###Chapter 1

Evelyn Sullivan was browsing through a department store for her third wedding anniversary gift when her phone vibrated.

A series of photos from Isabella Jackson flashed across the screen, each one stabbing into her heart like a knife.

In the pictures, Ethan Sullivan had his arm around Isabella's waist, whispering into her ear. Another showed him leaning down to kiss her forehead, his gaze tender enough to melt.

"Recognize this place, sis? It's your marital home."

Evelyn's fingers trembled uncontrollably. She knew this villa all too well—the one Ethan had never taken her back to after their wedding night.

"Ethan said this was originally meant for me," Isabella sent another message. "If it weren't for Grandma Sullivan meddling, you wouldn't even have set foot here."

The screen blurred. Only then did Evelyn realize her tears had fallen onto it.

"By the way, has Ethan been home much these past two months?" Isabella continued relentlessly. "He spends every day here with me."

Evelyn bit her lip until she tasted blood.

Her reply shook as she typed: "Isabella, don't push it."

"Push it?" Isabella shot back instantly. "When Ethan called you a dead fish in bed, did you think you were pushing it?"

Evelyn slammed her phone shut, her vision darkening at the edges.

It was past midnight when she finally heard the biometric lock disengage.

Ethan walked in, his brows furrowing the moment he saw her sitting by the entrance.

"What are you doing here?"

Evelyn lifted her head slowly. Even after three years, his face still made her heart race—but his eyes remained as cold as ever.

"Isabella's back?" Her voice was hoarse.

Ethan stiffened before replying indifferently, "Her affairs don't concern you."

"Don't concern me?" Evelyn let out a hollow laugh. "She's sleeping in our marital bed, and that doesn't concern me?"

"Evelyn!" His expression darkened. "Watch your tone. Isabella is just staying there temporarily. She's not that kind of person."

"What kind? The kind who sends provocative photos to the wife?" She stood, meeting his gaze directly.

His eyes turned glacial. "You're slandering her again."

Those words shattered her last shred of hope. He didn't even ask for the truth—just assumed she was lying.

"Let's get divorced," she whispered.

Ethan's pupils constricted. "Have you lost your mind?"

"I mean it." She wiped her tears. "I don't want a cent of your money."

"Enough!" he snapped. "We'll talk when you've calmed down."

As the door slammed behind him, Evelyn found it almost laughable. In his eyes, she didn't even have the right to be angry.

The next morning, a lawyer delivered the divorce papers.

"Mrs. Sullivan, are you certain about waiving asset division?" The lawyer hesitated.

Evelyn shook her head and signed without hesitation. When she removed her wedding ring, she noticed the faint tan line on her finger.

Packing took less than an hour. The villa held pitifully few belongings that were truly hers.

A red Lamborghini pulled up right on time. Sophia Reynolds lowered her sunglasses. "You're sure about this?"

Evelyn shoved her suitcase into the trunk. "Drive."

In the rearview mirror, the villa that had housed her three-year marriage grew smaller and smaller, vanishing around the corner.

###Chapter 2

Evelyn Sullivan tapped her fingers against the car window, her expression cool. "Since I reached out to you, it means I've already made up my mind."

Sophia Reynolds pressed down on the accelerator, a cold smirk curling her lips. "About time you dumped that scumbag Ethan Sullivan! After everything you've done for him, he still clings to Isabella Jackson. Who needs men? Isn't building an empire better?"

As her rant grew more heated, the car sped faster. Evelyn let out a soft laugh.

"Slow down. I just got out of a marriage—I don’t need to lose my life too."

Seeing she could still joke, Sophia relaxed slightly. "So, what’s the plan now?"

Truth be told, even if Evelyn hadn’t contacted her, Sophia would’ve tracked her down.

"I need some time to clear my head." Evelyn gazed out the window. "How’s the company?"

Three years ago, she’d handed over MY Fashion Group, the brand she built from scratch, to the board and devoted herself entirely to Ethan’s rehabilitation. She hadn’t even checked her bank balance since, but based on the growth plan she’d left, things should’ve been fine.

Sophia’s expression turned complicated. "Let’s talk about that after you’ve rested..."

Evelyn arched a brow. Clearly, things weren’t great. But she had no energy to deal with it now. "Take me to the airport."

"Where are you going?"

"Wherever the wind takes me."

Her tired reflection flickered in the window, fingers absently tracing circles on the leather seat. Sophia sighed inwardly. Even the sharpest minds turned foolish when love was involved.

At the arrivals terminal, Evelyn grabbed her carry-on and stepped out. "Have my luggage sent to Elm Cove."

"When will you be back?"

"See you in a month."

Watching her walk away with a casual wave, Sophia suddenly felt like the formidable CEO of MY was back.

Seattle, Sullivan Group’s regional office.

Ethan Sullivan was mid-meeting when his phone buzzed. Frowning at the caller ID, he signaled for a pause.

"Mom. What is it?"

Margaret Sullivan’s shrill voice pierced through. "I’ve gone to the villa three days in a row and Evelyn’s nowhere to be found! Is she avoiding me?"

Only then did Ethan realize—he hadn’t heard from his wife in a month. Even after their worst fights, she’d never gone radio silent this long.

"I’ll reach out. Did you need something from her?"

"Grandma’s birthday is coming up. I wanted her help picking a gift! I always said we should’ve let Isabella—"

"Got it." Ethan cut her off coldly. "I’ll handle it."

Five consecutive calls went straight to voicemail. His expression darkened as he turned to his assistant. "Try yours."

Colin Keller dialed, then reported nervously, "No answer, Mr. Sullivan..."

Ice formed in Ethan’s eyes. "Contact the villa’s property management."

An hour later, Colin approached under the heavy atmosphere. "The management said Ms. Sullivan moved out the day after your business trip."

The title "Ms. Sullivan" inexplicably grated on Ethan. He loosened his tie. "Find her. Book the earliest flight back."

"But Ms. Isabella Jackson—"

###Chapter 3

Ethan Sullivan tapped his long fingers twice on the desk, his gaze darkening. "Call her."

Colin Keller immediately understood—the "her" referred to Isabella Jackson. Since their business trip to Seattle began, Isabella had followed under the guise of vacation. Everyone in the branch office knew the second daughter of the Jackson family was chasing after Mr. Sullivan.

"I'll arrange it right away."

Three hours later, at the airport VIP passage.

Ethan shielded Isabella from the bustling crowd, his protective stance unmistakable. Colin trailed behind, silently comparing this scene to past business trips with Evelyn Sullivan—back then, Evelyn had handled everything while Ethan barely spared her a glance.

Now, it almost seemed like Isabella was the real Mrs. Sullivan.

...

At the other end of the airport, Evelyn pushed a luggage cart with effortless grace.

Her oversized sunglasses hid half her face but couldn't conceal the radiant smile on her lips. The V-neck slip dress hugged her curves, drawing admiring glances from passersby.

"Evelyn!" Sophia Reynolds waved enthusiastically from the arrivals gate.

Just as Evelyn quickened her pace, Sophia's expression froze. Following her friend's gaze, Evelyn turned and saw Ethan walking side by side with Isabella.

Her grip on the luggage handle turned white-knuckled.

"Let's go." Evelyn turned away, her voice eerily calm.

Sophia stole a glance at her expression before hastily taking the luggage. "You bought so much—your arms must be tired."

"Just gifts for everyone."

Laughing, they walked away, oblivious to the sharp gaze suddenly fixed on Evelyn's back.

Ethan stared at the retreating figure in the slip dress, his brow furrowed. The resemblance was uncanny... but Evelyn would never wear something so bold.

"Ethan?" Isabella tugged gently at his sleeve.

He pulled his eyes away. "It's nothing." Turning to Colin, his voice turned icy. "Still no leads?"

Colin's back prickled with sweat. "You'll have confirmation by today."

"Take Isabella home." With that, Ethan strode toward the parking lot.

The villa was pitch black.

Ethan pushed open the door, greeted by the stale scent of dust. Flipping on the lights, his eyes landed on the divorce agreement gathering dust on the coffee table.

A ring rested atop the signature line.

On the final page, Evelyn's signature was etched with deliberate force.

Veins bulged on Ethan's hand as he crumpled the papers. Just then, Colin's call came through.

"Mr. Sullivan, we've located Ms. Sullivan..."

"Speak."

"At Daniel Sterling's villa—the newly crowned Best Actor."

The sound of shattering glass pierced through the line.

###Chapter 4

Night deepened as Evelyn Sullivan pushed open the villa door, dragging her suitcase behind her.

The living room was filled with the rich aroma of coffee. Daniel Sterling stood at the open kitchen island, grinding coffee beans. Hearing the sound, he turned, a flicker of surprise in his eyes.

"Evelyn?"

She paused, then smiled. "Long time no see."

Daniel set down the grinder and strode toward her. He wore a simple white shirt with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows, revealing toned forearms.

"I just got a gig in Rongcheng. Thought this place would be close to the set..." He hesitated. "Didn't expect you to show up."

Evelyn leaned her suitcase against the wall. "It's fine. Stay as long as you need."

She remembered giving him the keys when he was just a rookie actor. Now he was an A-list star, yet still humble.

"Want some coffee?" He gestured to the steaming pot. "Freshly brewed."

"After I shower." She grabbed her suitcase and headed upstairs.

Daniel quickly took it from her. "Let me."

His fingers brushed against the back of her hand, warm to the touch. She didn’t notice his ears turning pink.

The master bedroom at the end of the hall remained unchanged. Daniel set the suitcase down gently, his gaze lingering on the dried-up perfume bottle on the vanity.

"Thanks." Evelyn opened the closet to find a few men's shirts neatly hung inside.

Daniel hurried to explain, "I leave some clothes here when I stay over. I’ll pack them tomorrow."

"No rush." She pulled out a set of pajamas. "I might be here a while."

His eyes flickered, but he simply nodded. "Okay."

As he descended the stairs, the sound of running water came from the bathroom.

The coffee maker beeped. Just as Daniel poured two cups, the doorbell rang.

Through the peephole, he saw a cold, handsome face—Ethan Sullivan.

The moment the door opened, their eyes locked in a silent battle.

"Where’s Evelyn?" Ethan’s voice was colder than the night.

Daniel blocked the doorway. "She’s resting."

Ethan narrowed his eyes, scanning the other man’s loungewear and the two coffee cups on the table.

"Move."

"Mr. Sullivan," Daniel stood firm, "breaking into someone’s home isn’t appropriate."

Ethan smirked and pulled a marriage certificate from his suit pocket, slamming it onto the entryway table.

"Read it carefully. This is my house."

###Chapter 5

Daniel Sterling's fingers tightened abruptly, his knuckles turning white. His pupils contracted violently as he stood frozen in the doorway.

"Daniel, why are you—"

Evelyn Sullivan's voice cut off. Her hand paused mid-motion, towel still pressed to her damp hair. Her gaze traveled over Daniel's shoulder, locking onto Ethan Sullivan's dark, stormy eyes.

"What are you doing here?" Her voice was ice-cold.

Ethan's lips curled into a mocking smile. "Seems I interrupted something?"

The towel twisted in Evelyn's grip, but her expression remained calm. "You received the divorce papers. When are we going to the courthouse?"

"Evelyn!" Ethan stepped forward abruptly. "I didn't sign them. You're coming home with me."

He reached for her, but Daniel moved between them in a flash.

Ethan's gaze turned dangerous. "Looking to get blacklisted?"

Daniel didn't flinch. "Good luck trying, Mr. Sullivan." He glanced at Evelyn. "She doesn't want to go with you."

Ethan pulled out his phone, finger hovering over the call button.

"Ethan." Evelyn spoke suddenly. "Let's talk."

The screen dimmed, but Ethan's fury burned hotter. "Already protecting him? You found yourself quite the distraction while I was gone this past month."

Ignoring him, Evelyn turned to Daniel. "Go. I'll handle this."

Daniel hesitated, then nodded. "Call me if you need anything."

The moment the door closed, Ethan grabbed Evelyn's wrist and dragged her outside.

"Let go!" She struggled, her heels stumbling on the steps.

Silent, Ethan shoved her roughly into the passenger seat of his Maybach. The engine roared as the car sped up the winding mountain road.

"Stop the car!" Evelyn pounded on the window. "Ethan, have you lost your mind?"

"Seatbelt." His grip on the steering wheel turned white-knuckled as the speedometer needle climbed.

Evelyn laughed coldly. "I meant what I said about the divorce."

A screech of brakes. Evelyn's forehead slammed into the dashboard. Darkness swam in her vision.

"Divorce?" Ethan's voice was lethal. "So you can run off with that actor? Dream on."

She pressed a hand to her throbbing temple. "You're in love with Isabella. I'm stepping aside. What more do you want?"

"What does she have to do with this?"

"Don't play dumb." Evelyn's lips curled in derision. "Shall I remind you who really holds your heart?"

The car filled with suffocating silence.

Ethan's phone buzzed. The name "Isabella Jackson" flashed on the screen.

"Ethan..." A tearful voice came through the speaker. "The power's out... I'm scared..."

His brow furrowed. "I'm on my way."

Hanging up, he met Evelyn's mocking stare. "The villa lost power. Isabella's afraid of the dark."

"Go." Evelyn pushed the door open. "Your signature on those papers is just a formality. I don't love you anymore. This marriage is over."

The night wind tangled in her hair as she walked away. Ethan watched her retreating figure, then slammed his fist into the steering wheel.

###Chapter 6

The black Maybach's door slammed shut. Evelyn Sullivan walked away without looking back.

In the rearview mirror, her slender figure grew smaller. Ethan Sullivan's knuckles turned white gripping the steering wheel.

He yanked his tie loose in frustration. The engine roared as he floored the accelerator.

His phone rang sharply over the noise.

"Ethan, my stomach hurts..." Isabella Jackson's weak voice trembled through the line.

"I'm on my way."

After hanging up, his expression darkened. He couldn't understand why his once-docile wife had suddenly become so resolute.

Mountain winds tangled Evelyn's hair as her phone lit up.

"Where are you?" Daniel Sterling's voice held urgency.

"Mid-slope." She kicked a pebble. "He's gone."

An engine revved through the phone. "Stay put!"

Five minutes later, headlights split the darkness.

Daniel sprinted to her side. Only after confirming she was unharmed did he exhale and open the passenger door.

"Since when are Best Actor winners this attentive?" Evelyn smirked.

"Care to upgrade me to boyfriend status?" His tone was playful.

"Top-tier candidate." She blinked. "Too bad we're both heartbreak veterans."

Daniel watched her self-deprecating smile in the mirror, his throat tightening.

In the villa, cold coffee mirrored two exhausted faces.

"Goodnight."

"See you tomorrow."

Dawn filtered through sheer curtains as Sophia Reynolds paced the living room clutching files.

"President Reynolds, one more day off?"

"Dream on!" A thick stack of documents thudded against Evelyn's chest. "We're cleaning house today!"

As pages rustled, Sophia suddenly leaned in. "Did the Best Actor stay over last night?"

"Your high school English teacher would weep—"

"Don't change the subject!" Sophia's eyes sparkled. "Mrs. Sullivan having an affair with a superstar? Scandalous!"

Evelyn shut the file. "First, we're just friends. Second—"

A shrill ringtone cut her off.

"Evelyn Sullivan!" Ethan's roar vibrated the phone.

She powered it off and tossed it to Sophia. "Get me a new number."

"I'm not your secretary!"

"Then let the company go bankrupt."

"Fine! I surrender!"

At MY's conference room, shareholders filed out grim-faced.

Sophia gave a thumbs-up. "Boss moves."

"The list." Evelyn tapped the desk. "Layoffs start tomorrow."

"Isn't that too rushed?"

"Send complainants directly to me."

Before the floor-to-ceiling windows, Evelyn surveyed the city lights. Three years away had left MY Fashion Group riddled with flaws.

News spread like wildfire through business circles.

On the top floor of Sullivan Holdings, Colin Keller cautiously presented documents. "MY's founder has returned."

"Raise the bid by 100 million." Ethan glared at his dark phone screen.

"But that founder is—"

"Proceed with acquisition." A pen snapped in his grip. "Surveillance on Daniel Sterling's villa. Now."

Colin hesitated before returning with a blue velvet box. "Angel's Tears has arrived."

The diamond shimmered with icy blue light—mirroring someone's defiant gaze.

Ethan stood abruptly, sending papers flying.

His phone rang again.

###Chapter 7

Ethan Sullivan's gaze fell on his phone screen, his anticipation instantly turning to disappointment.

The caller ID showed Isabella Jackson.

"Ethan, Grandpa's birthday is coming up," Isabella's sweet voice came through the phone. "Mom and Dad asked me to deliver the invitation. I'm passing by Sullivan Corporation—want to grab lunch?"

"Mhm."

After hanging up, Ethan tossed a file onto his desk in frustration.

Evelyn Sullivan had actually managed to resist contacting him this time.

A knock sounded at the door.

Colin Keller hurriedly entered. "Mr. Sullivan, the Eastside Project auction has been moved up!"

"Assemble the project team immediately."

By the time Isabella arrived, Ethan was still in a meeting.

"Miss Jackson, Mr. Sullivan asked me to escort you to his office," Colin said respectfully.

Entering the office, Isabella's eyes were drawn to a red velvet box on the desk.

This must be her birthday gift.

Unable to resist, she opened it—inside lay the necklace from the Seattle auction.

A sweet smile curved her lips.

An hour later, Ethan walked in.

"Apologies. Unexpected meeting."

"It's fine," Isabella replied gently. "I've already ordered lunch."

She gestured to the invitation on the desk. "Grandpa's birthday is next Saturday. Can you make it?"

"I have a business trip. I'll try to be back."

Isabella hesitated. "About Evelyn... Her line is always busy when I call."

At the mention of Evelyn, Ethan's gaze turned icy.

"Her relationship with the family is strained. I was hoping Grandpa's birthday could help mend things," Isabella said carefully.

"I'll let her know."

......

Evelyn had just closed her laptop when William Jackson's call came through.

"Grandpa's birthday is next Saturday. You will attend!"

"I'm swamped with work. Might not have time."

"What job is more important than your grandfather's birthday?!" William snapped. "Bring Ethan with you!"

Evelyn fell silent for a moment.

The divorce needed to be addressed in person.

"Understood."

After hanging up, Victoria Farley frowned. "Why even invite her?"

"She's still Mrs. Sullivan."

Victoria scoffed. "If Isabella hadn't gone abroad, Evelyn would never have gotten the chance. They should divorce so Isabella can marry him!"

William's expression darkened.

In three years, Evelyn had never secured any benefits for the Jackson family.

"Don't act rashly," he warned. "Until I say so, keep your mouth shut!"

Victoria turned away in disgust. "Isabella is the only daughter I acknowledge! Don't forget what that feng shui master said—"

"Enough!" William cut her off sharply. "Bring that up again, and there will be consequences!"

Victoria paled, her hatred for Evelyn deepening.

That evening, as Evelyn was about to leave work, Sophia Reynolds burst into her office.

"Free tonight?"
 the necklace? This is just the beginning."

###Chapter 8

Evelyn Sullivan glanced at Sophia Reynolds. "Let's go home."

"Home is boring!" Sophia grabbed her arm. "To celebrate your return to MY Fashion Group and your upcoming freedom from that miserable marriage, I booked us a VIP booth at Mirage Club. Heard they just got a fresh batch of male models—all top-tier!"

Evelyn arched a brow. "You just want to see them yourself, don’t you?"

Sophia leaned in, whispering shamelessly, "Darling, you’ve only had eyes for Ethan Sullivan all these years. You haven’t lived. Tonight, I’ll show you what you’ve been missing. Guaranteed to make you forget that scumbag."

"Not interested."

As Evelyn turned to leave, Sophia yanked her back. "Do it for me! Or are you still playing the loyal wife for that heartless man?"

Evelyn sighed. "One time only."

Sophia beamed and dragged her toward the door. "Let’s go! Dinner first!"

Night fell as they stepped into Mirage Club. Deafening music pulsed through the air. The dance floor throbbed with bodies moving under kaleidoscopic lights.

Upstairs in a glass-walled VIP booth, two male models waited.

"Well?" Sophia winked. "The one on the left is yours. I’ll take the right."

Evelyn gave the handsome young man a cursory glance. "You can have both."

"No way!" Sophia signaled the model. "Go keep Ms. Sullivan company."

The model named Jay settled beside Evelyn, admiration flashing in his eyes. "Would you like me to sing or dance for you?"

"Just sit there."

Across the table, Sophia was already feeding grapes to her model. Evelyn looked away, her ears tingeing pink.

Meanwhile, Lucas Laurier froze mid-step as he passed the booth. A smirk curled his lips after a confirming glance.

Pushing into the neighboring booth, he was greeted by Alexander King’s teasing voice. "Late as usual, Lucas. You’re buying tonight!"

Ethan Sullivan sat alone in the corner, radiating icy detachment.

Lucas shot him a meaningful look. "Guess who I just saw? Your little wife playing with male models next door."

A glass slammed onto the table.

Ethan stood, his expression thunderous, and strode out without a word.

Lucas raised a brow. "Thought he was into Isabella Jackson. Why the overreaction?"

Alexander shrugged. "Male pride." He pulled his date closer and snapped a selfie, promptly posting it online.

Ryan Paisley drained his glass in one gulp.

Back in the glass booth, Sophia was egging Evelyn on. "Pay up!" She shoved a grape into Evelyn’s hand.

Evelyn lifted it reluctantly—

The door burst open.

"Evelyn. Sullivan."

Ethan stood framed in the doorway, his eyes dark with fury.

###Chapter 9

The private booth door slammed open.

Evelyn Sullivan was mid-toast with Sophia Reynolds, her glass raised.

Ethan Sullivan stood in the doorway, radiating icy fury. His gaze locked onto Evelyn, eyes burning with rage.

Her fingers stilled around the stem of her glass.

She hadn’t expected to see him here.

Without sparing him a glance, she took a slow sip of wine.

"Evelyn Sullivan!"

He strode forward, seized her wrist, and yanked her toward the exit.

"What do you think you're doing?" Sophia stepped in front of them, her expression cold.

"Move." His voice was glacial.

Sophia didn’t budge. "She’s my friend. If you’re taking her, you’d better explain yourself."

Evelyn gave Sophia’s hand a reassuring pat. "It’s fine. I’ll be back soon."

He dragged her down the hallway, his grip brutal. By the time they reached the end, her wrist was already red.

"Do you remember you’re a married woman?" Ethan bit out. "First Daniel Sterling yesterday, and now male models at a bar?"

She rubbed her sore wrist. "If you don’t sign the divorce papers, things will get even more interesting."

"You wouldn’t dare."

"Try me." Her lips curved into a mocking smile. "Planning to threaten me with the Jacksons? Don’t forget—your precious Isabella is one of them."

His face darkened.

A realization struck him—he had no leverage over her.

The thought sent an unfamiliar pang through his chest.

"There’s nothing between Isabella and me," he said tightly.

"Not my concern." Her voice was indifferent. "All I care about is when you’ll sign the divorce papers."

His chest heaved.

In one swift motion, he gripped her chin and crushed his lips against hers.

Slap!

The sharp crack of her palm against his cheek echoed in the hallway.

She wiped her mouth with the back of her hand, disgust twisting her features.

"Evelyn!" A vein pulsed at his temple.

"If a dog bites you, wouldn’t you want to wash it off?" she said coldly.

This wasn’t the Evelyn he knew.

She was sharp, ruthless—a stranger.

"I have work tomorrow. No time for your tantrums." She checked her watch.

"You got a job?" His eyes narrowed.

"None of your business."

"We’re married."

"Not for long."

His fingers tightened around her wrist. "I’m losing patience."

"Then divorce me."

"Never."

"Then suffer."

A calm voice interrupted their standoff.

"Ethan? Evelyn?"

Ryan Paisley stood a few feet away, watching them with concern.

Evelyn’s icy demeanor softened slightly. She nodded at him. "Enjoy your night. I’m leaving."

This time, Ethan didn’t stop her.

"Trouble in paradise?" Ryan offered him a cigarette.

Ethan ignored it. "I’m heading out."

As Ethan walked away, Ryan’s gaze lingered thoughtfully on Evelyn’s retreating figure.

Outside, Evelyn waited by the curb for a cab.

A Maybach pulled up silently beside her.

She slid into the backseat—only to find Ethan already there.

"Ethan!"

She grabbed for the door, but the locks clicked into place.

"Grand View," he ordered the driver.

"Let me out!"

"I’ve been drinking," he said coldly. "You’re taking care of me tonight."

She scoffed. "Go find Isabella."

"You’re my wife."

"Not for long." She repeated the words like a mantra.

His knuckles whitened as his fists clenched.

The air in the car thickened, charged with the tension between them.

###Chapter 10

Evelyn Sullivan lifted her gaze indifferently, a cold smirk playing on her lips.

"She's done everything for you—things a wife should and shouldn't do. The only thing missing is a marriage certificate."

Ethan Sullivan's piercing eyes bore into her, searching for any crack in her composure. But her expression remained detached, as if he were nothing more than a stranger.

A sharp pain stabbed through his chest.

He turned away, his voice icy. "Until the divorce papers are signed, you're still Mrs. Sullivan."

Evelyn pulled out her phone impatiently, her fingers flying across the screen. She unblocked Isabella Jackson and sent a message before powering off the device.

——

At the Jackson family villa, Isabella had just changed into her nightgown when her phone buzzed. Her face drained of color as she read the message.

"That bitch!"

She grabbed a coat and rushed downstairs, nearly colliding with her parents in the foyer.

"Where are you going at this hour?" Victoria Farley frowned.

Isabella forced a smile. "Ethan had too much to drink. I need to check on him."

A gleam flashed in Victoria's eyes as she turned to the driver. "Take her there."

Once Isabella left, Victoria smirked at her husband. "Seems Ethan still prefers our Isabella."

William Jackson adjusted his cuffs absently. "Tell her to seize the opportunity. Hardly anyone knows about his marriage anyway—it won't affect future alliances."

——

When the black car pulled up to the villa, Ethan immediately sensed something amiss.

"You came back?"

Evelyn leaned against the car door, her smile mocking. "Why don't you go inside and see for yourself?"

The keypad beeped. The moment the door swung open, Ethan's pupils constricted.

"Evelyn!"

The aroma of hangover soup wafted from the kitchen. Isabella turned around, her face softening into a gentle smile.

Ethan grabbed Evelyn's wrist. "What the hell is this?"

She shook him off, her tone dripping with sarcasm. "You wanted someone to take care of you. I invited your beloved. Not satisfied, Mr. Sullivan?"

She turned on her heel and walked away, her black trench coat flapping in the night wind.

"Stop!"

Isabella suddenly clung to Ethan's arm. "Ethan, drink the soup first..."

He shoved her away. "Who told you to come here?"

"It was... my sister. She said you were drunk..." Isabella timidly handed him her phone.

Ethan's face darkened as he read the messages.

"Uncle West, take Miss Jackson home."

"Ethan!"

"Don't make me repeat myself."

The door slammed shut. Ethan stared at the divorce papers on the coffee table before suddenly tearing them to shreds with a cold laugh.

She wanted a divorce? Over his dead body.

——

The next morning, Tyler Laurier kicked open the CEO's office door.

"Are you trying to ruin me?" He pointed at the layoff list on the desk, his hand trembling.

Evelyn closed the folder leisurely. "No need to panic, Mr. Laurier. HR is already hiring replacements."

"What about the ongoing projects?!"

"Perfect timing," Evelyn said with a sudden smile. "I'd like to ask you something. What exactly do all these relatives of yours contribute to MY Fashion Group?"

Her fingers tapped the desk rhythmically, each tap like a hammer to Tyler's heart.

Sweat trickled down his forehead.

###Chapter 11

Tyler Laurier's forehead glistened with sweat. He had spent years stuffing the company with relatives while remaining clueless about actual operations.

Evelyn Sullivan's gaze pierced through him like a blade, leaving no room for evasion.

"Mr. Laurier, is the question too difficult?"

His face flushed crimson. Every possible answer would be a slap to his own face.

"Why must you humiliate me?" He bristled with wounded pride. "Everyone knows management isn't my strength!"

Evelyn tapped the desk with slender fingers. "If you're aware of your incompetence, what right do you have to challenge my decisions?"

Tyler stormed out, nearly colliding with Sophia Reynolds carrying documents.

"Did someone light a fuse under him?" Sophia entered to find Evelyn reviewing files.

"Just terminated a few of his relatives." Evelyn didn't look up. "What is it?"

Sophia handed over a contract. "Documents requiring your signature."

After scanning quickly, Evelyn signed. "Have HR assign me two secretaries—one male, one female."

"Understood." Sophia hesitated. "About the company's funding gap..."

"How much?"

"At least fifty million."

Evelyn closed the folder. "Noted."

After Sophia left, she checked her personal account. The balance showed just over fifty million.

When the CFO arrived, Evelyn had already written the check. "Consider this a personal loan. Deduct it from my year-end dividends."

Tyler shattered a teacup in his office, still seething. He dialed Simon Reynolds.

"Mr. Reynolds, care for lunch?"

In the private dining room, Tyler poured tea obsequiously.

"You heard about this morning?" Tyler probed.

Simon sipped leisurely. "Standard corporate restructuring."

"But whose allies will she target next..." Tyler insinuated. "I heard your deal with Tiansheng stalled?"

Simon's eyes flickered.

"Perhaps let Ms. Sullivan handle it?" Tyler lowered his voice. "Since she's so... capable."

Night fell. Evelyn barely reached her doorstep when Ethan Sullivan blocked her path.

"Had enough?" His expression darkened. "Living with another man—have you no shame?"

Evelyn smirked. "Did you consider propriety when entertaining Isabella in our marital home?"

"Nothing happened!"

"After divorce, you're free to do as you please."

Ethan clenched his fists. "I tore up the divorce papers."

"Then we'll draft new ones." Evelyn arched a brow. "Unless... you've fallen for me?"

"Delusional!" His gaze turned glacial. "Want a divorce? Pay fifty million for my wasted youth."

Evelyn froze. "You're serious?"

"No using money I gave you." His lips curled coldly. "Fail within a week, and the divorce is off."

"Deal." She turned to leave.

"Wait." Ethan grabbed her arm. "Until then, you're moving back."

Evelyn shook him off. "Don't push your luck, Ethan."

###Chapter 12

Ethan Sullivan's lips curled into a cold smirk. "You think this is too much? The worst is yet to come."

Evelyn Sullivan clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms. "Over my dead body."

"Either come back to the villa with me, or I move in with you. Choose."

Evelyn took a deep breath and turned toward the black Maybach.

"Where are your things?" Ethan called after her.

"One week. I don’t need anything." She yanked the car door open without looking back.

The suffocating silence inside the car was broken only by the sharp rustling of papers in Ethan’s hands.

Evelyn’s gaze flickered to the documents. Her pupils constricted. "You’re acquiring MY?"

Ethan glanced up, surprise flickering in his eyes. "Since when are you interested in corporate takeovers?"

"About as interested as you are in me." Her lips twisted in a mocking smile.

Remembering her mention of work the night before, Ethan narrowed his eyes. "You work at MY?"

"Which is why I suggest you drop this idea now."

"Every company has a price."

"Then we’ll see." Evelyn’s laugh was icy. She wouldn’t let anyone touch MY.

Something about her reaction unsettled him. "What’s your position at MY?"

"Janitor."

Ethan frowned. "Their HR department needs an overhaul."

"Just because you can’t do something doesn’t mean others can’t."

"If I’m a dog, then what does that make you?" He leaned in suddenly, his breath hot against her ear.

Evelyn jerked away, the tips of her ears burning.

Watching her flustered profile, Ethan found it inexplicably endearing. "Grandfather’s birthday is next Saturday. We’re going together."

"Perfect timing to announce the divorce." Her voice was flat.

Ethan’s gaze turned glacial. "Are you going to celebrate or give him a heart attack?"

"Why pretend? He’ll find out eventually."

"Save the grand declarations until you have the five million ready." His scoff made it clear he didn’t believe she could produce the sum.

Evelyn closed her eyes and said nothing more.

At the villa gates, she punched in the code—only for the system to reject it.

"I changed it." Ethan stood behind her. "Your birthday."

She laughed coldly. "Sure it’s not Isabella’s?"

Slamming in the numbers, she strode inside without a backward glance.

Ethan watched her go, fury churning in his chest. He’d thought of no one but her when resetting that code.

In the living room, the shredded divorce agreement in the trash bin was impossible to miss. Evelyn ignored it and sat down.

"What do you want for dinner?" Ethan took the seat across from her.

"Takeout." She didn’t look up from her phone.

"Junk food."

"I’m not asking you to eat it."

"I mean, you’re not eating it either."

Evelyn’s head snapped up. "Should I just drink air, then?"

"Cook."

"Busy." She kept tapping her screen. "Make your own damn food."

To her shock, Ethan actually walked into the kitchen.

After ordering fried chicken, Evelyn went upstairs to shower. When she returned, her takeout was in the trash.

"Ethan Sullivan!" She stormed into the kitchen just as he emerged with a bowl of soup.

The scalding liquid nearly splashed onto her before Ethan shoved her aside. The broth splattered across his forearm, instantly raising angry blisters.

Evelyn scrambled for the first-aid kit.

"I’m sorry, but if you hadn’t thrown out my food—"

"I just wanted to have a meal with you." His interruption was quiet.

"Don’t bother." She bandaged the wound with clinical detachment. "We’re divorcing in a week. Distance is best for both of us."

"Is there no other way?" His gaze burned into hers.

"No."

"We could—"

"Enough!" Evelyn stood. "Five million in seven days. I expect you to keep your word."

She turned toward the stairs, missing the storm that darkened his expression.

Late that night, Evelyn logged into a website she hadn’t touched in three years. A golden full moon emblem flashed: Welcome back.

She scrolled through mission listings. Only here could she secure five million in a week.

A message popped up.

Vulture: Back from the dead?

Iris: ...

Vulture: Three years gone, and you pick a five-million job first. Partner up?

After reviewing the details, Evelyn accepted another three-million contract. The money was as good as hers.

At six the next morning, the doorbell’s shrill ring startled her awake.

Isabella Jackson stood on the threshold, shock written across her face.

"Evelyn? What are you doing here?"

###Chapter 13

Evelyn Sullivan stood at the top of the staircase, looking down at Isabella with eyes as cold as ice.

"My affairs are none of your business."

She turned to leave, but Isabella's shrill voice stopped her.

"Stop right there!"

Evelyn glanced back, a mocking smile curling her lips.

"I've never seen a homewrecker so shameless before. Quite the spectacle."

Isabella's face drained of color before flushing red with rage.

"Ethan loves me! Clinging to him won't change that. Just sign the divorce papers already!"

Better yet, disappear forever.

Evelyn arched a brow and laughed.

"Sure. Give me five million, and I'll sign right now."

"You—!" Isabella trembled with fury. "Hasn't Ethan given you enough? Don't be greedy!"

"If you won't even pay that much, your love for him must be shallow."

Isabella opened her mouth to retort but froze when she spotted movement on the stairs.

"Sister, it's not that I don't want to... but Ethan would be furious if he found out..."

"Who's going to tell him?"

Isabella faltered.

"Evelyn." Ethan's icy voice cut through the air as he descended. "So this is your game."

Evelyn met his gaze calmly.

"I'm giving her a chance to prove her devotion."

Isabella clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms.

"Ethan, maybe Sister is in trouble? I could—"

"Not your concern." He cut her off. "If she asks for money again, refuse."

Seeing her five million slip away, Evelyn shrugged and turned to leave.

Ethan grabbed her wrist.

His voice dropped to a whisper. "Try extorting Isabella again, and even if you get the money, I won't sign."

Downstairs, Isabella's eyes burned as she watched them.

Evelyn yanked her arm free.

"Noted. Stay away—I'm allergic to idiots."

Ethan's gaze darkened. "Evelyn, you're pushing your luck."

She strode into her bedroom and slammed the door without looking back.

Ethan stared at the closed door, his expression stormy.

"Ethan..."

Isabella's voice snapped him out of it.

"Why are you here so early?"

Hearing his irritation, she bit her lip. "I was worried about you... I didn't know she'd be here..."

"She's my wife."

Tears welled in Isabella's eyes. "But we love each other! Why stay in this loveless marriage?"

Ethan was silent for a moment. "The past is over. I won't divorce her."

"Because she nursed you for two years? Do you love her now?"

"I don't. But the divorce isn't happening."

"Why?!"

"During those two years, she was the only one there."

The thought of divorce inexplicably unsettled him.

Isabella wept pitifully. "And what about me? You hid your accident from me! By the time I returned, you were already married! Do you know how much that hurt?!"

"You can stay at the villa. I'm acquiring MY for you. But I can't give you my heart."

With that, he walked away without looking back.

Isabella watched him go, nails drawing blood from her palms.

She wouldn't give up.

When Evelyn came downstairs later, the villa was empty.

At the office, she summoned Sophia Reynolds.

"I'll be traveling for a few days. You're in charge."

Sophia hesitated.

"Something else?"

"Tyler Laurier threw a tantrum yesterday. Today's meeting might be..."

"Got it."

At ten sharp, the conference room fell silent as Evelyn finished delegating tasks.

Just as she was about to adjourn, Tyler spoke up.

"CEO Sullivan, we're stuck on a deal. Perhaps you should take over? Let us see your skills firsthand."

Evelyn smiled. "Of course. Send the files to my office."

Tyler blinked, caught off guard by her easy agreement.

Sophia rushed in after her, frantic.

"You know it's a trap! Why walk into it?"

###Chapter 14

Sophia Reynolds burst into the office, her voice trembling with urgency. "Evelyn, that sly fox Tyler Laurier set you up with a problematic client!"

Evelyn Sullivan continued reviewing documents without looking up, her pen gliding across the paper with precise strokes. "I know."

"You know and still agreed?" Sophia stomped her foot in frustration. "Vincent White is notorious for harassing female associates! How many women has he taken advantage of?"

Evelyn signed the last document and closed the folder before finally meeting Sophia's gaze. "Avoiding him today won't solve anything."

"But—"

"Relax." Evelyn stood, straightening her blazer. "I know what I'm doing."

Sophia opened her mouth to protest but stopped at Evelyn's sharp look. She bit her lip. "Fine. But call me if anything happens."

Tyler Laurier strode in, barely concealing his smug expression. "Here are the contract details, Evelyn." He deliberately slammed the folder onto her desk. "Good luck with the negotiations."

Evelyn didn’t spare him a glance. "You can leave now."

Tyler’s face darkened. With a scoff, he stormed out. Let’s see how this arrogant girl handles Vincent White.

That evening, Evelyn arrived alone at the upscale restaurant. The moment she opened the private dining room door, an overpowering wave of cologne hit her.

"Miss Sullivan!" Vincent White stood abruptly, his beady eyes gleaming with greed. He lunged forward to grab her hand. "I’ve heard so much about you!"

Evelyn sidestepped his advance and took the seat farthest from him.

Vincent’s smile faltered before he forced another grin. "No need to be so distant." He lowered his voice suggestively. "I hear you’re interested in the fabric supply for the Eastside Project?"

"Mr. White," Evelyn slid the contract toward him, "let’s focus on business first."

Vincent ignored the document and poured a glass of red wine instead. "No rush. Have a drink."

Evelyn studied the glass, then smirked. "Prefer red?" She stood. "I’ll ask the waiter to bring some Maotai."

"Stop!" Vincent slammed his palm on the table. "Don’t play games with me, Evelyn." His grin turned predatory. "Did you really think you’d walk out of here so easily?"

In the adjacent private room, Ethan Sullivan’s hand stilled. Through the ornate screen divider, he watched as two hulking bodyguards closed in on Evelyn.

"Ethan," Lucas Laurier frowned, "should we—"

Ethan raised a hand, his gaze locked on his wife’s slender figure. Let’s see what secrets she’s hiding.

Evelyn scanned the room, her lips curling into a cold smile. "Forceful negotiation tactics, Mr. White?"

"Enough talk!" Vincent barked. "Take her inside!"

The bodyguards reached for her—

Evelyn pivoted, her hand striking like a blade against the first man’s neck. He collapsed before he could react.

The second guard roared and charged. A sharp kick from Evelyn’s stiletto connected with his temple. He crumpled to the floor with a heavy thud.

Vincent gaped. Before he could move, Evelyn’s heel slammed into his chest, sending him crashing against the wall. He wheezed, blood trickling from his lips.

Evelyn stepped forward, pressing her shoe against his ribs. "Shall we discuss the contract now?"

Behind the screen, Lucas inhaled sharply. "That’s Evelyn?"

Ethan’s grip tightened around his glass, cracks spiderwebbing across the surface.

###Chapter 15

Vincent White's face turned deathly pale, beads of sweat forming on his forehead.

"Miss Sullivan... I was just running my mouth..." His voice trembled as he suddenly slapped himself hard across the face. "Please don't take it to heart..."

The sharp sound of the slap echoed through the hallway.

Evelyn Sullivan watched coldly, only withdrawing her foot when his cheek swelled red. She walked away without sparing him another glance.

Vincent glared at her retreating figure, his eyes burning with venom.

Ethan Sullivan stood at the stairwell landing, his gaze dark and unreadable.

He had never seen this side of Evelyn before—sharp, decisive, like an unsheathed blade.

"Ethan," Lucas Laurier approached, "that White kid holds grudges. Aren't you going to step in?"

"She didn't ask me." Ethan turned toward the private room, his tone indifferent, as if discussing a stranger.

Lucas raised an eyebrow. "She's still your wife."

"Not for long." Ethan paused mid-step. "She filed for divorce."

"What?" Lucas's eyes widened. "But she's not—"

The door to the private room swung open, revealing Alexander King. "You two planning to stand guard out here all night?"

After several rounds of drinks, Ethan's phone lit up briefly before going dark.

The screen displayed an alert from the villa's security system: Someone was unlocking the front gate.

He set down his glass, knocking over another in his haste to stand.

"In a hurry?" Lucas teased.

Ethan didn't respond, striding out of the room without another word.

At the villa entrance, Evelyn pushed open the door, a black backpack slung over her shoulder.

Moonlight outlined her slender frame, her ponytail swaying slightly with the movement.

"Where are you going?" Ethan's voice came from the shadows.

Evelyn's fingers twitched. Surprise flickered in her eyes as she turned.

"Business trip."

Ethan stepped closer, catching the faint scent of gunpowder on her. "At midnight?"

"Move." She glanced at her watch, her voice turning icy.

As they stood locked in tension, Ethan heard a soft beep.

Evelyn's lips parted. "Three."

His pupils constricted.

"Two."

A sharp sting pricked the back of his neck.

"One."

Darkness swallowed him whole.

When he woke again, sunlight flooded the living room. Rubbing his temples, Ethan sat up to find the villa empty.

"Colin," he rasped into the phone, "track Evelyn's whereabouts."

Deep in the rainforest, gunfire sent birds scattering into the sky.

"Cross the river and we're safe!" The team leader raised his arm—just as a bullet tore through his forehead.

Evelyn lay hidden in the canopy, the river's ripples reflecting in her sniper scope.

"Wrap it up." Vulture's voice crackled in her earpiece. "Scorpion is down."

As she moved to stand, every hair on her body stood on end.

She fired backward without looking, dropping the ambusher as his bullet grazed her cheek.

"Nice shot!" Vulture whistled.

Evelyn wiped away the blood and severed the comms without ceremony.

Three days later, in the Sullivan Group CEO office...

Colin Keller hesitantly handed over a file. "Sir, this is everything on Miss Sullivan..."

Ethan opened it, his gaze freezing on the first page—a photograph of Evelyn holding a rifle, a military base visible in the background.

###Chapter 16

Evelyn lowered her head, beads of sweat forming at her temples.

"Mr. Sullivan, after Ms. Sullivan left the villa, the cameras only caught her disappearing at the southern intersection..."

"Useless!"

Ethan slammed the file onto the desk. The pen clattered to the floor, ink splattering across the tiles.

At 3 AM, the lock of the Northville Villa clicked softly.

Evelyn staggered through the door, her vision blurring. She braced herself against the wall, but her legs gave out at the entryway—

A strong arm caught her.

"Who—"

She strained to see, but only recognized the familiar scent of sandalwood.

Before darkness swallowed her, a whisper brushed her ear: "Still so stubborn."

Sunlight stabbed at her eyes.

Evelyn bolted upright, pain lancing through her abdomen. The bandages wrapped around her waist were too precise for an amateur.

The aroma of chicken soup drifted from the kitchen.

She slid a dagger from under the pillow and crept toward the sound barefoot.

"Awake?"

Daniel turned with a steaming bowl—only to freeze as cold steel pressed against his throat.

"Explain." Her voice was sharper than the blade.

"Your script from last week." He raised a leather portfolio with his left hand. "Found you bleeding out by coincidence." Leaning closer, he added, "If I wanted you dead, I'd have finished the job last night."

The dagger clattered to the floor.

The doorbell shattered the silence.

Daniel checked the monitor and smirked. "Guess who?"

Ethan's fist grazed Daniel's cheek before smashing into the doorframe.

"Evelyn!"

At the dining table, she calmly stirred her soup. The bandages peeking from her pajama collar made Ethan's pupils contract.

"Trespassing, Mr. Sullivan?"

"You vanished for five days to shack up with him?" He overturned the bowl. Scalding broth splashed her hand. "Does the Sterling family know you're seducing a married man?"

Daniel seized his collar. "She almost died—"

"Daniel!" Evelyn snapped. "Leave."

Once the door closed, she opened the TV cabinet drawer.

"Five million." She slid a black card across the table. "Civil Affairs Bureau. Nine AM tomorrow."

Ethan laughed.

He picked up the card and tapped it against her cheek. "Payment for services rendered?" His fingers dug into her chin. "Everywhere he touched you—it's filthy."

"Then divorce me."

"Never." He loosened his tie with a savage smile. "You'll keep the Sullivan name while I destroy the Sterlings."

The slammed door shattered the hallway mirror.

Evelyn gripped the table as blood bloomed through her bandages, staining the soup crimson.

Tension choked the MY conference room.

"While you were playing hide-and-seek, White Group terminated our contract!" Tyler hurled documents onto the table. "This is your crisis management?"

Evelyn pressed the remote. The screen showed Vincent White escorting his secretary into a hotel.

"Since you're so eager, Tyler, why don't you offer yourself next time?" Her glacial gaze swept the room. "Anyone forcing female colleagues to entertain clients—" A pen impaled the oak table. "—ends up like this."

After the meeting, she detained Simon.

"You and Tyler seem close lately." She twisted her wedding ring. "Heard your niece lost three million in Macau again?"

Simon's smile froze.

That night, a tall silhouette waited at her gate.

Ethan flicked the black card between his fingers. "Daniel's card. Password's your birthday."

He snapped it in half.

"Pity." Evelyn stepped over the fragments. "Could've bought your freedom."

###Chapter 17

Evelyn's brows furrowed, a flicker of impatience flashing in her eyes.

"Ethan, what do you want? I admit it was my fault for marrying you without your consent. But for three years, I’ve done everything for you. Now I just want to leave. Is that too much to ask?"

Ethan's pupils constricted, his jaw tightening.

"I told you—divorce is not an option."

He took a step closer, his voice low and dangerous.

"I’ve already found out you weren’t with Daniel Sterling those days. Where did the five million come from? If you don’t want me to dig deeper, come home with me now."

Evelyn’s fingers clenched unconsciously, conflict flickering in her gaze.

Finally, she shook off his hand and got into the car.

The air inside the vehicle was suffocating.

Evelyn stared out the window at the blurring scenery, frustration churning inside her.

She didn’t understand why Ethan had suddenly changed his stance. He had never cared about their marriage before.

When they arrived at the villa, she headed straight upstairs.

"Your grandfather’s birthday is the day after tomorrow," Ethan’s voice came from behind her. "I prepared a pair of antique vases as a gift."

Evelyn paused but didn’t turn around.

"Do what you want."

"He’s your grandfather."

"So what?" She finally turned, a mocking smile curling her lips. "Blood ties mean nothing."

The Jackson family had never given her warmth. She had no interest in pleasing them.

"We’re attending the banquet together."

"Fine."

She tossed the word coldly over her shoulder and hurried upstairs.

The moment she entered her room, Sophia’s call came through.

"Evelyn, Ethan wants to see you."

She arched a brow. "About the MY acquisition?"

"Yes. Sullivan Group’s offer is tempting. The board is already swayed. If I hadn’t stalled—"

"Set up the meeting," Evelyn cut in. "I’ll face him sooner or later."

As soon as she hung up, a knock sounded at her door.

Ethan’s voice came through the wood. "Dinner’s ready. I have a business dinner, so eat without me."

She didn’t respond. Only when the sound of his car faded did she go downstairs.

The dining table was laden with her favorite dishes.

Evelyn froze for a second before forcing herself to eat calmly. She cleaned up afterward without a word.

Late into the night, the roar of an engine shattered the silence.

She looked up from her book to see Ethan stumbling out of the car, clearly drunk. After the driver left, he nearly fell several times.

Evelyn coldly drew the curtains.

But the noise from the master bedroom—thuds and crashes—made sleep impossible.

"Can you keep it down?" She slammed her fist against his door.

The noise stopped abruptly.

As she turned to leave, the door suddenly swung open.

A strong hand yanked her into the darkness.

"Ah!"

Ethan’s scorching body pinned her against the door, the heavy scent of alcohol enveloping her.

His lips crashed down on hers, searing and demanding, while his hands roamed her waist.

Evelyn struggled violently. "Let me go!"

With a sharp click, she turned on the light.

In the harsh glare, Ethan squinted. She saw the raw desire in his eyes—and something else she couldn’t decipher.

"I’ll find someone else for you," she said icily.

His grip tightened. "Evelyn, you’re my wife."

"Not for long."

He let out a cold laugh before suddenly biting down hard on her lip.

"Want a divorce?" His voice was glacial. "Fine. Spend tonight with me first."

Evelyn’s face went deathly pale.

###Chapter 18

Evelyn's nails dug deep into her palms as a cold smile curved her lips. "Aren't you worried Isabella will find out about our deal?"

Ethan's gaze turned icy, the air around him dropping to a chilling intensity. "That's none of your concern."

She took half a step back, spine rigid. "I refuse."

A mocking smirk tugged at his lips. "Seems divorce isn't that important to you after all."

"I'll make you sign willingly," she countered, a sharp glint flashing in her eyes. "I don't need underhanded tactics."

He slammed the documents onto the desk. "Get out!"

Only when the door shut heavily behind her did the weight of his stare finally vanish. Evelyn exhaled slowly, her fingertips still trembling faintly.

The Jackson residence blazed with light as servants bustled about preparing for the birthday banquet. Charles Jackson glanced at the entrance for the eighth time. "Is Ethan coming or not?"

"Don't worry, Dad," William soothed, pouring tea. "Isabella went to fetch him personally. It'll be fine."

Just then, Isabella entered arm-in-arm with Lily White. She wore a champagne-colored gown, a diamond hairpin glinting in her upswept curls.

"Happy birthday, Grandpa!" She kissed his cheek affectionately. "Ethan got held up at the office, but he'll be here soon."

As Charles frowned, Lily presented an ornate box. "Grandfather Jackson, my father asked me to deliver this gift."

Inside lay a pair of pristine jade paperweights. The old man's expression brightened instantly. "How thoughtful of you, my dear."

Seizing the distraction, Isabella pulled her friend onto the terrace.

"Are you sure you want to show me this now?" Her voice tightened as she stared at the phone screen.

The video showed Ethan pinning Evelyn against a wall, their bodies dangerously close. The timestamp read last Wednesday—the very night he'd claimed to be working late.

Lily hesitated. "There's actually something else..."

A commotion erupted from the ballroom. Isabella turned—and froze.

There, standing impeccably suited in the doorway with Evelyn in emerald velvet on his arm, was Ethan.

###Chapter 19

"Isabella, your twin sister has been making quite a few moves lately. You should be careful." Lily White slid her phone across the table, displaying a video of Ethan Sullivan walking out of a bar with Evelyn Sullivan in his arms.

Isabella's fingers trembled slightly, but her smile remained sweet. "Lily, what does this prove? Ethan has always been kind. Maybe Evelyn was in trouble."

"You're too naive!" Lily lowered her voice. "I saw her order three male models in a private booth. The scene was disgusting!"

Isabella clenched her skirt tightly, though her tone stayed soft. "Do you have proof?"

"The bar's surveillance must have caught it!" Lily's eyes suddenly lit up. "I have an idea..."

After hearing her friend's plan, Isabella bit her lip and shook her head. "That doesn't seem right."

"What's wrong with it?" Lily insisted. "Leave it to me."

Isabella lowered her gaze, hiding the cold glint in her eyes. "Fine... I'll trust you."

As she turned toward the fitting room, her nails dug deep into her palms. Evelyn, since you insist on clinging to what isn't yours, don't blame me for what comes next.

MY Fashion Group Headquarters

Sophia Reynolds tossed an embossed invitation onto the desk. "Charles Jackson's seventieth birthday. He specifically invited his 'beloved granddaughter.'"

Evelyn didn't look up. "Don't you have work to do?"

"I'm just curious," Sophia leaned in. "If the Jacksons knew you're Anna, the legendary fashion designer, wouldn't they regret everything?"

Three years ago, Sophia had witnessed Victoria Farley slapping Evelyn in public while doting on Isabella. Back then, she'd assumed Evelyn was just an unloved adopted daughter.

Until she walked into MY for an interview and saw Evelyn sitting in the CEO's chair.

"Boring." Evelyn closed the file.

Sophia blinked. "Want me to go with you? Revealing your identity in front of them would be priceless."

"No need. Ethan is coming with me."

"What?!" Sophia nearly knocked over her coffee. "I thought you were getting divorced!"

Evelyn's expression darkened. "Plans changed."

Her phone rang suddenly. Vanessa Cruz, JM's store manager, sounded frantic. "Boss, a new employee accidentally displayed the Serendipity collection. A customer is insisting on buying it—offering double the price."

###Chapter 20

Evelyn Sullivan tapped her fingers lightly on the phone screen, her brow slightly furrowed. "Serendipity isn't for sale. Didn't you explain that to the client?"

The gown was her labor of love, designed over three sleepless nights as a birthday surprise for Sophia Reynolds. She'd been too busy with projects to pick it up.

"I did, but the client is Lily White from the White family," Vanessa Cruz's voice carried hesitation through the phone. "She insists on buying it, even offered ten times the price. The Whites have considerable influence, and I'm worried—"

Evelyn's gaze turned icy. "Tell her she can choose any other gown in the store. It's on me."

"Understood."

Vanessa hung up and took a deep breath before approaching the VIP section. Lily sat on the sofa with one leg crossed over the other, her fingers drumming impatiently on the armrest.

"Miss White, my sincerest apologies," Vanessa offered a professional smile. "The owner confirmed Serendipity isn't available for purchase. As a gesture of goodwill, you may select any other gown free of charge."

A flicker of greed flashed in Lily's eyes as she scanned the display. The gowns, each worth millions, were tempting—but none compared to Serendipity.

"Is this how you run your business?" She suddenly slammed her hand on the table. "If it's displayed, it should be sold! Who would dare shop here otherwise?"

Vanessa's smile cooled. "It was indeed a staff oversight. Perhaps you'd like to browse our other designs?"

"I want this one!" Lily yanked the hanger holding Serendipity. "If you refuse to sell it today, I'll make sure every socialite in town blacklists JM Couture!"

The air froze.

Vanessa dropped all pretense of politeness, her voice sharp as ice. "Miss White, know your limits. JM doesn't respond to threats."

Isabella Jackson, who had been silent until now, tugged at Lily's arm. "Lily, JM's standing in this city—"

"It's just some shabby boutique!" Lily shook her off. "DI and CH are far superior!"

Isabella hesitated. She knew better than anyone who stood behind JM.

The dressing room curtain suddenly parted. Sophia peeked out. "What's going on? I heard arguing—"

Evelyn slipped her phone away, her expression neutral. "Nothing serious. A staff member misplaced a sample."

Sophia narrowed her eyes. "It's not my birthday gown, is it—"

"Don't overthink it." Evelyn chuckled, nudging her back inside. "Try on the starlight dress."

Once the curtain closed again, all warmth vanished from Evelyn's eyes. She dialed another number. "Look into the White family's recent projects."

Keyboard clicks sounded through the receiver. "White Enterprises is bidding on the Eastside development."

"Send a message to Sullivan Group." A faint smirk curved Evelyn's lips. "Tell them I want that land."

###Chapter 21

Evelyn Sullivan rubbed her temples, sighing. "The birthday dress I designed for you was accidentally displayed by the staff. Now someone wants to buy it."

Sophia Reynolds' eyes lit up as she leaned in. "What style is it? I have a gala tonight—have Vanessa send it over so I can try it!"

"Your birthday isn't for another two weeks. Why the rush?" Evelyn closed the file in front of her. "Get back to work."

Sophia pestered her for a while longer but eventually gave up.

By evening, Ethan Sullivan's call came through.

"I'm outside MY," his voice was icy.

Evelyn checked the time. "I still have ten minutes left."

"I'll wait."

At exactly five, she walked out of the building.

The familiar black Maybach sat idling by the curb. The moment she slid into the backseat, a chill settled over her.

Ethan didn’t look up from the documents in his hands. "Drive," he ordered the chauffeur.

The air in the car grew suffocating. Only when they pulled up to the Jackson family estate did Evelyn finally speak. "If anyone asks, tell them you just gave me a ride."

He snapped the file shut. "Am I that much of an embarrassment?"

"We're getting divorced soon. No need to complicate things."

"Afraid it'll scare off your next lover?" His lips curled into a cold smirk.

Evelyn arched a brow. "You catch on quick."

As she moved to exit, a strong hand yanked her back. Ethan gripped her wrist, his voice dangerously low. "You’ve grown bold, Evelyn."

Outside the estate, the Jackson family waited eagerly.

Charles Jackson stood at the forefront, beaming. Ethan’s presence at the birthday banquet was a significant show of support for the Jacksons.

Victoria Farley proudly held Isabella Jackson’s arm. If not for her daughter, the Sullivans would never have granted them this honor.

But minutes passed, and the car door remained closed.

Whispers spread among the guests:

"Did Mr. Sullivan change his mind?"
"Maybe the Jacksons offended the Sullivans..."
"I heard he dotes on the second Miss Jackson. Why is he ignoring her now?"

Charles’ expression darkened. He turned to Isabella. "Go invite Mr. Sullivan inside."

###Chapter 22

Isabella's cheeks flushed pink as she nodded softly. "Alright."

She glided toward the car, her voice dripping with sweetness. "Ethan, everyone's waiting for you."

Inside the vehicle, Evelyn was trapped in Ethan's iron grip. The saccharine tone sent a shiver down her spine, goosebumps rising on her arms.

"Ethan~" she drawled, mimicking Isabella's sickly-sweet voice. "Your little sweetheart is pining for you outside. Aren't you going to let me go?"

Ethan's brow furrowed, his voice low and warning. "Evelyn, drop the act."

"How can I speak properly when you're crushing my wrist?" She arched a brow defiantly.

He abruptly released her, his tone icy. "Get out."

Evelyn pushed the door open. Isabella's eager expression froze the moment she saw her, her face draining of color.

"What are you doing here?!"

Evelyn's red lips curved. "You seem surprised to see me, little sister."

The Jackson family's expressions darkened instantly. Victoria's glare could have flayed her alive—this wretched girl was stealing Isabella's spotlight again!

Ethan stepped out from the other side and casually took Evelyn's hand.

She tried to pull away discreetly, but his grip only tightened.

"Are you insane?" she hissed under her breath. "Everyone's watching!"

"Since when is holding my wife's hand a crime?"

Their seemingly intimate gesture sent shockwaves through the crowd.

"I thought Ethan was into Isabella. Why is he so close to Evelyn?"

"Three years apart must have killed the spark."

"Isabella was just bragging about Ethan coming. This is so humiliating!"

Isabella's nails dug into her palms as the whispers cut deep. Her eyes welled with tears as she looked at Ethan. "How could you do this to me?"

With that, she covered her face and fled.

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. What a masterful retreat—playing the victim in just a few words.

Truly a world-class manipulator.

###Chapter 23

The guests' stares burned into Evelyn's back, but she remained unfazed.

She tilted her head toward Ethan, a mocking smile playing on her lips. "Your little sweetheart is about to cry. Aren’t you going to comfort her?"

Ethan's eyes turned icy. "Evelyn, know your limits."

She let out a soft laugh and fell silent.

Victoria stormed over, her face tight with undisguised loathing. "Making a scene in public—have you no shame?"

Evelyn emotionlessly pulled her wrist free from Ethan's grip. "You should be saying that to Mr. Sullivan."

"How dare you!" Victoria trembled with rage. "Do you even respect me as your mother?"

"Enough!" Charles slammed his cane against the floor. "All of you, silence!"

William quickly stepped in, ushering Ethan away with an apologetic smile.

Ethan tightened his grip on Evelyn's wrist, making her wince.

"Mr. Sullivan," she said in a low voice, "you have guests to attend to."

His eyes burned with fury. "Run off again, and I won’t hesitate to announce our relationship to everyone here."

"Fine," she suddenly smiled. "Let them all see how the second Jackson sister seduced her sister's fiancé."

She yanked her hand free and walked away without looking back.

Ethan watched her slender figure retreat, his knuckles whitening from the force of his grip.

In a secluded corner of the garden, Evelyn finally exhaled—only for a maid to rush over. "Madam Sullivan requests your presence."

Victoria's slap came with a sharp whistle through the air.

Evelyn sidestepped, watching coldly as the woman stumbled.

"You ungrateful wretch!" Victoria shrieked. "You knew Isabella loves Ethan, yet you humiliated her on purpose!"

"Three years ago, when Ethan was paralyzed," Evelyn enunciated each word, "where was your precious daughter?"

"She was young and foolish!" Victoria snapped. "Now that he's recovered, what right do you have to cling to him?"

Evelyn suddenly laughed. "The right I earned when I saved Isabella's life."

"Without the Jacksons, you're nothing!" Victoria jabbed a finger at her. "Don’t forget who pulled you out of that backwater village!"

Her nails dug into her palms as Evelyn heard her own icy reply: "Then I’ll go back to that village right now."

###Chapter 24

Evelyn Sullivan turned away with indifference. "Suit yourself."

"You!"

Victoria Farley trembled with rage, her voice shrill. "This is exactly why I can't stand you—always so cold and lifeless!"

"Anything else?"

The impatience in Evelyn's eyes only fueled Victoria's fury.

"Evelyn Sullivan, what kind of attitude is this?!"

Evelyn regarded her calmly. "What kind of attitude do you expect?"

Victoria wrinkled her nose in disgust. "Never mind. I don’t have time for this. Isabella’s back. When are you divorcing Ethan?"

"What does Isabella’s return have to do with me?"

Victoria scoffed. "Stop playing dumb. Ethan and Isabella are in love. Aren’t you ashamed of getting in their way?"

Evelyn’s gaze remained cool. "We’re legally married. The shame isn’t mine to bear."

"Are all the men in the world dead? Must you steal from your own sister?!"

A mocking smile touched Evelyn’s lips. "Mrs. Farley, Isabella is the one trying to take my husband. Instead of pressuring me, tell her to try harder. If Ethan asks for a divorce, I’ll sign without hesitation."

"Fine! Remember your words!"

Evelyn walked away without looking back.

Inside the banquet hall, Charles Jackson was delivering a speech.

Evelyn found a quiet corner and took out her phone. Sophia Reynolds immediately sidled up to her.

"Playing that again?" Sophia shot a disdainful glance at the screen.

"Mm."

Sophia studied Evelyn’s flawless profile and sighed. The Jacksons were blind, favoring a fake gem over the real one.

Recalling what she’d witnessed earlier, Sophia seethed. "I saw Ethan and Isabella all over each other in the garden. Disgusting!"

Evelyn’s fingers never paused. "They were always meant to be."

"Is Ethan blind? How could he fall for that scheming little—"

"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder."

Sophia gaped. "You’re just going to let your husband cheat?"

"It’s a secret marriage. To everyone else, they’re the legitimate couple."

Sophia: "..."

"You’re tragic. I’ll treat you better from now on."

"You can start now. Fetch me some cakes."

Sophia grinned and stood. "Wait here!"

As Charles concluded his speech, Emily Jackson gracefully took the stage. The Jackson family had three children: the eldest, William, the second son, David, and the youngest, Emily.

###Chapter 25

The Jackson family gathered three generations under one roof. The eldest son William Jackson and his wife Victoria Farley had twin daughters Evelyn Sullivan and Isabella Jackson. The second son Henry Jackson and his wife Aileen had a daughter Rain Jackson and a son Tyler Jackson. The youngest daughter Grace Jackson had married into a prominent family in the capital and couldn't attend due to personal matters.

The Jackson ancestral home was brightly lit, filled with guests. Rain stood on stage, preparing to play a carefully crafted birthday tribute video for her grandfather.

Evelyn sipped her champagne, fingers lightly tapping the glass.

The screen flickered after just a few seconds, then abruptly changed.

Security footage from Mirage Club appeared. It showed Evelyn feeding fruit to a male model beside her. The edited clip looped relentlessly. Gasps erupted through the crowd.

Rain paled, looking helplessly at her grandfather.

Whispers exploded among the guests.

"That adopted daughter of the Jacksons is downright wild!"

"Raised in the countryside—no wonder she has no manners."

"Old Mr. Jackson must be livid!"

Charles Jackson slammed the table, rattling the teacups. "William! Is this how you raised your daughter?"

Victoria's face twisted with fury. "I told you we never should've brought her back! Now the whole family is humiliated!"

"Enough!" William's temples throbbed. "What's the point of this now?"

Victoria's eyes reddened. "If she hadn't done such disgraceful things, we wouldn't be in this mess!"

Eleanor Jackson's voice was icy. "Let her explain herself."

Near the entrance, Ethan Sullivan and Isabella paused. A glint of triumph flashed in Isabella's eyes as Ethan strode toward Evelyn.

"Explain." His voice was glacial.

Evelyn met his gaze calmly. "Only Sophia and you knew about this. Who do you think did it?"

Ethan's eyes darkened. "You're accusing me?"

###Chapter 26

Evelyn Sullivan met Ethan Sullivan's gaze, a cold smile playing on her lips. "Shouldn't I doubt you? For the sake of your beloved, what wouldn't you do?"

Ethan's eyes darkened, his fingers clenching until they turned white. "In your eyes, am I really that despicable?"

The air froze between them.

A servant from the Jackson household hurried over, her tone sharp. "Miss Evelyn, the Madam demands an explanation from you."

"There's nothing to explain." Evelyn's voice was indifferent. "What you saw is the truth."

The servant stiffened. "The Madam was so angry she took heart medication. If you don't go—"

Before she could finish, Evelyn's wrist was seized.

Ethan dragged her forward with long strides.

"Ethan!" She struggled fiercely. "Let go!"

Isabella Jackson rushed to block their path, tears glistening in her eyes. "Ethan, explaining now will only make things worse. Let Evelyn leave first—"

Evelyn let out a cold laugh. "Stop pretending to be kind. If I find out you had anything to do with this—"

"Sister!" Isabella's voice trembled. "I was trying to help you. How could you—"

Victoria Farley stormed over, shielding Isabella as she snapped, "You shamelessly flirted with a male model, and now you're accusing Isabella? How could I have raised a daughter like you!"

Isabella feigned concern. "Mom, I don't mind, but Sister's reputation—"

"She deserves it!"

The mother-daughter duo's performance nearly made Evelyn laugh out loud.

Ethan pulled her onto the center of the stage.

The crowd erupted in murmurs.

Evelyn smirked mockingly. "What now? Not satisfied with humiliating me privately, so you want to do it publicly?"

Isabella hid a triumphant smile.

But the next moment, Ethan's words sent her crashing into an abyss.

"You want an explanation?" His icy gaze swept across the room. "Evelyn Sullivan is my wife. Can the Jackson family handle that explanation?"

The banquet hall exploded.

"What? Mr. Sullivan and Miss Evelyn are married?!"

"So Isabella is the homewrecker?"

"My God, he watched his wife feed fruit to a male model and stayed this calm?"

Isabella's face turned ashen, her entire body trembling.

She never expected Ethan to publicly acknowledge their marriage.

###Chapter 27

Isabella's champagne glass slipped from her fingers, shattering on the floor with a piercing crash that silenced the ballroom.

Her nails dug into her palms as she stared at Ethan's hand tightly gripping Evelyn's.

"Ethan..." Her voice trembled, tears welling in her eyes.

Victoria rushed to support her daughter, glaring at Evelyn. "Mr. Sullivan, surely you're being deceived! Isabella is the one who deserves your attention!"

Ethan's icy gaze silenced Victoria instantly.

"My personal affairs are none of your concern."

Charles's face darkened, his grip tightening on his cane. He never expected Ethan to publicly defend that illegitimate girl!

"Mr. Sullivan, we're only concerned about Evelyn's reputation—"

"Reputation?" Ethan scoffed. "Since when has the Jackson family cared about her reputation?"

The ballroom fell deathly quiet, guests holding their breaths.

Evelyn wrenched her hand free and strode toward the exit without looking back.

"Stop!" Ethan commanded sharply.

Her footsteps didn't falter, her retreating figure resolute.

As Ethan moved to follow, Isabella grabbed his sleeve desperately.

"Tell me the truth, Ethan..." Tears streamed down her face. "Have you fallen for my sister?"

Ethan frowned, slowly withdrawing his arm.

"Isabella, don't do this."

"Then why?!" she shrieked hysterically. "We were meant to be together!"

Exhaustion flickered in Ethan's eyes. "What happened three years ago is over."

"No!" Isabella shook her head wildly. "Everything will go back to how it was now that I'm home!"

Ethan said nothing more, turning on his heel to leave.

At the villa, Evelyn sat quietly by the floor-to-ceiling window.

Hearing the door open, she spoke without turning.

"Ethan, let's get divorced."

His footsteps halted, his expression darkening instantly.

"What did you say?"

Evelyn turned to face him, her gaze terrifyingly calm.

"This farce needs to end."

###Chapter 28

Evelyn stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, her fingertips lightly tapping against the glass in her hand.

"Ethan, we need to talk about what happened tonight."

Her voice was soft, but carried an unshakable resolve.

The chaos from the gala still lingered in her mind. The whispers, the prying stares—they all made her skin crawl.

Ethan sat on the sofa, his long fingers loosening his tie.

"I thought you'd be grateful."

"Grateful?" Evelyn turned, a flicker of mockery in her eyes. "Grateful that you announced our marriage without consulting me?"

His gaze turned icy.

"If I hadn't stepped in, those photos with the male models would have ruined you."

"That was my problem to handle." She took a step closer. "You crossed a line."

The air between them froze.

Ethan suddenly stood, his towering frame casting a shadow over her.

"What are you so afraid of, Evelyn?" His voice was low. "Afraid people will know you're Mrs. Sullivan?"

She retreated half a step, her back pressing against the cold glass.

"Why keep pretending? We're already at this point."

"Pretending?" He let out a cold laugh. "Who was the one begging to marry me?"

The words cut deep.

She drew a sharp breath. "Which is why I want to end this mistake now."

His eyes darkened dangerously.

"Not happening."

"Why?" Her voice finally rose. "What do you even want?"

He stared at her for a long moment before turning toward the door.

"Remember—this marriage is mine to control."

Evelyn grabbed a cushion and hurled it at his retreating figure.

"Then I'll go to Grandma!"

Ethan halted mid-step.

He turned slowly, his expression terrifyingly grim.

"Try it."

The door slammed shut behind him.

Evelyn collapsed onto the sofa. Her phone buzzed abruptly.

"Evelyn! What the hell happened between you and Ethan?" Sophia's voice was stunned. "The entire gala is buzzing about your three-year secret marriage!"

Evelyn closed her eyes.

"It's complicated."

"I thought you were getting divorced! How did—"

"Not now." Evelyn cut her off. "I'm exhausted."

She hung up and stared blankly at the ceiling.

In the study, Ethan was reviewing the investigation report Colin had sent.

"Confirmed it was Lily?"

"Yes, Mr. Sullivan." Colin's tone was grave. "She's closely connected to Isabella."

Ethan's gaze hardened.

"Send me the evidence."

The email notification chimed moments later.

After scanning the documents, Ethan dialed Isabella's number.

The call rang endlessly before she finally picked up.

"Ethan..." Her voice trembled with tears. "I thought you'd never speak to me again."

His voice was ice.

"How much were you involved in tonight?"

Silence.

"You... you're accusing me?" Her breath hitched.

###Chapter 29

"Speak." Ethan Sullivan's voice was icy.

"No! She's still my sister—how could I harm her?!"

Ethan's eyes darkened. "The evidence is clear. Lily White may be the face of it, but digging deeper..." He paused. "Last chance. Was it you?"

Isabella Jackson's breathing grew ragged. After a long silence, she suddenly laughed. "Yes, it was me!"

"Every time I saw you two together, I went mad with jealousy!" Her voice cracked. "Do I disgust you?"

"Never again." His tone could freeze hell. "Don't ruin what little goodwill I have left for you."

The call ended. Ethan yanked his tie loose, frustration simmering. The MY acquisition needed to accelerate. Once he handed the company to Isabella, he'd ensure she never got close to him again.

The next morning, Evelyn Sullivan had just finished washing up when her phone rang.

"Evelyn, you're awake?" William Jackson's voice was tentative.

"What do you want?"

"We didn't get to talk properly at your grandfather's birthday... Come to the family dinner tonight? Your grandmother made your favorite dishes."

Evelyn instantly understood the ploy. Too bad she wouldn't play along.

"I'm busy."

"But you're home—"

"I got a job. Can't be late." She hung up.

William stared at his phone, stunned.

"Well?" Victoria Farley approached, scowling.

"She said she's working."

Victoria sneered. "What decent job could she possibly have? Washing dishes or sweeping streets? She'll humiliate us!"

"Enough!"

"If Ethan Sullivan weren't crippled, would she have ever married into the Sullivans?" Victoria spat. "A high school dropout. Every time Eleanor Jackson brings her up, I want to disappear!"

"She's your daughter!"

"Isabella is my only child!" Victoria slammed the door behind her.

Rubbing his temples, William called his assistant. "Find out where Evelyn is working."

10 AM, MY Fashion Group's executive conference room.

Tyler Laurier slammed a file onto the table. "Evelyn, my entire department was gutted! Suppliers are hounding us for shipments. My team has worked two weeks straight—now they're all quitting!"

His bloodshot eyes burned. "This is on you."

###Chapter 30

Tyler Laurier's words still hung in the air when a chorus of agreement erupted in the conference room.

"My department is in complete chaos too!"

"Three people's workload dumped on one—this is inhuman!"

"If this continues, the company will collapse!"

Evelyn Sullivan scanned the room with an impassive expression before her gaze settled on Sophia Reynolds.

"Bring me Tyler's department performance reports."

Tyler shot to his feet, face dark with anger.

"What's the meaning of this, Evelyn? Don't you trust me?"

She accepted the file, a cold smirk playing on her lips.

"Numbers don't lie."

Her fingers tapped lightly against the pages as she skimmed through the data.

"Five projects. Three expire in six months. Two are a year overdue."

Beads of sweat formed on Tyler's forehead.

"Those two are in the final stages! We're short-staffed—"

"That's no excuse."

Snapping the file shut, she fixed him with a razor-sharp glare.

"I want results by year-end. Otherwise, these departments will be dissolved."

The room fell deathly silent.

Tyler clenched his fists, voice trembling.

"Evelyn, this company isn't yours alone!"

"Then prove your worth with performance."

She rose, sweeping her gaze across the room.

"Every department faces quarterly evaluations. Miss the target—either replace the head or shut it down."

Her heels clicked sharply against the floor as she strode toward the exit.

Tyler watched her retreating figure, eyes glinting with malice.

Outside, Sophia hurried to catch up.

"Evelyn, wasn't that too harsh?"

"Business is war."

Evelyn stepped into the elevator without looking back.

In the following days, Evelyn practically lived at the office. Her interactions with Ethan Sullivan were reduced to brief encounters at the foyer.

On the eve of Sophia's birthday, Evelyn left early to pick up a custom gown.

Under the dazzling mall lights, she came face-to-face with Isabella Jackson and Margaret Sullivan.

Margaret scowled and blocked her path.

"Stop right there! Where are your manners?"

Evelyn paused.

"I have errands. Excuse me."

Margaret's face twisted in outrage.

"You ungrateful brat! Help me pick a dress!"

"Isabella can assist you."

Evelyn walked away without a backward glance as Margaret's furious shrieks followed her.

"What use is a daughter-in-law like this?"

Isabella's soothing voice floated after her. "Aunt Margaret, don't upset yourself. My sister just..."

The glass storefront reflected Evelyn's icy profile. She tightened her grip on the bag strap and disappeared into the crowd.

###Chapter 31

Isabella bit her lip, her eyes darting nervously as she twisted the hem of her shirt between her fingers.

"Aunt Margaret... there's something... about my sister..."

Margaret set down her coffee cup, brows furrowing. "Isabella, speak plainly."

"My sister..." Isabella took a deep breath. "She was caught hiring male models at a bar a few days ago. At Grandpa's birthday banquet, the surveillance footage was projected on the big screen..."

Margaret's face paled. The teaspoon slipped from her fingers with a sharp clatter against the saucer.

"What?!"

Isabella's eyes welled with tears, her voice trembling. "Ethan publicly acknowledged their marriage to protect her..."

Margaret shot to her feet, chest heaving. She snatched up her purse, face dark with fury. "We'll talk another time, Isabella."

"Aunt Margaret..." Isabella caught her sleeve. "Please don't tell her it was me who told you..."

Margaret patted her hand, eyes glinting coldly. "Don't worry."

Watching Margaret's retreating figure, Isabella allowed a faint smirk to curl her lips.

At the mall entrance, Evelyn had just stepped out with her dress bag when her phone rang.

"Where are you?" Ethan's voice was glacial.

"Qanda Mall."

"Stay there."

The call ended abruptly. Within twenty minutes, a black Maybach screeched to a halt before her.

No sooner had Evelyn buckled her seatbelt than the car lurched forward.

"What's wrong?"

Ethan's knuckles whitened on the steering wheel. "We're cleaning up your mess."

As they pulled into the Sullivan estate, realization dawned on Evelyn. Remembering her earlier encounter with Margaret and Isabella at the mall, a cold smile touched her lips.

In the living room, Margaret sat rigid on the sofa, gaze sharp as a blade.

"Ethan, is it true she hired male models?"

Ethan's expression darkened. "Who's spreading lies?"

Margaret slammed her palm on the coffee table. "I want the truth!"

"It's true." Evelyn stepped forward, meeting Margaret's glare head-on. "What do you intend to do about it?"

Margaret shot to her feet, finger shaking as she pointed at Evelyn. "How dare you ask that?!"

She whirled toward Ethan, voice shrill. "You must divorce this shameless woman!"

The air turned to ice.

###Chapter 32

"I agree!"

"I absolutely disagree!"

Two opposing voices exploded in the living room. Margaret Sullivan shot to her feet, her well-maintained face twisted in shock. "Ethan Sullivan, have you lost your mind?! Evelyn had the audacity to openly hire male models!"

Ethan didn't even lift his gaze. "My marriage is none of your concern."

"None of my concern?!" Margaret trembled with rage. "After her disgraceful behavior, you still defend her?!"

"Mother, that's enough."

Evelyn suddenly chuckled. "I can sign the divorce papers anytime—if Mr. Sullivan is willing to let me go."

Margaret narrowed her eyes suspiciously. "You'd give in that easily?"

"As you said," Evelyn smoothed her cuffs leisurely, "three years without children, plus hiring male models—hardly worthy of the Sullivan name."

"You'd better mean that!"

"Would you like it in writing?"

"Evelyn!" Ethan snapped, gripping her wrist.

She met his stormy gaze. "Everyone thinks we should divorce. Why cling to this, Mr. Sullivan?"

She couldn't fathom it. Isabella was the one he truly loved—why keep her trapped?

His jaw tightened as he dragged her toward the door.

Margaret glared at their intertwined hands and angrily dialed Henry Sullivan. "Come home now! It's an emergency!"

——

The moment they stepped outside, Evelyn wrenched her hand free.

"Ethan, I'm done pretending!"

He paused. "You won't have to see her again."

She blinked, caught off guard.

"My decision stands. I want a divorce."

Ethan turned, caging her between the car and himself. "As long as I refuse, you remain Mrs. Sullivan."

Evelyn looked away. "Not in the mood to argue today."

Something twisted in his chest at her exhaustion.

The drive back passed in heavy silence.

——

The next morning, Evelyn handed a gift box to Sophia the moment she entered the office.

"Happy birthday."

Sophia gasped upon unwrapping it. "Oh my God! Is this—"

"Ordered it months ago."

"Evelyn!" Sophia hugged her tightly. "I'm wearing this on my date tonight!"

Evelyn arched a brow. "You have a boyfriend?"

"Yeah." Sophia's cheeks pinked. "I'll introduce you soon."

###Chapter 33

Sophia Reynolds couldn't hide the happiness radiating from her face. Evelyn Sullivan stole a few extra glances at her. Whatever man could make such a strong woman like Sophia act so girlish must be extraordinary.

"I wanted to invite you to dinner, but since you already have plans, we'll do it another time."

"Sure."

The moment Sophia left, Evelyn's phone rang sharply.

"Evelyn Sullivan, Ethan has signed the divorce papers. Come to the family estate immediately!"

Evelyn's fingers stilled. Ethan had been so adamant yesterday—why the sudden change?

"He really signed?"

A brief silence stretched on the other end before Margaret Sullivan's shrill voice snapped back. "What? Did you think Ethan couldn't live without you? Don't flatter yourself!"

"I'll be right there."

Hanging up, Isabella Jackson turned to Margaret with concern. "Aunt Margaret, Ethan will be furious if he finds out."

Margaret scoffed. "Once it's done, do you really think he'd disown his own mother for some woman?"

Last night, she'd embellished her complaints to Henry Sullivan, only to be scolded instead. Clenching her fists, Margaret thought of those disgraceful photos of Evelyn. That woman had to be driven out of the Sullivan family.

Half an hour later, Evelyn stepped into the Sullivan living room.

The two women chatting animatedly immediately fell silent. Margaret lifted her chin haughtily. "Once you sign, you and Ethan are finished."

Evelyn walked straight to the coffee table and flipped to the last page. The bold, sweeping signature stung her eyes.

"Is this signature valid?"

Margaret sneered. "Not everyone is as shameless as you."

As the pen touched paper, Evelyn's heartbeat roared in her ears. Margaret watched her swift movements with inexplicable irritation. Why wasn't this woman showing any reluctance?

"I'll go file the paperwork now."

Margaret shot to her feet. "I'm coming with you—just in case you try anything."

Outside, Margaret glared at the Lamborghini, her expression dark. "That car Ethan bought for you stays."

Isabella's eyes burned with envy. "Sister, even after the divorce, you still want to take advantage?"

Evelyn swept a cold gaze over them. "Sorry to disappoint. This car is mine." She got in and drove off without another word.

At the civil affairs office, Evelyn waited for what felt like forever. Impatient, she pushed open the car door—just as a black Maybach screeched to a halt in front of her.

The door swung open. Ethan stepped out, his long strides carrying him toward her, his presence suffocatingly oppressive.

###Chapter 34

A chilling aura radiated from him. His pitch-black eyes pinned her in place like daggers.

Evelyn's breath hitched as her back pressed against the cold wall.

Ethan advanced step by step, the sound of his dress shoes striking the tiles unnervingly sharp.

"Who gave you the nerve?"

His voice was low, each word laced with icy venom.

Her fingers tightened around the document folder, knuckles turning white.

"Mr. Sullivan, since you're here, why don't we go to the notary together?"

She lifted her chin, meeting his gaze without flinching.

A cold laugh escaped him as he seized her wrist.

"You think this is enough to get a divorce?"

The folder clattered to the floor, revealing the divorce papers inside.

She struggled, but his grip was unyielding.

"Do I need to find another man before you'll sign?"

His eyes darkened, fingers tightening until his knuckles whitened.

"Go ahead. Try."

He leaned in, his whisper terrifyingly soft against her ear.

"Let’s see who dares lay a finger on Mrs. Sullivan."

Evelyn shoved him away and bent to retrieve the folder.

"I won’t trouble you any further, Mr. Sullivan."

She turned toward the eye-catching Lamborghini.

Ethan’s gaze locked onto the car, his expression stormy.

"Whose car is that?"

She yanked the door open without looking back.

"None of your concern."

As the engine roared to life, Ethan pulled out his phone.

"Find out who owns that Lamborghini."

Evelyn had barely parked when she spotted William waiting at the company entrance.

"Evelyn, this car—"

His eyes lingered greedily on the luxury vehicle.

"Did you need something?"

She cut him off sharply.

His smile faltered before he forced it back.

"Come home for dinner this weekend. Your grandmother misses you."

"Fine."

She turned to leave, but he hurriedly added, "I’ll send a car for you on Saturday."

Only after he was gone did she exhale in relief.

Night fell.

Evelyn’s fingers flew across the keyboard as she stared at her screen.

Her phone buzzed.

"Evelyn…"

Sophia’s tearful voice crackled through the line.

She grabbed her coat and bolted out the door.

The private room reeked of alcohol.

Sophia lay sprawled on the couch, her makeup smeared.

"He cheated on me…"

Evelyn’s chest tightened as she rushed forward.

Broken bottles littered the floor, reflecting the chaos in fractured light.

###Chapter 35

Sophia Reynolds curled up in the corner of the couch, clutching a half-empty bottle of liquor. Tears streaked through her smudged eyeliner, leaving uneven trails down her face.

Evelyn Sullivan snatched the bottle from her grasp. "What happened?"

"He... he left me..." Sophia's voice cracked between sobs. "That bastard... said his first love came back..."

Evelyn gently rubbed her back. "He's not worth your tears."

"Give it back!" Sophia suddenly lunged for the bottle, swaying unsteadily.

Without hesitation, Evelyn scooped her up in a bridal carry, ignoring her protests, and strode toward the parking lot.

After settling the drunken Sophia, Evelyn realized her phone was missing. She hurried back to the club. The moment she pushed open the VIP room door, blaring music assaulted her ears.

A burly man with a rough face was toying with her phone, surrounded by smirking onlookers.

"Please return my phone," Evelyn said calmly.

The man narrowed his eyes at her. "Prove it's yours."

"I can unlock it."

"Fine," he slid three shots of hard liquor toward her. "Drink these, and it's yours."

Evelyn threw back the shots in quick succession, her throat burning. As she turned to leave with her phone, she noticed an eerie silence had fallen over the room.

The hallway lights flickered. Suddenly, her legs gave way, and an unfamiliar heat surged through her veins. She braced herself against the wall just as hurried footsteps pounded behind her.

"Quick! Don't let her escape!"

In the darkness, Evelyn bit her tongue hard to stay conscious, stumbling blindly into the emergency stairwell.

###Chapter 36

Evelyn Sullivan's eyes turned ice-cold in an instant.

Several burly men had already surrounded her.

"Pretty thing, come with us," the leader sneered, reaching out to grab her.

Evelyn seized his wrist with lightning speed and flipped him over her shoulder in one smooth motion.

"Ah!" The man crashed heavily onto the floor.

The remaining three men paled and lunged at her simultaneously.

Amid the flurry of punches and kicks, Evelyn's movements grew sluggish.

She barely managed to take down the last attacker before her vision began to darken.

Staggering into the elevator, she pressed the button for the first floor with trembling fingers.

When the doors opened again, she realized this wasn’t the lobby.

Footsteps echoed faintly behind her.

Gritting her teeth, she stumbled forward.

The hallway seemed endless.

Just as she was about to collapse, a pair of strong arms caught her.

Inside the VIP lounge on the eighth floor, Ethan Sullivan had already emptied three bottles of XO.

"Ethan, are you trying to drink yourself to death?" Lucas Laurier finally spoke up.

Ethan shot him a cold glare. "Shut up."

Ryan Paisley held Lucas back. "Can't you see he's in a bad mood?"

The door suddenly swung open.

Alexander King walked in with Lily White clinging to his arm. "Everyone, meet my girlfriend."

The air froze.

Lucas stared at Lily, remembering he’d just seen Alexander with Sophia Reynolds days ago.

"Hello, everyone," Lily greeted softly.

Alexander squeezed her hand. "Should we invite Isabella over?"

Lily glanced furtively at Ethan. "Would that be... intrusive?"

"Unnecessary." Ethan abruptly stood. "I'm leaving."

Lily's eyes reddened. "Does Mr. Sullivan dislike me?"

Lucas scoffed. "If he liked you, someone else would be crying."

###Chapter 37

Alexander King shot Lucas Laurier an annoyed glare before ruffling Lily White's hair affectionately. "Ignore him. He's always been cold. You'll get used to it."

Stepping out of the private room, Ethan Sullivan pulled out his phone. The screen was blank—no messages, no missed calls.

He remembered how Evelyn Sullivan used to text him reminders during business dinners and leave hangover medicine by the entrance. Now, even if he stayed out all night, she wouldn't bat an eye.

A chill flashed in his eyes as he was about to pocket his phone, when a glint of silver caught his attention.

It was the custom-made phone he'd gifted Evelyn last year—one of a kind in the entire city.

"Stop!" His fingers clamped around the stranger's wrist, voice icy. "Where did you get this?"

Daniel Sterling never expected to run into Evelyn at the Grand View. Her flushed cheeks and glazed eyes made it obvious—she'd been drugged.

Without hesitation, he whisked her to his suite and called his agent. "Get a female doctor here. Now!"

Hanging up, he paced anxiously before checking on her. The sight in the bedroom froze him in place.

Evelyn writhed on the tangled sheets, her collar undone, revealing pale skin. Her usually bright eyes were clouded as she tugged weakly at her clothes.

"So hot..."

Daniel's throat tightened. He spun around abruptly. "Hold on. The doctor's coming."

He fled the room, each second stretching unbearably. When the doctor still hadn't arrived after fifteen minutes, he turned to check again.

BANG!

The door burst open. Ethan stormed in, his gaze razor-sharp. "Where's Evelyn?"

Daniel blocked the bedroom. "This is my suite, Mr. Sullivan."

Ethan shoved past him. Bodyguards immediately restrained Daniel.

The moment Ethan opened the bedroom door, his pupils contracted. He slammed it shut and reemerged moments later with Evelyn securely wrapped in a blanket.

"If you had any part in this," Ethan gripped Daniel's jaw, voice lethally calm, "I'll make you wish you were dead."

In the penthouse, Evelyn continued to twist restlessly. Watching her struggle against the drugs, Ethan's chest burned with fury at what could've happened had he arrived later.

He tossed her onto the bed. The impact briefly cleared her haze before the heat consumed her again.

"Help me..." Her fingers clawed at her collar, skin flushed pink.

Ethan pinned her wrists, leaning dangerously close. "Be specific. How exactly should I help?"

###Chapter 38

Evelyn Sullivan felt her entire body burning with feverish desire. In her dazed state, she instinctively pressed closer to the cool presence beside her.

"Look at me. Who am I?" Ethan Sullivan's deep voice rumbled in her ear, laced with undeniable authority.

She forced her eyes open with difficulty, her blurred vision clearing to reveal Ethan's sharply defined, handsome features.

"Ethan..."

Before she could finish, his lips captured hers in a dominating kiss. Evelyn felt like a tiny boat tossed by violent waves, rising and falling helplessly.

At dawn, Evelyn woke to the ache in her limbs.

She turned sharply and found Ethan's sleeping profile mere inches away. Memories of the previous night flooded back, making her body tense instantly.

"Awake?" Ethan's eyes snapped open, his dark gaze piercing straight through her.

Evelyn instinctively gripped the sheets, her throat too dry to speak.

"About last night..." She took a deep breath. "Let's pretend it never happened."

Ethan's expression darkened. "What do you mean, Evelyn?"

"We're getting divorced soon. There's no point dwelling on this." She turned her face away, her voice eerily calm.

He let out a cold laugh. "So you sleep with me and then run?"

Evelyn whipped her head back to glare at him. "You took advantage of me!"

"Who was the one clinging to me all night?" He leaned closer, his breath hot against her skin. "Should I remind you of the details?"

Her ears burned as fragmented images from last night flashed through her mind.

"So what?" She forced composure. "These things happen between adults."

Ethan's eyes darkened dangerously. He suddenly seized her wrist. "Say that again, Evelyn."

Their breaths mingled. She could feel the heat radiating from his chest.

"Let go!" She struggled, but her voice trembled.

Instead of releasing her, he pinned her down harder. "Listen carefully. In my dictionary, there's no such thing as divorce—only widowhood."

"You—"

"Test me if you dare." He released her abruptly and reached for his robe. "From today onward, stay away from other men."

Evelyn hurled a pillow at his retreating figure. "Ethan Sullivan, you bastard!"

Without turning, he caught the pillow effortlessly. His voice dripped with menace. "Still have energy to curse? Seems I didn't wear you out enough last night."

###Chapter 39

Ethan Sullivan stood by the bed, sunlight streaming through the curtains to illuminate his form. He buttoned his shirt with deliberate slowness, the defined lines of his abs faintly visible in the morning light.

Evelyn Sullivan abruptly turned her head away, the tips of her ears turning pink.

"How much longer are you going to stare?"

Ethan chuckled lowly, leaning in close to her ear. "You examined me quite thoroughly last night."

"Get lost!"

Evelyn yanked the covers over her head. Her muffled voice came from beneath the sheets. "I need to get dressed."

"I already had clothes sent over."

He finished tying his tie and glanced at his watch. "I'll pick you up at seven tonight."

"I'm busy."

"Then eight."

His footsteps faded as the door clicked shut. Only then did Evelyn throw off the covers, staring blankly at the ceiling.

She never should have come back for her phone last night.

Grabbing her phone, she dialed a number. "Find out who was in VIP Room 5 at Mirage Club last night."

Under the hot spray of the shower, Evelyn glared at the marks on her skin in the mirror, muttering curses under her breath.

The doorbell rang. The delivery included not just a dress, but undergarments in her exact size.

Frowning, she changed and sent Sophia Reynolds a text to take the day off.

Inside the black Maybach, Colin Keller was delivering his report.

"Mr. Sullivan, it's Brother Chen from the north side. He has significant influence in the nightlife scene—complicated background."

Ethan's gaze turned icy. "I don't want to hear that name in this city by sundown."

"Understood."

At MY Fashion Group, Sophia hesitated for a long moment before dialing a familiar number.

"What is it?" Alexander King's voice was laced with impatience.

"My gown is still in your car."

"I know. I'll have my assistant return it."

The call ended abruptly. Sophia gave a bitter laugh and tossed her phone onto the desk.

At King Enterprises, the secretary had just retrieved the garment bag from the car when Lily White suddenly appeared.

"Is this a surprise for me?" Lily's eyes sparkled.

"This belongs to Ms. Reynolds—"

Lily snatched the bag. "I'll explain to Alexander."

She strutted into the elevator, leaving the secretary sighing in resignation.

At noon, Sophia called again. "Where's my dress?"

Silence stretched for several seconds.

"There was... an incident," Alexander said haltingly. "I'll replace it."

Sophia hung up with a cold laugh. She should have expected this.

###Chapter 40

The line was silent for a long moment before Alexander King's icy voice finally came through. "Lily likes that dress. Name your price."

Sophia Reynolds tightened her grip on the phone, her knuckles turning white. "Alexander, who gave you the right to touch my things? Return the dress within the hour, or we'll settle this in court!"

She hung up with a sharp click, took a deep breath, and dialed Evelyn Sullivan's number.

"Evelyn..." Sophia's voice trembled. "I left the birthday gift you gave me in that scumbag's car..."

After hearing the whole story, Evelyn's eyes darkened.

"The dress doesn’t matter. I can design another. But how do you plan to handle them treating you like this?"

"I'm getting it back!" Sophia gritted her teeth. "I already gave him an ultimatum."

"Let me know if you need help."

As soon as she hung up, her subordinate called. "Boss, the person who drugged you has been caught."

Evelyn tapped her fingers lightly on the desk. "Hand all the evidence over to the police. I want him locked away for life."

That evening, Ethan Sullivan sent a car to pick her up.

At the restaurant entrance, Evelyn suddenly stopped.

Not far away, Lily White's dress shimmered under the lights with a familiar glow—it was "Serendipity," the gown Evelyn had designed herself.

Ethan's voice came from behind her. "Why aren’t you going in?"

Alexander turned around, surprised. "Ethan? You actually come to places like this?"

Lily stared at Evelyn, quickly sending a message to Isabella Jackson before forcing a smile. "Since we’ve run into each other, why not join us?"

"Sure." Evelyn agreed easily.

Inside the private room, Lily feigned innocence. "Mr. Sullivan, who is this...?"

Evelyn swirled her wine glass, a faint smirk playing on her lips. "Do you deserve to know?"

The air froze instantly.

Ethan raised an eyebrow—this was the first time he’d seen his wife so sharp-edged.

###Chapter 41

Evelyn Sullivan's gaze was razor-sharp as it pierced through Lily White.

"That dress looks familiar."

Alexander King's expression darkened instantly as he stepped in front of Lily. "Evelyn, cut the sarcasm."

Lily clenched the fabric of the dress, her knuckles turning white.

"This was a birthday gift for Sophia Reynolds." Evelyn spoke each word deliberately. "So why is it on you now?"

The restaurant lights suddenly felt blinding.

Alexander scoffed. "We transferred the money to Sophia. The dress belongs to Lily now."

"Forced sale?" Evelyn laughed coldly. "Did Sophia agree to that?"

Tears welled up in Lily's eyes, her voice trembling. "Miss Sullivan, I didn’t know... I just loved the dress so much..."

"Loved it?" Evelyn took a step closer. "The same way you love stealing other people’s boyfriends?"

Alexander slammed his hands on the table. "Evelyn!"

The sharp clink of a glass being set down froze the air.

"Finished?" Ethan Sullivan lifted his icy gaze to Alexander.

Lily’s heart skipped a beat as she looked at Ethan hopefully.

"Ethan..." Alexander’s tone softened.

"My wife is right." Ethan stood, the cold gleam of his cufflinks catching the light. "You two are disgusting."

All color drained from Lily’s face.

Alexander was stunned. "You’re cutting ties over a dress?"

"Cutting ties?" Ethan smirked. "You overestimate your importance."

He grabbed Evelyn’s wrist. "Return the dress. Now." His eyes flicked to Lily. "Or I’ll remove it for you."

The door slammed shut behind them.

Lily’s tears finally fell. "Alexander, this is all my fault..."

Alexander stared at the closed door, his fists clenched so tight they cracked. "Change out of that dress when we get back."

"Okay." Lily lowered her head, nails digging into her palms.

She’d make sure Sophia never wore that dress again.

Outside, the cold wind hit Evelyn’s face.

She yanked her hand free. "Stay out of my business."

Ethan pulled her back. "Your business?" He leaned in, his voice low. "Mrs. Sullivan, your business is mine."

###Chapter 42

Evelyn's fingertips tapped lightly on the table. In the end, she didn't say those two words.

The atmosphere in the restaurant was suffocating. They returned to the villa in silence.

"I'll make noodles." She walked straight to the kitchen, her voice calm and unreadable.

Ethan took off his suit jacket. "Let me help."

"No need."

The fridge was neatly stocked. She pulled out greens, eggs, and noodles, moving efficiently as she prepared the meal.

Oil sizzled in the pan as she fried the eggs to a perfect golden brown. The water boiled, noodles swirling in the pot, the vibrant green of the vegetables peeking through the steam.

Two steaming bowls were soon placed on the dining table—but Ethan was nowhere to be seen.

The study door was slightly ajar. She heard his hushed voice: "This matter must be contained."

The sound of the door opening interrupted his call. Ethan turned, meeting her questioning gaze.

"The noodles are ready." She turned and walked back to the dining room.

Only the soft clink of chopsticks against bowls broke the silence. Ethan suddenly spoke: "Don’t you want to know what I’m handling?"

Evelyn set down her chopsticks. "You’ll tell me if you want to."

"Just ask—"

"The noodles will get cold." She cut him off, lowering her head to continue eating.

The clatter of dishes was unusually loud. By the time Ethan started clearing the table, she had already gone upstairs.

The next morning, Evelyn arrived at the office earlier than usual. When Sophia pushed open the door, the documents on the desk had already been processed.

"The meeting with Sullivan Group at ten—"

"You go." Evelyn didn’t look up. "Reject all acquisition terms."

Sophia raised an eyebrow in surprise but nodded in agreement.

At lunchtime, Sophia burst into the office in a flurry.

"Oh my god! Sullivan Group offered a billion!" She dramatically clutched her chest. "If I weren’t so loyal to MY—"

"A billion?" Evelyn’s pen stilled.

The number was more than triple the market valuation.

"Did Ethan give any reason?"

Sophia shook her head. "He refused to say a single word."

###Chapter 43

"Reject any future acquisition offers from Sullivan Group outright."

"Understood."

Colin Keller followed Ethan Sullivan out of MY Fashion Group's headquarters, hesitating before speaking up. "Sir, our offer was already three times the market value."

Ethan didn't break stride, his eyes frosty.

"Compile a dossier on Sullivan Group's apparel subsidiaries."

He'd intended to acquire MY as a training ground for Isabella. Since they refused to cooperate, he'd take a different approach.

"Right away, sir."

Saturday arrived swiftly.

Ethan was reviewing documents on the sofa when Evelyn Sullivan descended the stairs.

The sound made him close the folder.

She wore a pale blue sundress with her hair in a high ponytail, her fresh-faced look reminiscent of a college freshman.

His brow furrowed. Without warning, he tugged her hair tie loose.

"What are you doing?"

Chestnut waves cascaded over her shoulders.

"This suits you better." He tossed the hair tie into the trash.

Evelyn fumed.

"Since when do you care how I look?"

"Let's go." Ethan stood, pausing when she didn't follow. "Why the hesitation?"

"Did my father invite you too?"

"Is that an issue?"

She pressed her lips together.

She should've known. William Jackson never considered her feelings.

An hour later, their car pulled up to the Jackson family estate.

Isabella waited at the entrance, her smile faltering momentarily at Evelyn's appearance before quickly recovering.

"Ethan! Grandpa's been expecting you."

He ignored her, turning to Evelyn instead. "We'll go in together."

The hypocrisy was laughable.

Those intimate photos still lived in her phone, yet here he was pretending to be the dutiful husband.

Inside, Charles Jackson greeted them with obsequious enthusiasm.

"Mr. Sullivan! What an honor! Please, make yourself comfortable."

Evelyn had no patience for the charade. "I'll be in the garden," she told Ethan flatly.

Isabella soon cornered her in the gazebo.

"Don't get cocky. Ethan will always love me."

"Really?" Evelyn smirked. "He barely glanced at you earlier."

Isabella's face darkened.

"We're just having a fight!" She lowered her voice venomously. "Know why your male model scandal never blew up? Ethan buried it for me! He'll always protect me!"

###Chapter 44

Isabella Jackson stared intently at Evelyn Sullivan's face, searching for any trace of jealousy in her eyes. But those cool, composed eyes remained as still as undisturbed water, not a ripple of emotion in sight.

"Who are you trying to fool with this act of generosity?" Isabella scoffed, her nails digging deep into her palms. "Do you really think this will make Ethan look at you twice?"

Evelyn lifted her gaze slightly, her voice icy. "Isabella, you're pathetic."

"What did you just say?!"

Isabella's pupils constricted sharply. Even her flawless makeup couldn't hide the twisted fury on her face.

"What else is there in your world besides Ethan Sullivan?" Evelyn suddenly found it laughable. Had she once been this pitiful too?

"Shut up!" Isabella's voice rose sharply. "You're the real loser here! No one in the Jackson family wants you—not even your own husband!"

A faint smile touched Evelyn's lips. Once, she might have craved that elusive love. But now she knew better—her only true refuge was herself.

"Believe what you want." She turned, the hem of her dress sweeping an elegant arc. "If you can convince Ethan to divorce me, I’d actually thank you."

At the corner, a tall figure made her pause mid-step.

Ethan stood in the shadows, his tailored suit accentuating his broad shoulders and narrow waist. His dark eyes were unreadable, his jaw clenched tight.

Evelyn's breath caught. Every time she mentioned divorce, this man would erupt in fury.

But this time, Ethan only gave her a long, inscrutable look before turning and disappearing down the hallway.

"Grandmother is waiting for you in the parlor," William Jackson murmured from behind her, his voice low. "Mind your words."

In the parlor, Eleanor Jackson's smile was sickly sweet. "Evelyn, dear, come sit by me."

Evelyn chose the farthest seat. The scent of tea filled the air as she cut straight to the point. "What do you want, Grandmother?"

"You always were so blunt..." The old woman chuckled awkwardly, rubbing her prayer beads. "Now that Ethan is treating you well, you should focus on giving him an heir."

Evelyn nearly laughed aloud. Three months ago, these same people had been eager to push her aside for Isabella.

"Actually, there’s something I need to say too." She set down her teacup with a crisp clink. "I’m divorcing Ethan."

The prayer beads slipped from Eleanor's fingers, scattering across the floor like marbles.

"Don’t be absurd!" The old woman’s face darkened instantly. "Do you know how many women would kill to be Mrs. Sullivan?"

"Isn’t that what Isabella has always wanted?" Evelyn met her murky gaze head-on. "She’d be a much better fit, don’t you think?"

Eleanor’s expression froze, calculation flickering behind her wrinkles. "You... truly mean it?"

"As long as the Jackson family facilitates the process." Evelyn rose, sunlight casting delicate gold flecks on her lashes. "Take your time to consider it."

As she turned away, she missed the glint of triumph in the old woman’s eyes.

###Chapter 45

The living room stood empty, save for Ethan Sullivan seated alone on the sofa. His long fingers tapped rhythmically against the armrest, his gaze sharp as ice as it landed on Evelyn Sullivan, who had just stepped inside.

Evelyn glanced around, a slight frown forming. William Jackson, that opportunistic man, wouldn’t have missed a chance to cozy up to Ethan.

"Where were you?"

Ethan’s voice turned the air frigid.

The conversation in the garden still echoed in his mind. He had waited, expecting an apology—only for her to vanish without a trace. The fury inside him burned hotter by the second.

"Talking with Grandma," Evelyn replied, taking a seat across from him. "Where’s the rest of the family?"

"Explain what you said in the garden."

She met his blazing eyes calmly. "It meant exactly what it sounded like. Do I need to spell it out?"

"Evelyn!"

"We’re here for dinner," she pressed her lips together. "I don’t want to argue."

Ethan scoffed. "Then watch your mouth."

"Understood."

Silently, she added: Next time, I’ll say it where you can’t hear.

Tension stretched between them.

William hurried in, cradling a bottle of wine with an ingratiating smile. "Mr. Sullivan, this is my prized 1982 Lafite. You simply must indulge tonight."

The dynamic was absurd—a father-in-law fawning over his son-in-law. Evelyn observed with detached indifference.

"I’m driving."

"That’s no issue!" William insisted. "I’ll have the chauffeur take you home. Or you could stay the night."

Ethan’s eyes flickered. "Fine."

At the dining table, William deliberately seated Isabella Jackson to Ethan’s left. Evelyn took the right, watching as Isabella eagerly piled food onto Ethan’s plate.

"Ethan, try these ribs."

"The sticky rice lotus root is our chef’s specialty."

"Ethan..."

Isabella’s voice dripped with saccharine sweetness. Evelyn watched with amusement—Isabella’s gaze practically undressed him.

Then a piece of braised pork landed in Evelyn’s bowl.

"Eat more." Ethan’s tone was casual. "You’re too thin. It’s uncomfortable to hold."

Every pair of eyes at the table snapped toward them. Isabella’s glare was especially venomous—as if she wanted to devour Evelyn alive.

###Chapter 46

Evelyn picked up a piece of braised pork with her chopsticks and placed it gently into Ethan's bowl, her lips curving into a faint smile. "Eat more. You have enough on your plate at the company."

Isabella's grip on her chopsticks tightened until her knuckles turned white. She suddenly looked up, tears glistening in her eyes. "Ethan, do you remember what you promised me?"

Ethan's chopsticks paused mid-air, his expression unreadable.

The air at the dining table instantly froze. William quickly raised his wine glass. "Mr. Sullivan, a toast to you."

Ethan downed the wine in one go. William forced a few business-related jokes, barely maintaining the facade of harmony.

Evelyn set down her bowl and chopsticks, the hem of her dress sweeping gracefully as she stood. "I'm full."

She had barely taken a step when Ethan's hand closed firmly around her wrist.

"Let go," she murmured, a flicker of anger flashing in her eyes.

Ethan met her gaze, his voice low. "Wait for me."

"I need some air in the garden."

"I'll go with you."

William interjected smoothly, "Evelyn, Mr. Sullivan hasn't eaten much. Help serve him some dishes."

Evelyn let out a soft laugh, her gaze drifting to the small mountain of food piled on Isabella's plate. "It seems someone else is already taking excellent care of him. I wouldn't want to steal the credit."

Isabella's face paled. She shot to her feet, her voice trembling. "Sister, I just noticed Ethan wasn't eating much..."

"Oh?" Evelyn arched a brow. "You know his tastes so well. Seems like you've had plenty of... intimate conversations."

Slap!

Victoria slammed her hands on the table, her eyes filled with disgust. "You can't even keep your husband's attention, and you dare blame Isabella?! They grew up together—of course they're close!"

Evelyn wiped the corner of her mouth with deliberate calm. "Lovely. Then by all means, let them grow even closer."

"You—"

The air turned glacial. Evelyn turned to leave, only for Victoria's shrill voice to ring out behind her. "If you walk out that door today, don't ever call me your mother again!"

"Victoria!" William barked, veins bulging at his temples.

Ethan set down his napkin, his expression indifferent. "We'll take our leave."

William hurried after him. "Mr. Sullivan, about the South City project—"

"Jackson Group can bid," Ethan said without looking back. "May the best man win."

As soon as they reached the courtyard, Isabella rushed out after them. The night wind tangled her hair, her tear-streaked face glistening under the moonlight.

"Ethan..." She choked out, clutching his sleeve. "Do you really... not want me anymore?"

Ethan looked into her red-rimmed eyes—once bright with starlight, now blurred with tears.

"Go back inside. It's cold."

###Chapter 47

Ethan Sullivan turned to leave when Isabella Jackson suddenly wrapped her arms around him from behind.

"Ethan, don't go..." Her voice trembled, tears soaking into his suit.

His brow furrowed as he tried to pry her fingers loose.

"Isabella, let go."

"No!" She clung desperately to his sleeve. "You promised me... when I turned eighteen..."

Ethan stiffened, a flicker of something unreadable in his eyes.

He turned to face her, meeting her red-rimmed gaze. "I remember."

All these years, he had indulged her every whim—even when she hurt Evelyn.

"Then why won’t you divorce her?" Isabella tilted her face up, tears streaking her cheeks.

His throat worked, but no words came.

"Are you in love with her?" Her voice turned sharp.

"Impossible." The denial was absolute.

"Then divorce her!" She gripped his arm. "We can compensate her—any amount!"

After a long silence, he sighed. "Give me time."

Isabella released him, forcing a smile. "Fine. I'll wait."

As Ethan walked away, she wiped her tears, her eyes darkening with malice.

If Evelyn disappeared forever, the problem would solve itself.

Ethan’s Maybach had just left the Jackson estate when he spotted a familiar figure.

Evelyn walked alone along the mountain road, her back straight.

Isabella’s question echoed in his mind, his frown deepening.

Love? Impossible.

If he loved her, he wouldn’t have let the Jacksons mistreat her. He wouldn’t have shielded Isabella.

Her recent defiance just unsettled him—that was all.

The black Maybach screeched to a halt beside her.

"Get in." He lowered the window, his tone commanding.

Evelyn didn’t turn. "No need."

His lips curled. "Angry about earlier?"

"Do you care if I’m angry?" She finally glanced at him, a mocking smile on her lips.

"No."

"Then why ask?"

His gaze turned icy. "Don’t test me."

"Likewise." She met his eyes without flinching. "Control your people. If it happens again—"

"Are you threatening me?"

"A warning." She smirked. "Need I remind you about Grandfather’s birthday banquet?"

Just then, a Lamborghini roared up and stopped ahead.

Daniel Sterling strode toward them, his intense gaze fixed on Evelyn.
###Chapter 48 
Ethan's eyes turned icy, his knuckles whitening from the tight grip.

"That car belongs to Daniel Sterling?"

No wonder Colin couldn't find any leads. After their last encounter, he'd investigated but only uncovered Daniel's connection to the influential Sterling family in the capital. The political waters there ran too deep to pursue further.

Evelyn froze momentarily when she spotted Daniel, then quickly schooled her expression into indifference.

"Mr. Sullivan, you're overstepping."

She strode toward Daniel's car without a backward glance. Ethan watched the taillights disappear, darkness churning in his gaze.

"Back to the office."

Inside the car, Evelyn frowned at the driver's seat.

"Why you? I specifically called Sophia."

Daniel turned the steering wheel, a faint smile playing on his lips.

"We happened to be at dinner together. She got tied up, so I came instead."

Her brow arched. During his early career when she'd managed him, Sophia often visited the set. That's how they'd become friends.

"With your packed schedule, you still have time for dinners?"

Amusement sparkled in his eyes.

"Keeping tabs on my itinerary? Want me to bring you signed photos next time?"

"Please," she scoffed. "If I hadn't drilled your handwriting back then, your autograph would've been returned by disappointed fans."

Memories flashed of the calligraphy room—how he'd deliberately scrawled messy characters just to steal extra glances at her. Those secret longings would forever remain buried.

"Speaking of which," Evelyn's voice softened, "how are the others doing?"

"Busy with their own lives."

All the artists she'd once managed had skyrocketed to fame, though reunions became rare.

When the car stopped at Northville Villa, Evelyn shook her head.

"I moved back to the marital home. Let's drop you off first."

Daniel's grip on the wheel tightened.

"You two..."

"The divorce isn't finalized." Her interruption was sharp. "It's personal."

The words stabbed like a blade. So in her eyes, he didn't even merit the right to ask.

"Evelyn," his voice turned gravelly, "aren't we friends?"

She patted his shoulder.

"Exactly why I don't want you involved. Come on, let's get you to your hotel."

Late at night, the agent studied the silent man in the rearview mirror outside the hotel entrance.

"To Northville."

The black sedan melted into the darkness again. Daniel stood before the villa, staring at the pitch-black windows next door, his gaze darker than the night itself.
Dusk settled in, the last rays of sunset swallowed by heavy clouds.

I stood by the window, my fingers absently tracing the edge of the curtain. Outside, raindrops slanted across the glass, leaving winding trails of water.

My phone screen lit up with a message from Ethan: "8 p.m. The usual place."

Seven simple words, yet they made my pulse quicken. Three months had passed since we last saw each other—since that night.

I stared at the message until the screen went dark. The mirror reflected my pale face, the shadows under my eyes impossible to hide.

"What's meant to happen will happen," I whispered to my reflection.

The closet door creaked softly as I opened it. My fingers hovered over the row of clothes before settling on the emerald-green dress—his favorite.

The rain grew heavier, drumming loudly against my umbrella. Each step toward the café felt unsteady, as if I were walking on cotton.

Warm golden light spilled over me as I pushed the door open. In the corner, a familiar figure sat stirring his coffee.

When he looked up, surprise flickered in his eyes. My nails dug into my palms, but I barely felt the sting.

"You've lost weight," he said.

The clink of his cup against the saucer was sharp. I stared at the trembling reflection in my coffee and heard myself say, "Let's break up."

Outside, the rain turned violent. A bolt of lightning split the sky. Before the thunder could follow, his spoon clattered to the floor.
###Chapter 49

The agent glanced at the property transaction records on her phone and sighed. "You bought the villa next to hers, yet you don't dare let her know?"

Daniel Sterling stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, his fingertips tracing the outline of Evelyn Sullivan's villa reflected in the glass.

"Not yet."

The agent scoffed. "Keep waiting, and she'll have kids old enough to run errands."

When Daniel first debuted, she had opposed his secret crush. But that rainy night, when the Sterling family's fleet parked outside the set, she finally understood the lineage behind this quiet newcomer.

"Pick me up at seven tomorrow."

The moment the villa's lights flickered on, Daniel's pupils contracted slightly. Every piece of furniture, every book, even the curtain colors—all perfectly mirrored Evelyn's tastes. Those out-of-print books had taken him three years to collect.

A sudden ringtone shattered the silence.

"Young Master, the patriarch is on his deathbed..."

Daniel's knuckles turned white.

"Let his devoted sons keep vigil."

The steward's voice trembled. "He wants to pass the Sterling family to—"

"Enough!" Daniel hurled his phone against the wall. The shattered screen still displayed the call log. Slowly, he knelt to pick up the crumpled book—its cover bearing the autograph of Evelyn's favorite author.

Evelyn paused mid-step as an icy chill greeted her in the living room.

"Decided to come home?" Ethan Sullivan's voice was glacial.

She headed straight for the stairs.

"Stop."

Evelyn turned to meet the storm brewing in Ethan's eyes.

"What does the mighty Mr. Sullivan want?"

"From today onward, you're forbidden from seeing Daniel Sterling."

A laugh escaped her. "On what grounds?"

Ethan rose abruptly, his shadow engulfing her. "On the grounds that I can erase him from the entertainment industry."

"You—" Her grip tightened on the banister.

"What? Getting worked up over an outsider?" He seized her wrist. "Or have you forgotten who your husband is?"

Evelyn tilted her head up, her gaze frosty. "The husband who brought his mistress to galas? The one who let her drug me? Or—" She yanked her hand free. "The husband now threatening me with power?"

###Chapter 50

"Isabella is not a homewrecker. There's nothing between us!" Ethan's voice burned with suppressed fury.

Evelyn curled her lips into a cold smile. "It doesn't matter anymore. You're free to be with whoever you want. And my affairs are none of your concern."

"You know exactly what Daniel Sterling feels for you!" Ethan grabbed her wrist. "Don't force me to ruin him."

"What about you and Isabella?" Evelyn wrenched her hand away. "At least Daniel and I are aboveboard!"

Ethan's gaze turned glacial. "So you truly don't care about his career."

Evelyn clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms. She could ignore Ethan's threats, but she wouldn't let Daniel suffer because of her.

"Fine." She lifted icy eyes to meet his. "But if Isabella dares to touch him, I won't hold back either."

"You wouldn't dare!" The air around Ethan dropped several degrees.

"Learned it from you." Evelyn turned on her heel, stilettoes clicking sharply against the marble floor.

The moment she reached her bedroom, her phone rang.

"Evelyn, I need to take tomorrow off." Sophia's voice sounded exhausted.

"What's wrong?" Evelyn frowned. "You never take days off."

"I'm suing Lily White." Sophia spat the name through gritted teeth. "She shredded Serendipity to pieces!"

Evelyn's pupils constricted. "She actually—"

"The gown is beyond repair." Sophia's voice cracked. "I'm so sorry. I failed to protect the gift you gave me."

"Don't say that." Evelyn softened her tone. "I'll send you the current market price right away. This time, she'll pay dearly."

After hanging up, Evelyn immediately dialed Vanessa Cruz.

"What's Serendipity's current market value?"

"At least ten million." Vanessa sounded surprised. "Why the sudden inquiry, boss?"

Evelyn tapped her fingers against the desk. "Send me the transaction records from the past three years."

Once she received the file, she swiftly texted Sophia: [Demand ten million in damages.]

Then she made another call. "Fabricate a transfer record for me. Ten million, recipient MY Fashion Group account."

The cold glow of her phone screen cast eerie shadows across her face, deepening the darkness in her eyes. Since Lily insisted on digging her own grave, Evelyn would gladly push her in.

Sirens pierced the night sky just as Lily stood before her mirror, fastening a new diamond necklace. The doorbell made her jump, sending the necklace clattering to the floor.

"Miss White, you're under arrest for willful destruction of property. Please come with us."

Lily's face drained of color. With trembling hands, she dialed Alexander King. "Alex... save me..."

###Chapter 51

Alexander King gripped the steering wheel, his face dark with anger outside the police station.

Beside him, Lily White sniffled. "Alex, I swear I didn't mean to—"

"Shut up!" He slammed his palm against the wheel. "Do you have any idea how serious this is?"

He pulled out his phone and dialed Sophia Reynolds.

The moment the call connected, he snapped, "Sophia, have you lost your damn mind?"

Her icy voice cut through. "Alexander, maybe get your facts straight before yelling at me."

"It's just a damn dress!"

"Ask your precious girlfriend what she did."

The line went dead. When he tried calling back, all he got was a busy tone.

Alexander turned to Lily, his gaze sharp. "Explain. Now."

She bit her lip, tears streaming. "I just... I couldn't take it anymore..."

As the story spilled out, his expression darkened further.

"Are you out of your goddamn mind?"

"I—" She clutched his sleeve. "I just love you too much..."

He yanked his arm free. "Go home."

At noon, Alexander called Ethan Sullivan.

"Ethan, I need a favor."

After listening, Ethan refused flatly. "Not my problem."

"Just this once!" Alexander pressed. "Just get Evelyn to meet me for dinner!"

A pause.

"Last time." Ethan's voice was cold. "Dump Lily. Now."

That evening, Evelyn's phone lit up.

Seeing the caller ID, she declined immediately.

After several ignored calls, the screen finally went dark.

As she stepped out of the office, a familiar black Maybach idled by the curb.

The window rolled down, revealing Ethan's sharp profile.

"Get in."

Evelyn stayed rooted. "Say what you need to say."

"Get in first."

Under curious stares from passersby, she reluctantly opened the door.

She sat as far from him as possible, pressed against her own window.

"Talk."

"Alexander wants to apologize over dinner."

Her laugh was bitter. "And you agreed?"

"Your choice."

"I'm not going."

Ethan turned. "They want to make amends for the dress incident."

"Sophia is the one who deserves the apology."

The air in the car turned to ice.

Then Ethan spoke again. "At the Jacksons', your father mentioned the Eastside Project."

###Chapter 52

Evelyn Sullivan whirled around, her gaze sharp as a blade.

"What exactly are you trying to say, Mr. Sullivan?"

Ethan Sullivan tapped the steering wheel with his long fingers, his voice icy. "Have dinner with me, and the Jackson family's deal is yours."

Evelyn suddenly laughed, though the smile never reached her eyes.

"Generous of you, Mr. Sullivan. A single meal in exchange for a business deal?"

She leaned forward slightly, her red lips curling in a mocking smirk.

"Plenty of people in the Jackson family would jump at the chance to please you. Why not ask them?"

Pushing the car door open, Evelyn strode away without a backward glance.

"Evelyn!" Ethan's voice chased after her. "If Sophia keeps making trouble, Alexander won’t let it go."

Evelyn halted mid-step, her nails digging into her palms.

"So?" She turned, fury blazing in her eyes. "Should the weak just roll over and take it?"

Ethan frowned. "Do you really want this to end in mutual destruction?"

She scoffed. "You’re on Alexander’s side—fine. But don’t expect me to back down."

"Alexander is willing to compensate, and Lily has agreed to apologize. What more do you want?"

That dress had taken countless sleepless nights to design.

Every stitch, every thread had carried her blessings for Sophia.

"If it were Isabella’s dress that got ruined, would you still be this calm?"

Ethan’s silence cut deeper than any blade.

"Of course. In your eyes, I’ll never measure up to her." Her voice trembled. "Just because I loved you once, I deserve to be trampled on?"

The words "loved you" made Ethan’s eyes darken instantly.

"What will it take for you to stop this?"

Evelyn looked at him and suddenly felt exhausted.

"Ask Sophia."

She walked away, her back unyielding.

That night, Evelyn returned directly to Northville Villa.

Without Ethan around, even the air felt fresher.

A week later, Sophia showed up at her door.

"Evelyn, Alexander sent someone to negotiate."

Evelyn handed her a cup of tea. "What do you think?"

"Honestly... I just want an apology." Sophia twisted her fingers together.

"Then do what feels right." Evelyn took a sip. "But make sure she remembers the lesson."

Sophia’s eyes lit up. "I want her to apologize publicly on the Times Square LED screen!"

"Not a bad idea."

Sophia suddenly hugged her. "I’m sorry... It’s all my fault for losing Serendipity..."

Evelyn patted her back. "Out with the old, in with the new. Make her pay for it."

"You’re the best, Evelyn!"

Meanwhile, a loud crash echoed through the King family mansion.

"What?! A public apology in Times Square?!" Lily White shattered the last vase, her perfectly made-up face contorted with rage.

###Chapter 53

Lily White clenched her fists, her nails digging deep into her palms.

She stared at her perfectly made-up reflection in the mirror, but the face staring back looked twisted and grotesque.

"That bitch Sophia!" She violently swept all the cosmetics off the vanity.

Her manager stood nearby, expression grim.

"Lily, Mr. King has made it clear. You must attend this public apology today."

Lily's chest heaved violently. No amount of makeup could conceal the hatred burning in her eyes.

"Why should I apologize to that kind of woman?!"

Her manager sighed. "You offended the wrong person."

——

Isabella Jackson was getting a manicure when she received the news.

After listening to her assistant's report, her red lips curled into a cold smirk.

"Idiot."

Making such a scene over a dress had disgraced the entire socialite circle.

She elegantly blew on her freshly painted nails, not even bothering to make a consoling phone call.

——

The apology venue was packed with reporters.

Lily stood under the blinding camera flashes, her voice trembling.

"I sincerely apologize for my previous inappropriate remarks toward Miss Sophia Reynolds..."

Mid-sentence, her voice suddenly cracked.

The relentless camera flashes captured every moment of her humiliation.

No one knew those weren't tears of remorse—they were scalding drops of pure, seething resentment.

——

The video quickly went viral.

Though the King family swiftly suppressed the trending topic, everyone who mattered in their circle had already seen it.

Lily locked herself in her villa, smashing everything breakable in sight.

——

Meanwhile, Sophia received a bank notification.

Twenty million.

She stared at the number on the screen, a faint smile tugging at her lips.

"Evelyn, this money..."

Evelyn Sullivan didn't look up from the files she was flipping through. "Keep it."

"Then let me treat you to dinner. We can invite Daniel too."

At the mention of that name, Evelyn's fingers paused almost imperceptibly.

"You two go ahead."

Sophia immediately sensed something was off. "Did you two have a fight?"

"No." Evelyn closed the file. "I just have some personal matters to deal with lately."

Her tone made it clear she didn't want to discuss it further. Sophia tactfully dropped the subject.

——

The office had just regained its quiet when a phone ring shattered the silence.

Seeing the caller ID, Evelyn's cold, stern features instantly softened.

"Grandma..."

The vigorous voice of Mrs. Sullivan boomed through the receiver.

"You brat! Have you forgotten your grandmother exists?!"

Evelyn chuckled. "Of course not. It's just that recently—"

"No excuses! You're coming home for dinner tonight! I've already made your favorite sweet and sour ribs!"

The line went dead before Evelyn could respond.

Shaking her head in amusement, warmth flickered in her eyes.

——

Night fell.

A black sedan slowly ascended the winding road to Harmony Manor.

As Evelyn stepped out of the car, she spotted a familiar figure.

Ethan Sullivan stood beneath the corridor, casually scattering fish food with his slender fingers.

Moonlight outlined his perfect profile and illuminated the invisible rift between them.

This was their first meeting since their last unpleasant parting.

###Chapter 54

Ethan Sullivan rarely wore casual clothes, but today he had chosen a dark gray ensemble. Though it softened his usual sharp edges, an unapproachable aloofness still clung to him.

Evelyn Sullivan's gaze briefly met his before she calmly looked away.

"Young Madam is here!" Mrs. Zade greeted her warmly, her wrinkled eyes brimming with joy. The elderly woman, who had spent most of her life serving the Sullivan family, was practically a sister to the matriarch.

"Mrs. Zade, these are your favorite osmanthus cakes." Evelyn handed her an elegant pastry box. "And Cloud Slice Cake for Grandma."

"The old lady has been talking about them for days!" Mrs. Zade took the box, her smile widening. "I'll prepare tea right away."

In the living room, the elderly Mrs. Sullivan was directing the maids. "Put the watermelon candies here—Evelyn loves these..."

"Grandma." Evelyn couldn't help but laugh. "Are you trying to fatten me up?"

Mrs. Sullivan turned in delight and grasped her hands. "My dear Evelyn! If you can't finish them, take some home."

As they sat, the old woman frowned. "You've lost weight again. Ethan said you started working? If it's too much, quit! Let him take care of you."

"It's not tiring." Evelyn gently patted her hand. "Staying idle at home isn't for me."

Mrs. Sullivan hesitated, then sighed. "Don't push yourself too hard."

The air suddenly grew tense. Ethan stood at the entrance, his long legs outlined by black trousers, his presence as sharp as an unsheathed blade.

"Ethan," the old lady signaled with her eyes, "check if the juice is ready."

Once he left, she lowered her voice. "Tell me the truth—has that boy been mistreating you?"

Evelyn's fingers stilled briefly before she smiled. "Nothing like that."

"If he dares to—"

"You spoil me too much, Grandma." Evelyn leaned against her shoulder playfully.

When Ethan returned with the juice, the old lady deliberately said, "Report to your wife!"

"Don't trouble yourself, Mr. Sullivan." Evelyn didn't look up, her tone as calm as discussing the weather.

Ethan's eyes darkened as he turned away, leaving a chill in his wake.

Only after his footsteps faded did Mrs. Sullivan suddenly clasp Evelyn's hands. "Evelyn, dear... when are you two planning for children?"

###Chapter 55

Evelyn Sullivan nearly choked on her orange juice.

She hastily set down the glass, her throat burning.

"Grandma, we're not planning for children yet."

Grandma Sullivan sighed, her wrinkled hand covering Evelyn's.

"Isabella's back. I don't want you getting hurt. A child might make Ethan settle down."

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly, but she forced a faint smile.

"Using a baby to tie a man down? That would be pathetic."

"Silly girl, you saved Ethan's life and healed his leg. To me, you're the only one worthy of being his wife!"

Meeting the old woman's determined gaze, Evelyn suddenly turned serious.

"Grandma, if one day... Ethan and I divorce, would you understand?"

The teacup slipped from Grandma Sullivan's grasp, clattering onto the table.

"Did he hurt you?!"

"No. I just wanted to prepare you."

The dining room fell into icy silence.

Grandma Sullivan remained wordless throughout dinner, only shooting dagger-like glares at Ethan.

Before leaving, she dragged him into the garden.

"Betray Evelyn, and you'll lose your shares in Sullivan Group!"

Ethan's eyes turned glacial.

"You're overthinking, Grandmother."

Evelyn waited by the car, noticing the cold aura around Ethan when he returned.

She pretended not to notice, smiling at Grandma Sullivan.

"Take care, Grandma. I'll visit again soon."

"If this brat dares mistreat you, tell me immediately!"

The night breeze lifted Evelyn's hair as she nodded and got into the car.

The black sports car sped away without a backward glance.

Grandma Sullivan snorted and stormed inside.

Ethan stood rooted, his expression darkening.

At the mountain's base, a Maybach screeched to a halt, blocking the sports car.

Ethan strode forward, each step radiating dominance.

Evelyn rolled down her window, her profile cool under the moonlight.

"Yes?"

His Adam's apple bobbed.

"We need to talk."
###Chapter 56

Evelyn Sullivan pulled open the car door with an impassive expression, only to have it blocked by a hand with distinct knuckles.

"We need to talk." Ethan Sullivan's voice was low.

"Unnecessary." She didn’t even bother to look at him.

His Adam's apple bobbed. "I went too far last time."

Her fingers stilled. She hadn’t expected an apology from him. When she lifted her gaze, she met eyes so deep they seemed bottomless.

"Apology accepted." She turned to leave. "Now move."

Ethan suddenly gripped her wrist. "You're still angry."

"Don’t flatter yourself." She yanked her hand free. "My feelings are none of your concern."

The screech of tires pierced the air as her red sports car sped away.

For the next two weeks, tabloids were filled with photos of the Sullivan Group CEO attending events with the rising designer Isabella Jackson. Evelyn flipped past them without a second glance, as if they were strangers.

At ten o'clock one night, the doorbell of her villa rang abruptly.

Peering through the peephole, Evelyn saw Ethan standing outside. Her fingers tightened around the hem of her nightgown. When she opened the door, the pungent scent of alcohol hit her.

"You're drunk?" She frowned.

Ethan braced one hand against the doorframe, his tie loose. "Do you remember what today is?"

Only then did it dawn on her—their third wedding anniversary. She scoffed. "Finally remembered you have a wife?"

"I brought you a gift." He stepped closer without warning.

Evelyn retreated. "I don’t want—"

Before she could finish, his scorching lips crashed onto hers. She bit down hard, drawing blood. The metallic taste spread between them.

"Psycho!" She wiped her mouth furiously.

Ethan only chuckled as he fastened a diamond necklace around her throat. "Happy anniversary, Mrs. Sullivan." The cold metal touched her skin, and she jerked back, but he seized her wrist.

"Try taking it off." His eyes darkened dangerously. "I won’t hesitate to kiss you again."

Trembling with rage, she demanded, "What do you want?"

His long fingers brushed her cheek. "Three months. How much longer will you keep this up?"

"Keep this up?" She shoved him away. "Ethan, you’ll never understand respect."

Under the moonlight, the pendant glinted coldly—mirroring the ice in her gaze.

###Chapter 57

"Evelyn Sullivan, you're coming with me tonight!"

Ethan Sullivan's voice was icy. He'd been avoiding her deliberately to give her space. Yet she had the audacity to do this behind his back.

Evelyn scoffed, her gaze dismissive. "You overestimate yourself, Mr. Sullivan."

She turned to shut the door, but Ethan seized her wrist.

"You don't have a choice."

He dragged her out, only to feel a sharp pain at the back of his neck. Darkness swallowed his vision as he collapsed.

Evelyn coldly watched the unconscious man and dialed Colin Keller's number. She yanked off her necklace and hurled it onto Ethan's chest.

"Tell Mr. Sullivan I don't want his trinkets."

Half an hour later, Colin rushed over. As he helped Ethan up, he spotted the priceless diamond necklace lying discarded on the floor.

Ethan woke in the car.

"What happened?" He rubbed his sore neck, his expression dark.

Colin hesitated. "Sir, Ms. Sullivan... knocked you out."

The air froze.

Ethan's face turned stormy. But when Colin handed him the necklace, his pupils constricted.

"Throw it away."

Colin quietly pocketed the necklace. It was a one-of-a-kind anniversary gift Ethan had designed himself.

Back at the villa, Ethan stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, his knuckles white. His own wife had knocked him out—absurd!

His phone buzzed.

Lucas Laurier's voice was tentative. "Ethan, Alexander wants to invite you to the new Lakeside Resort..."

"Not interested."

"Evelyn will be there."

Ethan's eyes sharpened. "That's irrelevant!"

He slammed the phone down.

Lucas sighed at Alexander. "We'll need to ask Mrs. Sullivan for help."

In the corner, Lily White clenched her phone. She quickly texted Isabella Jackson: "Your precious sister is after Alexander again."

Isabella replied instantly: "Don't worry. Her time is running out."

The screen's glow illuminated Lily's twisted smile.

###Chapter 58

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains when Evelyn Sullivan's phone rang abruptly.

"Sweetheart, are you free this weekend?" Grandma Sullivan's voice brimmed with barely contained excitement. "My old friend invited me to the new Lakeside Resort. They have an equestrian center and an amusement park. Will you come with me?"

Evelyn rubbed her sleepy eyes, her fingers absently tracing the edge of her phone. She hadn't planned to go out, but hearing the hopeful tone in the old woman's voice, her refusal dissolved on her tongue.

"Alright, I'll go with you."

Grandma Sullivan's delighted laughter echoed through the line. "I'll pick you up Saturday morning! Oh, and Ethan is coming too."

Evelyn's grip on the phone tightened. She should have known—this was another one of Grandma's matchmaking schemes.

"Grandma, I don't live at Grand View anymore," she said softly. "I'm in Northville now."

Silence stretched for several seconds.

"You're separated?!" Grandma Sullivan's voice shot up an octave. "Is it because of that Isabella girl?"

Evelyn lowered her gaze to the floral pattern on her sheets. "This is between us. Please don't worry about it."

"How can I not worry?" The old woman sounded frantic. "Just wait—I'm calling that ungrateful grandson of mine right now!"

"Grandma—"

The call ended abruptly. When Evelyn tried calling back, the line was busy.

She sighed and got up to wash her face. The woman in the mirror had faint shadows under her eyes. She touched her own cheek, suddenly feeling like a stranger.

Her phone lit up with a barrage of texts from Ethan.

[Did you complain to Grandma again?]
[Isabella has suffered enough. Must you turn Grandma against her too?]
[What do you even want?]

Evelyn swiped away the notifications without expression. Each accusation was like a dull knife, slicing into her already numb heart.

On Saturday morning, just as Evelyn finished packing, tires screeched outside.

She opened the door and was met with Ethan's cold profile.

"Get in," he said without looking at her.

Clutching her bag strap, Evelyn headed straight for the backseat. But as she pulled the door open, Grandma Sullivan's voice stopped her.

"Sweetheart, my friend will be sitting in the back. You take the front."

Evelyn froze, her nails digging into her palm.

The passenger door slammed shut behind her. Ethan suddenly leaned over, his crisp cedar scent enveloping her.

"Don't touch me!" She jerked back, her head hitting the window.

His eyes darkened as he yanked the seatbelt across her and buckled it. "As if I wanted to."

The air in the car turned suffocating. Grandma Sullivan kept trying to make conversation from the backseat, but only received clipped responses from both of them.

When the Lakeside Resort sign came into view, Evelyn realized—there had never been any old friend.

This had been a carefully orchestrated trap from the start.

###Chapter 59

Evelyn Sullivan saw right through Grandma Sullivan's intentions.

This carefully orchestrated getaway was doomed to disappoint.

Her marriage to Ethan Sullivan resembled a termite-infested cabin—deceptively pristine on the surface, rotten to the core.

She'd once tried mending the cracks until splinters drew blood.

Some fractures could never be repaired.

The shuttle halted at Lakeside Resort's entrance.

The King family's billion-dollar playground sprawled across acres, boasting luxury hotels, elite conference centers, and entertainment venues—the crown jewel of Rongcheng.

"Finally!" Grandma King beamed, crow's feet crinkling as she embraced her old friend.

Grandma Sullivan patted her hand. "Traffic delayed us. Ethan, bring Evelyn over."

"Hello, Grandma King."

The matriarch's gaze flickered between them. "Your suites are ready. You youngsters enjoy yourselves—we old ladies have gardens to tour."

The receptionist flashed a polished smile. "Mr. Sullivan, your presidential suite is on the 28th floor."

Evelyn slid her ID across the counter. "I'd like a separate room."

Ethan seized her wrist. "What will people say if married couples sleep apart?"

"Let go." Her voice turned glacial. "Unless you want a scene."

He snatched her ID and tossed it back. "One keycard."

The elevator doors parted.

Ethan suddenly hoisted her off her feet.

Her nails dug into his shoulders as she gasped. "Have you lost your mind?!"

His breath scorched her ear. "Should've obeyed earlier."

"Disgusting!"

"Takes one to know one."

Floor numbers blinked overhead.

She squirmed. "Put me down. Now."

The doors slid open.

Their unexpected audience turned ashen.

###Chapter 60

"Ethan..."

Isabella Jackson stood frozen at the end of the hallway, her purse slipping from her fingers and hitting the floor with a dull thud. Her eyes widened as she watched Ethan Sullivan sweep Evelyn Sullivan into his arms—an intimate gesture that felt like a knife twisting in her chest.

Her nails dug into her palms, but she barely registered the pain. She had begged for his affection before, only to be met with a detached "Don't be childish." Now, he was holding her willingly.

Ethan turned sharply at the sound of her voice, instinctively loosening his grip. Evelyn stumbled slightly as she regained her footing, a cold smirk curling her lips.

"Seems I interrupted something."

Without another glance, she stepped into the elevator, pressing the close button under Ethan’s darkening glare. Only as the doors slid shut did she remember—her room key was still with him.

"Twentieth floor," she muttered, deciding to kill time in the restaurant.

The dining area was softly lit, the air laced with a faint hint of lavender. She had just taken a seat when a familiar voice called her name.

"Evelyn?"

Daniel Sterling stood beside her table in a tailored blazer, surprise brightening his eyes. He pulled out the chair across from her, fingers tapping absently against the tabletop.

"Shooting a new film?" Evelyn handed him a menu.

"Yeah, one-week location shoot." He took it, his fingertips brushing hers before he jerked back as if burned. "So... that dinner you promised me. Still on?"

Noticing the flush creeping up his ears, Evelyn recalled Ethan’s earlier words. She withdrew her hand smoothly. "Of course. Order whatever you like."

After placing their orders, Daniel hesitated. "You're... here alone?"

"With Ethan."

The air between them turned brittle. Daniel’s grip tightened around his water glass, knuckles whitening. "You two are...?"

"Just a marriage of convenience." Her tone was light, dismissive.

Daniel’s head snapped up, a flicker of hope in his gaze. "If you need a divorce lawyer—"

"My personal affairs are none of your concern."

Ethan’s voice cut through like ice. He stood behind them, his suit jacket draped over one arm, tie slightly loosened. His sharp gaze bore into Daniel, the unspoken challenge clear.

The two men locked eyes, tension crackling between them. Evelyn lifted her glass, taking a slow sip as the silent battle raged.

###Chapter 61

Evelyn Sullivan lifted her gaze, her eyes icy as frost, piercing straight into Ethan Sullivan.

Ethan's chest burned with fury. He'd only stepped away for a moment, and she'd already rushed to have dinner with another man. If he'd been any later, she might as well have handed him the divorce papers herself.

He strode to Evelyn's side and sat down, his sharp glare landing on Daniel Sterling across the table.

Daniel met his gaze calmly, a faint smile on his lips. "Mr. Sullivan, Evelyn's concerns are mine. I'll always be here when she needs me."

"How generous of you, Mr. Sterling," Ethan sneered. "But I suggest you mind your own business and focus on your acting."

"My acting skills are none of your concern."

The tension between them crackled in the air like live wires.

Evelyn frowned, her voice cold. "Ethan, if you're here to cause trouble, you can leave now."

Those words ignited Ethan's rage. "Evelyn!" he ground out. "This pretty boy is the one stirring the pot, and you're blaming me?"

"First, Daniel is my friend. Show some respect." Her gaze was razor-sharp. "Second, our relationship doesn't need anyone else to ruin it. You know exactly why it's broken."

Ethan let out a humorless laugh and yanked Evelyn up, dragging her toward the exit.

Daniel suddenly caught her other wrist. "Mr. Sullivan, didn't you see Evelyn almost fall?" His eyes blazed with anger. This was the man she'd given up everything for? If she were with him, he'd never let her suffer like this.

Ethan turned, his gaze like a blade on Daniel's grip. His voice was glacial. "Let go. Unless you want to lose that hand."

Daniel didn't back down. "You should be the one letting go."

Their standoff drew stares from the other diners.

A vein throbbed at Evelyn's temple. All she'd wanted was a quiet meal, and now this. She wrenched free from both men and strode toward the elevator without looking back.

Ethan caught up to her in seconds. "Evelyn, it seems you really don't learn." He pulled out his phone and dialed Colin Keller. "Look into Daniel Sterling's recent film contracts. Immediately—"

Before he could finish, Evelyn snatched the phone from his hand.

"Ethan," she said coldly, "is threatening people all you know how to do?"

"You think this will protect him?" Ethan's eyes darkened dangerously. "Unless you plan to shadow my every move, I have plenty of ways to erase him from the industry."

Before she could retort, Daniel's icy voice came from behind her. "Evelyn, don't worry. I'd like to see just how far Mr. Sullivan's power reaches."

She turned and lowered her voice. "This is my problem. I won't drag you into it." Daniel had worked too hard to get where he was. She couldn't let him suffer for her sake.

Daniel gave her a gentle smile. "I'm not afraid. No matter how powerful Mr. Sullivan is, he can't control the entire world."

Ethan scoffed. "We'll see about that."

###Chapter 62

Evelyn's brows furrowed as she looked at Daniel. "Daniel Sterling, thank you for helping me. But please stay out of this."

Daniel's face paled instantly, as if he'd been slapped. His lips parted, but no words came out.

The elevator doors slid shut, cutting off his lonely figure.

"Quite the performance," Ethan's voice was icy. "In such a hurry to push him away—afraid I'll hurt him?"

Evelyn didn't even glance at him. "None of your business."

"Say that again."

Ethan's patience had worn thin. The cold war between them had pushed him to the edge, and Evelyn's indifference only fueled his anger.

"What do you want?"

"Come back," Ethan stepped closer. "I can pretend none of this ever happened."

Evelyn lowered her lashes, silent for a moment. "There's no way forward except divorce."

"Evelyn!" He grabbed her wrist. "It's over between me and Isabella!"

"This isn't about her." She pulled free. "I just want this marriage to end."

"Never."

"Then we live separate lives." She met his gaze, her eyes hollow. "No interference."

Ethan's pupils constricted. "Separate lives?"

"Yes. If you can accept that, I won't mention divorce again."

The air in the elevator turned suffocating. Ethan stared at her, dark currents swirling in his eyes.

Ding—

The door was kicked open violently. Before Evelyn could react, she was thrown onto the bed.

Ethan pinned her down, undoing her buttons with one hand. "Want to play? I'll give you a game you won't forget."

"Let go!" She gripped his wrist. "I have no interest in you."

"But I'm not done with you yet." His lips curled into a cold smirk. "When I'm bored, I'll let you go."

"Disgusting." She turned her face away. "You make me sick."

"Sick?" He gripped her chin. "That's not what you said at the hotel."

"That was the drugs talking." Her laugh was mocking. "Any man would've had the same effect."

"Evelyn!"

"What, do I need pills every time just to endure you?"

Rage burned in Ethan's eyes. Evelyn seized the moment to shove him off, straightening her crumpled collar.

"If you need someone, go find Isabella." Her voice was frigid. "You two know the drill."

"I told you, there's nothing between us!"

"Whatever you say." Evelyn strode to the bathroom without looking back, slamming the door shut.

###Chapter 63

Ethan Sullivan stared at Evelyn Sullivan's impassive face, his chest tight as if stuffed with cotton. Never had he felt so powerless—no words or actions could elicit even the slightest reaction from her.

The frustration made him yank his tie loose with irritation.

He stood abruptly and slammed the door behind him.

Evelyn didn’t even glance up. She finished applying sunscreen at a leisurely pace, then grabbed her bag and left.

The resort’s sunlight was perfect. She had no interest in playing Ethan’s cold war games.

The equestrian center’s sign gleamed under the sun.

Evelyn’s eyes lit up. It had been three years since she last rode, and her fingers itched with anticipation. The promise of this very stable was why she’d agreed to come to the resort with the Sullivan matriarch.

"What can I get for you, Miss Sullivan?" A staff member greeted her warmly.

"Full gear." She pointed to the display case. "That burgundy set."

After changing into her riding boots, Evelyn followed the instructor to the stables. The trainer led out a docile pony, but her gaze locked onto the chestnut stallion in the far stall.

"I want that one."

A derisive laugh sounded behind her.

"Some people have a death wish."

Evelyn turned to see Ethan standing with Alexander King and their group. Lily White clung to Isabella Jackson’s arm, her face alight with schadenfreude.

Alexander frowned. "Lily!"

"Am I wrong?" Lily lifted her chin. "That horse kicked two trainers last week."

Isabella added softly, "Safety first, sister."

Evelyn ignored them and spoke to the instructor. "That one. It’s too noisy here."

Lily’s face flushed with anger. Isabella squeezed her hand and whispered, "Let’s see her break her neck."

Lucas Laurier nudged Ethan. "Aren’t you going to stop her?"

Ethan’s expression remained icy as he watched Evelyn’s retreating figure. "She’s choosing her own fate."

Ryan Paisley stepped forward. "Ethan, that horse—"

"Not my problem." Ethan turned and strode away, his polished shoes crunching harshly against the gravel.

###Chapter 64

A flicker of anger flashed in Ryan Paisley's eyes before vanishing just as quickly.

"Ethan, this isn't the time for pride. If something happens to Evelyn, you'll regret it!"

Ethan Sullivan shot him a cold glance. "If you're so concerned, go stop her yourself."

After a brief hesitation, Ryan strode forward.

The instructor was explaining safety precautions to Evelyn while holding the horse's reins. Sensing someone approach, Evelyn turned and met Ryan's worried gaze.

"Miss Sullivan, this horse is too spirited for a beginner."

The corner of Evelyn's lips lifted. "Thank you for your concern, Mr. Paisley. But my decision is made."

Ryan frowned. "Even if you're upset with Ethan, don't gamble with your safety."

"You worry too much," she said lightly. "He's not worth that much to me."

Before he could respond, she swung onto the horse with effortless grace. The deep red riding habit accentuated her slender waist, her ponytail swaying in the wind—radiant and fearless.

Ryan's breath hitched. He quickly lowered his gaze to hide his awe. When he looked up again, Evelyn was already galloping toward the heart of the equestrian center.

Ethan's eyes tracked the retreating figure in red. He'd never seen Evelyn like this—confident, bold, like a blazing flame.

In his memories, she had always been gentle and obedient, clinging to him like ivy. This unfamiliar version of her stirred something foreign in his chest.

Nearby, Isabella Jackson dug her nails into her palms, though her smile remained sweet. "Lily, shall we go riding too?"

Lily White caught her meaning and nodded. "Perfect. A little exercise would be nice."

They soon changed into riding gear and selected docile horses while the others lingered in the lounge.

Alexander King approached Ethan with sincere remorse. "Ethan, I was foolish before—"

Ethan cut him off coldly. "Keep your girlfriend away from Evelyn."

Alexander and Lucas Laurier exchanged startled glances—was Ethan actually protecting his ex-wife?

The sound of hooves echoed in the distance as Evelyn reappeared, galloping toward them on the spirited stallion, her hair whipping behind her like a living painting.

Unconsciously, Ethan rose to his feet, his gaze locked onto her.

Then, chaos erupted—Isabella and Lily's horses suddenly bolted, charging straight toward Evelyn!

###Chapter 65

Lucas Laurier and Alexander King stood by the edge of the equestrian center, their gazes complicated as they watched the distance. Having seen Isabella Jackson grow up, they had long believed she was the most suitable match for Ethan Sullivan.

"Ethan," Alexander hesitated before speaking, "Isabella's back. What are you going to do about your relationship with Evelyn?"

Ethan's eyes turned icy in an instant.

"Her return has nothing to do with me."

Alexander pressed on, unwilling to let it go. "But everyone knows you two used to—"

"Enough." Ethan's voice was sharp as frost. "Leave the past in the past."

Lucas quickly intervened. "Ethan, Alexander's just concerned about you. After all, Evelyn is—"

"She's fine," Ethan cut him off. "Mind your own business."

The atmosphere froze instantly.

Alexander opened his mouth but ultimately didn't dare say another word.

Meanwhile, on the field.

Isabella and Lily White had Evelyn Sullivan cornered from both sides.

"Sister," Isabella smiled sweetly, "your horse seems a bit unruly."

Without warning, Lily raised her whip and lashed it toward Evelyn's horse.

The startled animal bolted forward.

Evelyn swiftly tightened the reins, regaining control. She turned her head coldly, watching as the two rode after her with malicious grins.

"You're asking for trouble."

Evelyn deliberately steered her horse toward a secluded area.

When the three came to a stop in the corner, Lily was the first to strike.

"Evelyn Sullivan, it's time to settle our last score!"

Isabella pretended to mediate. "Lily, I'm sure my sister didn't mean it. Evelyn, just apologize to her."

Evelyn scoffed. "What a lovely little act you two have."

Lily's face twisted in anger as she raised her whip again, aiming for Evelyn's face.

The whip sliced through the air with a sharp whistle.

A glint of satisfaction flashed in Isabella's eyes before she feigned shock, covering her mouth.

Just as the whip was about to land—

Evelyn dodged effortlessly. Lily only felt a sharp pain in her wrist before she was sent crashing to the ground.

Amid the rising dust, Evelyn looked down at them with eyes colder than ice.

###Chapter 66

"Ah!"

Lily White tumbled from her horse with a piercing shriek.

She curled on the ground, face drained of color, sweat-drenched strands clinging to her forehead.

"Isabella... my back..." Her trembling hand reached out, voice quivering with tears. "It hurts... I can't move..."

Isabella Jackson swiftly dismounted but halted abruptly when approaching Lily.

She turned to Evelyn Sullivan, a calculating glint flashing in her eyes.

"Evelyn, Lily only said a few angry words. How could you do this to her?"

Evelyn idly tapped her riding crop against her palm.

"She asked for it."

"You!" Isabella's face darkened with rage. "Lily is Alexander's girlfriend. Aren't you afraid Ethan will blame you?"

Evelyn's lips curled into a frosty smile.

"What is he to me?"

"You—"

"Call a doctor," Evelyn glanced at Lily writhing in pain, "or she might end up paralyzed."

Isabella paled, feeling Lily's venomous glare. She fumbled for her phone.

"This isn't over, Evelyn!"

Evelyn ignored her, turning her horse to leave.

As she raised her crop, a glint of silver flashed from Isabella's sleeve.

"Neigh—"

The horse reared violently with a pained cry.

Evelyn barely avoided being thrown off, knuckles whitening around the reins.

The stallion went berserk, charging wildly across the field.

"Stop it!" Staff members shouted from the sidelines.

Evelyn crouched low, thighs gripping the horse's flanks.

The beast smashed through multiple barriers in its rampage.

Nearby, Alexander King received a call, expression darkening.

"Evelyn threw Lily off her horse?"

He arrived with his entourage just as Evelyn struggled to control the frenzied stallion.

"Serves her right," Alexander muttered.

Ethan Sullivan observed silently, lips pressed into a thin line.

Evelyn finally guided the horse back to the stable. Blood streaked her palms from the reins' brutal friction.

Inspecting the stallion's flank, she discovered a tiny silver needle embedded in its flesh.

"Explain."

Ethan's voice cut through the air like ice.

Evelyn didn't turn. "None of your business."
Twilight deepened as city lights began to glow.

I stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, gazing at the glittering skyline. My reflection in the glass revealed tired eyes shadowed with unspoken worry.

My phone lit up with a message from Sean Reynolds: "Meet me at the usual place. Eight o'clock."

My finger hovered over the screen before typing a single word in reply: "Okay."

At 7:45, I pushed open the café door. Sean was already waiting in our usual corner, dressed in a charcoal-gray suit with his tie slightly loosened. His long fingers tapped rhythmically against the table.

"You're here," he said, lifting his gaze. His dark eyes were unreadable.

I took my seat just as the server arrived with a steaming latte—he still remembered my order.

"I heard you've been looking into the South District case," Sean cut straight to the point.

My pulse jumped. The coffee cup burned against my palm. "How did you know?"

The corner of his mouth lifted as he slid a file from his briefcase toward me. "Because I'm investigating it too."

The words "South District Development Land Bid Case" were stamped across the cover. I flipped it open—and froze. The Jackson Group's official seal glared back at me.

"This can't be..." My voice shook.

Sean leaned in, lowering his voice. "The evidence is solid. The Jackson Group secured that land through illegal means. And your father—"

"Stop!" I slammed the file shut, my chest heaving.

The café lights suddenly felt too bright. The surrounding chatter faded into white noise. All I could hear was the frantic pounding of my own heartbeat—and Sean's next words, sharp as thunder:

"Your father is the mastermind behind this."
###Chapter 67

Ethan Sullivan clamped his hand around her wrist with bone-crushing force.

"Evelyn Sullivan, do you realize how dangerous it was when Lily White fell? A stampede could've happened at any moment in the Equestrian Center!"

Evelyn coldly wrenched her arm free.

"Dangerous? Isn't that exactly what you wanted?"

Ethan's eyes darkened. "What are you implying?"

"Exactly what I said." She turned to leave. "Move."

He grabbed her again. "You're coming with me to apologize."

"Dream on."

Her gaze suddenly locked onto the horse's hindquarters. Her pupils constricted.

Ethan dragged her toward the lounge without another word. Evelyn struggled but couldn't break free.

Alexander King cradled a trembling Lily in his arms as the doctor finished the preliminary exam.

"Mr. King, Ms. White has a fractured right leg. She needs immediate hospitalization."

Lily sobbed pitifully. "Alex, will I ever walk again?"

Alexander's expression was stormy, but his voice softened. "Don't worry. I'll get you the best specialists."

Isabella Jackson stood nearby. Seeing Evelyn unharmed, she dug her nails into her palms.

Why didn't that bitch die?

"Alex, this is all my fault..." Isabella's eyes welled with tears. "If only I hadn't suggested horseback riding..."

Alexander's glare sliced toward Evelyn. "This wasn't your doing. Someone here is clearly malicious."

Lily spotted Evelyn and shrieked. "Get her out! Make her leave!"

Isabella hurried to soothe her. "Lily, I'm sure Evelyn came to apologize—"

"Apologize?" Lily let out a hysterical laugh. "I want her to pay with her life!"

Ethan stepped forward. "I'll cover all medical expenses and subsequent treatments—"

"Save it." Alexander cut him off coldly. "Ethan, this isn't over."

Evelyn suddenly chuckled. "Medical expenses? When did I say I'd apologize?"

Alexander shot to his feet. "Evelyn Sullivan!"

Ethan gripped her shoulder. "Last warning. Apologize."

Evelyn met his gaze squarely. "Ethan Sullivan, you disgust me."

The lounge fell dead silent.

Alexander laughed in fury. "Perfect. Just perfect. Ethan, don't blame me for what happens next."

Evelyn adjusted her sleeve with deliberate nonchalance. "Want revenge? Be my guest."

"Evelyn!" Ethan roared. "Are you trying to get yourself killed?"

She leaned close, whispering words only he could hear. "Guess what I found on that horse's hindquarters?"

Ethan went rigid.

###Chapter 68

Evelyn Sullivan leaned against the doorframe, her fingers lightly tapping the wall as she swept a cold glance over Ethan Sullivan.

"I'm quite curious to see how you won't let me off the hook."

The air froze instantly.

A biting chill radiated from Ethan. Ryan Paisley immediately stepped forward.

"Ethan, we haven't investigated the matter fully yet."

Alexander King cradled Lily White in his arms and sneered.

"What's there to investigate? Lily has a broken bone!"

Evelyn suddenly let out a soft laugh.

Alexander's expression darkened. "What's so funny?"

"I'm laughing at how blind Sophia Reynolds was back then." She leisurely adjusted her cuff. "To have fallen for trash like you."

Ethan's pupils contracted.

The words were a double-edged sword, striking both men at once.

Lily spoke weakly, "Miss Sullivan, I know Sophia resents—"

"Are you worthy?" Evelyn cut her off. "Sophia wants nothing more than to stay far away from you two cheating scumbags."

"Evelyn Sullivan!"

Ethan's voice was sharp.

"Apologize."

Evelyn turned to leave.

Alexander abruptly set Lily down and blocked her path.

"Either apologize, or I'll break your leg too!"

Ethan watched coldly while Isabella Jackson hid a smirk.

Evelyn lowered her head with a faint laugh.

"I choose the third option."

Before the words fully left her mouth, Alexander lunged at her.

The next second, his tall frame crashed heavily onto the floor.

Silence fell over the room.

Ethan narrowed his eyes, his gaze sharp as a blade.

That shoulder throw was too professional.

Evelyn looked down at Alexander on the ground, her red lips parting slightly.

"I told you—you can't stop me."

As she turned, a staff member rushed over.

"Mr. King, we've retrieved the surveillance footage!"

Lily and Isabella stiffened simultaneously.

Surveillance?

They exchanged panicked glances.

Lily suddenly reached out.

"Give me the recording!"

###Chapter 69

Lily White's fingers trembled slightly as she stared at the tablet in the staff member's hands. With that footage, she could erase the evidence without anyone knowing.

"Miss White seems to have trouble with her hands. Let me help." Ryan Paisley suddenly reached out and took the tablet, his tone eerily calm.

Isabella Jackson quietly picked up a water glass from the table, pretending she might accidentally spill it on the device—until she met Ryan's sharp gaze. Her hand jerked, and the glass shattered on the floor.

"Miss Jackson, your hands are shaking quite badly," Ryan remarked with a faint smirk.

"The water was too hot," Isabella forced out, avoiding his eyes.

"Best not to touch things that burn you."

Ryan fast-forwarded through the surveillance footage at sixteen times the speed. After watching, he tossed the tablet to Ethan Sullivan with a cold laugh. "Alexander, your girlfriend put on quite the performance."

Lily's face drained of color.

Ethan's aura turned icy as he watched the recording. He hurled the tablet at Lily, the metal edge grazing her cheek before crashing into the wall with a deafening clang.

"Alexander, if you can't control your woman, I'll do it for you!"

Alexander King yanked Lily back as she tried to flee. His voice was glacial. "Tell the truth."

In the hotel room, Evelyn Sullivan was packing her suitcase when Ethan burst in. The luggage was already zipped shut.

"Evelyn, I—"

"Save it." She lifted her suitcase. "I won't apologize."

"I saw the footage." Ethan's throat moved. "I was wrong about you."

Evelyn scoffed and tried to push past him, but the commanding voice of Grandma Sullivan cut through the tension from the doorway. "Let my Evelyn go wherever she pleases!"

"Grandma!"

"Don't 'Grandma' me!" The elderly woman stormed in with her cane. "Evelyn was right to divorce you! A blind, heartless fool like you—good riddance!"

###Chapter 70

Ethan Sullivan's brows furrowed sharply. "Grandmother, what do you mean by that?"

"What do I mean?"

The elderly Mrs. Sullivan glared at him with icy fury. "I know everything about how you helped outsiders bully Evelyn! What use is a husband who turns against his own wife?"

Ethan's gaze darkened as he fixed Evelyn with a piercing stare. "You told Grandmother about this?"

Mrs. Sullivan immediately shielded Evelyn behind her. "How dare you question her? Listen well—from today onward, you stay away from Evelyn! The divorce papers will be delivered to your office tomorrow!"

"Grandmother!"

Ethan's face turned stormy. Divorce had never crossed his mind.

"Don't call me that! I have no grandson like you!"

With that, Mrs. Sullivan took Evelyn's hand and walked away.

After settling Evelyn in her room, Mrs. Sullivan held her hand tenderly. "Evelyn, I won't let that wretched boy hurt you anymore. I've realized you two are truly incompatible. He doesn't deserve you."

Evelyn's eyes reddened slightly. "Thank you, Grandmother."

"Silly child, I should be thanking you. If not for you, Ethan would never have walked again. It's a shame that fool is blind to your worth."

Evelyn shook her head gently. "I did everything willingly. Your support means the world to me."

"Enough with the thanks!" Mrs. Sullivan patted her hand. "You must be exhausted. Get some rest."

The moment the door closed, all warmth vanished from Mrs. Sullivan's face.

If she hadn't checked the surveillance footage on a whim, she would never have seen Isabella and Lily ganging up on Evelyn—with Ethan forcing Evelyn to apologize!

As she approached her own room, she found Ethan standing like a statue outside her door.

"Do you understand your mistake now?" Mrs. Sullivan demanded coldly.

Ethan's lips pressed into a thin line. "Grandmother, you shouldn't have agreed to help Evelyn with the div—"

Slap!

A sharp crack echoed through the hallway.

"Ethan Sullivan! Is this how you treat your wife?" Mrs. Sullivan trembled with rage.

A vivid handprint bloomed on Ethan's cheek. He clenched his fists, his entire body radiating cold fury.

"Who nursed you day and night during those two years you were paralyzed? Who searched high and low for doctors?" Mrs. Sullivan's voice broke with emotion. "If Isabella truly loved you, where was she when you needed her most?"

Ethan remained silent for a moment. "She was abroad. The news of my marriage to Evelyn... shocked her."

"And you!" Mrs. Sullivan's voice rose. "Why did you start acting inappropriately with Isabella the moment she returned?"

"That's not true." Ethan frowned. "Evelyn misunderstood."

Mrs. Sullivan laughed bitterly. "Still lying! Who lent your marital home to Isabella? Who escorted her to every social event?"

Crash!

The sound of something heavy hitting the floor came from behind them.

Both turned to see Evelyn standing at the corridor's bend, her face deathly pale.

###Chapter 71

Evelyn Sullivan stood at the corridor's bend, her fingertips trembling faintly. Ethan Sullivan's voice defending Isabella Jackson reached her ears with painful clarity, like a blunt knife scraping against her heart.

"Evelyn?"

The voice of Grandma Sullivan snapped her back to reality. She bent to pick up the dropped phone, forcing a strained smile.

"Grandma, your phone."

By the time Grandma Sullivan took it, Evelyn had already turned away. She walked swiftly, as if fleeing from some unseen monster.

"Stop."

At the elevator doors, Ethan grabbed her wrist. His intense gaze searched her eyes for any trace of emotion.

"What is there to explain?" Evelyn laughed lightly. "How you defended Isabella in front of Grandma?"

The sound of the elevator doors opening and closing echoed through the hallway.

Suddenly, Ethan stepped inside. In the confined space, his presence overwhelmed her.

"That day in Iceland—"

"It doesn't matter anymore." Evelyn cut him off. "You know what I realized when I fell into that frozen lake?"

Her eyes were like ice-covered waters.

"Some warmth was never meant for me."

Ethan's throat moved as he swallowed. He remembered that snowy night three years ago, when she had curled into his arms and whispered promises of forever.

"I won't divorce you."

"Why bother?" Evelyn pressed the floor button. "A marriage without love is colder than any frozen lake."

The elevator's chime announced their arrival. Ethan's hurried retreat mirrored the way she had once chased after him.

Alone in her bedroom, Evelyn stared blankly at the ceiling. The sudden ring of her phone shattered the silence—Sophia Reynolds' name flashed on the screen.

"Evelyn! Something terrible happened!"

The voice on the other end was choked with tears. Evelyn bolted upright. Outside the window, the sunset bled crimson across the sky.

###Chapter 72

"Ms. Sullivan, hello. I'm the event coordinator for the resort." A young woman in uniform smiled and handed her an invitation. "We're hosting a beachside barbecue tonight. Would you like to join?"

Evelyn Sullivan accepted the invitation, her fingers brushing over the embossed gold lettering. She glanced at the darkening sky outside the window and nodded.

The bonfire crackled on the sand, casting flickering light over the laughing guests. Evelyn had just settled into a quiet corner when a familiar voice called out.

"Evelyn, dear!"

Mrs. Sullivan hurried over with her cane, followed by several elegantly dressed elderly women. She grasped Evelyn's hand. "Why are you hiding here all alone? Come join us."

Before Evelyn could decline, she was swept toward the main table. The women's eyes locked onto her, studying her like a rare treasure.

"Old Mrs. Sullivan, who is this lovely young lady?" one of them, adorned with a jade necklace, asked curiously.

Mrs. Sullivan straightened proudly. "This is my goddaughter, Evelyn. She's now the CEO of MY Fashion Group." She lowered her voice conspiratorially. "If any of you know suitable young gentlemen, don't forget to introduce them to her."

The skewer in Evelyn's hand nearly slipped. She gave Mrs. Sullivan a helpless look. "Grandma, I'm very busy with work right now..."

"Work is important, but so is your future." Mrs. Sullivan patted her hand. "Don't worry. I'll find someone better than Ethan for you."

The words struck like a blade, landing squarely on Ethan Sullivan, who stood nearby. His grip on the beer bottle tightened, his knuckles turning white.

"Tsk, tsk. Grandma Sullivan is setting you up for a rebound," Lucas Laurier teased, grinning.

Ethan shot him a cold glare. "One more word, and you'll be cutting all the meat tonight."

Lucas immediately mimed zipping his lips. He turned to Isabella Jackson, who had been unusually quiet. "Why so silent today?"

Isabella forced a smile. "Just tired, I guess." Her eyes kept darting toward Ethan. Ever since the equestrian center surveillance footage was exposed, she'd been on edge.

The fire crackled, illuminating the varied thoughts swirling among them. Suddenly, Ethan stood and strode purposefully toward Evelyn.

###Chapter 73

The elderly women crowded around the grill, eagerly holding Evelyn Sullivan's hand.

"Evelyn, my grandson just returned from abroad. He's quite handsome. Why don't you young people exchange numbers?"

Evelyn forced an awkward smile, about to politely decline, when another woman whipped out her phone with a QR code ready.

"Come on, scan it! My grandson is exceptional!"

Pushed into a corner, Evelyn reached for her phone. Just as her finger hovered over the scan button, a strong, well-defined hand snatched it away.

She spun around to face Ethan Sullivan’s icy profile.

"Give it back."

He slipped the phone into his suit pocket, his tone brooking no argument. "Confiscated."

The women exchanged confused glances before turning to Mrs. Sullivan. "Xiufen, what's going on—?"

Before she could respond, Ethan stepped forward, pulling Evelyn against him.

"Ladies, this is my wife. My grandmother was just teasing you."

The group erupted.

"What?! Xiufen, how could you keep this from us?"

"I knew Evelyn looked familiar! She's the young madam of Sullivan Group!"

"The Sullivans really know how to keep secrets!"

While the women swarmed Mrs. Sullivan with questions, Ethan dragged Evelyn away.

In the lakeside woods, he finally released her.

"Were you that desperate to replace me?" His voice simmered with anger.

Evelyn rubbed her reddened wrist. "Since when do you care?"

"Our marriage isn’t dissolved yet."

"And?" She scoffed. "You can parade around with other women, but I can't even make friends?"

His eyes darkened as he stepped closer. "Are you jealous?"

"Give me my phone." She turned away.

"Stay with me for ten minutes."

"Dream on."

She turned to leave, but Ethan wrapped his arms around her from behind, his warm breath brushing her ear. "I'm sorry."

Her entire body stiffened.

"I misunderstood you today." His voice was uncharacteristically soft.

Evelyn wrenched free, her gaze glacial. "Ethan, your apology means nothing. The surveillance footage proved Isabella framed me, yet you still protected her."

"I'll handle her—"

"Too late." She cut him off. "Since you chose her side, don’t blame me for playing dirty."

His expression hardened. "What are you planning?"

###Chapter 74

Evelyn Sullivan curled her lips in a mocking smile. "Just teaching her a lesson."

She turned to leave, but Ethan Sullivan grabbed her wrist, his voice icy. "Isabella is fragile. If you dare lay a finger on her, the Jacksons won’t let you off easy."

"I haven’t even touched her, and you’re already worried?"

His brows furrowed. "Evelyn, must you twist my words?"

He was only concerned about William and Victoria retaliating against her.

"Whether I’m twisting them or not, you know the truth."

She shook off his grip and walked away without looking back.

Ethan watched her retreating figure, fury simmering in his eyes.

On her way back, Daniel Sterling intercepted her.

"Did Mr. Sullivan give you trouble?" His concern was unmistakable.

A flicker of warmth touched Evelyn’s heart, but her expression remained cold. "Daniel, it’s best if you stay out of other people’s affairs."

His face stiffened. "Actually… Mr. Sullivan’s secretary contacted me. They want to buy your villa."

Her pupils contracted. She’d taken precautions to conceal the property—how had they traced it to Daniel?

"Thanks for the heads-up."

Back in her room, she took a hot shower and collapsed onto the bed. This vacation had been a disaster. She’d rather go home and sleep.

Late at night, the electronic lock beeped, jolting her awake.

A shadowy figure crept toward the bed in the darkness.

Evelyn lunged, aiming straight for the intruder’s throat. The person dodged with startling reflexes.

"Not bad," she muttered, narrowing her eyes.

The lights flicked on.

Recognition ignited her rage. "Ethan Sullivan, you break into my room in the middle of the night?"

She’d file a complaint tomorrow—since when did hotels hand out keycards so freely?

His gaze sharpened. "Since when do you know combat techniques?"

"Takes one to know one," she scoffed. "You’re full of secrets too."

"I’ll find out the truth."

"Be my guest." She shrugged indifferently.

His eyes darkened. "I’ve checked out."

Without another word, he strode into the bathroom. The sound of running water soon followed.

Evelyn clenched the sheets, her knuckles turning white. What the hell was this man playing at?

###Chapter 75

Evelyn Sullivan glared at him coldly. "So?"

"I'm sleeping here tonight."

She nearly laughed out loud. How could this man sound so entitled when their relationship was already so strained?

"Fine. I'll take another room."

She grabbed her coat and turned to leave. Ethan Sullivan seized her wrist. "Evelyn, don't push me."

"Your limits mean nothing to me."

The door had barely cracked open when his hand slammed it shut. The world spun as he lifted her off her feet.

"Ethan! Have you lost your mind?"

Ignoring her, he tossed her onto the bed and pinned her against his chest with one arm.

"Sleep."

He actually closed his eyes. Evelyn trembled with rage. "Let go!"

As she struggled, she felt the muscles in his arm tense. She looked up to meet his dark, smoldering gaze.

"You're despicable."

"Don't want to sleep?" His Adam's apple bobbed. "We could do something else."

The hunger in his eyes froze her in place.

Morning light filtered through the curtains. Evelyn realized she'd spent the night pillowed on his arm. She shoved him hard. "Get off!"

Ethan tightened his hold, his voice rough. "Stay a little longer."

"You can stay here till you rot!"

This time, he didn't stop her. By the time she finished freshening up, he was buttoning his dress shirt.

"Breakfast together."

Her response was the sharp snap of her suitcase closing. The moment he stepped into the bathroom, she grabbed her purse and bolted.

At the elevator, she collided with Isabella Jackson's pale face.

"You think you've won?" Isabella's nails dug into her palms. "Ethan only loves me!"

Evelyn didn't even spare her a glance.

Back at her villa, she'd just ordered takeout when the doorbell rang. Ethan stood outside, impeccably dressed in his suit, eyes stormy.

"Persistent bastard!" She slammed the door.

His hand shot out to block it. "Come home with me."

"I'm calling the police."

"Good." His lips curled into a cold smile. "Let them see what it means for a married woman to live in another man's house."

###Chapter 76

Evelyn Sullivan walked straight into the villa with takeout in hand, not even glancing at Ethan Sullivan standing by the door.

She ate her dinner unhurriedly and was about to head upstairs when Ethan finally lost his patience.

"How long are you going to keep this up?"

Evelyn paused, turning to face him calmly. "Mr. Sullivan, you're mistaken. I'm perfectly clear-headed right now."

Ethan shot up from his chair, the legs scraping against the floor with a harsh screech.

"Evelyn!"

She arched a brow. "No need to raise your voice. Even if you drag me back by force, I'll find a way to leave again."

His gaze darkened as he stared at her. After a long moment, he ground out through clenched teeth, "Fine. Very well."

Watching him storm out and slam the door behind him, Evelyn exhaled in relief.

That afternoon, Grandma Sullivan called.

"Sweetheart, come to Harmony Manor and keep me company for a while."

The moment Evelyn stepped into the living room, Grandma Sullivan warmly gestured for her to sit.

"Grandma, you wanted to see me?"

The older woman took her hand, her tone suddenly serious. "Sweetheart, I'll ask you one last time. Are you really determined to get a divorce?"

Evelyn nodded without hesitation. "Yes."

"But Ethan—"

"Grandma," Evelyn interrupted gently, "the issues between us aren't impulsive."

Grandma Sullivan sighed and patted her hand. "Alright. I'll help you."

Within the hour, a lawyer arrived with the divorce papers.

Evelyn flipped to the asset division page, her pupils contracting sharply.

"Grandma, I can't accept these shares."

Grandma Sullivan's expression hardened. "This is my gift to you."

"But—"

"No buts!" The older woman's voice was firm. "If you refuse, this divorce isn't happening."

Evelyn was torn between laughter and tears at the sudden ultimatum.

By evening, Ethan arrived at Harmony Manor with a stormy expression.

Spotting the documents on the coffee table, he snatched them up and hurled them to the floor.

"I refuse!"

Grandma Sullivan gave a cold laugh. "Come with me to the study."

As the study door closed, Evelyn's heart clenched.

Her eyes fixed on the wall clock, each tick of the minute hand fraying her nerves.

If even Grandma Sullivan couldn't persuade him...

Evelyn's fists tightened.

###Chapter 77

Ethan Sullivan waited until his grandmother disappeared down the hallway before stepping forward.

An icy aura radiated from him, freezing the very air around them.

His slender fingers gripped a pen, pressing down so hard the signature nearly tore through the paper.

"Evelyn Sullivan. Happy now?"

His sharp gaze lifted like a blade.

Evelyn's lips curved as she signed her name with practiced ease.

"Absolutely."

She reached for the agreement, but Ethan snatched it away first.

"Mr. Sullivan?"

"Why should I trust you?" His laugh was cold. "Even Grandmother handed over her shares to you."

Evelyn frowned. "I said I didn't want the 10%."

"Then revise the agreement. Remove the shares clause."

The elder Mrs. Sullivan suddenly spoke. "Either accept the shares and divorce, or we forget this ever happened."

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly.

"Grandmother..."

"Choose."

After a long silence, Evelyn whispered, "I'll take the shares."

Ethan slammed the door on his way out.

Evelyn moved to follow, but the elder Mrs. Sullivan held her back.

"Don't worry. He won't go back on his word once he's signed."

At dinner, the elder Mrs. Sullivan kept serving Evelyn dishes.

"Come visit me often after this."

The farewell embrace made Evelyn's nose sting with unshed tears.

Night had fallen when she stood before the gates of Grand View Villa.

Ethan opened the door, frost in his eyes.

"You got what you wanted. Why are you here?"
###Chapter 78

Evelyn Sullivan pushed open the villa door and was immediately hit by the strong smell of alcohol. She instinctively frowned and took half a step back.

"I came to return the Sullivan Group shares."

Ethan Sullivan leaned against the doorframe, his shirt collar disheveled and open. He let out a cold laugh, his eyes bloodshot.

"You went through all that trouble to find Grandma just to get a divorce. Stop pretending to be noble now."

"That's not true."

"Then take the shares and get the hell out!" Ethan slammed the door shut. "We're done!"

The metallic clang of the doorframe echoed in her ears. Evelyn clenched her fists, her nails digging deep into her palms.

"When are we going to the notary office?"

"Tomorrow!" The sound of shattering glass came from inside. "Happy now?"

Evelyn turned and walked away, the click of her heels against the stone path unusually sharp.

The next morning, Tyler Laurier barged into the CEO's office with a stack of documents.

"Evelyn, the new energy project is waiting for your signature."

Without looking up, she said, "Leave it on the desk."

"But this is a crucial project for the company's next three years—"

"I said, leave it on the desk."

Tyler's smile froze. As he set the files down, his knuckles turned white from gripping them too hard.

The moment the office door closed, Evelyn glanced at her watch. The civil affairs office opened at nine. Ethan should be—

Her phone vibrated. Colin Keller's voice trembled with panic. "Ms. Sullivan, Ethan's been in a car accident!"

The red light above the operating room burned her eyes. Evelyn stared at the consent form she'd just signed, the ink still wet.

"What happened?"

"Someone was tailing his car," Colin said, his voice shaking. "On Hengjiang Bridge... They were trying to kill him."

Evelyn's nails carved crescent-shaped marks into her palms.

"Trace the license plate."

"It's a fake." Colin handed her a tablet. "But the dashcam caught the driver wearing a black mask."

The screen froze on a pair of sinister eyes. Evelyn's blood ran cold.

A familiar notification tone suddenly rang out. She hurried to the end of the hallway and unlocked her phone.

A line of blood-red text flashed on the screen: [Scorpion isn't dead.]

The words dissolved like smoke just as the operating room doors swung open. The doctor removed his mask. "The patient is out of immediate danger, but—"

Evelyn didn't hear the rest. Her gaze pierced through the glass window, landing on Ethan's pale face.

Outside, a crow perched on a tree branch, its crimson eyes fixed unblinkingly on the hospital room.

###Chapter 79

Evelyn had just slipped her phone back into her pocket when she turned and met Colin's probing gaze.

"Miss Sullivan, your ringtone..." Colin frowned slightly. "It sounds familiar."

Her fingers twitched. "Where have you heard it before?"

That was the encrypted alert tone exclusive to the mercenary alliance. Outsiders shouldn't recognize it.

Colin scratched his head. "Can't recall. Just feels distinctive."

The air between them froze.

"Miss Sullivan," Colin suddenly lowered his voice, "the CEO's car burst into flames immediately after colliding with the bus. The team only managed to pull him and the driver out—"

Evelyn clenched her fists. "We'll discuss the divorce papers after he wakes up."

She needed to confirm if Scorpion was behind this. That lunatic loved watching his prey struggle in agony.

The operating lights dimmed late into the night.

When Ethan was wheeled out, his face was ghostly pale, fragile as porcelain.

"Mr. Sullivan's old injuries have relapsed," the doctor removed his mask. "I'm afraid... he may never walk again."

Evelyn's legs gave way. She braced herself against the wall to keep from collapsing.

"Arrange for a private nurse," she heard herself say mechanically. "I'll stay with him."

Colin's expression darkened when he received a call.

"Stock prices plummeting? I'm heading back to the office now!"

He glanced at Evelyn. She nodded before he could speak. "Go."

The moment the door clicked shut, she tapped the unnamed black avatar in her contacts.

[Trace the leak.]

The reply came instantly: [Scorpion.]

Evelyn stared at the man tethered to tubes, her nails biting into her palms. She should've ended that madman herself.

Reporters swarmed outside Sullivan Tower.

The elder Mrs. Sullivan nearly fainted at the hospital room doorway.

"Evelyn..." The old woman trembled as she grasped her hand. "This is all my fault..."

Evelyn steadied the swaying matriarch. Her gaze toward the hospital bed was unreadable.

###Chapter 80

Guilt crashed over Evelyn like a tidal wave. Her fists clenched. Scorpion's target was her. Even without the accident near the civil affairs office, Ethan would have faced other dangers.

"Grandmother, don't worry. Mr. Sullivan will be fine."

She wouldn't let anything happen to him.

After seeing Mrs. Sullivan off, Evelyn returned to the hospital room door. Before long, Isabella stormed in, her heels clicking sharply against the floor.

"I heard Ethan got into an accident on his way to divorce you?" Isabella's eyes were red, her voice shrill. "Evelyn, you're nothing but a jinx!"

"None of your business," Evelyn sneered. "We're still married. A homewrecker like you has no right to speak."

Isabella trembled with rage. "Just wait until Ethan wakes up—"

"And then what?" Evelyn cut her off. "I haven't even settled the score with you over what happened at the equestrian center. If you keep making a scene here, I won't hesitate to teach you a lesson right now."

"So this is your true face!" Isabella hissed through gritted teeth. "All that meekness was just an act for Ethan, wasn't it?"

"My kindness is reserved for those who deserve it." Evelyn's gaze turned icy. "You don't qualify."

After driving Isabella away, the hallway finally fell silent. Evelyn stared at the hospital door, her heart heavy. If she weren't worried about Scorpion striking again, she would have left long ago.

What troubled her more was Ethan's leg injury. She couldn't let him spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair.

After much hesitation, she dialed a number she hadn't used in three years.

"Brat, you finally remembered this old man?" A familiar grumble came through the line. "Any later, and you could've just offered incense at my grave."

"Master..." Her voice caught.

"This is about that Sullivan boy again, isn't it?" The old man snorted. "Has he treated you well?"

"He has."

"Bullshit!" he snapped. "If he truly cared for you, you'd have brought him to meet me by now!"

Evelyn had no rebuttal.

"Three years ago, I told you to come home if you were unhappy," he fumed. "Instead, you'd rather drive me to an early grave, is that it?"

Her senior brother must have tattled. Evelyn gritted her teeth silently.

"Don't blame your senior brother!" The old man seemed to read her mind. "Next time, come back together—and bring that Ethan Sullivan. I want to see what kind of man has my disciple so bewitched!"

After hanging up, Evelyn kept vigil outside the hospital room for three straight days. Ethan remained unconscious.

At noon on the third day, Sophia's call came through abruptly.

###Chapter 81

"Evelyn, the board is pressing hard. Several contracts require your personal signature." Sophia's exhausted voice came through the phone.

Evelyn massaged her temples. "Bring them to the hospital. I'm in the VIP ward."

After hanging up, she glanced at the man sleeping soundly in the hospital bed. Ethan's breathing was steady, though his face remained pale.

Sophia arrived quickly, rushing into the room with an armful of documents.

"These all need your review," she whispered, careful not to disturb the patient.

Evelyn took the files, flipping through the pages with swift fingers. The scratch of her pen against paper echoed sharply in the quiet room.

"I'll leave the company in your hands for now." She closed the last file and met Sophia's gaze.

Sophia hesitated but ultimately nodded.

After seeing Sophia out, Evelyn heard commotion from inside the room as she approached the door. Through the window, she spotted a cluster of white coats gathered around the bed.

Had Ethan woken up?

She pushed the door open—only to hear Isabella's saccharine voice cutting through the crowd. "Don't worry, Dr. Howard. I'll take good care of Ethan."

Dr. Howard turned and spotted Evelyn in the doorway, his expression flickering with discomfort. "Ms. Sullivan, Mr. Sullivan just regained consciousness."

Before Evelyn could speak, Isabella interjected, "Doctor, Ethan needs rest. All these people will disturb him."

The medical staff filed out, and only then did Isabella notice Evelyn's presence. She lifted her chin defiantly before fussing with Ethan's blanket.

"Ethan, would you like some water?" Her voice dripped with honeyed sweetness.

Ethan's gaze settled on Isabella, his eyes softer than Evelyn had ever seen. "No. You should rest."

Evelyn stood frozen in the doorway, the sight stinging like salt in a wound. Ethan's first waking sight had been Isabella. The realization twisted something inside her.

"Since you're awake, I'll head back." Her voice was calm, detached.

Silence filled the room. Ethan didn’t even glance her way.

As Evelyn turned to leave, the shattering of glass rang out behind her. She paused mid-step but didn’t look back.

"Don’t bother coming again." Ethan's icy words chased after her. "Isabella is enough."

The hallway lights stretched her shadow long and thin. Evelyn clenched her fists, nails biting into her palms.

Inside the room, Isabella flinched at Ethan’s sudden fury. Trembling, she reached for his hand. "Ethan—"

He yanked his arm away, his glare dark and terrifying. "Get out."

Isabella paled, biting her lip as she retreated from the room.

###Chapter 82

"Ethan..."

Isabella's timid voice made Ethan Sullivan turn his head. She stood at the hospital room door, nervously twisting the hem of her dress, her eyes filled with unease.

The coldness in Ethan's expression softened instantly.

"Did I scare you?"

She shook her head, forcing a smile. When she bent down to pick up the shattered glass on the floor, Ethan stopped her.

"Don't touch it. You might cut yourself."

A nurse quickly came in to clean up the mess. Isabella sat by the bed, speaking softly to Ethan until he closed his eyes. Only then did she tiptoe out of the room.

The moment the door clicked shut, Ethan's eyes snapped open.

He dialed Colin's number, his tone leaving no room for argument. "Get to the hospital. Now."

Half an hour later, Colin rushed in.

"Sir, you're finally awake!" He exhaled in relief. "The stock price has plummeted these past few days. Some board members are already making moves..."

Ethan's gaze sharpened as he swiftly assessed the company's situation.

"Hold a press conference this afternoon."

Colin hesitated. "But your condition—"

"Then issue a statement first." Ethan narrowed his eyes. "Arrange for photos."

After handling business matters, Ethan abruptly changed the subject. "Any updates on the car accident?"

A bead of sweat formed on Colin's temple. "That vehicle... vanished without a trace."

The temperature in the room seemed to drop. Ethan didn't press further, instead asking about the driver.

"Uncle West is out of danger." Colin paused before adding carefully, "As for Ms. Sullivan—"

"She's tired." Ethan cut him off. "You're dismissed."

In the following days, Evelyn never returned to the hospital. She had reviewed Ethan's medical records and knew his leg injury required long-term treatment.

Now that he was safe, she saw no reason to irritate him further.

Meanwhile, Ethan's temper grew increasingly unpredictable.

On his discharge day, Evelyn was in the middle of assigning tasks in a meeting when her phone buzzed.

"Mr. Sullivan?"

A cold laugh came through the line. "Mrs. Sullivan, do you remember you have a husband?"

She rubbed her temples. "You told me not to come."

"You weren't this obedient during the divorce." His voice rose sharply. "Get to the hospital. Now!"

The call ended with a violent click. Evelyn stared at the darkened screen and sighed deeply.
###Chapter 83

The line went dead. Evelyn Sullivan stared at the darkened phone screen, her fingertips trembling slightly.

Every executive in the boardroom held their breath, watching her.

"Meeting adjourned." She closed the folder, her voice eerily calm.

Tyler Laurier slammed his documents onto the table with a loud bang. "CEO Sullivan, are you treating this company as a joke? The project is already a week behind schedule!"

Her heels clicked sharply against the floor as she turned. "Director Laurier, the South China project you oversaw last quarter lost twenty million. Shall I review the details for everyone?"

Silence filled the room.

Tyler's face turned ashen, veins bulging in his neck. "There were extenuating circumstances!"

"And my rejection of your new proposal is also based on circumstances." She grabbed her bag and strode out, leaving stunned faces in her wake. "Dismissed."

The sterile scent of disinfectant stung her eyes in the hospital corridor.

The VIP suite door flew open. Ethan Sullivan sat propped against the headboard, reviewing documents, his casted leg suspended in a brace.

"Forty-seven minutes late." He didn't look up, his pen scratching harshly across the paper.

Evelyn tossed her bag onto the sofa. "There was a pileup on the road."

"Liar." His gaze finally lifted, darker than the night outside the window. "The traffic app shows clear roads from MY Fashion Group to the hospital today."

Her fingers paused on her blazer buttons.

"Dr. Howard said my leg—" Ethan suddenly hurled the files onto the nightstand, sending the metal tray clattering. "Might never heal properly."

Her nails dug into her palms.

"And?"

"So the divorce papers are void." His eyes locked onto her paling lips as he enunciated each word. "Until I recover, you're moving back to Grand View."

The wail of an approaching ambulance grew louder outside.

"I can hire the best physical therapists for you."

"I want you." His hand shot out, gripping her wrist. The IV needle tore free, blood splattering the white sheets. "Every morning and night, watching me struggle like a useless cripple."

The heart monitor shrieked an alarm.

Nurses rushed in to find Evelyn pressing gauze to his bleeding hand. Their eyes met in the chaos, and she saw the near-delirious obsession swirling in his gaze.

"Fine." The word was barely audible.

At the discharge counter, Dr. Howard hesitated before handing her a stack of test results. "Mrs. Sullivan, actually, Mr. Sullivan's nerve damage—"

"I know." She stuffed the papers into her bag and turned—only to collide with a wheelchair in the hallway. Ethan sat with a tablet on his lap, MY's stock chart glowing on the screen.

In the car returning to Grand View, he broke the silence. "You'll take the master bedroom."

"What?"

"I'll stay in the first-floor guest room." He watched the receding sycamores outside. "So you can't sneak out at night."

Her grip tightened on the steering wheel. The rearview mirror reflected her red-rimmed eyes. Storm clouds gathered on the horizon, heavy with impending rain.

###Chapter 84

The air froze for several seconds before Evelyn Sullivan finally lowered her lashes.

She turned toward the kitchen. Just as the refrigerator door swung open, the doorbell rang sharply.

Isabella Jackson stood outside, her meticulously applied makeup cracking at the sight of Evelyn.

"What are you doing here?"

Evelyn leaned against the doorframe, fingers tapping lightly on the metal handle.

"Is it strange for a legal spouse to be in her marital home?"

Isabella's grip tightened around the fruit basket in her hands, her nails digging into the wrapping paper. She had gone to the hospital early that morning, only to find his room empty.

"Where's Ethan?"

Without waiting for an answer, she pushed past Evelyn into the foyer. Ethan Sullivan sat in his wheelchair, flipping through documents, his tailored suit emphasizing his gaunt frame.

"Your legs..." Isabella's Chanel clutch slipped from her fingers and hit the floor.

Ethan closed the folder. "Permanent damage."

"That's impossible!" She stumbled forward, dropping to her knees before his wheelchair, her pearl earrings swaying violently. "I know a neurologist in Switzerland—"

"Isabella." His voice cut her off. "Not now."

Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, plane tree leaves spiraled into the swimming pool. Isabella wiped her tears and suddenly seized the cufflink on Ethan's sleeve.

"The divorce papers were already drafted. It's inappropriate for her to stay here." She shot a glance toward the kitchen. "Let me take care of you."

She wouldn't repeat the same mistake from three years ago—that wedding that should have been hers.

Ethan wheeled himself back half a step. "We've reached a new agreement. The marriage stands until my legs recover."

"What if they never do?" The words slipped out before she could stop them. Flustered, she backtracked, "I mean, she's unpredictable. What if she—"

"I don't go back to exes." Evelyn emerged from the kitchen, carrying a glass of lemon water. Ice cubes clinked against the sides.

Ethan's expression darkened, his knuckles whitening on the wheelchair armrests.

Isabella let out a soft laugh. "Didn't you swear you'd never fall for someone in an arranged marriage?" Her gaze drifted meaningfully to the wedding portrait hanging in the living room.

The scent of antiseptic clashed with perfume in the air. Ethan spoke abruptly, "Isabella, thank you for staying with me those three days at the hospital..."

"I wanted to!" she interrupted urgently, her manicured hand covering his. "No matter how long it took."

He withdrew his hand. In his peripheral vision, Evelyn was spinning her wedding ring around her finger—the plain band circling loosely, as if it might slip off at any moment.

"Make steamed eggs," he ordered abruptly.

Evelyn arched a brow, then gave Isabella a knowing smile. "Fine. But speaking of hospital vigils..."

###Chapter 85

"Sis!"

Isabella Jackson plastered on a fake smile and hurried over to Evelyn Sullivan.

"You know I make the best steamed eggs. Let me help you."

"Sure."

They carried the eggs into the kitchen. The moment the door closed, Isabella's smile vanished.

"Evelyn, if you dare tell him—"

Evelyn cracked an egg leisurely, a smirk playing on her lips. "Why should I keep your secret? What if Ethan finds out it was me who stayed by his hospital bed for three days and nights?"

Isabella clenched her fists.

"You're the one who made me leave!"

"And you just obeyed?" Evelyn shot her a sidelong glance. "Seems like you don’t care about him that much."

Isabella's face darkened.

"What do you want?"

"You should be asking what you can offer me."

Evelyn whisked the eggs with practiced ease and placed the bowl into the steamer.

"You have until these eggs are done. Make it worth my while."

Isabella trembled with rage. She never should have come today.

Ten minutes later, steam rose from the pot.

"Five minutes left."

Isabella gritted her teeth. "Mom and Dad will throw you a birthday party this year!"

She expected Evelyn to be tempted.

Instead, Evelyn only laughed softly.

"That’s it?"

"You’ve always wanted their approval!"

Evelyn shook her head.

"Not anymore."

"You’re lying!"

Evelyn reached for the steamer.

"Then I guess I’ll just tell Ethan."

A flash of malice crossed Isabella’s eyes. She suddenly knocked the bowl of steaming eggs from Evelyn’s hands.

Scalding custard splashed toward Evelyn.

Evelyn dodged, but the hot liquid still seared her arm, leaving an angry red blister.

Isabella gasped in fake concern. "Sis, I didn’t mean to—"

Slap!

A sharp slap cut her off.

###Chapter 86

Slap!

The sharp sound of a palm striking flesh echoed through the kitchen.

Isabella Jackson clutched her stinging cheek, eyes wide with shock and fury. "Evelyn Sullivan, have you lost your mind?!"

Before she could finish, another slap landed.

"These two slaps are to teach you your place." Evelyn's voice was glacial, her gaze like shards of ice. "I ignored your antics before because you weren't worth my time."

Isabella trembled with rage, nails digging into her palms. She lunged forward, only for Evelyn to seize her wrist and slam her onto the countertop.

"Ah!" A pained scream escaped as her back collided with the hard surface.

"Still not clear-headed enough?" Evelyn advanced slowly, cold fury flashing in her eyes.

Isabella shrank back, genuine fear flickering across her face.

The kitchen door swung open.

"Ethan!" Isabella's expression instantly transformed. Tears welled up on command. "Sister, I... I just accidentally spilled the steamed eggs—"

Slap! Slap!

Two more resounding strikes.

"Now you can continue your performance." Evelyn flexed her fingers with a mocking smile.

Isabella covered her burning face, hatred boiling in her eyes.

"Enough!" Ethan Sullivan's voice cut through the tension, his brow furrowed. "Evelyn, that's enough."

Evelyn didn't even glance his way. "Keep your precious First Love in check. Next time, it won't just be slaps."

She turned to leave, but Ethan grabbed her arm.

"You're hurt." His voice dropped as he noticed the blisters on her forearm.

Evelyn wrenched free. "Not your concern."

"Where's the first aid kit?"

"Save your concern for your darling." She strode away without looking back, her exit final.

Ethan's eyes darkened. Despite staying to care for him, she maintained an impenetrable distance.

She still intended to leave him.

"Ethan..." Isabella's tearful voice trembled.

He turned to see her swollen cheeks, his frown deepening.

"What really happened?" His tone was dangerously calm.

###Chapter 87

Ethan Sullivan had Evelyn Sullivan figured out. She never started fights but wouldn't back down from one.

Seeing Ethan's silence, Isabella Jackson's eyes instantly welled up.

"I just wanted to help serve the steamed eggs..." Her voice trembled. "I didn't mean to spill them... But Evelyn thinks I did it on purpose..."

Ethan remained quiet for a moment before speaking flatly, "Understood. You should go."

Isabella's eyes widened. Was he dismissing her just like that?

"Okay..." She bit her lip. "Don't blame Evelyn. It's all my fault..."

Before leaving, she stole a glance at Ethan. His expression was unreadable.

Ethan retrieved the first aid kit and wheeled himself back to the bedroom.

Evelyn had just rinsed her scalded arm under cold water. Spotting the kit in his hands, she arched a brow.

"Come here," he said, his voice low.

Evelyn didn't move. "I can handle it."

"You can't reach."

"Then I won't bother."

As she turned to leave, Ethan's grip tightened on his wheelchair. "Stop!"

He shoved the kit into her arms.

Evelyn walked out without looking back.

In the living room, she struggled to apply the ointment. Ethan's gaze darkened at the angry red burn on her arm.

"Why four slaps?"

Evelyn scoffed. "Does it hurt you to see it?"

"Two would've been enough."

"The other two were for the Equestrian Center." Her voice was icy. "If you're so bothered, take them for her next time."

Ethan suddenly closed the distance between them. "Then what about me? How will you settle the injustice at the Equestrian Center?"

"Slap yourself twice." She snapped the kit shut. "But that petty grievance isn't worth my effort."

His hand clamped around her wrist.

"You stayed to take care of me," he rasped. "Is it because you still love me?"

Evelyn laughed as if hearing a joke. "Don't flatter yourself. You got hurt while finalizing our divorce. I'm responsible."

More importantly, that crash had been meant for her.

Ethan searched her eyes but found only indifference.

He released her abruptly. "Good. Remember your place."

###Chapter 88

"I'm tired of hearing that." Evelyn Sullivan set down her glass with an impassive expression. "I know exactly how much I mean to you."

The living room plunged into suffocating silence.

She straightened her clothes and stood. "I'll clean the kitchen. We'll order takeout later. What do you want?"

"Whatever." Ethan Sullivan didn't look up from his tablet. "I have paperwork to finish in the study."

The sound of running water filled the kitchen. Evelyn dried her hands and hesitated before tapping on a delivery app. She finally selected a Sichuan restaurant.

The food arrived quickly. As she set the table, a knock came from the study door.

Ethan's wheelchair stopped by the dining table. His gaze froze when he saw the spread of crimson dishes.

"Evelyn!"
"Hmm?" She scooped mapo tofu into her bowl.

"Are you doing this on purpose?" His voice was icy. "You know my stomach can't handle spicy food."

She poked at her rice with chopsticks. "I ordered steamed egg and stir-fried vegetables for you." A quiet mutter followed. "You said 'whatever' earlier..."

His knuckles whitened on the wheelchair armrests.

With every bite of spicy food she took, his glare darkened. Evelyn finally put down her chopsticks. "We should hire a cook starting tomorrow."

After a long silence, Ethan gave a stiff nod.

As she cleared the dishes, he spoke abruptly. "Help me shower."

"What?" She nearly dropped the dishcloth. "Your hands aren't broken!"

"Do you think I can do it myself right now?" His laugh was cold.

Her flushed face reflected in the bathroom tiles. The running water masked her pounding heart, but she still froze when she turned around—Ethan had only removed his shirt, his sculpted torso tapering into dress pants.

"Your pants..."

"You do it."

Her ears burned. "Should I call a male nurse?"

His hand clamped around her wrist. The world spun as she landed in his lap. The heat of his chest seared her palm, muscles shifting with each breath.

"Let me teach you." He guided her fingers to his belt buckle.

The metallic click startled sparrows perched outside the window.

###Chapter 89

The sharp click of a metal buckle echoed through the silent room.

Evelyn Sullivan's fingers trembled slightly as she deliberately avoided looking at the loosened belt around Ethan Sullivan's waist.

"Pull it out for me."

His deep voice carried a hint of amusement, thickening the air between them.

Evelyn bit her lower lip and remained motionless.

"What's wrong?" Ethan leaned closer, his warm breath brushing her earlobe. "Don't tell me you're shy, Ms. Sullivan."

"Who's shy?"

She jerked her head up, meeting his laughing eyes. A surge of irritation shot through her. She yanked the belt free and flung it to the floor before swiftly pulling down his trousers.

"Should I take off the underwear too?"

"Whatever pleases you."

Evelyn scoffed. "I'd rather not dirty my eyes."

Steam filled the bathroom. She wrung out the towel, carefully avoiding his half-healed wounds. When her fingertips accidentally grazed his firm abs, she recoiled as if burned.

"Do the rest yourself."

She tossed the towel into his lap and stormed out without looking back.

The door slammed shut with enough force to rattle the frosted glass.

Ethan watched the trembling door, a knowing smirk playing on his lips.

When Evelyn emerged from her shower, Ethan was on the phone by the window. Moonlight outlined his sharp silhouette, casting a severe shadow.

She towel-dried her hair as she heard him say, "Keep watching. Don't alert them."

Their eyes met. He ended the call.

The whir of the hairdryer drowned out their breathing. Evelyn pulled spare bedding from the closet and began spreading it on the floor when a cold laugh came from the bed.

"Get up here."

"No need."

"Evelyn." His voice turned icy. "Do you really think I'd do anything to you?"

"I'm just not used to sharing a bed."

"You slept soundly enough at the resort."

Her grip tightened on the blanket. "That was different."

"How?" His eyes narrowed. "Or are you afraid of something?"

"Think whatever you want."

She snapped off the overhead light and burrowed under the covers. In the darkness, she could feel his burning gaze fixed on her back.

Morning sunlight stabbed at Evelyn's eyes when she woke.

Ethan sat fully dressed in his wheelchair, his handsome face stormy. She mechanically assisted with his morning routine, treating him like a statue.

"The caregiver will cook lunch."

She hurriedly tied her shoes and nearly collided with Colin Keller at the door. A young man in caregiver scrubs stood beside him, nervously wringing his hands.

"This is Leo. He'll handle Mr. Sullivan's daytime care from now on." Colin smiled. "Including bathing and dressing."

Evelyn's eyes brightened. "He'll help with baths?"

"Of course, though Mr. Sullivan usually—"

"Perfect." She cut him off with visible relief, nodding at Leo. "Thank you."

She turned away before seeing the sudden darkness in Ethan's eyes.

###Chapter 90

Evelyn clenched her fists, her nails digging deep into her palms.

So Ethan hadn't needed her help bathing last night at all.

He had been toying with her!

Colin noticed her stormy expression and asked cautiously, "Ms. Sullivan, is there something wrong with Mr. Sullivan?"

"Nothing."

She turned and walked away, her heels clicking sharply against the marble floor.

Inside the villa, Ethan's sharp features looked even more severe in the morning light.

"What did she ask you?"

Colin answered truthfully, "Ms. Sullivan inquired about your usual bathing routine."

Ethan's gaze darkened.

"And what did you say?"

"I told her you always bathe yourself..."

The air instantly turned icy.

Colin belatedly realized his mistake, cold sweat drenching his back.

"From now on," Ethan said coldly, "the answer to any question about me is 'I don't know.'"

"Yes, sir."

Ethan rubbed his temples.

This was going to be troublesome.

In her office, Evelyn slammed a file onto her desk.

Tyler walked in just as her dark expression came into view.

"Ms. Sullivan, this contract requires your review."

She flipped through it quickly, marking over a dozen glaring errors with red ink.

"Mr. Laurier," she said with a cold smile, "are you trying to send MY Fashion Group to prison?"

Tyler's face paled.

The contract was a trap set by Vincent. After being publicly humiliated by Evelyn, Vincent had sworn revenge.

"Ms. Sullivan!" Tyler forced composure. "This was just an oversight!"

Evelyn tapped her fingers lightly on the desk.

"Remember who gave you your shares?"

Beads of sweat formed on Tyler's forehead.

"But I've contributed to the company!"

"Indeed," Evelyn smiled. "That's why I'm giving you a graceful exit—resign from the board within three days."

"Over my dead body!"

Tyler slammed his hands on the desk and stood.

Unfazed, Evelyn pressed the intercom.

"Security, escort him out."

When silence returned to the office, Evelyn gazed out the window.

This wasn't over between her and Ethan.

###Chapter 91

Tyler Laurier slammed his office door shut. He pulled out his phone and jabbed at the screen with sharp, angry taps.

"Mr. White, I accept your proposal," he muttered in a low voice. "Meet me at the usual place at eight tonight."

After hanging up, Tyler glared at the photo of Evelyn Sullivan on his desk. His expression darkened as he flipped it face down, his knuckles turning white from the force.

"You left me no choice."

As night fell, Evelyn pushed open the villa door to find Ethan Sullivan sitting by the floor-to-ceiling window, reviewing documents. The warm glow of the lamp outlined the sharp angles of his profile.

"Dinner's on the table," he said without looking up.

Evelyn strode over and dropped her bag heavily onto the coffee table. "Ethan, was last night intentional?"

Ethan closed the file and met her gaze. "What?"

"You could've showered by yourself," she said, her ears burning. "Why did you—"

"Isn't that normal between married couples?" A faint smirk played on his lips. "Or is Mrs. Sullivan feeling shy?"

She turned on her heel. "Don't even think about it again!"

Dinner passed in silence. Evelyn carried a fruit platter to the couch and deliberately turned up the volume on the TV.

Ethan set down his pen and rubbed his temples. "You actually watch these ridiculous dramas?"

"If you don't like it, go upstairs." She popped a grape into her mouth.

The doorbell rang.

Evelyn opened the door to find Lucas Laurier and Ryan Paisley standing there, their suits still carrying the chill from the airport.

"Evelyn?" Lucas raised an eyebrow in surprise. "Is Ethan home?"

She stepped aside. "In the living room."

As she moved to the kitchen to prepare tea, she caught Lucas's urgent voice: "What happened to your leg? What did the doctor say?"

"It's done for." Ethan's tone was as calm as discussing the weather.

The teacups clinked softly on the tray. Evelyn glanced down, watching her reflection tremble in the tea.

"If it was treatable last time, it can be fixed now too!" Ryan's voice rose suddenly. "Should we contact New Moon again—"

"No need."

When Evelyn returned with the tea set, the living room fell silent. She set down the cups. "Take your time."

She headed upstairs but paused at the landing when she heard Lucas press, "Ethan, something's off. You weren't like this last time."

Ethan's voice carried a weariness she'd never heard before: "This time is different."

Evelyn froze at the turn of the staircase. Moonlight streamed through the window, casting a sharp line between light and shadow at her feet. Standing at the threshold, her heartbeat roared in her ears.

###Chapter 92

Lucas Laurier frowned deeply. "No, I'll contact international specialists for a consultation immediately."

"Unnecessary."

Ethan Sullivan's tone was icy. Lucas could only sigh in resignation.

Ryan Paisley stepped forward. "Let us know if you need anything."

"Hmm."

"There's actually one more thing."

Ethan lifted his gaze.

"Alexander is outside. About what happened last time—"

Before he could finish, the air around Ethan turned frigid.

"Send him away."

"Ethan, we've been brothers for years—"

"Unless he breaks up with Lily White."

Lucas quickly interjected, "The King family would never accept a woman like that!"

Ethan's eyes frosted over. "Show them out."

The two left empty-handed.

Outside the villa, Alexander King forced a smile at their grim expressions. "I'll come back another day."

Lucas patted his shoulder. "Go home for now."

Once Alexander was gone, Lucas yanked at his tie in frustration.

"This is a problem."

Ryan's gaze darkened. "The key is Evelyn Sullivan."

"Isn't Isabella more—"

"Then why is Evelyn the one standing by his side?"

Lucas suddenly understood. "Alexander needs to apologize."

Ryan's Adam's apple bobbed as he masked the shadows in his eyes.

In the bedroom, Evelyn flipped through a book.

"Are they gone?"

"Yes."

As she stood, Ethan suddenly gripped her wrist.

"Alexander came by."

Evelyn arched a brow in confusion.

###Chapter 93

"Let go."

Ethan Sullivan didn't move. His dark eyes locked onto her, voice low. "He came to apologize for the Lakeside Resort incident. I didn't see him."

Evelyn Sullivan struggled against his grip. "Whether you see him or not has nothing to do with me. Let go!"

"I was wrong about you. I'm sorry."

His earnest expression made her want to laugh. Since their divorce, he'd apologized more times than in their entire three-year marriage.

"I already said I don't care about that anymore."

A spark of anger flared in his eyes. "Is it that you don't care about the incident—or that you don't care about me at all?"

She wrenched her arm free. "What's the difference? Weren't you the one who told me not to fantasize about you? I listened. What more do you want?"

His knuckles turned white, his expression darkening.

"Stop saying things like that. I'm not interested in playing these games with you."

Evelyn turned and walked away.

In the living room, she massaged her temples in frustration. She needed to heal his legs quickly—only then could this divorce be finalized.

The next morning, Evelyn ran into Alexander King and Lily White outside the MY Fashion Group building.

Gone was their arrogance from the Lakeside Resort. Now, their faces were plastered with insincere apologies.

"Miss Sullivan," Alexander began, tone painfully earnest, "we came to apologize. We misunderstood you that day. We're sorry."

Lily chimed in, "I shouldn't have framed you and then blamed you. Please forgive me."

Evelyn smirked. "Save your apologies. I won't forgive you."

Lily's face stiffened. Just as Isabella had warned—this bitch never knew when to quit!

"Miss Sullivan, I'll do anything you ask! Just tell me how to make it right!"

Evelyn arched a brow. "Anything?"

Lily's stomach twisted, but she forced a nod. Alexander had made it clear—if she didn't apologize properly, he'd break up with her. After scheming so hard to steal him, she couldn't lose him now.

"Fine. Then break up."

Both their expressions changed instantly.

Alexander's face darkened. "Evelyn, don't push it."

"You said anything," she sneered. "If you're just here to put on a show, spare me the disgust."

As she turned to leave, Lily finally dropped the act. "Alexander and I are getting married soon! Tell Sophia Reynolds she'll never steal him back!"

Evelyn glanced over her shoulder with a cold laugh. "Sophia wouldn't want your trash. But you? Proud of being a homewrecker? Pathetic."

"You know nothing! The one who isn't loved is the real homewrecker!" Lily shrieked. "Sophia and you are both losers compared to me and Isabella!"

"Lily!" Alexander snapped.

###Chapter 94

Alexander King's eyes burned with fury, but he suppressed it. Though Evelyn Sullivan's words enraged him, he didn't want to escalate things further.

Lily White watched coldly, disappointment flashing in her gaze. "Alex, I thought things would be different this time. But you keep letting me down. I need to reconsider our relationship."

She turned and walked away, her heels clicking sharply against the floor. Alexander stood rooted in place, his fists clenching and unclenching, but he didn’t follow.

"Happy now, Evelyn?"

Evelyn lifted her icy gaze. "Not my problem. You started this."

If they hadn’t provoked her, none of this would have happened. She knew Lily’s game—she just wanted Alexander to grovel.

Without another word, Evelyn strode into the MY Fashion Group building, her back rigid.

Two weeks later, Ethan Sullivan recovered enough to return to work.

Evelyn decided the timing was right and arranged to meet her senior, Dr. Evan, at a Western restaurant.

"Long time no see, junior." Evan pulled out a chair for her with a smile.

Evelyn sat and immediately picked up the menu. "Your treat?"

"Order whatever you want." He smirked. "I can afford it."

She swiftly selected her meal and handed the menu to the waiter. "Then I won’t hold back."

"You shouldn’t." Evan chuckled. "Otherwise, you’ll stay mad at me."

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. "Next time you gossip about me to the professor, I’ll return the favor with some of your stories."

"He adores you. Of course he’d ask about you." Evan spread his hands helplessly. "I had no choice."

"Tell him to ask me directly."

"Not a bad idea." A mischievous glint flashed in his eyes.

Evelyn rolled hers. "I’m visiting the sect next week. Coming? Rumor has it you haven’t been back in three years."

"Only because of you." He grinned. "Otherwise, the professor wouldn’t let me through the door."

"Mostly because I need you to stop him from beating me up."

"Serves you right!" Evan laughed. "He warned you not to save Ethan the first time. Now you’re doing it again? If he doesn’t make you kneel for three days, I’ll take your last name!"

Evelyn sighed.

No mercy from anyone.

"Last time was impulsive. But this time, his injuries are my fault..."

Evan frowned. "What happened?"

"Drop it." She pressed her lips together. "Once he’s healed, we’re even. We go our separate ways."

Seeing her reluctance, he changed the subject. "Taking him back to the sect?"

###Chapter 95

Evelyn Sullivan shook her head lightly, her fingers absently tracing the rim of her teacup.

"Once his legs are healed, we'll be even. There's no need for him to know who I am."

She had originally planned to take Ethan Sullivan back to her master's residence, but their recent tension made her reconsider.

Dr. Evan frowned and set his cup down with a sharp clink.

"You nearly died searching for that herb. He should at least know the truth!"

"And what would that change?" A cold smile touched her lips. "I want a clean break, not his guilt."

"You're impossible." He exhaled in frustration. "I've never met anyone as stubborn as you."

Evelyn deftly shifted the conversation to recent fluctuations in the herb market.

Meanwhile, in a private dining room across the restaurant, Isabella Jackson poured wine for Director Lott with practiced charm.

Beside her, Lily White sat stiffly, her manicured fingers clutching her skirt.

"Director, Lily may lack experience, but she's a fast learner." Isabella slid a resume across the table with a polished smile.

Director Lott studied Lily before speaking.

"Perform a scene for me."

Twenty minutes later, the role of the palace maid in Eternal Legacy was secured.

Lily's eyes shimmered with grateful tears as she bowed repeatedly.

On their way out, Tyler Lott suddenly grabbed Isabella's sleeve.

"Isabella, look! That woman over there could be your twin!"

Her gaze followed his pointing finger—and froze.

Across the room, Evelyn laughed with an unfamiliar man, utterly at ease.

Isabella's lips curled.

"Must be a coincidence." She feigned surprise. "Oh no, I left my keys inside. You two go ahead."

The moment they disappeared, she snapped a photo and sent it to Ethan.

[Ethan, your wife is on a date with another man.]

Her phone buzzed instantly.

Reading his reply, she smirked and strode out, satisfaction gleaming in her eyes.

When Evelyn pushed open the villa door that night, she met Ethan's glacial stare.

"Where were you?" His voice was razor-sharp.

"Dinner with a friend." She shrugged off her coat, indifferent.

"A male friend?" He surged to his feet, his shadow engulfing her. "We're still married!"

Evelyn's pupils contracted.

"You had me followed?"

"Guilty conscience?" His knuckles whitened. "Or is he the reason you're so eager for a divorce?"

###Chapter 96

Evelyn's eyes were icy cold.

"Find anything interesting?" Her lips curled into a mocking smile. "Did you catch me in bed with someone?"

Ethan's brow furrowed. Before he could speak, she turned and walked away.

The atmosphere in the villa plummeted to freezing.

Even the housekeeper noticed the tension. She quietly pulled Evelyn aside. "Miss Evelyn, you and Mr. Sullivan..."

"It's nothing." Evelyn cut her off. "He's under a lot of stress at work."

The housekeeper hesitated but left without another word.

Evelyn waited in the living room for Ethan to return for dinner. At seven o'clock, Colin called.

"Mr. Sullivan has a business dinner tonight."

She hung up, picked at her food, then went upstairs.

At the banquet hall, Ethan checked his phone every half hour.

When Colin handed it to him for the tenth time, he finally asked, "Are you expecting an important call, sir?"

"Did she ask where I was?" Ethan suddenly demanded.

Colin blinked. "Miss Evelyn just said she understood."

Ethan's expression darkened. He downed a glass of strong liquor in one gulp.

"Sir, you shouldn't drink any more—"

"Tell her to come pick me up."

The phone rang endlessly. No answer.

"Keep calling!"

After five missed calls, Ethan slammed his glass down. "Let's go!"

The villa was pitch black.

Ethan pushed open the bedroom door to find Evelyn curled up on the floor mattress, fast asleep. A surge of anger rose in his chest.

"Evelyn!"

She jolted awake, sitting up sharply. "What the hell is wrong with you?"

"Why didn't you answer your phone?"

Evelyn grabbed her phone and glanced at it, then laughed in disbelief. "I put it on silent when I sleep. Is that a problem?"

"You don't sleep until I'm home!"

His voice cut through the darkness like a blade.

###Chapter 97

"Were you planning to keep me awake all night waiting for you?" Evelyn rolled her eyes, her voice dripping with sarcasm.

"No."

"Hmm?"

"I wouldn’t stay out all night."

Ethan’s voice was low, but Evelyn didn’t even bother to look at him. She yawned and started to lie down. "Got it. Can I sleep now?"

"Evelyn!" His tone sharpened abruptly.

"What now?" She cracked an irritated eye open.

He stared at her for a few seconds before saying, "I’ve been drinking. Help me wash up."

Evelyn took a deep breath, barely resisting the urge to kick him off the bed. She dragged him toward the bathroom, roughly squeezed toothpaste onto his toothbrush, and shoved it into his hand. "Do it yourself!"

Once he finished brushing, she snatched a towel and scrubbed his face with enough force to peel skin.

"Easy." Ethan frowned.

"Sorry. Heavy-handed by nature." She smirked.

Finally done, she shoved him under the covers and snapped off the light.

In the darkness, Ethan spoke again. "About last time... I misunderstood you."

He had considered investigating the man she’d dined with but ultimately decided against it. The truth might only drive them further apart.

Evelyn lay with her back to him. After a long silence, she muttered, "Sleep."

The next morning, the other side of the bed was empty when she woke. She took her time getting ready before stepping out and spotting Ethan on a call in the living room.

The gray sweater he wore softened his usual sharp edges. Evelyn barely glanced at him before heading to the kitchen.

"Alexander wants to take you to lunch today to apologize," Ethan said after hanging up.

Evelyn paused. "Did he lose his mind?"

"He broke up with Lily." Ethan studied her reaction. "He mainly wants to apologize to you and Sophia."

"What does that have to do with me?" She scoffed. "Not going."

Ethan set down his coffee cup. "Suit yourself."

They ate breakfast in silence. As Evelyn cleared the dishes, she said abruptly, "I won’t be back for lunch. Tell the housekeeper not to cook for me."

"Where are you going?"

"Since when do you care?" She arched a brow. "Want to send someone to tail me? That way, you’ll know."

His expression darkened. "I’m not monitoring you."

"Then how did you know I was out with a man last time?" she shot back.

###Chapter 98

Ethan Sullivan remained silent. Evelyn Sullivan didn't press further. She changed her shoes and left the villa without another word.

At the café, Sophia Reynolds had been waiting for a while. The moment Evelyn sat down, Sophia blurted out urgently,

"Evelyn, it's an emergency!"

"What's so urgent?"

Sophia leaned in, lowering her voice. "My family set me up on a blind date, but I have an important meeting this afternoon. Can you go in my place?"

Evelyn nearly choked on her coffee.

"You want me to go on your blind date?"

"Please!" Sophia clasped her hands together. "Just this once!"

Evelyn stirred her coffee slowly, then suddenly smirked.

"Fine. But on one condition."

"What condition?"

"I'm traveling for work next week. Until I return, you handle all my responsibilities."

Sophia's eyes widened before she gritted her teeth and nodded. "Deal!"

After receiving the address, Sophia hurried off. Evelyn checked the time and decided to kill a few hours at the mall.

The moment she stepped into the luxury section, she ran straight into Isabella Jackson and Lily White.

Lily's face twisted with hatred the second she spotted Evelyn.

"Evelyn Sullivan!"

Evelyn ignored her and turned to leave.

"Stop right there!" Lily rushed forward, blocking her path. "You ruined my relationship with Alexander! You're not getting away today!"

She raised her hand to strike, but Evelyn caught her wrist midair.

"Let go, you bitch!"

A sharp slap echoed through the mall.

"That was for your lack of manners," Evelyn said coldly. "If you want to blame someone for your breakup, look no further than the girl standing beside you."

Isabella paled. "Sister, what nonsense are you saying?"

Lily clutched her cheek, then lunged at Evelyn in a frenzy. "I'll tear your mouth apart!"

Another slap landed.

"One more word, and you'll regret it."

Realizing she was outmatched, Lily glared venomously. "You'll pay for this!"

Isabella quickly steadied her. "Lily, let's just go..."

Once they were a safe distance away, Lily suddenly smirked. "Next Friday is the 'Eternal Legacy' premiere. I'll make sure the entire crew knows exactly what she's done."

A glint flashed in Isabella's eyes. "You mean..."

"I'll ruin her reputation beyond repair."

###Chapter 99

Isabella Jackson remained silent for a long moment, her fingers unconsciously tracing the rim of her coffee cup.

"Lily, this role wasn't easy to secure. If—"

"What's there to fear?" Lily White interrupted with a cold smirk. "I'll take the fall if anything happens."

Isabella lowered her lashes, a glint of ice flashing in her eyes.

At exactly three in the afternoon, Evelyn Sullivan pushed open the glass door of the café.

Her gaze immediately landed on the man sitting by the window. His silver-gray suit accentuated his broad shoulders, and behind his gold-rimmed glasses, his eyes were as gentle as jade.

"Mr. Wen?"

The moment he looked up, Evelyn felt as if a spring breeze had rippled across a lake.

"Miss Shen?" A flicker of admiration crossed Wen Qinghe's gaze.

The hem of Evelyn's dress swayed gracefully as she took her seat.

"Apologies, I'm here on Sophia's behalf," she said bluntly. "She isn't interested in dating right now."

Wen Qinghe tapped the table lightly with his fingers.

"But you're not her."

Evelyn's breath hitched.

"I've seen Miss Shen's photo," he continued, his smile unwavering. "Please let her know I look forward to meeting her in person."

...

Lucas Laurier's wineglass tilted abruptly in his grip.

Narrowing his eyes at the striking pair by the window, he immediately dialed his secretary. "Check Wen Qinghe's schedule for today."

As he ended the call, he caught sight of Wen Qinghe pulling out a chair for Evelyn. His knuckles tightened involuntarily.

On the drive back, Evelyn called Sophia Reynolds.

"We're busted," she sighed. "Your mom showed him your photo."

A groan came through the phone. "I knew it!"

"So our deal—"

"Still stands!" Sophia gritted her teeth. "I'll deal with my mom first, then thank you properly."

The moment Evelyn hung up, her phone began vibrating violently.

Ethan Sullivan's caller ID flashed on the screen, as if radiating tangible fury.
###Chapter 100

Ethan Sullivan's voice was icy cold, his suppressed fury evident through the phone.

"Where are you?"

"Just left the café. Heading back to Grand View."

"Get back here now!"

The call ended abruptly. Evelyn Sullivan stared at the darkened screen, her brow slightly furrowed.

Inside the villa, Ethan stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, his silhouette radiating chilling hostility.

"Explain yourself."

Evelyn set down her bag and met his gaze calmly.

"Explain what?"

"Daniel Sterling!" Ethan turned, his eyes blazing with anger. "You went behind my back to meet him?"

"You had me followed?"

"The entire restaurant saw you!" He slammed his phone onto the coffee table. The screen displayed a photo of her seated across from Daniel. "Mrs. Sullivan, are you that desperate for male attention?"

Evelyn scoffed and bent to pick up the phone.

"Compared to your cozy photos with Isabella, this is nothing."

"There's nothing between me and Isabella!"

"Really?" She tossed the phone back at him. "Need me to refresh your memory about those hotel photos?"

Ethan's expression darkened instantly. He seized her wrist.

"You investigated me?"

"Let go." She wrenched free of his grip. "If we're both playing games, don't act like the wronged party."

"Evelyn!" His voice held a dangerous warning. "Don't push me."

"Push you?" She laughed lightly. "Isabella is your limit, isn't she?"

Ethan's eyes flashed. In one swift motion, he pinned her against the wall.

"Say that again."

"I said—" She met his gaze unflinchingly. "Ethan, I want a divorce."

The air froze.

Ethan released her and took a step back, his lips curling into a mocking smile.

"For Daniel?"

"For myself." She turned toward the stairs. "I've had enough of these three years."

As the bedroom door clicked shut, Ethan drove his fist into the wall.

The phone rang abruptly.

"Ethan, we've got the details." Lucas Laurier's voice carried awkwardness. "The Sterling family originally arranged for Sophia to meet Daniel. She had an emergency, so Evelyn went to explain—"

Ethan ended the call.

His chest ached with an unfamiliar sting as he stared at the closed door upstairs.

At dinner, Evelyn descended with a suitcase.

"Where are you going?" Ethan stood at the foot of the stairs, his voice hoarse.

"Northville Villa." She brushed past him. "The divorce papers will be sent by my lawyer."

"What if I refuse to sign?"

She paused but didn't turn.

"Then we'll settle it in court."

The slam of the front door struck like a hammer.

Ethan overturned the dining table. The shattering of porcelain echoed through the empty villa.

Northville Villa had been uninhabited for months. The fridge was bare.

Evelyn drove to the supermarket and returned with groceries as the city lights flickered to life.

Her tired reflection stared back from the restaurant window.

As she stepped outside, a shadow collided with her.

Shopping bags scattered across the pavement.

"Sorry! So sorry!" The stranger frantically gathered her items—then froze upon looking up.

Evelyn's pupils contracted.

She'd recognize that face anywhere. Even in death.

###Chapter 101

The girl who bumped into Evelyn was around eighteen or nineteen, her high ponytail swinging as she frantically knelt to gather the scattered items.

"I'm so sorry, miss! I wasn't watching where I was going!"

Evelyn calmly collected her documents into her bag and glanced at the girl. "Be more careful next time."

The girl bit her lip, eyes reddening as she nodded.

Evelyn turned and headed toward the underground parking garage. The moment she started her car, a black sedan appeared in her rearview mirror, maintaining a steady distance.

Her fingers tapped the steering wheel as she dialed Ethan. "Call off your men."

His deep voice rumbled through the line. "It's not me."

Evelyn's pupils constricted. She hung up. If it wasn't Ethan... was it Scorpion?

Her red sports car accelerated sharply, speeding toward the outskirts of the city. But within minutes, her limbs grew heavy, her vision blurring.

Drugged?

The image of the clumsy girl outside the restaurant flashed through her mind. Fighting to stay conscious, she dialed Sophia. "Call the police—"

Her phone clattered to the floor as the car swerved and crashed into the guardrail.

BANG!

Ethan shot to his feet at the deafening noise, his face darkening. "Locate Evelyn. Now."

——

A biting pain dragged Evelyn back to awareness. She found herself tied to a rusted metal chair, her wrists raw and bleeding. The abandoned chemical factory reeked of harsh solvents.

The screech of metal echoed as the door swung open. Tyler Laurier and Vincent White strode in, smug triumph on their faces.

"Miss Sullivan," Tyler sneered. "You brought this on yourself."

Vincent waved impatiently. "Enough talk. Bring the contract."

When Evelyn saw the document, she let out a cold laugh. "So this is what you want."

"Untie her," Vincent ordered, arms crossed. "She won't get far."

Tyler hesitated. "She's cunning—"

"Relax." Vincent nudged a syringe with his foot. "That's enough anesthetic to keep her paralyzed for a day. And I've got three hundred men outside."

The ropes fell away. Vincent tossed a pen at Evelyn's feet.

"Sign it, and we'll make your death quick."

###Chapter 102

Vincent White narrowed his eyes as he studied Evelyn Sullivan. He had assumed she was just an ordinary PR representative, never expecting her to be Anna, the founder of MY Fashion Group. This revelation piqued his interest in the woman before him.

"Sign it." Vincent slammed the document onto the table, his tone leaving no room for argument.

Evelyn let out a cold laugh, her gaze icy. "In your dreams."

The smirk vanished from Vincent's face. With a subtle nod to his men, two burly henchmen stepped forward and roughly seized Evelyn's left wrist.

A sharp crack echoed as her wrist bone snapped. Pain shot through her, beads of sweat forming on her forehead, but she clenched her teeth and refused to make a sound.

"Must you make this difficult, Ms. Sullivan?" Vincent feigned sympathy with a sigh. "Sign the papers, and I'll have you taken to the hospital immediately."

Evelyn lifted her pale face, a chilling smile curling her lips. "Fine. Give me the pen."

Vincent smugly handed her the fountain pen—only to let out a bloodcurdling scream the next second. The pen had been driven deep into his left eye, blood streaming down his cheek.

"Grab her! I want her to suffer!" Vincent roared, clutching his eye.

Evelyn snatched up a chair and hurled it at the nearest thug before bolting for the warehouse exit. The drugs in her system made her limbs heavy, but sheer survival instinct fueled her desperate sprint.

"Two million! Two million to whoever catches her!" Vincent's enraged voice echoed behind her.

Outside, a dozen more henchmen stood waiting. Evelyn grabbed a wooden pole and charged into the crowd without hesitation. The pole became a weapon in her hands, felling three men before exhaustion finally overtook her.

Vincent staggered out, a gleaming dagger in his hand. His remaining eye was bloodshot, like a wounded beast.

"Mr. White, don't act rashly!" Tyler Laurier rushed to intervene. "The contract isn't signed yet!"

"Get lost!" Vincent backhanded him. "Today, I'm carving out her eyes myself!"

The dagger glinted coldly in the sunlight, inching closer to Evelyn's face. She stared back at Vincent, not a trace of fear in her eyes.

Just as the blade was about to touch her pupil, the roar of an engine cut through the air. A black SUV shot toward them like an arrow, barreling straight into the crowd!

###Chapter 103

"What's there to fear? This bitch's death would be a blessing! At worst, I'll flee abroad and live freely. As for you..." Vincent White shot Tyler Laurier a chilling glare. "You're on your own."

"But the contract hasn't been signed yet..."

Vincent waved impatiently, signaling his men to bring the document.

"Sign it!"

Evelyn Sullivan's eyes said everything—she would never comply willingly.

Weak and helpless, she watched as her hand was forced onto the contract.

Vincent tossed the signed papers at Tyler and pressed a dagger to his throat. "Go back to Serenity City and process the paperwork immediately. Remember, I have your entire family."

Tyler's pupils constricted. "You—"

"Don't act so surprised." Vincent sneered, tapping the blade against Tyler's cheek. "If you obey, they live."

Clenching his teeth in fury, Tyler could only grip the contract and flee in panic.

Vincent turned to Evelyn and struck her twice across the face.

"Bitch, I'll make you wish you were dead."

Blood trickled from Evelyn's lips, but her gaze remained icy.

"Choose—left eye or right?" Vincent toyed with the dagger, tracing the tip before her eyes.

When she stayed silent, he smirked. "Left it is."

The blade flashed. Evelyn jerked her head aside. The dagger plunged deep into her shoulder, staining her clothes crimson.

The searing pain made her grimace, but she realized—her limbs were regaining sensation.

In a sudden burst of strength, she yanked the dagger from her shoulder!

Blood sprayed as Vincent stumbled back, barely avoiding a fatal strike.

"Grab her!" he roared.

Evelyn moved like a phantom, the bloodied blade dancing through the air. With each flash, another man fell.

Vincent's expression darkened.

This woman had to die.

"Bring the last vial!" he snarled.

It was an imported neurotoxin worth millions, originally reserved for his greatest rival. But now—

His trembling subordinate handed him the syringe.

"Inject her when she's distracted!"

Amid the chaos, Evelyn didn't notice the lethal needle closing in—

###Chapter 104

Evelyn's vision began to blur. A sharp pain shot through her arm.

She looked down to find a syringe embedded in her flesh. Her gaze turned icy.

With a swift motion, she yanked it out—only to realize half the drug had already been injected.

"Trying to poison me?" She smirked, using her last ounce of strength to plunge the remaining liquid into her attacker's arm.

Her legs gave way. She collapsed hard onto the floor.

When Ethan arrived, the scene before him froze his blood—Evelyn lay in a pool of crimson, her face deathly pale.

"Leave no one alive." His voice was colder than Arctic ice.

Vincent's grin stiffened. Dozens of black-clad men swarmed from all directions, swiftly overpowering his men.

Then he saw the man in the wheelchair. His knees trembled uncontrollably.

"M-Mr. Sullivan..."

Ethan didn't even glance at him. His hands shook as he gathered Evelyn into his arms. Her blood soaked through his shirt.

"Get a doctor. Now!"

His gaze landed on her swollen cheek. The air around him turned lethal.

"Who hit her?"

Vincent frantically waved his hands. "Not me—"

Ethan's lips curled into a cruel smile. "If you won't tell the truth, you won't need your tongue."

Screams echoed through the warehouse.

Vincent knelt, forehead smacking the ground, mouth dripping blood.

"Mr. Sullivan, these men—"

"Make them wish they were dead."

"And Vincent?"

"Chop him up. Feed him to the dogs."

Evelyn opened her eyes to a familiar ceiling.

She blinked, memories of the attack flooding back. That embrace—it had been Ethan.

The sound of a turning doorknob interrupted her thoughts.

Ethan entered with a bowl of soup, his wheelchair gliding silently over the carpet.

"You're awake." His voice was soft, almost cautious.

Evelyn lowered her lashes. "Thank you."

"Drink this first." He handed her the bowl. "The drug drained you. You need to recover."

The aroma of chicken broth filled the room. She took small sips, the silence between them making her pulse quicken.

"Move back in." His sudden command startled her.

Evelyn's fingers twitched. "That's not necessary—"

"The security here is better." His tone brooked no argument, though concern flickered in his eyes.

She studied his tense jawline and found herself unable to refuse.

###Chapter 105

"I'll stay here while recovering. I'll move back once I'm better." Evelyn Sullivan tightened the blanket around her shoulders, her voice barely audible.

Ethan Sullivan's cigarette snapped between his fingers, ashes scattering across the black marble coffee table.

"What about Vincent White?"

"Dead."

Evelyn's head jerked up, her pupils contracting. "You did it?"

"Cliff dive." Ethan brushed nonexistent dust from his sleeve. "By the time they found him, wild wolves had picked his bones clean."

Even if the fall hadn't killed him, he would've finished the bastard himself.

"And Tyler Laurier..."

"Turned himself in." Ethan suddenly leaned in, closing the distance between them. "Was a mere MY employee worth such an elaborate scheme?"

Evelyn's fingers clenched the edge of the blanket. "Tyler sent me to sign a contract. Vincent tried to coerce me into sleeping with him. I beat him up instead."

Ethan's lips curled into a cold smile. "Firing you would've been simpler."

"Sophia is my best friend!" Her temple throbbed. "As for why Vincent dragged Tyler into this—since when do psychopaths need reasons?"

The air froze between them.

"Rest." Ethan turned sharply, the fabric of his suit pants cutting a clean line through the air. "Ring if you need anything."

The moment the door clicked shut, Evelyn collapsed onto the sofa like a puppet with its strings cut.

That afternoon, Sophia burst in, nearly knocking over the medicine bowl.

"Do you know I almost called the police?" Her eyes were red as she yanked Evelyn's collar aside to inspect the wounds. "That bastard Tyler—"

"Still breathing." Evelyn swatted her hand away. "Keep touching and I'll charge you."

Sophia tossed a stack of documents onto the table. "This shady contract is enough to put Tyler away for life. You're really destroying it?"

"Yes."

"Afraid Ethan will find out you're MY's real owner?" Sophia leaned in suddenly. "Don't tell me...you're having second thoughts?"

Evelyn's fingers twitched, the medicine spoon clinking against the bowl.

"The divorce papers are signed."

Yet in her midnight dreams, she still saw Ethan carrying her bloodied body out of the warehouse. Moonlight had caught the rigid line of his jaw—an expression of sheer anguish.

Before leaving, Sophia turned back. "Tyler keeps demanding to see you from his jail cell."

The police arrived with the same message on their third visit.

###Chapter 106

"Alright, I'll come tomorrow." Evelyn Sullivan's fingers tightened slightly around her phone, her voice calm and unreadable.

The next morning, Evelyn drove alone to the police station.

In the interrogation room, Tyler Laurier sat hunched on a metal chair. In just a few days, his temples had turned gray, his eyes sunken, the once-confident demeanor completely gone.

"Evelyn Sullivan!" His head jerked up, hatred burning in his dull eyes. "Vincent White is dead, and I'm going to prison. Are you happy now?"

Evelyn pulled out a chair and sat, her black trench coat cutting a sharp arc through the air. "Mr. Laurier, you brought this on yourselves."

Tyler slammed his cuffed fists onto the table, the chains rattling. "I called you here today to discuss my 10% stake in the company."

"Oh?" Evelyn arched a brow.

"I want to transfer the shares to my son." Tyler lowered his voice. "He won't interfere with company affairs—just the annual dividends—"

"Mr. Laurier," Evelyn laughed lightly, "do I look like a charity to you?"

His face darkened. "Don't forget about your secret! I could sell it for a good price!"

The air froze.

Evelyn leaned forward slowly, her red lips parting. "Are you threatening me?"

"It's a transaction." Tyler forced his voice steady. "Five million is too low. At least—"

"Tyler Laurier." Evelyn cut him off. "Your son just bought a Porsche last week, didn't he? With the embezzled company funds?"

Tyler's pupils contracted.

"Your family has been living lavishly all these years. Now that you're in prison, they won’t even pay for visitation fees." Evelyn tapped the table lightly with her fingers. "Five million should be enough for them to pretend they care while you serve your sentence."

Tyler's face turned ashen. He knew his wife had moved her lover into their villa, and his son was busy selling off his prized collections.

"Sign the agreement." Evelyn slid a document toward him. "The lawyer is already on his way."

The pen trembled in Tyler's hand. As the final stroke dried, he suddenly looked up. "Evelyn Sullivan, you'll get what's coming to you!"

"Karma?" Evelyn collected the papers, her lips curving into a cold smile. "When you embezzled project funds and left three workers disabled, did you ever fear karma?"

Stepping out of the police station, the harsh sunlight made Evelyn squint. She raised a hand to shield her eyes—and spotted Dr. Evan leaning against his car, waving at her.

"All settled?" He handed her a cup of hot coffee.

Evelyn took the cup, warmth seeping into her fingertips. "What are you doing here, Evan?"

###Chapter 107

"The housekeeper told me you were at the police station."

"Packed and ready to go."

"Mm."

The villa was filled with the aroma of cooking. The housekeeper bustled in the kitchen, hurrying out when she heard the door open.

"Miss Sullivan, a gentleman came looking for you earlier."

Evelyn paused mid-step. "Noted."

"Are you leaving?"

"For about a week. Please inform Mr. Sullivan when he returns."

The housekeeper hesitated. "Won't you tell him yourself?"

"He's busy with work." Evelyn lifted her suitcase. "The flight takes seven or eight hours. By the time I land, he should be resting."

"Very well."

The housekeeper opened her mouth as if to say more but thought better of it.

Night fell.

Ethan pushed open the door to silence. He dialed a number, only to hear the automated female voice.

"The number you have dialed is currently switched off."

The housekeeper emerged with a dish. "Mr. Sullivan, Miss Sullivan asked me to inform you she’s away on business for a week."

"When?" His voice turned icy.

"Three this afternoon—"

Thud! His phone slammed onto the coffee table.

The housekeeper flinched. "She said she didn’t want to disturb you—"

"Get out."

The phone rang abruptly.

"Find her flight details."

Ten minutes later, Colin messaged:
Licheng. Traveling with Dr. Evan.

Ethan stared at the screen. The heir to the Howard family? Since when did they know each other?

Licheng—a remote town in the southwest. She’d never mentioned going there.

He was beginning to realize how little he understood this woman.

Have someone watch the airport.

Understood.

The tarmac gleamed coldly in the early hours.

Evelyn turned off airplane mode. Her screen was blank, wiped clean.

She smirked wryly.

The SUV pulled away from the airport. The scenery outside was both foreign and familiar.

"We’re being followed," the driver muttered under his breath.

###Chapter 108

Evelyn Sullivan had just stepped out of the airport when a chill ran down the back of her neck.

She slowed her pace subtly, scanning the area with her peripheral vision.

"We're being followed," she murmured under her breath.

Dr. Evan adjusted his glasses, the lenses reflecting a cold glint.

"Two cars, alternating positions," he said calmly. "They've been tailing us since the airport."

They exchanged a glance and silently altered their original route.

"Head to the hotel," Evan instructed as he dialed a number. "Find out who sent them."

Inside the hotel room, Evelyn peered through the gap in the curtains.

"Still there," she frowned. "Two separate groups."

Evan tossed the dismantled listening device into the toilet, the sound of flushing masking their conversation.

"Master's secret must stay hidden," Evelyn tapped her fingers lightly on the table.

The door suddenly burst open.

"Police raid!"

Evelyn nearly reacted on instinct as officers stormed in.

An hour later, outside the police station.

"Apologies, it was a mistake," the officer said awkwardly.

Back at the hotel, they booked separate rooms.

Meanwhile, at Sullivan Group headquarters in Rongcheng.

"Mr. Sullivan, Ms. Sullivan checked in alone," the voice on the phone reported.

The pen in Ethan Sullivan's hand snapped in half.

"Keep watching her."

The next morning at breakfast, Evan wore a strange expression.

"I found out. One group was after me."

Evelyn paused mid-stir of her coffee.

"And the other?"

"Your ex-husband."

Her cup slammed onto the table.

She stepped into a corner and dialed a number.

"Call off your men," she said icily.

Ethan's cold laugh echoed through the receiver.

"Explain why you booked a room first."

A smirk curled Evelyn's lips.

"Guess," she said before hanging up abruptly.

###Chapter 109

"Was it you last night?!"

Ethan Sullivan's voice was icy. "That was just the beginning. If I see you making eyes at Dr. Evan again, I'll drag you back myself!"

"Mr. Sullivan, I came to Licheng to find a cure for your legs!"

"Then why sneak around?"

"When did I sneak around?"

"You left without a word, had a servant deliver your message—afraid I'd know you were coming here?"

Evelyn Sullivan fell silent.

"What? No comeback?"

"Think whatever you want. Call off your men, or I won't hold back."

"Fine. I’d love to see you try."

The call ended abruptly. Ethan's grip on the phone turned his knuckles white. She dared hang up on him.

"Colin, book two tickets to Licheng. Now."

On the other side, Evelyn returned to her seat across from Dr. Evan, her expression cool. "He misunderstood our relationship. Refuses to withdraw his men."

Dr. Evan smirked. "Seems your husband cares more than you claimed. Want me to test how much?"

"Are you bored? Focus on losing his surveillance first."

"Easy. But don’t you want to know what he’s really thinking?"

"No. And if you keep talking, I’ll tell Prof. Cloud about your little escapades."

Dr. Evan shut up.

Late that night, Ethan arrived in Licheng—only to learn his men had lost her.

"Sir, they lost her in the northern district. Only one road leads out..."

"Forget it. Watch the airport. Alert me the moment she appears."

Once alone, Ethan's gaze darkened.

Two years ago, Evelyn had vanished just like this—returning with the antidote and acupuncture techniques that healed his legs. Back then, he’d barely questioned it when she credited a "Dr. Crescent."

Now, he saw the gaps. The mysteries he’d ignored.

He dialed her number.

Straight to voicemail.

Before a bamboo cottage, an elderly man ground herbs, not glancing up at the approaching car. "Decided to come back?"

Evelyn and Dr. Evan exchanged grins, stepping forward.

"Master, three years later, and you’re still the picture of wisdom!"

The old man shot her a sidelong look. "Am I?"

###Chapter 110

"Master, I wouldn't dare lie to you!" Evelyn Sullivan blinked innocently.

Professor Cloud snorted, slamming his palm-leaf fan onto the table. "If it weren't for treating that Sullivan boy's leg, would you even bother visiting this old man?"

Evelyn ducked her head, muttering under her breath, "I was afraid you'd scold me..."

"Afraid and still ran away?" Professor Cloud's eyes widened. "All your seniors stayed until they mastered their skills. Only you, half-trained, dared to leave!"

The aroma of food wafted from the kitchen. Evelyn's eyes lit up. "Master, are we having mushroom chicken stew tonight?"

"Dream on!" His beard twitched. "You're eating vegetables!"

"You'd never make me!" She giggled and darted toward the kitchen. "I'll help Lily with the fire!"

Watching her skip away, Professor Cloud sighed. "That girl..."

Dr. Evan handed him a steaming cup of tea. "Don't be angry, Master. That's just how she is."

"How is she doing in Licheng?" The professor traced the rim of his cup, his voice low.

Dr. Evan paused. "Not as lively as before."

"Hmph!" The cup clattered onto the table. "Those Jackson ingrates abandoned her over some fortune-teller's nonsense. They only took her back for her bone marrow!"

"Master..."

"Enough." He waved a hand. "Someone will deal with them."

Dr. Evan looked up, puzzled. "Who?"

"The Xiao Family of the capital." Professor Cloud narrowed his eyes. "If they find out..."

Dr. Evan inhaled sharply. The Xiao Family—whose mere footsteps could shake the entire capital?

In the kitchen, Lily Cloud fed firewood into the stove.

"Elder Sister, is the outside world fun?" The young girl's eyes sparkled.

Evelyn stirred the greens in the wok. "You'll know when you turn twenty."

"Two more years!" Lily pouted. "Grandpa's so old-fashioned!"

"He just wants to protect you." Evelyn pinched her cheek. "There are many bad people out there."

"With you and my seniors around, who'd dare bully me?" Lily brandished a fire poker. "I could take on ten with this!"

Evelyn chuckled. "You'll understand when you leave."

"But what about Grandpa?" Lily's expression dimmed. "He'd be so lonely alone."

Evelyn gazed out the window. "Master could return to the capital..."

"He says someone there doesn't want him back." Lily tilted her head. "Why? Grandpa's saved so many lives..."

The fire crackled, casting flickering shadows across Evelyn's thoughtful face.

###Chapter 111: The Blood Snow Lotus

"You'll understand when you're older."
"Okay."

The kitchen was filled with the aroma of food. Evelyn was about to press further when Prof. Cloud suddenly pushed the door open, his expression dark and foreboding.

"Where's the food?!" He slammed his hand on the stove. "The pot's about to burn through, and you're still chatting!"

Evelyn suppressed a smile. The old man was clearly venting his frustration. Ever since her return, he'd been finding fault with everything she did.

The firelight flickered across half her face. These peaceful days were numbered.

Once Lily could handle things on her own, the old man would return to the capital.

Seeing them both silently tending to the cooking, Prof. Cloud snorted and stormed out, his sleeves flaring dramatically.

As the door curtain swayed, Evelyn and Lily exchanged a knowing smile.

From the next day onward, Prof. Cloud pushed all incoming patients onto the two of them.

"Testing whether your skills have rusted," he said, pacing with his hands behind his back—though his eyes kept darting toward the aged liquor hidden in the medicine cabinet.

They treated over a hundred patients daily, leaving Lily's wrists sore from preparing prescriptions. On the eve of their departure, Prof. Cloud finally granted them a reprieve.

Flipping through their case records, his beard twitched. "At least you haven't completely disgraced me."

"Master, do you usually see this many patients?"

Prof. Cloud narrowed his eyes. "Of course not. These were two months' worth of backlog. Now that you've cleared them, I can relax for a while."

Evelyn's fingers stilled. Rumors painted the Ghost Doctor as eccentric, but in private, he was just a mischievous old man.

"Should we... visit more often?"

"No!" Prof. Cloud waved his hands dismissively. "Once in a while is enough. Seeing you every day would drive me mad."

Dr. Evan chuckled, earning himself a glare.

"Go pack!" Prof. Cloud shooed them away. "You leave at dawn."

As Evelyn folded her clothes, Lily entered carrying an ornate box.

"Grandfather gave this to you."

Inside lay a Blood Snow Lotus, its crimson petals vivid as sunset. Lily's expression was solemn. "Remember, Sister, this is the last one."

Evelyn traced the petals with her fingertips and exhaled deeply. Ethan's legs could finally be healed.

At the farewell dinner, Prof. Cloud personally cooked. After three rounds of drinks, he excused himself abruptly.

"Grandfather's hiding in his room crying," Lily said, her eyes red. "These past few days, he's been staying up late, rereading your old case records."

At daybreak, the three of them bowed in farewell outside his closed door.

In the airport terminal, a black-suited bodyguard blocked their path.

"Miss Sullivan, Mr. Sullivan requests your presence."

###Chapter 112

Evelyn took a cautious step back, her cold gaze sweeping over the black-clad figures before her.

"Who are you?"

The lead operative gave a slight bow. "Ms. Sullivan, Mr. Sullivan requests your presence."

"Ethan?"

"Yes."

Surprise flickered in Evelyn's eyes. "He's in Licheng?"

"He came specifically to find you."

She turned to Dr. Evan. "Dr. Howard, I—"

"I'm coming with you," he interrupted.

Thirty minutes later, a black sedan pulled up at Licheng International Hotel.

The elevator ascended directly to the penthouse. The operatives escorted them to the presidential suite before departing.

Colin opened the door. "Ms. Sullivan, the CEO is waiting inside."

When Dr. Evan moved to follow, Colin blocked his path. "Mr. Sullivan wishes to speak with Ms. Sullivan alone."

Evelyn offered Dr. Evan a reassuring smile. "Please have the kitchen prepare something light for lunch. Dr. Howard has a sensitive stomach."

Pushing open the inner door, she found Ethan seated by the floor-to-ceiling windows, reviewing documents.

He looked up at the sound of her entrance.

"Evelyn Sullivan."

His voice was glacial.

"Do you have any idea how long I've been searching for you?"

She took the seat opposite him. "Mr. Sullivan, I thought we agreed not to interfere in each other's affairs."

"What gave you that impression?" He snapped the file shut.

"I was gathering medicinal herbs for your leg treatment this week."

"With him?" Ethan's gaze sharpened like a blade.

"Dr. Howard is the renowned physician Crescent who treated your legs three years ago."

Ethan's laugh was icy. "There are limits to how far a lie can stretch."

"You can ask him yourself." Evelyn remained composed.

She'd texted Dr. Evan instructions to play along before entering the car.

"You'd better hope I don't discover any discrepancies," Ethan warned, his voice dangerous.

"The truth will reveal itself in a month."

The temperature in the room seemed to plummet.

"So eager for the divorce?" Ethan asked abruptly.

"Isn't that what you've always wanted?"

The air thickened with tension.

"Your flight's been canceled. We return to New York together tomorrow." He turned toward the window, ending the conversation.

###Chapter 113

Ethan Sullivan's decisions were never open to debate. Evelyn Sullivan knew this all too well, so she simply nodded. "Alright. Where will Dr. Evan stay?"

"Colin will arrange it." Ethan's gaze darkened. "You're staying with me."

As Evelyn turned to leave, Ethan immediately made a call. "Track their movements over the past few days."

He didn’t believe a word of Evelyn’s explanation. Losing his men so precisely couldn’t have been a simple wrong turn.

Night fell. Just as Evelyn stepped out for some air, Ethan demanded his acupuncture treatment.

"Now?" She frowned slightly.

"Problem?"

Evelyn called Dr. Evan. Within ten minutes, he arrived with his acupuncture kit.

"Mr. Sullivan, this will hurt more than three years ago." Evan unrolled the silver needles. "Tell me if you need to stop."

Colin helped Ethan lie flat on the bed. Evelyn was asked to leave the room.

As each needle was inserted, beads of sweat formed on Ethan’s forehead. When the needles reached the points on his calves, his fingers clenched the sheets.

"The worst is coming," Evan warned.

By the final needle, Ethan’s back was drenched. Evan’s eyes flickered with surprise—most people couldn’t endure the first needle, yet this man hadn’t made a sound.

"Needles come out in thirty minutes."

Ethan lacked the strength to respond, managing only a faint nod.

When the needles were removed, his face was ghostly pale.

"Try walking a few steps," Evan said, packing up. "But the pain will intensify."

Evelyn was called back in to find Ethan struggling to sit up. His full weight pressed onto her shoulders as he took his first step. Instantly, his shirt was soaked with sweat.

"Don’t push yourself," Evelyn murmured, feeling his muscles tremble. "After three sessions—"

"Keep going," Ethan gritted out.

On the fifth step, his legs gave out. He lurched forward, but Evelyn caught him and guided him back to the bed.

"I’ll get some water."

As she turned, his hand locked around her wrist.

"How long," he rasped, voice raw, "until my legs are healed?"

###Chapter 114

Evelyn arched a brow. "At least three months, depending on your rehabilitation progress."

Ethan gave a slight nod. "Hmm."

"Why the sudden question?" She set down the medical chart. "Eager to recover?"

"Just curious."

Evelyn didn't press further and turned to fetch water from the bathroom. Drawing from her previous experience, she efficiently helped Ethan wash up, her expression calm throughout.

"Mr. Sullivan," she said, folding the towel neatly. "I'll be sleeping in the guest room tonight. Call if you need anything."

Ethan's face darkened instantly, his eyes flashing with cold fury.

"Evelyn Sullivan, we're still married!" His voice was icy. "You'd leave a paralyzed man alone without a second thought?"

"You were managing just fine at the hospital," she pointed out evenly.

"That was out of necessity!" He scoffed. "You couldn't even be bothered to visit me there. Who else could I rely on?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together and walked toward the guest room.

When she returned with bedding, Ethan's expression remained stormy. Silently, she laid out the futon. Just as she reached for the light switch, her phone buzzed.

The name "Victoria Farley" on the screen made her fingers freeze. It was the first time her mother had ever called her.

She declined the call.

The phone rang three more times before Evelyn blocked the number in irritation.

A message from Isabella popped up immediately:
[Are you insane? Mom was humiliated in front of the socialites today and nearly fainted!]
[The whole city is talking about the scandal online. Apologize to her now!]

Evelyn opened Twitter. The trending hashtags glared back at her:
#JacksonHeiressAssaultsInnocentWoman
#EvelynStealsSistersMan

The first tag linked to a video of the mall incident. The second featured a viral post accusing her of stealing Isabella's boyfriend and flaunting their relationship to torment her sister.

Her lips curled into a cold smile as she dialed Sophia. "Look into these hashtags. I bet Lily White is behind this."

Twenty minutes later, Sophia called back. "Got it! Lily landed the supporting actress role in Eternal Legacy. At today's press conference, she played the victim, claiming you stole her best friend's man. She even paid influencers to push the narrative!"

"She's in Eternal Legacy?" Evelyn mused.

"That's what you focus on?" Sophia snapped. "She's painting you as a homewrecker!"

Evelyn stared at the trending page, her eyes glinting with frost.

###Chapter 115

Evelyn's finger hovered over her phone screen for three seconds before she spoke coldly, "Call the police."

"Understood. I'll handle it immediately."

The moment the call ended, she felt Ethan's burning gaze. She turned to meet his mocking eyes and frowned. "Is there something you need, Mr. Sullivan?"

He tilted his phone toward her, revealing a photo she had secretly taken of his profile. His lips curved slightly. "So, Miss Sullivan enjoys taking pictures of me without permission?"

In the photo, she was hiding behind a pillar, her gaze fixed on him as if he were the only person in the world. The tips of Evelyn's ears burned—those leaked photos were undeniable proof of her once-hopeless crush.

"That was a childish mistake," she said flatly, turning her face away.

Ethan's smile vanished. He seized her wrist. "And now?"

"Why ask when you already know the answer?"

For three years, she had followed him like a shadow, only to be left behind. Now that she had walked away, he wouldn’t let go. The irony was bitter.

After a long silence, he released her. "Do you need me to handle the trending scandal?"

"No," Evelyn rubbed her reddened wrist. "It'll be resolved soon."

"I'm your husband." His voice was rough. "You can rely on me."

"I said I don't need your help!" She stood abruptly. "We're even. Goodnight."

She snapped off the lights and turned her back to him, cocooning herself in the blankets. In the darkness, Ethan's sigh was barely audible.

At dawn, William's call arrived right on schedule.

Evelyn stared at the flashing name on her screen, a cold smirk forming. The moment she answered, his furious roar erupted. "Issue a public apology immediately! The Jackson Group's stocks have dropped five percent!"

"Why should I?"

"Because you're a Jackson!" He panted heavily. "Just post a statement saying you were young and foolish. That’ll be the end of it."

Her nails dug into her palm. The whole world knew she was Ethan's lawfully wedded wife, yet her own father wanted her to admit she was a homewrecker?

"Your company's losses aren't my concern."

Scuffling noises came through the line before Victoria's shrill voice pierced her ears. "Ungrateful brat! After everything we've done for you, this is how you repay us?"

"And how exactly should I repay you?" Evelyn laughed softly. "By taking the fall for Isabella?"

"You—"

"Tell Isabella this," she enunciated each word. "Either she clears my name, or we settle this in court."

The call ended with a violent click. Evelyn watched the lightening sky outside before tossing her phone onto the couch.
######Chapter 116

Evelyn Sullivan's fingers turned icy as she answered.

"You ungrateful wretch! I should've left you at the orphanage—"

She stabbed the end-call button, knuckles whitening.

August sunlight filtered through the curtains but couldn't dispel the chill around her.

"Is this how the Jacksons raise their daughters?" Ethan Sullivan's wheelchair halted in the corridor shadows, his voice glacial.

Evelyn pocketed her phone and turned to leave.

"Stop."

His calloused fingers clamped around her wrist with bruising force.

"Mr. Sullivan, mind your manners."

She wrenched free, frost crystallizing in her eyes.

"I'm your husband!"

"Husband?" Evelyn laughed abruptly. "You've always enjoyed watching me suffer, haven't you?"

Ethan's expression darkened.

Water drummed against the shower tiles.

The mirror reflected Evelyn's red-rimmed eyes. She scrubbed her face roughly.

When she emerged, Ethan remained motionless, shadows carving his sharp features.

"Breakfast is served."

Coffee aroma drifted through the dining room.

Dr. Evan waved from a corner table. "Over here!"

Evelyn pushed the wheelchair forward, catching Ethan's gritted "Whatever."

Porcelain clinked sharply.

"The film crew's relocating this afternoon?" Evan asked suddenly.

Ethan set down his fork. "Three o'clock flight to Rongcheng."

Elevator numbers blinked upward.

"I'm sorry."

The apology rumbled in Ethan's chest.

Evelyn's grip on the wheelchair tightened slightly.

"It's over."

She missed seeing Ethan's whitened knuckles as she turned away.

An open suitcase sprawled across the bed.

Her phone vibrated violently.

"Evelyn Sullivan! How dare you call the police?" Lily White's shriek nearly shattered her eardrum.

"Isabella gave you this number?"

"Stop playing dumb! Every online exposé is true!"

Evelyn chuckled softly. "Then explain yourself to the officers, Miss White."

The call ended with a decisive tap.

Outside, sirens wailed in the distance.

###Chapter 117

The moment the call ended, Lily White's delicate features twisted with rage.

Her grip on the phone tightened, her freshly manicured nails digging into her palm without her even noticing the pain.

"Evelyn Sullivan!"

The name hissed through her clenched teeth, dripping with venomous hatred.

She immediately dialed her mother, her voice trembling with tears. "Mom, that bitch Evelyn bullied me!"

Inside the White family villa, Mrs. White's face darkened like a storm cloud as she listened to her daughter's sobs.

"Don't worry, darling. I'll go have a word with Victoria Farley about this!"

Victoria was arranging flowers in the living room when Mrs. White barged in, nearly causing her to drop the scissors.

"Mrs. White, what—"

"Your precious daughter!" Mrs. White slammed her phone onto the coffee table. "Look what she's done!"

Victoria's face paled as she read the news on the screen.

"That ungrateful wretch!"

Mrs. White stood, her voice icy. "If this ruins Lily's career, the White family won't let this go!"

After seeing Mrs. White out, Victoria immediately summoned Isabella.

"Contact that disgraceful daughter of mine, now!"

Isabella bit her lip, eyes red-rimmed. "Mom... she blocked me."

Victoria trembled with fury, sweeping a vase off the table with a crash.

"How dare she defy me like this!"

Meanwhile, Evelyn's plane had just landed.

As her phone powered on, a flood of missed call notifications popped up—William Jackson, Eleanor Jackson, Charles Jackson...

She scoffed and muted the device.

"Mr. Sullivan, I'll be going now."

Ethan Sullivan seized her wrist. "I'll drive you."

"No need."

"Evelyn." His voice was glacial. "Get in the car, or walk."

After a tense standoff, Evelyn finally slid into the passenger seat.

When the car stopped outside Grand View Villa, she made no move to exit.

"Colin will take you inside."

Ethan narrowed his eyes. "Don't test my patience."

Evelyn shoved the door open and strode toward the curb without looking back.

"Evelyn!"

His furious roar followed her as she hailed a taxi.

She had barely stepped inside her home when the doorbell rang.

Through the peephole, she saw Ethan's stormy expression and turned away.

"I know you're there." His voice carried through the door. "Open up, or I'll call a locksmith."

Evelyn yanked the door open. "What do you want?"

Ethan slid a hand into his pocket, his tone deceptively calm. "Move in with me."

###Chapter 118

Evelyn's lips curved into a meaningful smile.

"Mr. Sullivan, this is Daniel Sterling's villa. Doesn't it bother you to stay here?"

Ethan's eyes turned icy. Just as Evelyn thought he would storm off, his deep voice cut through the silence.

"If he was willing to lend it to you, I doubt he'd mind an extra guest."

Evelyn clenched her jaw. "I don't want to live under the same roof as you."

"Either prepare a room for me, or come back to Grand View with me." His voice was cold. "Don't forget who put me in this wheelchair."

The air froze for several seconds.

"Fine. I'll go back with you."

She couldn't stand the thought of Ethan staying here, nor did she want any lingering entanglements.

Late that night, they returned to Grand View. Evelyn headed straight for the guest bedroom. Surprisingly, Ethan didn't stop her. Now that she was back, he could afford to be patient.

The next morning, as Evelyn approached the entrance of MY Fashion Group, she spotted Victoria Farley and Isabella Jackson waiting for her.

Victoria lunged forward, hand raised to strike. "Drop the lawsuit immediately! You're humiliating our family!"

Evelyn sidestepped the slap. Victoria trembled with rage. "How dare you dodge?"

"Why wouldn't I?"

"I'm your mother! I have every right to discipline you!"

Isabella quickly chimed in. "Sister, Mom hasn't slept all night because of you. How can you let her beg the White family like this?"

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Lily White slandered me online. Instead of confronting her, you're here pressuring me to withdraw the lawsuit?"

Victoria shrieked. "If you'd done nothing wrong, would she have posted those things?! If you don't drop this lawsuit today, I disown you!"

"You're right. I did make a mistake." Evelyn spoke each word deliberately.

Victoria's face lit with triumph. "Good! It's not too late to apologize!"

"My mistake was returning to the Jackson family at sixteen, believing you actually wanted to make amends." Evelyn's gaze turned glacial. "And worse—thinking there was still hope for us."

Isabella paled. Victoria snapped, "Donating your bone marrow to Isabella was your duty!"

"From now on, I won't step foot in the Jackson home again." Evelyn turned to leave. "Consider me dead to you."

Victoria's voice rose to a hysterical pitch. "I should've strangled you at birth!"

###Chapter 119

Evelyn Sullivan walked away without hesitation, her back rigid with icy resolve.

Isabella Jackson quickly steadied the trembling Victoria Farley, her voice choked with tears. "Mom, please don't be angry. Evelyn just—"

"Enough!" Victoria's chest heaved violently. "From now on, you're my only daughter!"

A glint of triumph flashed in Isabella's eyes, though she feigned concern with a furrowed brow. "Mom, don't say that... I'll handle the White family."

Victoria clasped her hand, eyes brimming with affection. "You're the only one who understands me."

After escorting Victoria home, Isabella immediately dialed Mrs. White.

"Aunt Vanessa, about my sister..."

As dusk settled, Evelyn stepped out of MY Fashion Group's headquarters. A dark figure lunged at her from the side.

She dodged with razor-sharp reflexes. A bucket of crimson paint splattered the ground like a pool of blood, barely missing her coat.

The attacker bolted. Nearby, an accomplice revved a motorcycle and flipped her off with a crude gesture.

Evelyn smirked and dialed a number. "Find them."

An hour later, at the police station.

Mrs. White was dragged in, snarling like a rabid animal. "You little bitch! The Whites will destroy you!"

A sharp slap echoed through the room.

"Ah—!" Mrs. White shrieked, clutching her cheek. "I'll ruin you in this city!"

Evelyn flexed her stinging palm. "One slap clearly wasn’t enough to teach you a lesson."

By the time she finished giving her statement, night had fallen.

News spread like wildfire. By morning, every elite in the city was whispering.

At a high-society card game, a socialite sneered, "Mrs. Farley, how brave of you to show your face."

Victoria forced a smile. "It's all a misunderstanding..."

"Misunderstanding?" The woman arched a brow theatrically. "Your daughter sent both White women to jail!"

Victoria's teacup shattered on the floor.

###Chapter 120

The White family had always been notorious in Rongcheng's business circles for their ruthless tactics. Even as a second-tier family, few dared to cross them.

"Have you forgotten who's backing her? Just the name Ethan Sullivan is enough for her to get away with murder in Rongcheng. Watch your tongue next time unless you want trouble."

"Mrs. Farley, that look on your face... Don't tell me you haven't heard about Mrs. White being taken away by the police? It happened half an hour ago—they arrested her right in the middle of our mahjong game!"

Victoria Farley's face turned ashen. With trembling hands, she pulled out her phone and dialed William Sullivan.

"William, Evelyn—"

"Shut up!" William's furious roar cut her off. "I don't have time for your nonsense right now. Tell that ungrateful wretch to get her ass home immediately!"

The dial tone echoed in her ear. Victoria shook with rage.

First, Evelyn had humiliated her in public. Now she'd called the police on Lily White's mother. Was this daughter of hers trying to start a rebellion?

Meanwhile, at the villa, Evelyn Sullivan was having dinner with Ethan.

After the meal, Dr. Evan arrived punctually for Ethan's treatment.

As she walked him out, his stern demeanor melted away. He winked at her. "Not bad acting, huh?"

Evelyn nodded solemnly. "If you'd put half this effort into medicine, you'd be world-famous by now."

Dr. Evan scowled playfully. "Remember who's helping you here. Push me too far and—"

His threat died on his lips when he spotted the porcelain vial in her hand.

"Antidote Pill?! Where the hell did you get this?"

"Little Lily gave it to me before I left."

Dr. Evan clutched his chest in exaggerated despair. "The old man always plays favorites!"

Evelyn snorted. "Cut the act. He sent an entire crate of ancient medical texts for you."

Caught, he grinned sheepishly. "No fun... So why show me this now?"

"Your payment."

"Seriously?!" He snatched the vial, his mood shifting instantly. "Don't worry,师妹. Ethan's legs are in good hands!"

"Still thinking of bailing?"

Dr. Evan straightened with mock solemnity. "A doctor's compassion knows no bounds. I'll give it my all!"

After seeing him off, Evelyn returned to the bedroom to find Ethan struggling to walk with crutches, sweat beading on his forehead.

She rushed to support him. "We agreed you'd wait for more acupuncture sessions before rehab! You're making the injury worse!"

He let her guide him to sit, his voice low. "I thought... you'd want me to recover faster."

Her hands stilled as she tucked the blanket around him. "I do want you healed. But not at the cost of your health. This injury is worse than three years ago. It needs more time."

###Chapter 121

Ethan Sullivan's words still hung in the air when Evelyn Sullivan turned and walked into the bathroom. She twisted the faucet, letting warm water soak the towel until her fingertips turned pink from the heat.

The doorbell rang abruptly.

Through the peephole, Mrs. Zhao's anxious face came into view. The moment Evelyn opened the door, the older woman grabbed her wrist. "Miss Evelyn, your father is furious at home..."

Evelyn's lashes trembled slightly. In all her years at the Jackson household, Mrs. Zhao had been the only one to sneak her pastries and stay by her bedside when she had a fever.

"I'm fine," she said softly, withdrawing her hand. "You should go back now."

After seeing Mrs. Zhao off, Evelyn stood motionless in the foyer. Outside the window, tree shadows swayed like grotesque specters.

The next morning, a shrill phone call shattered the silence.

"Evelyn!" Sophia Reynolds' voice nearly pierced through the receiver. "Your mother is live-streaming!"

The moment the computer screen lit up, Victoria Farley's haggard face filled the display. The recording had been meticulously edited—only Evelyn's icy words remained: "We don’t have a mother-daughter bond."

"I apologize for Evelyn's actions..." Victoria's tears fell with perfect timing. "We will personally apologize to the White family..."

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms. The woman on screen wept as if she were truly a devoted mother.

"How dare she!" Sophia raged through the phone. "I'm going to confront her right now!"

"Don’t." Evelyn's voice was eerily calm. "The reporters must be swarming the company entrance, right?"

"You still plan to go to work?!" Sophia gasped. "They're trying to destroy you!"

After hanging up, Evelyn mechanically squeezed toothpaste onto her brush. The woman in the mirror had frost in her eyes, but her lips curled in bitter amusement.

In the dining room, Ethan's coffee had long gone cold. He looked up as Evelyn spread jam on her toast with deliberate nonchalance.

"I heard about the press conference," he said, his knuckles tapping the table.

Evelyn didn’t glance up. "Mm."

"I can handle it."

"Unnecessary."

Ethan suddenly seized her wrist, sending the porcelain plate screeching across the table. "Evelyn Sullivan!"

She finally met his gaze. Her dark, unreadable eyes reflected his fury. "Mr. Sullivan, we're getting divorced soon."

###Chapter 122

Ethan Sullivan stared at Evelyn Sullivan's calm face, his chest tight as if stuffed with cotton. She always did this—shouldering everything alone, never giving him a chance to explain.

"Mr. Sullivan, I apologize for the trouble this has caused you." Evelyn set down her utensils, her voice feather-light. "I'll handle it as soon as possible."

Ethan clenched his fists until his knuckles turned white. "You think that's what I care about?"

The air in the dining room froze.

Evelyn stood, grabbing her bag with decisive movements. "Regardless, I'll resolve it. I'm heading to work now."

The sound of the door closing struck Ethan like a slap. He flipped the table over in one violent motion, the shattering of porcelain sending the kitchen staff trembling.

No one dared to clean up the mess. The only downside of this well-paying job was constantly bracing for their employer's sudden fury.

At the Jackson family villa, Victoria Farley had barely stepped inside when she was met by her waiting husband and daughter.

"Mom!" Isabella Jackson rushed forward, eyes red-rimmed. "You shouldn't have had to endure that."

Victoria waved a tired hand. "It's worth it for this family."

The "family" she spoke of never included her rebellious eldest daughter.

"Evelyn will drop the lawsuit," Isabella murmured soothingly. "The media is on our side."

"Let her do as she pleases." Victoria rubbed her temples. "I need to rest."

As she turned away, a cold smirk curled Isabella's lips. After that press conference, Evelyn's reputation as a "homewrecker" was sealed. She couldn't wait to see how long that woman would last by Ethan's side with such a stain on her name.

The front of MY Fashion Group was swarmed with reporters clutching cameras. Evelyn expressionlessly turned her car around, entering through the underground garage and taking the CEO's private elevator up.

"Evelyn!" Sophia Reynolds burst into the office. "What can I do?"

Evelyn looked up from booting her computer. "What can you do?"

"I can..." Sophia blinked. "Offer moral support?"

Once the office door closed, Evelyn opened a chat window with a pure black avatar, her fingers flying across the keyboard.

###Chapter 123

The afternoon sun glared harshly.

The trending list on social media suddenly exploded.

Popular entertainment influencer "Gossip Insider" dropped a bombshell:
—At Evelyn Sullivan's request, we are releasing the full audio recording and mother-daughter call logs. The truth speaks for itself.

Two audio clips instantly went viral.

Comments flooded in:
[Victoria's hypocrisy is unreal! Crying crocodile tears at the press conference while being so cruel to her own daughter in private?]
[Waiting for the plot twist. Is this legit?]
[Both mother and daughter are equally toxic. Apples don't fall far from the tree.]
[The real villain is William. Forcing his daughter to submit for the sake of the company!]

The hashtag remained at the top of the charts, thanks to Evelyn's behind-the-scenes maneuvering.

Victoria woke from her nap, expecting her daughter's apology, only to find herself drowning in online hate.

Her hands trembled with rage, nails digging into her palms.

She should have kicked that ungrateful wretch out right after the bone marrow donation!

Jackson Group's stock continued to plummet—clearly, someone was pulling strings.

During the board meeting, shareholders mocked William relentlessly, humiliating him.

"Useless!" He smashed a teacup and called Victoria. "Clean up this mess online—now!"

The pampered socialite had never faced such a crisis. Panicked, she turned to Isabella.

"Isabella, you said Evelyn would drop the lawsuit after the press conference!" Her voice shook. "Now the entire internet is attacking me!"

Isabella patted her mother's back. "Don't worry, Mom. Evelyn has gone too far."

"She's just jealous of you!" Victoria's eyes burned with venom. "She can't stand seeing you happy!"

Isabella bit her lip, then looked up. "I'll ask Ethan for help."

"Yes!" Victoria clutched at the lifeline. "He adores you..."

In Ethan Sullivan's office, Isabella pushed open the door with red-rimmed eyes.

"Ethan, please... help me."

He didn't look up from his documents. "If this is about the trending scandal, the answer is no."

"But if Evelyn keeps this up..." A tear rolled down her cheek. "It'll damage both our families."

His pen scratched a jagged line across the page.

"Did you consider the consequences when Victoria held that press conference?"

Isabella paled. "You think I orchestrated it?"

The air turned to ice.

###Chapter 124

Isabella Jackson's face turned deathly pale. Her slender fingers clutched the hem of her dress tightly.

Her eyes reddened, voice trembling. "So this is how you see me..."

Ethan Sullivan stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, his tall frame casting a long shadow. His expression remained indifferent, not even sparing her a glance.

The air in the office grew thick with tension.

Isabella waited. And waited. But no response came.

Tears spilled down her cheeks. She turned and fled the office.

The door slammed behind her with a loud bang.

She collided with Colin Keller, who nearly dropped the velvet box in his hands.

"Miss Jackson?" Colin steadied himself.

Isabella opened her mouth to snap at him—then froze. Her gaze locked onto the box.

Her pulse quickened. Her voice softened. "Is that...?"

Colin answered politely. "The Angel's Tears necklace. Just returned from maintenance."

She bit her lip, suppressing the sudden hope flaring in her chest. "Take it inside, then."

She lingered near the elevators, glancing back repeatedly. Three elevators came and went. The office door remained shut.

"Ethan Sullivan!" She stomped her foot in frustration and jabbed the elevator button.

Meanwhile, outside Rongcheng Police Station.

Vincent White emerged with a face like thunder. His lawyer trailed behind, shaking his head.

"Mr. White, this time it's..." The lawyer hesitated.

Vincent slid into his car, expression dark. "To Sullivan Group."

Top floor, Sullivan Tower.

Colin knocked and entered. "Sir, Vincent White has been waiting all afternoon."

Ethan didn't look up. "Let him wait."

Night had fallen when Ethan finally stepped out of the elevator. Vincent rushed forward. "Mr. Sullivan! Five minutes, please!"

Ethan's icy gaze swept over him. "You're asking the wrong person."

Beads of sweat formed on Vincent's forehead. "Just say the word, and I'll make them apologize to Mrs. Sullivan immediately!"

"Tell that to my wife." Ethan strode past, voice frigid. "It's not over until she says so."

PR Department, White Corporation.

"Mr. White, this statement will ruin Miss White's career!" The manager looked uneasy.

Vincent slammed his fist on the desk. "She brought this on herself!"

The manager flinched and nodded hastily. "I'll handle it right away."

Outside, the night stretched on, dark and endless.

###Chapter 125

Lily White's social media account suddenly posted a public apology.

Attached was the full surveillance footage, clearly showing what had really happened at the mall that day.

The post instantly went viral.

"Holy crap! The truth comes out fast! Lily was the instigator all along!"

"Where are all the people who bashed Evelyn? Come out and face this!"

"I knew there was more to the story. There's always a twist!"

Evelyn Sullivan was reviewing documents in her office when her phone buzzed.

A message from Sophia Reynolds flashed on the screen: "Check social media! The Whites just issued a statement!"

Evelyn tapped the notification, her brow furrowing slightly.

This was unexpected.

She had planned to let Lily stew in jail a few more days before releasing her evidence.

Yet the White family had beaten her to it.

"Interesting," she murmured, setting her phone aside.

At closing time, Evelyn stepped out of MY Fashion Group's headquarters.

A sharply dressed man approached. "Ms. Sullivan, Mr. White requests the honor of your company for dinner."

Evelyn glanced at the black sedan idling nearby.

"Was the apology his idea?"

"Yes. He wishes to express his regrets in person."

"Unnecessary." She turned to leave.

Vincent White suddenly emerged from the car. "Ms. Sullivan, please wait!"

He hurried over, sincerity etched across his face. "I know my daughter and wife were completely in the wrong. I beg your forgiveness."

Evelyn regarded him calmly. "What exactly are you proposing?"

"We'll hold a public press conference. They'll apologize to you before the media."

"Not enough." Her voice remained even. "I want recorded apologies published across all platforms."

Vincent's jaw tightened. "Done."

That evening at the White estate:

Lily and Mrs. White had just been released on bail when they received the news.

"What?!" Lily shrieked. "You want me to apologize to that bitch?!"

CRACK!

A stinging slap silenced her.

Vincent stood trembling with rage. "Haven't you embarrassed this family enough?!"

###Chapter 126

Slap!

The sharp sound of a hand striking flesh echoed through the living room. Lily White staggered back, clutching her cheek, her eyes wide with shock.

"Dad... you hit me?"

Stella White immediately rushed forward, shielding Lily behind her as she glared at Vincent White. "Have you lost your mind?! Lily just got out of police custody, and instead of comforting her, you hit her?!"

Vincent let out a cold laugh, his bloodshot eyes burning with fury. "Comfort? Do you have any idea what I've been through these past few days?! The Sullivan Group cut all ties with us. I had to grovel just to get you two out!"

"Isn't that your job as a father?!" Stella snapped.

"My job?" Vincent slammed his palm on the table. "If you hadn't provoked Evelyn Sullivan, would the White family be in this mess?!"

He pointed at Lily, his voice icy. "Tomorrow night, at the gala, you will both apologize to Evelyn—publicly."

"No!" Lily lifted her chin defiantly, tears welling in her eyes.

Vincent's expression darkened. "Then consider our father-daughter relationship over."

The words hit Lily like a bucket of ice water. She trembled uncontrollably. "For an outsider..."

"Outsider?" Vincent sneered. "Ethan Sullivan is crushing our family for her sake. If this continues, White Enterprises will be bankrupt within a month!"

Lily's face turned deathly pale. "That can't be... Isabella said Ethan loves her..."

"Idiot!" Vincent barked out a humorless laugh. "If he truly loved Isabella, why hasn't he divorced Evelyn?"

"It's because Evelyn refuses—"

"You believe everything Isabella says?" Vincent shook his head in disgust. "When you were in trouble, did she lift a finger to help?"

Before storming out, he delivered his ultimatum. "Apologize, or lose your place in this family. The choice is yours."

Silence swallowed the room.

Lily turned to her mother, lost. "Mom..."

Stella's gaze was complex. "Lily, do you know who came up with the idea to vandalize Evelyn's property?"

"Stop!" Lily covered her ears.

"Haven't you realized? Every time something happens, we're the ones who suffer! Isabella is using us!"

"That's not true..." Lily's voice shook.

Stella's tone turned frigid. "From now on, stay away from her."

She headed upstairs, a ruthless glint in her eyes. This debt would be repaid—Isabella would pay.

Lily collapsed onto the sofa. Her phone rang.

"Miss White, the production team has decided to terminate your contract..."

Evelyn pushed open the villa door. Warm golden light spilled over the dining table, where Ethan sat waiting.

"You didn't have to wait for me," she murmured.

Ethan looked up. "You seem pleased."

"I am." A faint smile touched Evelyn's lips. "Vincent came to apologize today. He said Lily and Stella will make a public apology tomorrow night."

Ethan chuckled. "Finally, someone with sense."

###Chapter 127

If Colin were here, he'd be rolling his eyes. After Ethan Sullivan personally ordered all business ties with the White family severed, who would dare cross him?

Evelyn Sullivan's lips curved slightly as she lowered her head to continue eating.

After dinner, they sat in the living room watching TV. Ethan suddenly spoke. "What do you plan to do about your mother?"

Evelyn's smile froze. "Since she publicly announced cutting ties, we'll be strangers."

Ethan raised an eyebrow. "Are you sure?"

He remembered Isabella mentioning how Evelyn had always longed for her parents' affection.

"What do you mean?" Evelyn frowned at him.

"I heard you used to care deeply about your relationship with Victoria. Having family support might—"

Clang. Evelyn slammed the fruit fork down. "Are you here to plead the Jacksons' case?"

Ethan hesitated. "Isabella came to see me today. She hopes you'll let this go."

"So you agreed?" Her voice turned icy.

"No. I just don't want you to regret it later."

"Don't trouble yourself, Mr. Sullivan. I've thought this through!"

Evelyn stood and stormed to her room, slamming the door.

Even when Dr. Evan arrived for Ethan's acupuncture session, the bedroom door remained shut.

After much deliberation, Ethan wheeled himself to her door.

"Evelyn, we need to talk."

"I'm sleeping," came the muffled reply.

"You're angry."

"I'm not. Don't disturb me."

The sound of his wheelchair gradually faded away.

The next morning, Evelyn was already gone when Ethan woke.

He ate breakfast in silence, then made a call.

"Yes?" Her voice was cool and distant.

"Evelyn!" Ethan struggled to contain his anger. "What's this tantrum about?"

"I'm busy."

"Too busy to face me?"

"You're overthinking it. Work calls. Goodbye."

"I'll pick you up at MY for the Whites' banquet tonight!"

He hung up before she could respond.

As the sun set, Evelyn was reviewing documents when her phone rang again.

"Come down." Ethan's tone brooked no argument.

###Chapter 128

Evelyn Sullivan massaged her temples, exhausted from a full day of meetings. The charity gala had completely slipped her mind.

"Give me five more minutes."

She quickly organized her files. As she hurried to the parking lot in her heels, she spotted Ethan Sullivan checking his watch.

The moment she slid into the car, she felt his piercing gaze sweep over her.

"Problem?"

"You're planning to attend the charity gala dressed like that?"

Evelyn glanced down at her professional attire—a black pencil skirt paired with a white blouse, sleek and efficient.

"This isn't appropriate?"

Ethan's long fingers tapped the armrest. "Ginza."

"Mr. Sullivan, it's just a routine event. No need for such extravagance."

"Tonight you represent Sullivan Group." His tone brooked no argument. "Perfection is mandatory."

Forty minutes later, Colin Keller wheeled Ethan into Ginza Shopping Center. The trio drew countless stares.

Even in a wheelchair, Ethan commanded attention. Several young women hesitated, their flirtatious advances dying under his icy glare.

"Which store first?"

"Vera Wang."

Evelyn paused mid-step. "Let's pick another."

"Their designs suit you."

She arched an eyebrow. "Since when does Mr. Sullivan know women's fashion?"

"Jealous?"

"Hardly." Her lips curved. "I've taken your advice about not overestimating my position to heart."

Ethan's expression darkened instantly, the air between them turning glacial.

Upon entering the boutique, store manager Vanessa Cruz's eyes widened in recognition. A subtle glance from Evelyn silenced any outburst.

"Mr. Sullivan, Ms. Sullivan, welcome."

Evelyn studied Ethan's profile. "You frequent this store?"

"First time."

Colin smoothly interjected, "Mr. Sullivan reviewed Vera Wang's fashion show last month specifically noting designs for you."

Vanessa enthusiastically presented the season's collection, highlighting several pieces by the head designer. Evelyn's ears grew warm beneath the praise.

"Try them all."

In the fitting room, Vanessa whispered urgently, "My God! What's your relationship with Ethan Sullivan? He doesn't know you own Vera Wang?"

"It's complicated." Evelyn sighed. "Prepare yourself—this might shock you."

"Unless you're telling me you're married."

"Bingo."

"What?!"

###Chapter 129

Vanessa Cruz clapped a trembling hand over her mouth.

"You...you're serious?!"

She never imagined Evelyn Sullivan had married Ethan Sullivan.

"Who said they wouldn't be surprised?" Evelyn chuckled.

Vanessa fell silent.

"Stop staring," Evelyn casually flicked through the gowns on the rack. "We're divorcing soon. Free money is free money."

Vanessa hesitated before pulling out a silver-gray mermaid dress.

The boutique fell into stunned silence when the fitting room curtain opened.

Evelyn strode toward Ethan in stilettos, the slit in her skirt revealing glimpses of porcelain thighs. The plunging neckline accentuated her curves, while the cutout waistline added dangerous allure.

"Well?"

Ethan's pupils contracted.

"Change." His voice tightened.

She twirled, sending silver-gray ripples across the skirt. "I like it."

"I said, change."

After five rejected gowns, they settled on a sapphire blue cheongsam. The teardrop neckline framed her collarbones perfectly, while embroidered patterns shimmered under the lights.

"This one." Ethan's Adam's apple bobbed.

While Evelyn selected shoes, he slapped a black card on the counter. "Wrap everything she tried."

Vanessa gasped—those dresses cost more than a luxury penthouse!

"Mr. Sullivan," she glanced nervously at Evelyn, "I heard you two were..."

Ethan cut her off. "I'd like to hire Elia as my personal designer."

Vanessa nearly dropped the POS machine.

"Apologies. Elia doesn't take private commissions."

A gilded business card slid toward her.

"Call me anytime."

During the drive to the White residence, Evelyn noticed Colin's absence.

"He went back to the office for something," Ethan said without turning.

As the Maybach parked, Evelyn reached for the door—only to be yanked back onto the seat. Heat from his palm seared through her dress, making her heart skip.

"Wait for Colin."

Twenty minutes later, a breathless Colin handed over a velvet box.

When the lid sprang open, Evelyn's breath caught—

Angel's Tears glowed blood-red in the twilight.

###Chapter 130

Evelyn froze.

She thought Ethan had long discarded that necklace.

The man's slender fingers held the delicate chain, his voice low. "Let me put it on for you."

"...Alright."

She gathered her long hair. Ethan leaned in close. His breath brushed her ear, carrying a faint scent of cedarwood.

The proximity was dangerously intimate.

Heat rushed to Evelyn's cheeks as her heartbeat quickened.

Cool metal touched her skin before Ethan's presence retreated.

"Done."

His gaze lingered on her slender neck. Diamonds sparkled under the chandelier, accentuating her porcelain skin.

"It's beautiful," she murmured sincerely.

"Why did you throw it away last time?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "With the divorce pending, I didn't want any lingering connections."

Ethan's expression darkened instantly. "Consider this a loan tonight. Since you don't want it, I won't offer again."

"Understood." Relief colored her voice.

His eyes turned stormier at her reaction. Nearby, Colin struggled to suppress a laugh.

If only the CEO would drop this tsundere act, maybe his wife wouldn't be so eager for divorce.

Colin positioned the wheelchair. With effortless upper-body strength, Ethan transferred himself into it.

Evelyn tightened her grip on the clutch.

He could perform this maneuver using only his torso—proof of his relentless rehabilitation.

Her ears burned pink remembering the defined abs she'd touched while bathing him.

"Stop daydreaming. Push me inside," Ethan snapped.

Flustered, Evelyn exited the car and took the wheelchair handles. Her pulse hadn't steadied by the time they entered the White residence.

The ballroom glittered with crystal lights and elite guests.

Though everyone speculated about Vincent White's motives, none dared show disrespect toward the influential family.

Upstairs, Lily White clutched Isabella's hand in tearful outrage.

"Father said I must apologize publicly or leave this house!"

Isabella patted her friend's hand. "Be patient. My sister's been manipulating Ethan somehow—he's grown distant with me too."

"That bitch cost me my acting role, and now I have to grovel?" Lily's eyes burned with venom. "She'll pay for this."

"Don't act rashly. Let me assess the situation first."

As Isabella stepped into the hallway, she nearly collided with Madeline White carrying a soup tray.

"Good evening, Mrs. White."

Madeline's cold appraisal didn't reach her perfunctory smile.

###Chapter 131

"Isabella, Lily is too naive for someone as calculating as you." Sophia Reynolds pulled Isabella Jackson aside, her expression icy. "Stay away from her."

Isabella's smile froze. Her lashes fluttered slightly. "Aunt Sophia, are you still upset about what happened last time?"

"Since you're aware, keep your distance!" Sophia's tone was sharp.

Isabella lifted her glistening eyes, voice soft. "I only meant to warn you. I never expected my sister to call the police. I even pleaded for leniency afterward, but she—"

"Enough!" Sophia cut her off. "You're clever enough to understand me."

"Mom!" Lily White stormed over, shielding Isabella. "How could you speak to her like that?"

Sophia's expression shifted. "Lily, I'm doing this for your own good."

"I don't need it!" Lily grabbed Isabella's hand. "Isabella, I'm sorry about my mother..."

Isabella shook her head gently. "It's fine. Aunt Sophia cares about you." She withdrew her hand. "You two talk. I'll head to the ballroom."

The moment she turned, the warmth in Isabella's eyes vanished.

If Lily weren't still useful, she wouldn't have tolerated such humiliation.

The day she won Ethan Sullivan's heart, she'd make Sophia beg for forgiveness on her knees.

The ballroom glittered under crystal chandeliers. As Isabella entered, she spotted Ethan pushing Evelyn Sullivan's wheelchair through the doors.

Clenching her fists, she forced a sweet smile and approached.

"Ethan, I didn't expect you to come."

Ethan gave her a cold glance. "The Whites issued a public apology. Of course I'd attend."

Only then did Isabella notice Evelyn. Her pupils constricted at the sight of the necklace around her sister's neck.

"Angel's Tears?" Her voice rose sharply. "Why do you have this?"

She whirled toward Ethan, tears welling. "Ethan, wasn't this meant to be my birthday gift?"

Evelyn arched a brow at Ethan, her lips curling in mockery.

Nearby guests paused, whispers spreading like wildfire.

"Is Mr. Sullivan two-timing?"

"Sisters fighting over one man—this should be good."

Ethan's face darkened. "I never promised it to you."

"But in Seattle..." Isabella's voice trembled. "You bought it because I loved it! Giving it to her now—are you punishing me?"

Her tearful display drew more curious stares.

Evelyn chuckled softly, fingertips brushing the sapphire. "How fascinating. This necklace has quite the backstory."

###Chapter 132

Ethan Sullivan's slender fingers traced the sapphire necklace as he said calmly, "Regardless of opinions, this will be Evelyn Sullivan's anniversary gift."

Isabella Jackson's face paled instantly, her nails digging into her palms.

"You're really giving it to her?"

"Yes."

The hushed whispers around them pierced Isabella's ears like needles. The mocking stares made her suffocate. Staggering back, she turned and fled the banquet hall.

Ethan's icy gaze swept across the room, his voice laced with warning. "Anyone who speaks ill of her is an enemy of the Sullivan Group."

Evelyn's hands remained steady on the wheelchair, as if the drama had nothing to do with her. She pushed Ethan toward the business circle, keenly absorbing every piece of commercial intelligence.

"If you're bored, you can grab something to eat," Ethan suddenly glanced back.

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "Business negotiations are far more interesting than desserts."

Just then, Lily White descended the spiral staircase with her mother, Sophia White. Her nails nearly dug into her mother's arm as she glared at Evelyn.

"Mom, I can't take this anymore—"

Sophia whispered sharply, "Patience. When Ethan casts her aside, you can have your revenge."

Vincent White stood under the spotlight, his voice booming. "Thank you all for coming. Tonight, I must formally apologize to Ms. Sullivan for my daughter's past mistakes."

Lily stood on stage, trembling as she recited her crimes. Sophia even had a bucket of bright red paint brought up, offering to endure the same retaliation.

The guests exchanged knowing glances—not out of disdain for their actions, but amusement at how they'd been cornered into such humiliation.

Evelyn watched coldly as the mother-daughter pair turned ghostly pale.

This disgrace was nothing compared to the agony their cyberbullying had once inflicted on her.

###Chapter 133

Evelyn Sullivan's lips curled into a faint smile as her gaze shifted between Lily White and Sophia Reynolds. "No need for paint. I just hope you'll remember today's humiliation."

She paused, her voice soft yet cutting. "Think twice before acting next time."

Lily's nails dug into her palms as she clung to her last shred of dignity. "I'll remember your advice, Ms. Sullivan."

As she stepped off the stage, Lily caught sight of a figure in the corner. Alexander King stood there, watching her with a complicated expression.

Her heart clenched. The cold rejection from his phone call at the police station still echoed in her ears.

Taking a deep breath, Lily walked toward him in her high heels.

"Happy now?" She lifted her chin, her voice sharp.

Alexander shook his head, disappointment flooding his eyes. "I just wanted to see the real you—the woman I've loved for years."

"See it now?" Lily sneered. "I'm not the sweet, innocent girl you imagined."

His familiar face now felt foreign. Alexander suddenly realized he'd been in love with an illusion.

"Why did it have to come to this?" His voice was hoarse.

"Because this is who I am." Lily met his gaze. "When I left the country after our breakup, it was because I knew we weren't right. Coming back was just self-deception."

Alexander's face paled instantly. The hesitation of the past few days finally had its answer.

"I see."

He turned and walked away, his retreating figure devoid of any lingering attachment.

Lily bit her lip hard. Even if she begged, history would repeat itself. It was better to let go.

Upstairs, cheerful music played, making her humiliation even more pronounced. She wouldn't forget tonight's disgrace.

At the Sullivan villa, Victoria Farley waited anxiously. The moment Isabella Jackson walked in with red, swollen eyes, she rushed forward.

"Isabella! Who hurt you?"

Isabella shook her head, but tears kept falling. "Mom, please don't ask..."

"Was it Evelyn?" Victoria's voice rose sharply.

"My sister..." Isabella sobbed. "The necklace Ethan bought in Seattle—I thought it was my birthday gift, but today..."

Victoria shot to her feet. "She even stole that from you?!"

"Don't..." Isabella grabbed her mother's hand. "I don't want to make things difficult for Ethan. Maybe... this is just fate."

Victoria wiped her daughter's tears away tenderly. "Silly girl, I'll make sure you get the happiness you deserve."

She patted Isabella's back, her eyes hardening with resolve. That usurper had overstayed her welcome in the Sullivan family. It was time for her to go.

###Chapter 134

"Mom, don't go looking for her." Victoria Farley's youngest daughter whispered. "You publicly cut ties with her at the press conference. She must still be furious. I'll handle this myself."

At the mention of that day, Victoria's temper flared. "Let her be! From now on, I'll act like I never had that daughter!"

Night deepened as Evelyn Sullivan and Ethan Sullivan returned to their villa.

She removed the necklace from her neck and handed it to him. "Thank you for tonight."

Ethan's expression instantly darkened, his gaze heavy. "You think I'd regift something that's been worn?"

Evelyn considered it. "Then I'll reimburse you."

"Do you have to be so transactional?" His voice rose sharply.

Sensing his anger, she pressed her lips together. "Mr. Sullivan, blurred boundaries help no one."

Since their separation was inevitable, she wanted no lingering ties.

"I'm tired. I'm going to bed." She turned away, her retreating figure resolute.

Back in her room, Evelyn looked up the necklace's price. The auction record stole her breath.

One billion.

For this ridiculous thing?!

She tossed all night, nearly tearing her hair out trying to figure out how to repay the sum.

Had she known the cost, she'd never have worn it.

The next morning, Evelyn descended the stairs with dark circles under her eyes.

Breakfast passed in stiff silence before they left separately.

At the office, she found the lobby overflowing with flowers, surrounded by buzzing chatter.

"Who's the mystery millionaire behind this?"

"This must've cost a fortune!"

"So jealous!"

As Evelyn moved to leave, Sophia Reynolds stormed over.

"Throw every last one out! Reject any future deliveries!"

Evelyn arched a brow. "An admirer?"

Sophia dragged her into the elevator, seething. "Who else but that lunatic Alexander King? Drunk off his ass last night babbling about making amends, then pulls this stunt!"

"He wants you back?"

"In his dreams!" Sophia scoffed. "Now that Lily White dumped him, he's harassing me. What do I look like, his rebound?"

The elevator reached the top floor, and they parted ways.

No sooner had Evelyn sat down than Zoe Zade called.

"A whole week in town without reaching out?"

"With your schedule, I didn't dare interrupt."

Zoe's voice turned playful. "For you, I'm always free. Just waiting for you to take advantage of me."

Evelyn: "..."

If fans saw their icy screen goddess like this, mass unfollowing would ensue.

###Chapter 135

"I'm not into women."

"Evelyn, you're so blunt! You're breaking my heart~"

Evelyn Sullivan shuddered, goosebumps rising on her skin.

"Zoe, can you act normal for once?"

A soft cough came through the phone before Zoe Zade finally switched to her natural voice.

"I've been swamped with filming and just saw the news about that supporting actress trying to ride on Eternal Legacy's hype to smear you. Everything handled?"

"Yeah. Did you call just for that?"

"I care about you! You're so cold—my heart's freezing over."

Evelyn: "......Save the acting for your movies."

"Fine, I'll stop teasing. When are you free for dinner?"

"Your schedule's packed. Whenever works for you."

"Tomorrow night then! I'll have my agent book a place."

"Sure."

"Got another scene to shoot. Talk later!"

Zoe hung up and turned to her agent. "Red, reserve a private VIP room for tomorrow. Dinner with Evelyn."

Red nodded. "Consider it done."

The next evening, Evelyn texted Ethan Sullivan that she wouldn't be home for dinner and drove to the restaurant.

The moment she pushed open the private room's door, a fragrant figure lunged at her, planting two kisses on her cheeks.

"Evelyn darling, I missed you so much!"

Evelyn: "......"

Zoe's over-the-top affection hadn't changed.

"Let go first..."

Zoe pecked her cheek once more before releasing her.

"You didn't miss me at all?!"

"Nope."

"Ugh, you wound me!"

Evelyn nearly dropped the menu. "Keep talking like that and I'll throw you out."

"Alright, alright~"

After ordering, Zoe brought up Lily White.

"If I'd seen the news sooner, I wouldn’t have let the director fire her. I play her senior in the movie—perfect chance to take care of her for you!"

Watching Zoe crack her knuckles, Evelyn chuckled.

"It's over. You're an award-winning actress now. Bullying a newcomer would look bad."

Zoe raised a brow. "Since when can’t an award-winner defend her best friend?"

"We won’t cross paths again anyway."

"Don’t be so sure. Word is she’s already negotiating with agencies."

Evelyn was surprised Lily was serious about entering the industry.

"Let’s not ruin the mood. We barely get to meet."

"True. Next week we’re shooting on location—won’t see you for ages."

"Work comes first."

Zoe leaned in, mischief glinting in her peach-blossom eyes.

"How about you sponsor me? Then I could stick around forever! I cook, I give massages—you’ll regret passing me up!"

###Chapter 136

Evelyn Sullivan rubbed her temples in exasperation. "Zoe, superstar, spare me. I'm not into women. Besides, my salary barely covers my own expenses."

Zoe Zade pouted dramatically. "How boring. My dream of marrying into wealth just shattered."

"Please," Evelyn chuckled, poking fun at her. "You're such a workaholic. Three days off and you'd go stir-crazy."

"Only because you keep rejecting me!" Zoe sighed theatrically. "Forcing me to drown myself in film roles."

As they bantered, Zoe stood up. "I'm heading to the restroom."

Evelyn nodded.

In the hallway, Zoe strode toward the cashier. A figure suddenly emerged from around the corner, and they collided.

Her hat tumbled to the floor, revealing her striking features under the lights.

She quickly snatched it back, pulling it low over her face. "Checkout for private room three," she murmured to the cashier.

Lucas Laurier stared at her delicate chin, still dazzled by the brief glimpse of her beauty. The rising starlet was even more captivating in person than on screen.

Straightening his tie, he approached. "My apologies for earlier."

Zoe didn’t look up. "No worries."

"Can I get your number?" Lucas flashed a charming grin. "It was love at first sight."

She lifted icy eyes to his. "Sorry. I only date women."

Seizing his stunned silence, she walked away. Lucas watched her retreating figure, then dialed a number. "Find out about Zoe Zade’s new project. I’m investing a hundred million."

Back in the private room, Zoe glared at Evelyn. "I said this was my treat!"

"You have a family to support," Evelyn teased, suppressing a smile.

"My paycheck went home weeks ago!" Zoe planted her hands on her hips. "Next time at Wangjing, I’m paying!"

"Fine, fine."

As they stepped out, they nearly ran into Ethan Sullivan’s group.

Lucas’s eyes lit up—until he spotted Evelyn. They knew each other?

"Sister-in-law, dining out?" he ventured cautiously.

Evelyn’s expression remained cool. "You’ve mistaken me for someone else, Mr. Laurier."

Zoe suddenly slipped into drama mode, clutching Evelyn’s arm. "Evelyn, why is he calling you sister-in-law? Have you changed your heart?"

Her fake sobs echoed down the hallway.

###Chapter 137

Evelyn Sullivan: "..."

Zoe Zade's words stunned everyone present.

Evelyn felt several probing gazes on her, her fingertips trembling slightly. She took a deep breath, suppressing the urge to punch someone.

Lucas Laurier's eyes widened as his gaze darted between the two women. When Zoe had claimed to be a lesbian earlier, he'd assumed it was just an excuse. But was Evelyn really the one she loved?

"We'll talk about this another time. You should go."

Zoe pouted, reluctantly nodding. "Then don't forget to miss me."

"Hmm."

As Zoe left, Lucas immediately chased after her. He intercepted her in the parking lot just as she was about to get into her car.

"Miss Zade, I'm serious. Give me a chance?"

Zoe was about to refuse when her eyes suddenly gleamed with mischief. "Why did you call Evelyn 'sister-in-law' earlier?"

"Go on a date with me, and I'll tell you."

"Ha. Not interested." Zoe slammed the car door and drove off.

Lucas watched her taillights disappear, a playful smirk curling his lips.

Interesting.

Back in the restaurant, the atmosphere was tense.

Ryan Paisley cleared his throat. "Since Evelyn is here, I won't escort Ethan back."

"Thank you for looking after him, Mr. Paisley." Evelyn nodded politely, her tone distant.

A flicker of disappointment crossed Ryan's eyes before he turned and left.

"How do you know Zoe?" Ethan suddenly asked.

Evelyn frowned. "That's my personal business, Mr. Sullivan."

Ethan's grip on his wheelchair tightened, his knuckles turning white. Ever since she'd brought up divorce, she'd been like a hedgehog, constantly on guard against him.

The ride back to the villa was silent.

No sooner had Evelyn settled Ethan in than the doorbell rang sharply.

She opened the door—only to be met with a stinging slap across the face.

Smack!

Caught off guard, her cheek burned with pain.

Margaret Sullivan raised her hand to strike again. "You wretched girl! Look what you've done to my son!"

Evelyn stepped back quickly. "Please control yourself."

"Control myself?" Margaret hissed through clenched teeth. "Ethan ended up like this because of your divorce! How dare you still show your face here!"

When she'd received Isabella's call yesterday, she'd nearly fainted. This jinx should never have been allowed into their home!

"Mother." Ethan's icy voice cut through the air from behind them. "Who gave you permission to lay a hand on what's mine?"

###Chapter 138

Margaret Sullivan's pupils contracted sharply as she pushed open the hospital room door.

Ethan Sullivan sat in a wheelchair, his right leg encased in plaster, his handsome face as pale as paper.

"Ethan!"

She rushed forward, shoving Evelyn Sullivan aside.

"You're in this state, and you're still protecting her?!"

Ethan frowned. "The accident was just that—an accident."

"An accident?" Margaret sneered. "If you hadn't been rushing to file for divorce, would this have happened?!"

"Mother." His voice turned icy. "Calm down."

Margaret's chest heaved with rage. "Pack your things. You're coming home with me."

"I'm not going anywhere."

"This isn't up for debate!" she snapped. "I won't let you stay with this jinx any longer!"

Ethan's head jerked up, his gaze sharp as a blade.

"She is my wife."

Margaret took half a step back, staring at her son in disbelief. In just a few months, he'd become so fiercely protective of Evelyn.

"Ethan, she's not worthy of you! I'll handle the divorce proceedings."

"That won't be necessary." His tone was glacial. "Stay out of it."

"You—" She trembled with fury. "I nearly died of fright when I heard about your accident, and this is how you speak to me? For her?!"

Ethan's eyes narrowed.

"Who told you?"

Margaret's expression faltered. She avoided his gaze.

"That's irrelevant. You must divorce her!"

"Uncle West will take you home."

"Ethan Sullivan!" Her voice rose to a shrill pitch. "Are you trying to kill me?!"

Ignoring her, Ethan turned to Evelyn.

"Help me shower."

Evelyn had barely taken a step when Margaret shoved her away violently.

"Get out!"

Rubbing her wrist, Evelyn smirked coldly.

"Then I'll leave it to you, Mrs. Sullivan."

She turned and walked out, her departure final.

The moment the door closed, Ethan maneuvered his wheelchair to face his mother.

"I won't divorce her."

Margaret's nails dug into her palms.

"Isabella Jackson is the one who suits you best!"

"I don't need an arranged marriage."

"You used to love Isabella!" Her voice shook. "Have you really fallen for that country bumpkin?"

Ethan's gaze darkened.

"This isn't about feelings."

"She can't give you any advantage!" Margaret was nearly hysterical. "The Jacksons are the ones who—"

"Enough!" Ethan cut her off sharply. "Stay out of my affairs."

Margaret staggered back, bracing herself against the wall to keep from collapsing.

###Chapter 139

"No."

"Fine! Then I'll talk to Evelyn Sullivan myself!"

"If you dare approach her, I'll sever all ties with you as my mother."

Margaret Sullivan trembled with rage, tears welling in her eyes.

"How can you say such things for a woman?!"

Ethan Sullivan's expression remained icy. "She's my wife, not just any woman. This isn't a threat—it's a warning."

"Fine, Ethan Sullivan! You'll regret this!"

Margaret stormed out, the door slamming shut with a deafening crash.

Evelyn heard every word from the guest bedroom.

She had just finished washing up when a knock interrupted her.

Ethan stood at the door, his gaze dark and unreadable.

"Miss Sullivan, it's time to honor your promise."

Evelyn frowned. "Mr. Sullivan, your injuries don't prevent you from bathing."

She turned to leave but was yanked into his arms.

The heat of his body burned through her clothes.

"Let go!"

She struggled, but his grip only tightened.

"Keep resisting, and you'll face the consequences."

Evelyn froze.

She could feel his body's unmistakable reaction.

"Disgusting!"

Ethan chuckled lowly. "It's a natural physiological response."

"I'm going to bed!"

"Help me wash up first."

"Never!"

"Then we'll stay like this all night."

Her cheeks burned with fury.

In the end, she relented.

Back in her room, she slammed the door shut.

She needed to hire a nurse immediately—this was unbearable!

The next morning, Sophia Reynolds burst into the office.

"Evelyn, I need to take leave!"

Evelyn looked up. "What happened?"

###Chapter 140

Sophia Reynolds bit her lip, hesitation flickering in her eyes.

"It's not work-related..." she murmured. "Just some personal family matters."

Evelyn Sullivan nodded without pressing further.

"Let me know if you need help."

"Thanks."

After seeing Sophia out, Evelyn's phone rang. An unknown number flashed on the screen.

"Hello, is this Evelyn Sullivan? We're from the National Fashion Design Competition committee."

Evelyn arched a brow.

"Speaking."

"This year's competition will be held next month. We'd be honored if you could join us as a judge."

The voice on the other end brimmed with anticipation.

Evelyn tapped her fingers lightly against the desk. She received this invitation every year after her three consecutive wins. But because of Ethan Sullivan, she'd always declined.

"Dates?"

"Fifteenth of next month, at the Rongcheng International Convention Center!"

The caller's pitch rose sharply, clearly surprised by her question.

A faint smile curved Evelyn's lips.

"Send the details to my email."

Within five minutes of hanging up, a confirmation email arrived. Simultaneously, the competition's official account couldn't resist breaking the news.

[Breaking! Elia Confirmed as This Year's Judge!]

The announcement sent the internet into a frenzy.

[OMG! My idol is finally coming out of retirement!]

[Rumor has it Elia never makes public appearances—is she looking for an apprentice?]

[Will we get to see her in person at the finals? I'm buying tickets now!]

Isabella Jackson stumbled upon the trending topic while reviewing past winning designs. Her nails dug into her palms as she stared at her phone screen.

She'd just registered for the competition. Now Evelyn was a judge?

Her phone vibrated with a message from Ethan: [Brocade's documents are ready. Sign the transfer agreement tomorrow.]

Isabella smirked coldly and replied: [Thanks, Ethan.]

Setting her phone aside, she walked to the window. The setting sun stretched her shadow long across the floor.

"Evelyn Sullivan, you think this makes you better than me?"

——

On the top floor of Sullivan Tower, Ethan stood before the floor-to-ceiling windows, a document clenched in his hand.

"Mr. Sullivan, Brocade's handover is complete," Colin Keller reported from behind.

"Mm."

Ethan's gaze remained fixed on the distant skyline, his expression inscrutable.

"After this, we're even."

###Chapter 141

Ethan Sullivan had just opened the file when a sharp pain exploded in his leg. He sucked in a breath, his knuckles turning white as he gripped the armrest.

The pain came in relentless waves, growing more intense with each surge.

Cold sweat slid down his temples, soaking the back of his shirt. Trembling, he dialed Evelyn Sullivan's number. The moment he gasped out "Help me," darkness swallowed his vision.

When he opened his eyes again, night had fallen outside the window.

Evelyn was wringing out a warm towel. Seeing him awake, she immediately leaned over to check his forehead. "Still in pain?"

Ethan tried to move his leg but found his entire body weak. Frowning, he glanced at the acupuncture kit by the bed. "Dr. Evan was here?"

"Yes." Evelyn helped him sit up. "The nerve damage in your leg is worse than expected. You need complete bed rest."

After a moment of silence, Ethan suddenly grasped her hand. "Thank you."

Before Evelyn could respond, her phone rang. An unknown number.

"Evelyn! They—"

Sophia Reynolds' scream cut off abruptly, replaced by a man's curses and the dull thud of something heavy hitting the floor.

Evelyn's pupils constricted. She redialed, but the line was dead.

"What happened?" Ethan sensed the shift in her demeanor.

Evelyn was already grabbing her jacket. "Sophia's in danger."

"Wait!" Ethan struggled to get up but was forced back by a wave of dizziness. He immediately called Colin Keller. "Send men after Mrs. Sullivan—now!"

Under the cover of night, Evelyn's sports car shot onto the highway like an arrow. Her phone buzzed with a location—Royal Emperor Club.

She jerked the steering wheel, tires screeching against the pavement.

The eighth-floor hallway was carpeted in deep crimson. The moment Evelyn kicked open the private room door, the stench of alcohol and debauchery hit her.

As the lights flooded the space, she saw Sophia pinned to the couch, her dress torn, blood at the corner of her mouth.

"You're dead!" Evelyn snatched a bottle and smashed it over the attacker's head.

Amid the shattering glass, a one-eyed man shoved the woman in his lap aside and stood. "Who the hell are you?" He licked his gold tooth with a sneer. "Since you're here, you can join the fun."

Evelyn pulled Sophia behind her and cracked her knuckles.

"I'm in a hurry." Her icy gaze swept over the dozen thugs in the room. "Come at me together."

###Chapter 142

"Get her!" The one-eyed man narrowed his cold gaze and signaled to the burly thug beside him.

The six-foot-tall brute swung his fist at Evelyn with a vicious grin.

Ten seconds later, he crashed heavily onto the floor in front of his companions with a dull thud.

"Useless!" The one-eyed man spat. "All of you, attack!"

The private room soon echoed with agonized groans. Within five minutes, over a dozen enforcers lay sprawled across the floor. Hostesses screamed and fled in panic as the crystal chandelier swayed precariously from the brawl.

Evelyn helped Sophia straighten her disheveled clothes. Just as they reached the exit, Lina blocked their path with a group of security guards.

"Miss," Lina's red lips curved, though her eyes remained icy. "You can't just walk out after assaulting my patrons."

"What do you want?"

"Leave behind a finger." She twirled a fruit knife in her hand. "Or else—"

Evelyn scoffed. "You think you can stop me?"

From inside the room, the one-eyed man roared, "Lina Xu! Let her escape today, and I'll burn this place to the ground tomorrow!"

Lina's face paled. The one-eyed man was infamous in the underworld—a rabid dog with endless grudges.

"Seize her!" she barked.

As the guards advanced, a voice colder than steel cut through the air.

"Touch her, and you die."

Everyone turned. Ethan stood at the end of the hallway like an avenging deity. The hem of his black trench coat flared with each step, his presence crushing the air from their lungs.

Lina rushed forward, flustered. "Mr. Sullivan, this is just a misunder—"

Before she could finish, a bodyguard kicked her aside. She slammed into the wall with a gasp.

"Mr. Sullivan..." She curled into herself, wincing. "Please let me explain—"

Ethan ignored her. His hawk-like gaze locked onto Evelyn. "Come here."

Evelyn pressed her lips together, steadying Sophia as they approached. "She needs a hospital."

"Mm."

As she turned, the one-eyed man charged out, bellowing, "Ethan Sullivan! I paid five million for that woman!"

Ethan's eyes darkened. "Name your price."

"F-four million!" The man faltered under Evelyn's glare.

Suddenly, Evelyn released Sophia and strode toward him.

"Stay back!" he shrieked, scrambling away.

Crack!

A scream tore through the air as Evelyn twisted his wrist. "Six million. The extra million buys your hand."

In the hospital corridor, Sophia finally broke down, sobbing. Evelyn gently rubbed her trembling back, fingers brushing damp tear tracks.

"It's over."

Sophia buried her face into Evelyn's shoulder, tears soaking through the fabric. The emergency lights flickered in the distance, casting their intertwined shadows against the wall.

###Chapter 143

The sharp scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the hospital air.

Sophia Reynolds lay on the bed, her face as pale as paper. The doctor had just finished examining her—aside from some bruises and scrapes, she was thankfully unharmed.

"Sophia, what happened?"

Evelyn Sullivan grasped her cold hand.

Sophia's fingers trembled slightly, a flash of hatred flickering in her eyes.

"He gambled again," she rasped. "Lost five million this time. The creditors threatened to chop off his hand. To save himself, he sold me."

Evelyn's pupils constricted.

"Doesn't he know the money you've earned these years could cover his debts?"

"How could I tell him?" Sophia let out a bitter laugh. "That money would just fuel his addiction. Everything I've saved from working myself to the bone wasn't meant to fill his bottomless pit."

Evelyn's heart ached.

The once-pampered heiress of the Reynolds family, now reduced to this by her own father.

"Sophia, have you ever thought about..." She chose her words carefully. "Cutting ties with him completely?"

Sophia's head snapped up, shock flashing across her face.

"I've tried." Her smile was rueful. "But as long as I'm in this city, I'll never escape his shadow."

"That's illegal." Evelyn's voice was firm. "Selling your own daughter—that's enough to put him behind bars."

Sophia clenched the sheets, her knuckles turning white.

"I need time to think..."

If she really sent her father to prison, she could be free. But he was still her flesh and blood.

"No rush." Evelyn patted her hand. "You can move first, then refuse to have anything to do with him."

Sophia nodded, forcing a weak smile.

"Evelyn, you should go. I'll be fine."

When Evelyn returned home, the lights in the living room were still on.

Ethan Sullivan sat in his wheelchair, his expression dark as thunder.

"Mr. Sullivan, your leg injury requires rest."

"You still remember to care about me?" He let out a cold laugh. "Sneaking off alone to take on a dozen thugs—Evelyn Sullivan, you've got quite the nerve."

Evelyn pressed her lips together, silent.

"What if they had guns? What if you were outnumbered?" Ethan's voice grew colder. "Do you think you're invincible?"

Evelyn lowered her head.

"I'm sorry. I just didn't want you to worry."

"Oh? Then should I thank you for being so considerate?"

God knew how furious he'd been when he got the news. This reckless woman had actually gone to such a place alone.

Evelyn peeked up, meeting Ethan's piercing gaze.

"Mr. Sullivan, I promise it won't happen again. It's late—should we rest?"

"See that it doesn't."

He turned his wheelchair to leave when Evelyn suddenly spoke.

"I've transferred six million back to you. The money for Angel's Tears—I'll repay it as soon as I can."

Ethan's back stiffened.

"Suit yourself."

He left without looking back, the sound of his wheelchair rolling across the floor gratingly loud.

Evelyn exhaled deeply.

She didn't want to owe him too much. Some debts needed to be settled clean.

The next morning, Evelyn pushed open the hospital door, breakfast in hand.

"Get out! I don't want to see you!"

Sophia's furious shout rang out from inside.

###Chapter 144

Evelyn nearly dropped the insulated lunchbox when she pushed open the hospital room door.

Alexander stood by Sophia's bed, holding a bouquet of vibrant roses.

"Evelyn..." Alexander awkwardly set the flowers down, his gaze shifting away.

Sophia turned her head coldly. "Mr. King, please leave."

His Adam's apple bobbed. "I'll visit again tomorrow."

"Don't bother."

The door slammed shut behind him. Evelyn placed the lunchbox on the bedside table.

"Why was he here?"

"Who knows?" Sophia tugged irritably at the blanket. "Maybe the hospital notified him."

Evelyn noticed the crumpled roses on the nightstand.

"I'm discharging myself this afternoon," Sophia announced suddenly.

"Did the doctor approve?"

"It's just a minor injury." Sophia threw off the covers. "There's a mountain of work waiting at the office."

Evelyn hesitated but finally nodded.

At three p.m., Sophia appeared punctually in the conference room.

A high-neck sweater concealed the bruises on her throat. Her spine remained straight as she walked.

Evelyn's anxious heart finally settled.

Before leaving work, Ethan's call came through.

"Alexander wants to take you to dinner."

Evelyn's fingers stilled. "If it's about Sophia, forget it."

Silence stretched for several seconds.

"Understood."

Ethan hung up and turned to Alexander beside him.

"Rejected?" Alexander gave a bitter smile. "Expected."

"You deserve it."

"Yeah." Alexander tilted his head back, taking a swig of whiskey. "I really do."

......

Steam rose from the hot pot.

Sophia mechanically dropped slices of meat into the boiling broth, her gaze distant.

"Still thinking about this morning?" Evelyn placed a slice of tripe in her bowl.

Sophia suddenly set down her chopsticks.

"I've decided to cut ties with him." Her voice trembled. "But when I remember him begging on his knees..."

Evelyn grasped her icy hand.

"Having a soft heart isn't wrong."

"But you—"

"Our situations are different." Evelyn smiled faintly. "At least your father truly cared for you once."

Sophia shook her head, eyes reddening. "You're the best one. The Sullivan family is blind!"

"Eat the meat before it overcooks."

In the bubbling red broth, the slices slowly curled.

###Chapter 145

"Mhm."

Evelyn Sullivan held the car door open for Sophia Reynolds outside her apartment building. The cool night breeze brushed against Sophia's flushed cheeks.

"Alexander called me again today," Evelyn said abruptly.

Sophia halted mid-step, irritation flashing in her eyes. "Ignore him. I've made myself clear—there's no future between us."

Evelyn nodded softly. "I'll support whatever you decide."

When Evelyn returned to the villa, the living room lights were still on. Ethan Sullivan sat on the sofa, his long fingers tapping the armrest as he waited.

"Did you need something, Mr. Sullivan?" Evelyn took a seat across from him.

"Grandmother's birthday is coming up." Ethan lifted his gaze. "Have you decided on a gift?"

"Yes, I've had it planned for a while." She paused. "What about you?"

His brow furrowed slightly. "This year, we'll give one together."

Evelyn's fingers twitched. "We've always given separate gifts."

"Then we'll change that starting this year." His voice turned colder.

She took a deep breath. "We agreed that once your legs healed, we'd divorce. There's no need to—"

"Are you so certain I'll walk again?" Ethan cut her off, his eyes darkening. "Dr. Howard said I'll never stand for the rest of my life."

"You will recover." Her tone was firm.

Ethan let out a humorless laugh. "What makes you so sure?"

"Don’t you want to walk again?" she countered.

The air between them froze. After a long silence, Evelyn stood. "I'm going to bed."

"Evelyn." His low voice stopped her. "Have you never regretted bringing up divorce?"

Her nails dug into her palms. "No."

In an instant, the room turned icy. Ethan radiated a chilling aura, his gaze sharp as a blade.

Evelyn walked away without looking back. She couldn't turn around—couldn't go back to being the Evelyn who had once groveled at his feet.

Three days later, Dr. Evan's call shattered the uneasy calm.

"Evelyn, Mr. Sullivan suddenly terminated his treatment."

Her heart lurched. Several calls to Ethan went unanswered. She dialed Colin Keller instead, hearing his cautious voice on the line.

"Ms. Sullivan, the CEO has been staying at the office these past few days... Did you two...?"

"Just a minor disagreement," she said lightly.

Colin sounded near tears. "Ms. Sullivan, you should come see for yourself... The CEO has..." He lowered his voice. "...already reduced three department managers to tears this week."

Evelyn gripped her phone, staring out at the overcast sky.

###Chapter 146

Evelyn stared at her phone screen for a long time, her fingers tapping lightly on the desk.

"I'll come by after work."

The voice on the other end audibly relaxed. "Okay."

After hanging up, she gazed out the window. The employees at Sullivan Group must be having a hard time lately—when the boss was in a bad mood, the entire company felt the tension.

The moment the clock struck quitting time, Evelyn grabbed her bag and left.

Sullivan Tower was even more impressive than she'd imagined. Standing at the base of the building, she suddenly remembered Ethan's words from their secret marriage days: "Don't come to the company looking for me."

"Ms. Sullivan?"

Colin approached quickly. "Mr. Sullivan is still in a meeting. Should I take you to his office to wait?"

"No need." Evelyn shook her head. "The conference room is fine."

The floor-to-ceiling windows in the conference room offered a panoramic view of the city. She sat on the sofa, watching the sunset slowly sink below the horizon.

"Would you like something to drink?"

"Don't trouble yourself."

After Colin left, the room was so quiet she could hear the clock ticking. At some point, she dozed off, her head resting on the table.

The meeting room door was flung open.

"Where is she?" Ethan's voice was colder than usual.

"In the conference room... asleep."

The sound of wheelchair wheels rolling over carpet was faint. Ethan stopped by the table, his gaze settling on the slight furrow between Evelyn's brows.

"Blanket," he said, holding out a hand.

Colin quickly handed him a wool throw. Ethan moved carefully, but the moment the fabric brushed her shoulder, a pair of drowsy eyes met his.

"Mr. Sullivan?"

Evelyn straightened, the blanket slipping from her shoulders. She blinked, her lashes casting delicate shadows under the light.

"Finished your meeting?"

Ethan averted his eyes. "What did you want to talk about?"

She was fully awake now. Staring directly into his eyes, she said, "Dr. Howard told me you refused treatment."

"My legs. My decision."

"Are you insane?" Her voice rose. "Have you forgotten what happened three years ago? Sullivan Group almost changed hands!"

Ethan's fingers tightened around the armrests of his wheelchair, veins bulging.

"No one can touch Sullivan Group now."

"Then why refuse treatment?!"

"None of your business."

Evelyn shot to her feet. "How is it not my business? We agreed—once your legs were healed, we'd get divorced!"

The air froze.

Ethan suddenly laughed, though his eyes remained icy. "So that's it. You can't wait for me to stand again so you can be rid of me, is that it?"

Evelyn stared at him in disbelief.

"Ethan, have you hit your head recently?"

###Chapter 147

"What do you mean by that?"

"I'll pay for your leg treatment. We get divorced. Everyone gets what they want. If you refuse treatment, I'll still file for divorce!"

Ethan Sullivan's eyes turned to ice. "Evelyn Sullivan, how dare you!"

A cold smile curled Evelyn's lips. "Why wouldn't I dare? You can wallow in self-pity all you want, but don't drag me down with you. Go be miserable on your own!"

She turned and walked away, her heels clicking sharply against the floor.

Standing outside Sullivan Corporation, Evelyn hesitated before dialing Grandma Sullivan's number.

After hanging up, she drove straight back to the villa.

Fresh from her shower and about to eat, Ethan stormed in, bringing a chill with him.

"Who gave you permission to tell Grandma about this?"

Evelyn set down her chopsticks and met his furious gaze calmly. "She would've found out eventually. What's the difference?"

Veins bulged on Ethan's forehead, his fists clenched tight.

"You're ruthless!"

"If you insist on refusing treatment, I'm moving out tonight." Evelyn dabbed her lips with a napkin, unhurried.

"You wouldn't dare."

"Try me."

Ethan took a deep breath, his voice frigid. "I'll continue treatment. On one condition—no divorce."

Evelyn scoffed. "Ethan Sullivan, using this to blackmail me? How pathetic."

"You—"

Seeing his rage, Evelyn lost her appetite completely. She stood abruptly, deliberately knocking over a glass. "Suit yourself. It's not my legs that'll be useless. When Isabella dumps you again, you'll deserve it."

In the bedroom, she was tossing clothes into a suitcase when Ethan shoved the door open.

"I'll cooperate with treatment. You're not leaving."

Evelyn hurled a folded shirt at him. "Should've been this reasonable from the start. Needing coaxing to get your legs treated—how childish."

Ethan: "..."

After the storm passed, they settled back into their usual uneasy truce.

Soon, Grandma Sullivan's seventieth birthday arrived.

Neither mentioned the gift again, maintaining their silent agreement.

Evelyn left work early to pick up the sandalwood prayer beads she'd ordered six months prior, then headed straight to Harmony Manor.

Though Grandma had wanted a quiet celebration, Henry and Margaret Sullivan insisted on inviting half of Rongcheng's elite.

The living room buzzed with clinking glasses. The moment Evelyn entered, she saw Margaret chatting warmly with Isabella, who shot her a disdainful glance before turning away.

Evelyn went straight to the guest of honor.

"Evelyn!" Grandma's eyes lit up. "I thought you'd forgotten my birthday."

"Never." Evelyn handed her the velvet box. "Wishing you endless happiness."

Grandma opened it, delight spreading across her face as she admired the lustrous beads. "You always know best!"

Her immediate decision to wear them made the guests reassess this granddaughter-in-law's standing.

"Where's Ethan? Didn't he come with you?"

###Chapter 148

Evelyn shook her head lightly. "I went straight to pick up the prayer beads after work. Mr. Sullivan might still be at the office."

Disappointment flickered in Mrs. Sullivan's eyes. She had hoped their relationship would improve after living under the same roof, but it seemed nothing had changed.

"Working late on my birthday? You must scold him properly when he arrives!"

Evelyn pressed her lips into a faint smile. "Of course."

Nearby, Isabella watched as Mrs. Sullivan doted on Evelyn while barely acknowledging her. Her nails dug deep into her palms.

If not for currying favor with this old woman, she wouldn’t endure such humiliation!

"Isabella? Why so quiet?"

Margaret's voice snapped her back to reality. She forced a smile. "Aunt Margaret, I’ve been a bit tired lately."

"Planning the birthday banquet must have been exhausting." Margaret patted her hand. "If only Evelyn were half as considerate as you."

Suppressing her irritation, Isabella lowered her head meekly. "Helping you is my pleasure."

Margaret nodded approvingly. "Don’t worry. You’re the only one I see as my daughter-in-law."

"Aunt Margaret, please don’t say that..." Isabella feigned alarm. "Evelyn and Ethan are already married."

Margaret whispered something in her ear, and Isabella’s face flushed crimson.

After circling the ballroom, Evelyn grew bored and headed to the garden.

At the entrance, she overheard a group of socialites gossiping.

"Mr. Sullivan didn’t show tonight. Too ashamed to be seen in his condition?"

"If I were paralyzed, I’d hide in shame too!"

Evelyn strode in, her expression icy. "Say that to Ethan’s face."

The women startled, then sneered when they recognized her.

"We’re just stating facts. Why so defensive, Miss Sullivan?"

A woman in a pink gown stood. "Pretend you heard nothing, or my father will cut ties with the Jacksons!"

Before Evelyn could respond, a cold voice cut through the air.

"The Wangs must be feeling bold tonight."

Ethan sat in his wheelchair, his gaze sharp as a blade.

The socialites paled instantly.

"Mr. Sullivan... We’re sorry..."

"Please forgive us..."

###Chapter 149

The group of girls trembled in fear. One had already covered her face, quietly sobbing.

Ethan Sullivan's gaze was icy, his voice devoid of warmth. "If you can't control your tongues, you'll face the consequences."

Evelyn Sullivan turned in surprise. "Mr. Sullivan? When did you—"

"Since you left the living room."

Her heart skipped a beat.

So he had been following her all along.

Ethan's expression softened slightly—a rare occurrence. He hadn't expected Evelyn to defend him, and an unfamiliar warmth stirred in his chest.

"Grandmother was looking for you earlier."

"I haven't had the chance to see her yet."

He had spotted her heading toward the garden the moment he arrived at Harmony Manor and followed.

"Let me wheel you over. Did you prepare a gift for her?"

"Yes."

The wheelchair moved forward slowly as they exchanged idle words, the atmosphere surprisingly harmonious.

The moment they entered the living room, all eyes turned toward them.

Though their marriage had been announced at the Jackson family banquet, the guests still couldn't hide their astonishment.

Isabella Jackson clenched her fists so tightly her nails dug into her palms. That position should have been hers!

Upon seeing her grandson, the elderly Mrs. Sullivan deliberately feigned displeasure. "Finally decided to show up?"

Ethan presented a gift box. "Happy birthday, Grandmother."

She accepted it, her lips curving upward when she saw the priceless jade necklace inside.

"Though I must say, Evelyn's prayer beads suit my taste better."

Ethan's gaze sharpened.

That string of beads was worth at least fifty million.

"She gave them to you?"

"Yes."

"They are quite exquisite."

Margaret Sullivan suddenly approached with Isabella in tow.

"Mother, Isabella went to Jietai Temple specially to get you a protective talisman."

Isabella offered the yellow paper with both hands, her voice sweet. "Grandmother Sullivan, I prayed sincerely for a whole month—"

The elder woman accepted it with a faint nod. "How thoughtful."

Isabella's smile froze. She glanced at Ethan, silently pleading for his attention.

But the man's gaze remained fixed on Evelyn.

###Chapter 150

Isabella's nails dug deep into her palms.

Her eyes reddened, but she stubbornly refused to shed a tear.

Margaret Sullivan shot an icy glare at Ethan's hand clasping Evelyn's.

"Ethan," she said coldly, "Isabella rarely visits Harmony Manor. Show her around."

Ethan didn't even glance up. "Let the housekeeper handle it."

"You—!" Margaret's chest heaved with anger. "She grew up with you! Is this how you treat her?"

The elderly Mrs. Sullivan slammed her teacdown with a sharp clatter.

"Enough! Anyone who causes trouble today will be thrown out!"

Isabella forced a smile. "Aunt Margaret, I just remembered I have plans with a friend. Excuse me."

Her skirt swirled sharply as she turned.

Margaret leaned closer to Ethan, her voice low. "After the banquet, you stay."

In the corner, Lily White swirled her champagne glass with a mocking laugh.

"What's the point of sucking up to Margaret? Ethan only has eyes for Evelyn."

Isabella's red lips curved dangerously. "Who said I was sucking up to her?"

"Suit yourself." Lily changed the subject. "I got the supporting role in Eternal Legacy."

Isabella clapped halfheartedly. "Congratulations, superstar."

"That bastard Alexander went crawling back to Sophia..." Lily suddenly crushed a pastry in her hand. "I won't let them be happy."

Before Isabella could ask more, Lily's phone lit up.

After a brief call, she stood abruptly. "Family emergency. Talk later."

The banquet hall fell silent.

Mrs. Sullivan's cake knife clattered to the floor.

Her trembling finger pointed toward the entrance. "Ad... Adrian?"

A man in a crisp suit smiled and spread his arms. "Grandmother, I've returned for your birthday."

The guests gasped collectively.

The long-lost eldest grandson of the Sullivan family had reappeared without warning.

Adrian knelt on one knee, taking the old woman's shaking hands. "This unfilial grandson has made you worry."

Tears streamed down Mrs. Sullivan's face—until her clouded eyes caught a glimpse of the faint scar peeking from his sleeve.

Her pupils constricted sharply.

That was unmistakably a gunshot wound.

###Chapter 151

"Alright, as you wish."

An eight-tier birthday cake was wheeled into the grand hall by the servants. After the guests finished singing "Happy Birthday" to Mrs. Sullivan, the elderly woman made a symbolic cut into the cake before eagerly pulling Adrian Sullivan aside for a private conversation.

Evelyn frowned slightly. She had never heard of this person in the Sullivan family.

"Mr. Sullivan, who is that?"

Ethan's expression remained indifferent. "My cousin, Adrian Sullivan."

"You have an uncle?" Evelyn couldn't hide her surprise.

"They died in a car accident before I met you," Ethan replied, his gaze turning cold. "Adrian left a letter and disappeared from Rongcheng afterward. No one heard from him all these years."

Evelyn wisely didn’t press further. The distance in Ethan’s tone when speaking about his cousin was unmistakable.

As the night deepened and the guests dispersed, Mrs. Sullivan called the two of them over.

"Adrian, this is Ethan and his wife, Evelyn."

Adrian’s gaze lingered briefly on Ethan’s wheelchair, a flicker of something unreadable in his eyes.

"Your legs..."

"Useless," Ethan said calmly, as if discussing the weather.

Adrian paused. "Modern medicine is advanced. There’s always hope."

He turned to Evelyn with a polite, gentle smile. "Nice to meet you, sister-in-law."

"Likewise."

A chill ran down Evelyn’s spine. Despite his warm demeanor, something about this man felt deeply unsettling.

Mrs. Sullivan patted Adrian’s hand. "Your parents' villa has been kept clean. You can stay there tonight."

At the mention of her late son and daughter-in-law, the old woman’s eyes reddened again.

Adrian knelt before her. "I’ll visit their graves tomorrow, then come see you again."

After seeing Adrian off, Mrs. Sullivan waved tiredly. "Everyone, get some rest."

Margaret Sullivan had intended to bring up the divorce but lost the mood, leaving with a cold expression.

On the ride home, Evelyn sensed the heavy tension radiating from Ethan.

"You and your cousin..."

"Are you interested in him?" Ethan suddenly cut in, his gaze sharp as a blade.

Evelyn blinked. "What?"

"You didn’t even blink when he greeted you."

Only then did she realize—that discomfort she felt was the scent of danger. Beneath Adrian’s gentle facade lurked something deeply unsettling.

When she didn’t respond, Ethan’s voice turned icy. "Stay away from him."

Evelyn gazed out at the passing city lights, a faint unease settling in her chest. This sudden appearance of a Sullivan family member was far from simple.

###Chapter 152

"Which eye saw me provoking him?" Evelyn Sullivan frowned, her tone icy.

Ethan Sullivan's gaze darkened. "Both."

"..."

Utterly unreasonable!

She turned her face away, ignoring him while considering whether to investigate Adrian Sullivan's background.

Then it struck her—once divorced from Ethan, the Sullivan family affairs would no longer concern her. No matter how dangerous Adrian was, he couldn't threaten her.

The thought lifted a weight off her chest.

At Harmony Manor, Margaret Sullivan's hand trembled as she clutched her phone.

"Henry, Adrian has returned!"

Within half an hour, Henry Sullivan rushed home, dust still clinging to his clothes.

"What happened?"

He'd been on his way to a business meeting when the call came.

"He appeared during the cake-cutting ceremony," Margaret whispered. "Could he be back for the inheritance?"

Had Zachary and Jane Sullivan not died in that car crash, and Adrian not vanished mysteriously, Ethan might never have become CEO.

Henry's expression turned grave. "We'll observe first. Ethan has managed Sullivan Group all these years. Adrian can have shares, but seizing control? Impossible."

"Why return after all this time?" Margaret twisted her fingers anxiously.

Henry's eyes turned cold. "Adrian is my nephew, orphaned by tragedy. From now on, he's my son. If I hear such words again, don't blame me for being harsh."

Margaret paled, murmuring assent.

"I have work. Won't be back tonight."

Watching her husband leave, Margaret clenched her fists. She should've known—this business marriage never held his heart.

For a month, Dr. Evan had administered daily acupuncture treatments to Ethan.

Today, after the session, Dr. Evan had Ethan attempt standing.

Under Evelyn's hopeful gaze, Ethan slowly rose. Beads of sweat formed on his forehead from the pain, but he remained silent, walking for ten full minutes before returning to his wheelchair.

"Good progress," Dr. Evan nodded. "Continue rehabilitation, and you'll walk normally in two weeks."

Ethan's expression stayed indifferent, showing no joy.

"What's the fee?"

"One million," Dr. Evan said briskly. "I'll send the account details to Ms. Sullivan."

After seeing Dr. Evan out, Evelyn turned back. "Aren't you happy your legs are healing?"

"I am."

His flat tone made her press her lips together.

"I'll draw your bath."

As water filled the tub, Evelyn's mind wandered.

Once his legs recovered, their divorce would proceed.

The thought left a dull ache in her chest.

Perhaps she'd just grown accustomed to his presence. Separation would take adjustment.

"Evelyn!" Ethan's voice suddenly called from the doorway. "Grandmother collapsed—she's hospitalized!"

###Chapter 153

Evelyn's hand trembled violently. The shower's water flow cut off abruptly.

She rushed out of the bathroom, droplets still clinging to her hair.

"What happened?"

Ethan's face was dark as iron, his voice icy. "The hospital."

The hospital corridor lights glared harshly.

Margaret and Henry stood outside the ward. Adrian leaned against the wall, an unlit cigarette between his fingers.

Ethan strode forward. "How's Grandma?"

Henry sighed heavily. "The doctor's examining her."

"What happened?"

The air froze.

Adrian spoke suddenly. "Someone sent a package to Harmony Manor."

He paused, lowering his voice. "A dead baby."

Evelyn gasped, nails digging into her palms.

Ethan's gaze turned glacial. "Check the surveillance?"

"The sender was cunning. They avoided all cameras." Adrian crushed the cigarette. "I've already sent people to investigate."

Ethan pulled out his phone, murderous intent radiating as he dialed. "Find them. Alive or dead."

The doctor emerged. "The patient was just frightened. She'll wake soon."

Margaret forced a smile. "Thank you, Doctor."

She turned to Ethan. "You should all go rest."

Ethan didn't move. "I'll wait for Grandma to wake."

Adrian remained as well.

Evelyn suddenly stood. "I need the restroom."

The stairwell's motion-sensor light flickered.

She quickly typed a message, the screen's glow highlighting her tense jawline.

Click—

The door hinge creaked loudly in the silence.

Evelyn whirled around. "Who's there?"

A phone screen lit up, revealing Adrian's amused face.

"Enjoying some alone time, sister-in-law?" He toyed with the cigarette, eyes predatory like a leopard's.

When he removed the cigarette, his expression smoothed back into gentle refinement.

Evelyn's back chilled. "Just getting some air."

She hurried toward the exit. As she passed him, Adrian suddenly chuckled. "Now's not the best time to return."

The ward door was slightly ajar. Margaret's shrill voice pierced through:

"They must divorce! That woman will be the death of our family!"

Evelyn's hand froze mid-reach.

###Chapter 154

Evelyn Sullivan was about to speak when Ethan Sullivan cut her off coldly. "This is between husband and wife. No outsiders need interfere."

Margaret Sullivan turned pale with rage. "Ethan! How much longer will you keep protecting her?"

An icy aura radiated from Ethan, plunging the hospital room into a sudden chill.

"Mrs. Sullivan," Evelyn said calmly, "Mr. Sullivan and I have already agreed to divorce once his leg injury heals."

"Evelyn Sullivan!"

Ethan's sharp gaze pierced through her like a blade.

She met his eyes steadily. "It's a settled matter. I don't want this causing rifts between you and your family."

"How considerate of you." The sarcasm in his voice made Evelyn press her lips together.

Margaret sneered. "Remember your words today. Don't come crawling back later!"

"Is Mr. Sullivan some priceless treasure worth clinging to?"

Margaret was left speechless, her face twisting with fury.

"No wonder the Jacksons can't stand you. That sharp tongue of yours is unbearable!"

Evelyn's expression turned frosty.

"Mother," Ethan said darkly, "if you have nothing else, you should go rest."

"You're dismissing me for an outsider now?"

"There wouldn't have been this scene if you hadn't stirred trouble."

"So I'm wrong for wanting you to divorce?"

"Since you recognize it's wrong, let this end here."

Margaret stood abruptly. "Fine! I won't interfere in your affairs anymore!"

"Good riddance."

The door slammed shut behind her.

Evelyn stood quietly by the hospital bed, her indifferent gaze fixed on the IV drip.

Half an hour later, Grandma Sullivan finally woke.

"Grandma, take it slow."

Evelyn rushed to support her.

Henry Sullivan approached quickly. "Mother, how are you feeling?"

The elderly woman shook her head weakly. "I'd like to be alone."

"Call us if you need anything."

As Evelyn carefully tucked in the blanket, she caught sight of a tear slipping down the old woman's cheek.

It was the first time she'd seen the ever-smiling Grandma Sullivan look so heartbroken.

In the hallway, Adrian Sullivan arrived in a hurry.

Henry lowered his voice. "Everyone should go home. There's no point crowding here."

"Keep us updated."

Outside the hospital, after Adrian left, Ethan spoke abruptly. "This incident, like my car accident, was premeditated."

Evelyn tightened her grip on the wheelchair handles. "Maybe it's just coincidence—"

"My grandmother actually had four children," Ethan's voice turned glacial. "The youngest was kidnapped as an infant. When we found them..."

Evelyn's heart clenched.

"So that package..."

"It's not suspicion." Ethan's tone brooked no argument. "I know it's the same person behind this."

###Chapter 155

Evelyn pressed her lips together and dropped the subject. "Let's go back."

After returning to the villa, she settled Ethan in bed and immediately retreated to her room to check her messages. The black avatar had sent her a file along with over a dozen texts.

Her expression darkened as she read through them.

Scorpion.

She had planned to deal with him after Ethan's leg healed, but the bastard kept targeting those close to her.

Evelyn lowered her gaze and typed rapidly.

[Find Scorpion's current location for me.]

The reply came swiftly:
[Last spotted at LoseDemon Bar, No. 383 Jiutong Road, Rongcheng.]

[Thanks.]

[Don’t underestimate Scorpion. Make sure you’re fully prepared before making a move.]

She ignored the warning. Changing into dark clothes, she slipped out of the villa unnoticed.

Unbeknownst to her, the curtains in Ethan’s room stirred. A tall figure stood by the window, watching her vanish into the night.

Within minutes of leaving, Evelyn sensed she was being followed. It took her half an hour to shake the tail before she hailed a cab to LoseDemon.

The bar’s entry fee was an exorbitant $2,000, catering exclusively to the wealthy. Its risqué entertainment never led to trouble—thanks to powerful backers.

After paying, Evelyn accepted a fox mask from the host and descended to the underground venue. Deafening music pulsed through the air.

Couples swayed intimately on the dance floor. She averted her gaze and headed for the bar, ordering a drink.

Scorpion frequented this place, but she wasn’t sure he’d be here tonight.

The bartender eyed her delicate jawline and porcelain skin, pegging her as a beauty. He mixed her drink and added a complimentary pudding.

Evelyn smiled, resting her chin on one hand as she surveyed the room with feigned curiosity.

After thirty minutes, the bartender confirmed she was alone and struck up a conversation. "Here by yourself, gorgeous?"

She downed her drink and smirked. "Got a problem with that?"

"Not at all. But it’s not safe." Desire flickered in his eyes. "My shift’s ending. I could take you home. Or... if you want to keep partying, I’m game."

Evelyn pretended to consider it. "Let’s go home. No fun alone. Thanks."

"My pleasure."

After changing, he led her toward the private booth area.

"Isn’t the exit up front?" she asked.

"Too crowded. Staff use this route—leads straight to the subway."

"Alright."

The music faded as they moved deeper into the hallway, footsteps echoing.

"How much farther?"

"Almost there."

Two hulking men suddenly blocked their path at a corner, reaching for Evelyn. She dodged and glared at the bartender lurking behind them. "What’s this about?"

###Chapter 156

"Little girl, aren't you here for some fun?" The bartender licked his lips, his gaze crawling over her like oil. "How about I show you something more exciting?"

As he spoke, two hulking men lunged from the shadows.

The bartender's triumphant smirk froze.

The delicate-looking girl pivoted, her leg slicing through the air with lethal precision. Both men crashed to the floor without even grazing her clothes, howling in pain.

"Misunderstanding! It was all a misunderstanding!" The bartender paled, stumbling backward.

Evelyn Sullivan twisted his wrist. A sharp crack echoed as his arm went limp.

"Ah—Mercy, please! I won't dare again!"

"Want to live?" She released him, staring down coldly. "Answer my questions."

"Anything! I'll tell you everything!"

"Did someone recently book your most expensive private room?"

The bartender's pupils constricted. "How did you—"

"Yes or no."

"Y-yes... A masked man. Comes every Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Always with a group of thugs..." Sweat beaded on his forehead. "That's all I know, I swear!"

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. "What time does he arrive?"

"A-around nine... Never stays more than two hours..."

She let go. The bartender crumpled to the ground.

"Remember this—lie to me, and you'll suffer ten times worse."

Exiting the bar, Evelyn glanced at the hidden door at the end of the hallway. It led straight to the subway—perfect cover for the bartender's crimes.

The villa was silent when she returned late that night.

Light spilled from the living room. Ethan Sullivan sat rigid on the sofa, radiating icy fury.

"Where were you?" His voice could freeze hell.

Evelyn paused. "Personal business."

"Personal business?" He shot to his feet. "At 3 AM?"

"I don't report to you."

"I'm your husband!" His fist smashed through the coffee table. Glass shattered.

Evelyn turned toward the stairs. "Think whatever you want."

As the bedroom door clicked shut, porcelain exploded downstairs. Leaning against the door, her fingers absently traced the hidden weapon in her sleeve—Ethan's moods were becoming increasingly unpredictable.

Friday, 8 PM. Evelyn entered the private room right on schedule.

Scorpion lounged on the leather sofa, his silver-gray mask glinting. A raspy chuckle escaped as she walked in.

"Iris. I've heard so much about you."

Evelyn took the seat opposite him, gaze sharp as a blade. "Scorpion. Keep our feud between us. Leave innocents out of it."

"Innocents?" He leaned forward abruptly. "When you slaughtered thirty-seven of my men, did you think about their families?"

He slammed the table. A dozen black-clad figures materialized, sealing off the room.

"I'll make you watch as everyone you care about disappears."

###Chapter 157

Evelyn's fingers twitched imperceptibly, resting on the dagger at her waist. "So there's no room for negotiation?"

Scorpion lounged in the leather sofa, his masked eyes glinting coldly. "Don't be hasty. My men are stationed outside Mrs. Sullivan's hospital room. If I die, she won't last the night."

Evelyn narrowed her eyes, her knuckles whitening. "Your terms."

"Simple." Scorpion polished his blade with deliberate slowness. "Your life for my brother's."

"It was just a job." Her laugh was icy. "The rules are clear—vengeance belongs to the one who was wronged."

"Rules?" Scorpion suddenly lunged, his dagger grazing her ear before embedding into the wall. "Where were your rules when you took his life?"

In a flash, Evelyn spun forward, pressing her blade to his throat. "Call off your men."

Scorpion chuckled, his warm breath brushing her hand. "Kill me, and you'll never leave this room alive."

She tilted her dagger upward, catching the strap of his mask. "Then let the underworld see Scorpion's true face."

The air turned to ice.

"Interesting." Scorpion abruptly clapped. "I'll give you a chance. Walk out alive, and I'll withdraw my men."

"Deal."

From the second-floor railing, Scorpion swirled his wineglass, watching the battle unfold with amusement. Eight mercenaries encircled Evelyn, their blades carving cold arcs through the dimly lit private room.

The first cut split her shoulder, unleashing the metallic tang of blood. She twisted the attacker's wrist, snapping it, then drove the stolen combat knife into the second man's chest.

By the fifth corpse, a deep gash exposed the bone in her right leg. The remaining three exchanged glances and shifted tactics.

"Iris lives up to her reputation." Scorpion's voice drifted down as the last mercenary crumpled, clutching his throat.

Evelyn braced against the table, gasping, blood dripping from her fingers. "Remember your promise."

"The game has only begun." His laughter slithered down her spine like a serpent. "I'll make you watch everyone you care about disappear."

Staggering out of the bar, neon lights blurred into streaks of blood in her vision. She collapsed onto the sidewalk, the screech of brakes the last thing she heard before darkness took her.

The sting of antiseptic shocked her awake.

"Don't move." Adrian pressed a hand to her shoulder. "Three stab wounds. You lost 800cc of blood."

Her pupils constricted. "Why are you here?"

"I happened to be in the bar district." He offered her water. "Ethan's been notified."

The door burst open as Ethan's wheelchair crushed shattered glass under its wheels. Colin barely had time to react before being slammed outside.

"Explain." Ethan yanked open her hospital gown. The brutal wounds beneath the bandages darkened his gaze. "Who did this?"

###Chapter 158

Evelyn's lips trembled slightly. The words died on her tongue.

Ethan's gaze turned icy, his voice laced with unyielding authority. "Evelyn Sullivan, if you dare say it's none of your business again, I'll turn LoseDemon upside down."

His threat hung over her like a blade.

She lowered her lashes, fingers absently tracing the edge of the blanket. Scorpion wouldn't leave marks if he wanted to torture her.

"Speak!" Ethan slammed his palm against the nightstand, rattling the IV stand.

"You already know the answer," she said, lifting her eyes to meet his with unsettling calm.

The air froze.

A nurse pushed the door open, flinching at the tension.

"This IV will take an hour and a half." She stole a glance at Ethan's sharp profile, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Press the call button if you need anything."

Ethan didn't even blink.

The nurse hurried out, cheeks flushed, muttering under her breath, "Handsome but terrifying..."

Evelyn bit her lower lip as a dull ache spread through her abdomen.

"Mr. Sullivan." Her voice was barely audible. "Could you call the nurse?"

If not for the bandages, she'd rather suffer in silence.

Ethan pressed the call button without looking away from her flushed ears.

When the IV finished, Evelyn tried to sit up.

"Stay down!" The nurse pushed her back. "Do you want your stitches to tear?"

Evelyn retreated under the covers.

In the hallway, Colin hesitated.

"I'll get some air." She tactfully turned away.

The sound of wheelchair wheels faded.

"The surveillance was wiped," Colin murmured. "Seven dead in the VIP room, but it's been hushed up."

Ethan's knuckles whitened. "Find former staff. Money is no object."

Back in the room, Evelyn stared blankly out the window.

"A busy man like you shouldn't waste time here."

"Saturday," he sneered. "So you don't disappear again."

She closed her eyes.

On discharge day, sunlight made her squint.

At the villa, her phone buzzed.

A message from Vulture: [Did Scorpion find you?]

Her fingers hovered before typing: [We crossed paths.]

[Be careful! That lunatic never lets go!]

She paused, then typed: [You knew Scorpion was among the survivors that mission, didn't you?]

The typing indicator flickered with no reply.

Her final message: [The real mission wasn't to kill Scorpion. It was to lure him to me, wasn't it?]

###Chapter 159

Evelyn stared at her phone screen for a few seconds before tapping lightly to block the number.

She would settle this score after dealing with Scorpion.

A full week passed without any trace of Scorpion. It was as if he had vanished into thin air. But Evelyn knew the madman was watching from the shadows, waiting for his next opportunity.

Her fists clenched, nails digging into her palms.

No more playing defense. It was time to strike first.

Dr. Howard held the medical report with an expression of disbelief.

"Mr. Sullivan, your recovery speed is nothing short of miraculous! At this rate, you'll be walking normally by next week."

Ethan responded with a faint hum, his eyes devoid of emotion.

After Dr. Howard left, he dialed Colin's number.

"Prepare a divorce agreement. Deliver it tonight."

Night fell. The moment Evelyn stepped into the living room, a document was thrust into her hands.

"Sign it."

Her pupils contracted at the words "Divorce Agreement."

"You—"

"I've already signed." Ethan's voice was icy. "The paperwork will be finalized within a week after notarization."

Her throat tightened. Her fingers absently traced the edge of the paper.

Their time together had made her waver on the divorce she once insisted on. But reason told her that repeating past mistakes would only bring more pain.

The pen scratched against the paper with a soft rustle.

"Mail me the divorce certificate."

"Fine."

"I'll move out this weekend."

Ethan turned toward the door. "No need. The villa has been transferred to your name."

The sound of the door closing echoed sharply through the silent house.

Evelyn stood before her easel, surrounded by discarded sketches. Frustrated, she threw down her brush and went to the kitchen for water.

The sound of rolling luggage came from the living room.

Colin froze when he saw her. "Ms. Sullivan, Mr. Sullivan sent me to collect some clothes."

"Mm."

"He's waiting in the car. I'll be going now."

The glass grew cold in her hands. Evelyn stared at the empty foyer, her chest heavy as if weighed down by stone.

Outside, Colin stuffed the empty suitcase into the trunk before hesitating. "Mr. Sullivan, are you sure about this?"

Ethan ran his fingers over the fresh signature on the divorce papers, his gaze dark.

"Only by letting her think it's over can we truly start again."

If she believed their marriage had reached its end, he would play along.

And then he would make her fall in love with him all over again.

###Chapter 160

The day the divorce certificate arrived, Evelyn Sullivan stared at the small red booklet for a long time.

Her fingertips brushed against the cover, and it felt strangely hot to the touch.

Instead of the expected relief, it was like a stone finally dropping—leaving a shallow dent in her heart.

She tucked the document into the deepest drawer and began packing.

The villa in Northville was closer to the office, making the move more convenient. As for this marital home, since Ethan Sullivan had already transferred it to her, selling it wouldn’t be an issue.

After listing the property, she wheeled her suitcase out the front door.

"Evelyn?"

The familiar voice made her pause.

Daniel Sterling stood at the entrance of the neighboring villa, his gaze lingering on her luggage, a flicker of hope in his eyes.

"I'm moving here," she said plainly. "We're divorced."

His pupils contracted slightly, and the corners of his lips lifted unconsciously.

"I’ve been meaning to tell you—I live right next door—"

A sudden phone ring cut him off.

After hanging up, Evelyn offered an apologetic smile. "Something urgent came up. Let’s talk another time."

Daniel watched her hurried departure, words left unspoken.

Night fell.

Evelyn closed her laptop and rubbed her stiff neck. Outside, the city lights shimmered, and her phone screen lit up at the perfect moment.

"Wrapped!" Zoe Zade’s cheerful voice burst through the receiver. "Come have late-night snacks with me!"

"I haven’t even had dinner yet."

"Perfect!" Zoe exclaimed. "My treat—we’re going to the most expensive place in town!"

"Big paycheck?"

"Just…" Zoe dragged out the word playfully, "a fraction of a small fortune!"

Evelyn chuckled and sent her the location.

The doorbell rang just as she finished wiping the coffee table.

"Missed you so much!" Zoe flung her arms open for a hug.

Evelyn sidestepped gracefully. "Mind your image, superstar."

"Ugh!" Zoe puffed her cheeks. "You have no idea how exhausting it is to keep up appearances every day."

"Cold beauty persona crumbling?"

"Blame my agent!" Zoe groaned. "I’m a total softie, but she insists I act like some ice queen!"

Then she leaned in conspiratorially. "But lately, there’s this investor chasing me hard—even funded Eternal Legacy just to have dinner with me."

Evelyn raised a brow. "Interested?"

"Not a chance!" Zoe scoffed. "I still prefer the Ethan Sullivan type—aloof and untouchable—"

Before she could finish, she collapsed onto the couch, laughing at herself.

###Chapter 161

Evelyn choked on her water.

Zoe quickly waved her hands in explanation. "Don't get me wrong—I have no interest in Ethan. I just admire men of his type."

During her last dinner with Lucas, she'd learned about Ethan and Evelyn's marriage. At the time, she'd barely contained her curiosity.

Evelyn wiped the table with a napkin, her tone calm. "We're divorced. Feel free to pursue him if you want."

Zoe's eyes widened.

She had just processed the news of her friend's marriage, only to be told about the divorce moments later.

"How could you let go of such a perfect man?"

"I fell out of love." Evelyn shrugged.

Zoe was speechless.

After the meal, they ran into Ethan and Isabella at the restaurant entrance.

It was their first encounter since the divorce.

Ethan's leg injury had healed well—he no longer needed a wheelchair.

An inexplicable tightness settled in Evelyn's chest.

Ethan gave her a cold glance before looking away, as if she were a stranger.

Isabella clung to his arm, her sweet smile laced with provocation. "Oh, sister, you're here too? We could've dined together."

Evelyn grabbed Zoe's wrist and walked past them without a word.

Watching her retreating figure, Isabella feigned hurt. "Ethan, why is sister ignoring us?"

He replied flatly, "Weren't you hungry? Let's go in."

He entered the restaurant first, not sparing Isabella another glance.

This dinner had been arranged by Margaret. After the old lady's birthday banquet, she'd wanted to thank Isabella but couldn't find the time, so she'd asked Ethan to do it instead.

He hadn't wanted to come but gave in to his mother's insistence.

He hadn't expected to run into Evelyn. Since the divorce, she'd grown bold—daring to pretend she didn't know him.

But that woman with her... she looked familiar.

Ethan pulled out his phone and texted Lucas: What's the name of that actress you're chasing?

Lucas replied quickly: Why the sudden interest?

Ethan: Just saw Evelyn having dinner with her.

Lucas: Oh, they're friends. They were together last time we ran into Evelyn too.

Ethan stared at the screen for a few seconds before typing: Next time you ask her out, invite me.

Lucas: ??? You're not into Zoe, are you?

Before Ethan could respond, Isabella spoke up. "Ethan, you've been on your phone this whole time. Do you not want to have dinner with me?"

###Chapter 162

Ethan Sullivan locked his phone screen and lifted his gaze to meet Isabella Jackson's tear-filled eyes across the table.

In the past, he would have comforted her tenderly. Now, his temples throbbed with irritation.

"Isabella, this dinner is to thank you for organizing Grandma's birthday banquet." His knuckles tapped lightly on the table. "Nothing more."

Her nails dug into her palms. "Even after the divorce, I still don't have a chance?"

She stared at the intricate patterns on the tablecloth. How could she lose to Evelyn Sullivan? The woman she had always looked down on.

"You'll always be my sister."

"Sister?" Isabella suddenly laughed bitterly. "When we shared the same bed, you never called me that."

Ethan's eyes turned icy.

"If I hadn't left the country in anger back then—"

"There are no 'what ifs.'" He cut her off. "Evelyn and I are only temporarily separated."

Isabella shot to her feet, her napkin fluttering to the floor.

"She said she would never come back!"

The air around Ethan turned frigid. A glass on the table cracked with a sharp sound.

In the car on the way back, Isabella's tears soaked her Chanel jacket. Through the rearview mirror, the man's chiseled profile remained unmoved.

"I'll wait for you to change your mind," she choked out before slamming the car door.

The black Maybach turned toward the southern district but screeched to a halt outside a darkened villa. Colin Keller's hesitant voice came through the phone. "Miss Sullivan has moved to Northville Villa..."

Northville Villa was brightly lit.

Ethan watched as Daniel Sterling carried a fruit platter inside. The leather steering wheel creaked under his grip.

"Schedule Daniel for a shoot," he said, his voice dripping with ice. "The farther away, the better."

Inside the villa, Zoe Zade was sticking notes on Daniel's face.

"Royal flush!" Evelyn tossed down her last two cards, and all three burst into laughter.

Daniel's phone buzzed. His expression darkened. "The crew needs me for emergency reshoots."

After seeing their guests out, Zoe leaned in close. "The way Daniel looks at you..."

Evelyn choked on her watermelon juice, her face turning red.

"He never smiles on set," Zoe mused, swirling her wineglass. "But just now, his eyes sparkled when he looked at you."

Outside, tree shadows swayed in the darkness. No one noticed the car parked in the shadows.

Ethan stared at the second-floor lights and dialed another number.

"Check Daniel's upcoming schedule," he said coldly. "I want him on set tomorrow."

###Chapter 163

Evelyn frowned slightly. "That's just his personality. He's distant with people he's not close to."

Zoe smirked knowingly. "But he's different with you."

Evelyn opened her mouth to explain that it was because she'd helped him during his darkest days, but remembering Daniel might not want those memories dredged up, she swallowed her words.

"You're overthinking it."

The doorbell rang abruptly.

Evelyn hurried to the door and peered through the peephole. Ethan's stern face filled her vision, and her fingers tightened involuntarily.

"What do you want?"

His gaze was heavy. "Why did you sell the villa?"

"It's my property. I can do what I want with it."

"Are you living with Daniel now?"

His accusatory tone ignited her temper. "Since when do you care, Ethan?"

Zoe's voice carried from the living room. "Evelyn, is that Daniel?"

"No!" She quickly pushed Ethan back. "Just a salesman."

Slamming the door, she hissed under her breath, "Leave. Now."

Ethan's lips curled coldly. "Afraid Daniel might see me?"

"Not everyone moves on the day after their divorce by flaunting their new lover in public."

He stepped closer suddenly. "Does it bother you?"

Evelyn stumbled back against the door. "Don't flatter yourself."

"How's work been?"

"What do you actually want?"

His eyes lingered on her face. "Just wanted to see you."

"Seen enough? Then go."

Footsteps approached from inside.

"Evelyn?"

In a panic, she yanked Ethan into the shadows by the wall, positioning herself to block the doorway.

"Coming in a second!"

Zoe pulled the door open, scanning the hallway suspiciously.

"Everything okay?"

"Go take your shower. I'm going for a walk."

Out of the corner of her eye, Evelyn saw Ethan shift. Her heart skipped a beat as she shoved Zoe inside and locked the door.

"Evelyn Sullivan," Zoe's muffled voice came through the wood, "you've got a man stashed out there, don't you?"

###Chapter 164

Evelyn's heart skipped a beat. She forced herself to stay calm. "Stop making wild guesses. I just wanted some peace and quiet. You're the one who stirred me up with your nonsense!"

There was silence on the other end of the line for a few seconds before Zoe finally drawled, "Fine. Take your time. I'm going for a soak."

The dial tone sounded. Evelyn exhaled in relief.

Ethan emerged from the shadows, his handsome face dark with anger.

"Evelyn, am I really that shameful to be seen with?"

"Mr. Sullivan, mind your position." She took half a step back. "What would people think if they saw me tangled up with my ex-husband at this hour?"

His brows furrowed. "Divorced couples can't meet?"

"During the day, yes. Not in the dead of night."

He scoffed. "So Daniel Sterling can visit you openly at midnight?"

"He's a friend. It's different." She waved impatiently. "If there's nothing else, please leave."

His eyes turned icy. He grabbed her wrist. "Is this how you're going to talk to me now?"

"Let go!" She yanked her arm free. "I'll call security if you don't leave!"

Ethan fell silent.

"I have a meeting tomorrow. No time for your drama." She turned toward the door. "Don't come back."

The villa door slammed shut with enough force to make the porch light sway.

As she changed into slippers, she spotted Zoe leaning against the stair railing, arms crossed, smirking.

Evelyn's pulse jumped. "I thought you were taking a bath."

"Waiting for you to come clean." Zoe blinked. "Who was at the door? Aren't you going to introduce us?"

"What door—"

"Playing dumb?" Zoe moved toward the entrance. "He probably hasn't gone far—"

"Fine, fine! It was Ethan."

Zoe's eyes widened. "Your ex-husband? Isn't he all over Isabella? What was he doing here at this hour? Unless..."

"Stop." Evelyn rubbed her temples. "He was just passing by."

"Bullshit!" Zoe rolled her eyes. "A man shows up at his ex-wife's door at midnight. What else could it be?"

Evelyn gave a wry smile. "Maybe he was bored."

"Girl, have some self-respect."

"It's not about that." Evelyn gazed out the window at the night sky. "Three years of marriage couldn't make him look at me twice. You think divorce suddenly opened his eyes?"

Zoe hesitated.

She knew very little about the details of that marriage.

"Whatever. Out with the old, in with the new." Zoe slung an arm around her shoulders. "Tomorrow, I'm taking you to meet some fresh meat!"

###Chapter 165

Evelyn Sullivan set down the documents and rubbed her temples.

"Maybe a hot shower will help. You have an early morning tomorrow."

Zoe Zade hugged a pillow on the couch, her eyes sparkling as she watched Evelyn.

"Tingting, I don't have any gigs lined up right now. Can I crash at your place for a few days? I'll pay rent!"

Evelyn chuckled and pinched her cheek.

"Since when do we talk about money?"

"Then I won't hold back!"

......

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains. The moment Evelyn came downstairs, she caught the rich aroma of breakfast.

Zoe stood in the kitchen, an apron tied around her waist, busy at work.

"You didn’t have to do this. I usually just grab something quick."

Zoe pushed a steaming cup of soy milk toward her.

"No way. I can’t freeload. From now on, I’m handling all your meals!"

"Really, it’s not necessary—"

"Two options," Zoe interrupted. "Either take rent money or let me cook."

Evelyn shook her head in defeat.

"Fine. But don’t overdo it."

"Got it! Now eat up—you’ll be late."

......

MY Fashion Group, Design Director’s Office.

Sophia Reynolds burst through the door.

"Evelyn, we have a problem. Brocade just interfered with our project. They’re already in talks with the Paisleys."

Evelyn’s pen stilled.

Brocade was a high-end brand under the Sullivan Group. They never bothered with small-scale projects like this.

"Find out why."

An image of Ethan Sullivan’s cold, sharp features flashed through her mind.

That man didn’t operate this way.

"Secretary Xu, arrange a meeting with Ryan Paisley."

......

Top floor, Sullivan Group headquarters.

Colin Keller placed a file on the desk.

"Mr. Sullivan, Brocade’s losses are worse than projected."

Ethan’s gaze darkened.

"Notify management. Emergency meeting in thirty minutes."

The conference room was thick with tension.

"Is this the best you could do?"

Ethan slammed the report onto the table. Half the executives were fired on the spot.

Jason Zade, the newly appointed general manager, wiped sweat from his brow.

"Sir, we’re trying to secure the Paisley textile deal, but... MY might have beaten us to it."

Ethan’s lips curled into a cold smile.

"And?"

Jason’s knees nearly buckled.

###Chapter 166

Ethan Sullivan's gaze swept over Jason Zade like a blade, sending cold sweat trickling down the man's back.

"Mr. Sullivan... Brocade is short-staffed right now. The Paisley Group seems to favor MY..."

Ethan's slender fingers tapped twice on the desk, his voice icy. "Noted."

When silence returned to the office, he dialed Ryan Paisley's number.

"What an unexpected call," Ryan's voice held a teasing lilt.

"I want the Paisley Group's collaboration with MY."

The rustling of papers sounded through the phone before Ryan chuckled. "Since when do you personally handle such small projects?"

"Name your terms."

Ryan's tone suddenly turned serious. "Is this for Isabella?"

Ethan's eyes darkened. "None of your business."

"Thirty percent of the Eastside Project," Ryan tapped his desk. "But tell me, Ethan—does Evelyn know about this?"

The call ended abruptly.

Ryan stared at the darkened screen, a mocking smile curling his lips. He turned to his secretary. "Inform MY the deal is off."

The moment the secretary left, Ryan slammed the files onto his desk. Evelyn's ever-smiling eyes flashed in his mind, an inexplicable tightness gripping his chest.

Meanwhile, Quincy Howard rushed into Evelyn's office.

"Ms. Sullivan, the Paisley Group—"

"I know." Evelyn signed documents without looking up, her pen leaving deep marks on the paper. "Tell the team to stand down."

Sophia Reynolds burst in just as Evelyn stood by the floor-to-ceiling window. The sunset stretched her silhouette, making her appear fragile enough to vanish at any moment.

"It was Ethan!" Sophia's voice trembled with anger. "He'd stoop this low just to pave the way for Isabella!"

Evelyn turned, her expression unreadable. "Notify Legal. Prepare to sue Brocade for breach of contract."

She grabbed her coat and headed for the door, pausing briefly. "And dig up my divorce papers with Ethan."

###Chapter 167

Sophia Reynolds tapped her fingers absently against the desk, staring at the computer screen. The sudden takeover of MY Fashion Group's partnership by Sullivan Corporation felt too coincidental. If she didn't know better, she'd suspect this was Ethan Sullivan's retaliation for the divorce—except he had no idea Evelyn Sullivan was MY's CEO.

"Evelyn, the deal fell through," Sophia said into the phone, barely containing her frustration.

A brief silence followed before Evelyn's calm voice responded, "Send me the backup fabric suppliers' list."

After hanging up, Evelyn studied the profiles of three companies on her screen, her fingertips lightly drumming the desk. She pressed the intercom. "Quincy, schedule meetings with these executives."

By six in the evening, Evelyn sat at the reserved restaurant table, her lemon water refilled three times. At six-thirty, she called Quincy again. "Find out where they are."

"Evelyn, they suddenly left for a business trip," Quincy fumed. "No courtesy call—completely unprofessional!"

Evelyn chuckled dryly. "Business is war. Get used to it." She hung up, gazing at the neon lights outside. MY was like this ice-cold lemon water—desperately needing fresh energy.

She dialed Zoe Zade. "Free for dinner?"

Half an hour later, a figure in a baseball cap, sunglasses, and a mask slipped furtively into the restaurant. Evelyn burst out laughing at her friend's over-the-top disguise. "You're drawing more attention like this."

"Really?" Zoe glanced around nervously before removing her sunglasses, revealing dramatic stage makeup.

Evelyn raised an eyebrow. "Auditioning for a play?"

Zoe pointed proudly at her fake mole. "How's my spycraft?"

Their laughter was interrupted by a familiar voice. "Miss Zade, what a coincidence."

Zoe froze. Lucas Laurier stood beside their table, smirking. His gaze shifted to Evelyn, then faltered. "Evelyn?"

"Don't call her that!" Zoe snapped. "She's divorced from Ethan."

Lucas's eyes darted between them before he grinned. "We're in VIP Room 1. Care to join?"

Evelyn set her glass down with a sharp clink. She met his gaze with a cool smile. "No, thank you."

###Chapter 168

Lucas Laurier froze in place, his smile stiffening on his face.

"That can't be true. We just asked Ethan when you two were planning to have kids, and he said it was up to you..."

His sharp instincts told him Ethan hadn't informed their friend group about the divorce.

Evelyn Sullivan frowned slightly.

She didn’t understand why Ethan was keeping this a secret.

"We've already signed the divorce papers."

Lucas awkwardly rubbed his nose. The usually smooth-talking man found himself at a loss for words.

"Well... I should head back to the private room."

He practically fled the scene.

The private room door burst open.

"Ethan!" Lucas's voice rose sharply. "You and Evelyn are divorced, and you didn’t tell us?"

Ethan Sullivan and Ryan Paisley both looked up.

"Who told you that?" Ethan's gaze turned icy.

"I ran into Evelyn in the restroom. She said it herself." Lucas sighed. "From the moment Isabella returned, I knew this day would come..."

Ryan clenched his fists, his knuckles turning white.

So they were already divorced.

A secret flicker of joy stirred in his chest.

Ethan suddenly stood and strode out of the room.

In another corner of the restaurant, Evelyn was laughing with Zoe Zade.

A shadow fell over their table.

"Come with me." Ethan's voice was cold as ice.

Evelyn set down her chopsticks. "Whatever it is, can it wait—"

Before she could finish, his hand clamped around her wrist.

"Ethan, what are you doing?" Zoe slammed her hands on the table.

Evelyn shook her head at her, signaling her not to interfere.

Inside an empty private room, Ethan slammed the door shut.

"Why did you tell Lucas we're divorced?"

Evelyn met his gaze calmly. "Isn't it the truth?"

"Grandmother's health is fragile. She can't handle the shock."

"She agreed to the divorce when we signed the papers."

Ethan took a step closer. "She adores you. How could you bear to break her heart? Once you remarry, will you even visit her?"

Evelyn's lips curled into a cold smile. "So you expect me to keep up this charade for you?"

###Chapter 169

"I'll personally tell Grandma the truth within three months. Until then, I need you to keep this secret."

Evelyn frowned slightly, sensing something unspoken in Ethan's words.

"When exactly?"

"No later than three months."

Silence stretched between them before Evelyn reluctantly nodded.

"Fine. I hope you keep your word."

As she turned to leave, Ethan grabbed her wrist.

"You'll need to play along during this time. Every visit to Grandma requires your presence."

"Ethan!" She yanked her arm free. "Keeping this secret is already crossing my line!"

His gaze darkened. "Grandma's health has been declining since the last shock. I won't have her worrying about us."

"Understood." Her voice turned icy. "Anything else?"

He released her and shook his head.

"I'm leaving."

The private room door slammed shut. Ethan remained motionless, his fingertips still warm from her skin.

Returning to the VIP suite, Evelyn had lost her appetite. After picking at her food, she left the restaurant with Zoe.

"I must've been blind!" Zoe fumed in the car. "Arrogant control freaks are the worst!"

Evelyn changed the subject. "How did you meet Lucas Laurier?"

"That annoying investor!" Zoe rolled her eyes. "He keeps inviting me to dinner under the pretense of discussing Eternal Legacy, always so damn polite I can't even refuse properly!"

Lucas's flirtatious charm screamed playboy—exactly the type Zoe despised.

"Rumor says he changes girlfriends more often than shirts," Evelyn warned.

"Relax!" Zoe scoffed. "I hate players like him."

The memory of her mother excusing her father's endless betrayals haunted her. That childhood trauma had killed her belief in love.

"Just be careful."

"I'll quit acting once I save enough!" Zoe's eyes sparkled. "Open a little bookstore somewhere anonymous—just reading and sunbathing all day."

Back at Northville Villa, Evelyn buried herself in paperwork until late evening. Rubbing her stiff neck, she emerged from the study past ten.

Her phone buzzed with William's caller ID.

"Evelyn, where are you?"

Her tone chilled. "What do you want?"

After an endless pause, he finally spoke. "Come home. We need to talk."

###Chapter 170

Evelyn's cold voice came through the phone. "Get to the point."

William's tone was awkward. "The Sullivan Group is developing the Eastside Project... Could you put in a word for me?"

Evelyn let out a soft laugh. "Do you really think he'd listen to me?"

"You're his wife—"

"Sorry. Can't help."

The call ended abruptly.

William's face darkened instantly. He slammed his phone onto the couch.

Victoria sneered beside him. "I told you she's an ungrateful wretch!"

"We never should have brought her back," William growled through clenched teeth.

Isabella walked in to find her parents sitting stiffly in the living room, their expressions stormy.

"What's wrong?"

Victoria immediately launched into her complaint. "It's that precious sister of yours!"

After hearing the story, Isabella soothed them gently. "Let me try."

Back in her room, Isabella dialed Ethan's number.

The phone rang for a long time before he answered.

"What is it?"

His voice was icy.

Isabella softened her tone. "Ethan, about the Eastside Project—"

"Isabella." Ethan cut her off sharply. "This isn't a game."

The line went dead.

Isabella gripped her phone so tightly her nails dug into her palm.

Sullivan Group CEO Office.

Ethan stared at the documents on his desk before speaking abruptly. "Has William been here?"

Colin nodded. "Three times."

"Next time, tell him directly," Ethan said, his gaze frigid. "The Jackson Group isn't qualified."

###Chapter 171

"Mr. Sullivan, is there a problem?"

Ethan Sullivan remained silent for a long moment, his fingers tapping lightly on the desk.

"Look into that land project. See which smaller contracts can be allocated to the Jacksons."

Colin Keller's eyes flickered with surprise, but he quickly masked it.

"I'll get right on it."

The office fell back into silence. Ethan picked up his phone, staring at Evelyn Sullivan's profile picture on the screen. After a long pause, he locked the device.

Three hours later, Colin returned with documents.

"Mr. Sullivan, the swimming pool and landscaping contracts can be outsourced to the Jacksons."

"Contact William Jackson." Ethan paused. "Next time he comes, let him through without delay."

Colin nodded and left, his mind reeling.

The change was too sudden. Even during Ethan's passionate relationship with Isabella, he had never shown favoritism to the Jacksons. Unless... this was for Evelyn?

Colin suddenly understood. He'd have to treat William with more respect from now on—this was his future father-in-law.

At the Jackson villa, Isabella had just calmed down and was preparing for bed when her door was knocked open urgently.

"Isabella!" Victoria Farley beamed with excitement. "Did you contact Ethan?"

Isabella froze, remembering the rejected call earlier.

"Mom, actually—"

"Your father just got word! The Sullivans are giving the Eastside Project to our family!" Victoria clasped her daughter's hands. "I knew you could make it happen!"

Isabella's pupils contracted. Ethan had been so cold on the phone—how could this be?

"I... I'm just so happy," she forced a smile.

Victoria lovingly stroked her hair. "This project will bring in at least a hundred million. What reward would you like?"

"Nothing, Mom."

"That six-million-dollar dress—we'll go buy it tomorrow."

Isabella's eyes lit up as she threw herself into Victoria's arms. "Thank you, Mom!"

The next morning, Evelyn had just picked up her car keys when her phone rang.

"Evelyn!" Sophia Reynolds' voice was urgent. "Glorious is suing us for copyright infringement!"

###Chapter 172

Evelyn Sullivan frowned. "What happened?"

"MY's designs from last quarter just launched yesterday and sold out instantly. But this morning, a plagiarism scandal exploded. Glorious sent us a cease-and-desist letter!"

Sophia Reynolds trembled with anger. She had personally reviewed those designs—there was no way they were plagiarized.

"Send me the accused designs. Do we have photos of Glorious's piece?"

"No physical images, but Glorious claims they have stock at Qanda Mall. I was about to head there."

Evelyn checked her watch. "The mall isn't open yet. Let’s return to the office first. Bring the designer to my office."

"What about the online backlash?"

"Stay silent for now. We don’t want to give them ammunition."

Half an hour later, Yvonne Young, a timid new designer, stood nervously before Evelyn’s desk. No one would expect such bold designs from this shy girl.

Sophia handed her a glass of water. "Relax. Tell us when you designed this piece. Do you still have the original draft?"

"It was completed on May 3rd and uploaded to the cloud that same day." Yvonne’s eyes reddened. "Sophia, I swear I didn’t copy anything!"

"I believe you." Sophia reassured her. "Walk us through your inspiration and design process."

By the time the sun dipped low, Sophia had compiled all the timelines. Evelyn closed the folder. "Time to face Glorious."

The online images only showed a vague resemblance, but they needed to examine the details in person.

Qanda Mall blazed with lights. The moment they approached Glorious’s entrance, a clerk blocked them.

"Sorry. MY employees aren’t allowed inside."

Sophia smirked. "What’s wrong? Afraid we’ll expose you?"

The clerk forced a smile. "Only plagiarists would say that."

"You—"

Evelyn yanked Sophia back before she could lunge. Dragging her away, Evelyn’s eyes darkened.

"They were prepared for us. The cease-and-desist is just the beginning. This might end up in court."

Sophia kicked a pebble in frustration. "Cowards!"

"Back to the office." Evelyn glanced at the mall’s security cameras. "I’ll find a way to get that dress."

###Chapter 173

Sophia slammed her palm against the bathroom sink, sending icy droplets splashing onto her face.

"I can't swallow this insult!"

She whirled around and stormed out of the restroom, her stilettos clicking sharply against the marble floor.

Evelyn Sullivan leaned against the railing, her fingers gliding swiftly across her phone screen. The moment she sent Vanessa Cruz's message, she locked her phone and lifted her gaze to the massive advertisement hanging in the mall atrium.

The plagiarism scandal loomed like a ticking time bomb, threatening to obliterate MY Fashion Group at any moment.

"Evelyn Sullivan!"

A shrill voice sliced through the air.

Evelyn turned slowly to see Victoria Farley striding toward her, Isabella Jackson clinging to her arm. The luxury shopping bag in Isabella's hand gleamed under the lights, its prominent logo impossible to miss.

Victoria closed the distance in quick strides, her meticulously groomed brows furrowed in anger.

"Too busy to see us yesterday, but now you have time to shop?"

Evelyn's lips curled into a cold smile.

"Mrs. Farley, you never even fulfilled your duty as a mother. What right do you have to demand anything from me?"

Victoria's crimson-nailed fingers clenched into fists.

"We took you back into the Jackson family at sixteen. Did we ever deprive you of food or clothes? Did you lack anything Isabella had?"

Evelyn studied Victoria's twisted expression and found it almost laughable.

"Are you done?"

She turned to leave, but Victoria seized her wrist.

"When are you filing for divorce?"

Evelyn's gaze flicked to Isabella's suddenly pale face. A soft chuckle escaped her.

"In such a hurry to take my place?"

Isabella's lips trembled.

"Ethan doesn't love you..."

"Did he tell you that himself?"

"Everyone can see it!"

Evelyn nodded, her eyes filled with pity.

"So not only are you a scheming little snake, but you're also blind."

Victoria's shriek drew stares from passersby.

"Divorce him now, or you'll regret it!"

Evelyn leisurely extracted her wrist from Victoria's grip.

"Who was it that publicly disowned me at the press conference? What gives you the right to order me around now?"

Victoria shook with rage.

"Pay back every cent the Jacksons spent on you!"

Evelyn's expression turned glacial.

"Fine. Let Isabella vomit up my bone marrow first."

Victoria staggered back a step, and Isabella hurried to steady her.

"Mom, she's just confused right now..."

"She's an ungrateful wretch!" Victoria spat through gritted teeth. Then she turned to Isabella. "Your father wants to invite Ethan to dinner. You'll go personally."

Isabella nodded obediently, a glimmer of triumph flashing in her eyes.

###Chapter 174

Isabella's fingers trembled slightly as she whispered, "Okay."

On the way home with Victoria, her mind wandered. Only when she stood at the foot of the Sullivan Group building did she take a deep breath, steady herself, and step into the elevator.

"Ethan." She forced a sweet smile, but it froze when she met his icy gaze.

"What do you want?"

"Dad would like to invite you to dinner to thank you for including Jackson Corp in the Eastside Project." She hesitated, then added, "Just our family."

Ethan didn’t look up from his files. "Will Evelyn be there?"

Isabella's smile shattered. Her grip tightened on her purse strap, nails digging into her palms.

"You... want her to come?"

"She's my wife." His sharp gaze finally lifted, cutting through her like a blade. "Shouldn't your father invite her too?"

Tears burned behind her eyes. "I'll ask Dad to let her know."

Outside, the sunlight stung. She wanted to storm back in and scream at him—why give her hope just to crush it?

But she didn’t dare.

At home, Victoria rushed to meet her. "Well? Did he agree?"

"Yes." Isabella bit her lip. "But... Ethan wants Evelyn there."

Victoria's face darkened. "Why would we invite her?"

"Mom..." Her voice wavered. "Maybe we should call her?"

"Absolutely not!" Victoria snapped. "That ungrateful girl doesn’t care about this family!"

William sat silently on the couch.

Isabella picked up her phone and dialed the long-unused number. It rang endlessly before connecting.

"What do you want?" Evelyn's voice was glacial.

Isabella relayed the invitation. A cold laugh echoed through the line.

"Not interested."

"But—"

The call ended abruptly. Tears spilled down Isabella's cheeks.

"She... hung up on me."

Victoria pulled her into a hug. "Forget her! Good riddance!"

Meanwhile, in the MY Fashion Group office...

Evelyn had just set down her phone when Vanessa called.

"Boss, I got the dresses."

"Leave them at reception."

She rubbed her temples. Ten minutes later, Bianca delivered the package.

Evelyn unwrapped it, spreading both garments on her desk. Her fingers traced the fabric, her expression hardening with every inch.

"Sophia, come here."

When Sophia saw the nearly identical designs, she trembled with rage.

"Glorious has no shame! This is blatant plagiarism!"

Evelyn shook her head. "They released theirs two months before us."

"But Yvonne has the original sketches—"

"If Glorious wasn’t confident, they wouldn’t publicly accuse us." Evelyn’s voice was eerily calm. "Until we have proof, we don’t take sides."

Sophia gnawed her lip. "So we just let this go?"

Evelyn stared out the window, her eyes shadowed.

"Of course not."

###Chapter 175

"Yvonne's designs are completely original! I watched her revise them three times myself!" Sophia Reynolds slammed her palm on the table in agitation.

Evelyn Sullivan massaged her temples and turned the laptop screen toward her. "See for yourself. The similarity exceeds 90%."

Sophia stared at the screen, her fingers tightening unconsciously.

"I refuse to believe she'd plagiarize..."

"If it's not plagiarism, then it's a leak." Evelyn shut the laptop. "Glorious started small-scale production of this design three months ago, waiting for today."

Sophia's face turned ashen, her lips trembling slightly.

"I'm going to confront her right now!"

"Stop." Evelyn's voice turned icy. "Alerting them now will only make things worse."

——

At the penthouse of Brocade Tower, Jason Zade swirled his wine glass with a satisfied smile. "Director Young, this move was brilliant."

Mason Young took a sip, his eyes glinting shrewdly. "The shares you promised me, Mr. Zade..."

"Don't worry. The contract will be in your hands the day MY Fashion Group goes under."

An assistant hurried in. "Director Young, the trending topic is live."

Mason nodded approvingly. "Keep pushing. I want MY to have no chance of recovery."

——

Evelyn's fingers flew across the keyboard.

The screen displayed: Mason Young, Creative Director of Glorious, Yvonne Young's uncle.

A cold smirk curved her lips as she dialed a private investigator. "Dig deeper. I want records of all their financial transactions."

——

As dusk fell, Evelyn approached her doorstep to the sound of a heated argument.

"Mr. Laurier, I said no means no!" Zoe Zade's cheeks flushed crimson with anger.

Lucas Laurier leaned against his sports car, grinning lazily. "I'll double the penalty fee."

"You—"

"Zoe." Evelyn interrupted. "What's going on?"

Zoe immediately linked arms with her. "Evelyn, this guy won't take no for an answer about some ad..."

Lucas straightened, his smile turning more earnest. "Evelyn, do me a favor?"

She gave him a cool glance. "Since when does Laurier Group lack spokesmodels?"

"We lack someone exactly like Miss Zade." His gaze burned into Zoe. "Name your price."

Zoe rolled her eyes and tugged Evelyn inside. "Not worth my time!"

Lucas called after them, "I'll be back tomorrow."

The door slammed shut. Zoe collapsed onto the sofa, fuming. "Why won't he take a hint?"

Evelyn gazed thoughtfully at the darkening sky outside.

###Chapter 176

"You haven't even heard what I need help with yet, sis-in-law."

Evelyn Sullivan pressed her lips together, her expression distant. "Mr. Laurier, I don't think there's anything left between us that requires assistance."

After the divorce, she had no intention of staying entangled with Ethan Sullivan's circle.

The moment they stepped into the villa, Zoe Zade rolled her eyes.

"That Lucas Laurier is like a persistent ghost! He ambushed me three times today, insisting I endorse his new product. If not for his status, I would've called the police!"

Evelyn couldn't help but laugh.

Lucas was notorious in high society for being a heartthrob. If he knew how much Zoe despised him, he'd probably choke on his own pride.

"The endorsement fee must be decent. Consider it a side gig."

Zoe gave her a strange look. "Do you know what he's selling?"

"Hmm?"

"Condoms."

Evelyn nearly choked on her water. "Is he insane?"

"If I weren't worried about future retaliation, I'd suggest he check himself into a psychiatric ward."

Dinner was prepared by Zoe, who had inherited her mother's culinary skills. In comparison, Evelyn's cooking was barely edible.

After the meal, Evelyn sprawled on the couch, too lazy to move.

Zoe tugged at her. "Don't lie down right after eating. Let's take a walk."

The night was pleasant. By the time they returned from their stroll through the villa grounds, Lucas' car was gone.

As Evelyn settled in to check her emails after her shower, her phone buzzed.

[Picking you up tomorrow morning.]

She frowned. There shouldn't be any reason for her and Ethan to meet anytime soon. She chose to ignore it.

In VIP Room 8888, the clatter of mahjong tiles filled the air.

Ethan and Lucas were visibly distracted.

"I'm done." Ryan Paisley pushed the tiles away. "What's wrong with you two tonight?"

Ethan picked up his phone and stood. "Going for a smoke."

Ryan smirked. "Waiting for Isabella's reply?"

"No."

At the end of the hallway, Ethan stared at the unanswered message on his screen, an inexplicable tightness in his chest.

It suddenly struck him how empty the villa had felt since she moved out.

"Something wrong?"

The familiar voice on the other end made him realize he'd dialed her number.

"You saw my message?"

"I did."

"Why didn't you reply?"

"I thought you sent it to the wrong person."

###Chapter 177

Evelyn Sullivan stared at her phone screen, fingers hovering over the keyboard. She deleted the drafted message and typed again: "Work has been hectic lately. I'll visit Grandma another day."

Ethan Sullivan's reply popped up instantly: "Who said anything about visiting Grandma?"

She frowned, fingers flying across the screen: "Then why are you contacting me?"

"Didn't Isabella tell you?" His message carried obvious irritation.

Only then did Evelyn recall the family dinner invitation from William. She smirked and replied: "Enjoy your family gathering. I wouldn't want to ruin the mood."

Her phone vibrated—Ethan was calling.

"Evelyn Sullivan, what's your last name?" His voice was icy.

"Mr. Sullivan, I'm busy—"

"Six p.m. tomorrow. I'll pick you up at the office." He cut her off decisively before hanging up.

Evelyn stared at the darkened screen, chest rising and falling rapidly. She texted another refusal, but received no response.

The next morning at MY Fashion Group.

Sophia Reynolds entered the CEO's office to find Evelyn standing by the floor-to-ceiling window. Sunlight gilded her silhouette but couldn't dispel the chill surrounding her.

"Look at this." Evelyn slid a file across the desk.

Sophia flipped through the pages, her expression shifting dramatically. "Yvonne Young is the niece of Glorious' creative director?!"

"Glorious received the designs before Yvonne even uploaded them to our system." Evelyn tapped the desk. "Coincidence?"

"I'll confront her immediately!" Sophia trembled with anger.

Evelyn stopped her. "Don't alert them yet."

She picked up her phone and messaged a black avatar contact. An instant "OK" appeared in response.

"This goes deeper than it seems." Evelyn narrowed her eyes. "Glorious is just a front."

Sophia looked confused. "What do you mean?"

"Wait and see." A smirk played on Evelyn's lips. "Someone's handing us free publicity."

At closing time, Quincy Howard rushed in. "Ms. Sullivan, reporters are swarming the building!"

Evelyn walked to the window. Camera crews clustered at the entrance, flashes popping like fireworks.

"Call security." Her gaze drifted to a distant black sedan where a shadowy figure watched through binoculars.

###Chapter 178

Quincy froze, clearly unprepared for Evelyn's unyielding stance.

"I'll handle it right away."

"Wait."

Evelyn stopped him, a cold smirk playing on her lips.

"If the police prove useless, hire a team of bodyguards instead."

"Understood."

When Ethan's Maybach pulled up in front of the MY building, chaos greeted him—bodyguards shoving reporters aside.

"What's going on?"

"MY's designer is accused of plagiarizing Glorious. The media is here to ambush Anna."

Ethan's gaze darkened.

Anna?

The elusive founder of MY?

He suddenly recalled Evelyn's employment date—it aligned perfectly with Anna's return to MY.

The coincidence was too glaring.

"Mr. Sullivan, Ms. Sullivan is coming out!"

Ethan turned to see Evelyn striding toward the curb, hailing a cab.

"Bring her here."

Colin hurried after Evelyn just as she was about to enter the taxi.

"Ms. Sullivan, Mr. Sullivan is waiting for you."

"Colin, we're divorced."

She yanked the car door open without hesitation.

"Tell him I don't have time for dinner."

Colin paled.

"If you refuse, I'll be in trouble."

Evelyn chuckled.

"Relax. He'd replace his wife before he replaces his secretary."

The taxi sped away.

The atmosphere inside the Maybach turned glacial.

"Back to the office."

Ethan's voice was icy.

In the private dining room of the Jackson residence, Isabella swayed gracefully in a lavender chiffon gown, the cinched waist accentuating her slender figure.

The skirt fluttered with her movements like a budding water lily.

Victoria surveyed her daughter with satisfaction.

This was the refined heiress she had meticulously raised—every gesture exuded elegance.

###Chapter 179

Evelyn Sullivan had only spent a few years with the Jackson family, barely shedding her provincial air. Every time Victoria Farley thought of her adopted daughter, disgust welled up in her heart.

If Evelyn had obediently served the family’s interests, Victoria might have spared her a few kind words. Now? She wished Evelyn would disappear forever.

William Jackson checked his watch for the third time, his frown deepening. Ethan Sullivan was half an hour late with no sign of arrival.

"Isabella, call Mr. Sullivan," William said impatiently.

Isabella Jackson dialed three times, her expression darkening. "Dad, Ethan isn’t answering..."

William immediately called Colin Keller. When the call ended, his face was stormy.

Victoria and Isabella exchanged confused glances.

"The Sullivan Group canceled the deal!" William slammed his phone on the table, barely containing his rage.

"What?!" Victoria shrieked. "Why would they cancel so suddenly?"

William gritted his teeth. "Colin said unless Evelyn personally goes to negotiate with Ethan." His eyes flashed with fury. "That ungrateful wretch must be behind this!"

"That jinx!" Victoria trembled with anger. "Ever since she came back, this family has known no peace!"

William dialed Evelyn’s number and roared into the phone, "Evelyn! What did you do to Ethan?!"

On the other end, Evelyn coldly hung up. Subsequent calls went unanswered.

"Find her! Track her down now!" William barked at his secretary.

At the villa, Evelyn had just finished dinner with Zoe Zade when the doorbell rang abruptly.

The security feed showed William and Victoria, faces twisted with anger. A flicker of irritation crossed Evelyn’s eyes.

The moment the door opened, William swung a slap at her. Evelyn dodged smoothly, her gaze icy. "Leave, or I’ll call the police."

"Call the police?" William laughed bitterly. "Evelyn, are you determined to ruin this family? First, you refused to help, and now you sabotaged our deal. What do you want?!"

Victoria cut in shrilly, "If it’s shares you’re after, using such despicable methods only makes us loathe you more!"

Evelyn studied them as if they were strangers. "Isn’t Isabella so capable? Let her beg Ethan again."

"Why should Isabella clean up your mess?" Victoria snapped. "Apologize to Mr. Sullivan immediately!"

Evelyn suddenly smiled.

"What are you laughing at?!"

"At how ridiculous you are." Her voice was calm. "I’ve done nothing wrong. Why should I apologize?"

Victoria raised her hand to strike, but a slender hand caught her wrist.

Zoe shoved Victoria back. "What kind of rabid dog barks at someone’s doorstep?"

Victoria staggered, shaking with rage. "Evelyn! What lowlife friends have you brought into this house?"

"Shut up!" Evelyn’s gaze sharpened like a blade. "You have no right to judge my friends."

###Chapter 180

Victoria Farley's chest heaved with rage, her nails digging deep into her palms.

"Look at what you've become! Corrupted by these lowlifes!"

Evelyn Sullivan leaned against the doorframe, her gaze icy.

"What I become is none of your concern."

Victoria sneered, the wrinkles at her eyes twisting with malice.

"If you hadn't caused Sullivan Group to withdraw their investment, do you think we'd bother coming here?!"

Evelyn pulled out her phone and dialed Ethan Sullivan's number.

The moment the call connected, his deep voice came through. "Evelyn?"

"Impressive move, Mr. Sullivan." Evelyn's lips curled in mockery. "Cutting ties with Jackson Corporation just to force me to see you?"

Three seconds of silence.

"Where are you? I'll come now."

"Don't bother." Her words were sharp and deliberate. "Stop using my family to harass me. We're done."

She hung up and turned to Victoria and William, who stood stunned.

Victoria's face paled, her trembling finger pointing accusingly.

"Have you lost your mind?! How dare you speak to Mr. Sullivan like that! Apologize now!"

Evelyn scoffed and slammed the door shut.

The loud bang made Victoria stagger back, nearly falling.

"You ungrateful brat!" Victoria shrieked, pounding on the door.

William stood silently, his mind drifting to the gentle woman from twenty years ago.

When had she become this shrill, calculating shrew?

Perhaps when he first glimpsed the scheming beneath her sweet facade.

Exhausted from yelling, Victoria turned and caught William's conflicted expression. "What are you staring at?"

Before he could answer, the roar of an engine approached.

A black Maybach rolled to a stop. Isabella Jackson fluttered toward it like a butterfly.

"Ethan!"

He strode past her without a glance, stopping at the villa's entrance.

"Evelyn, open the door."

Her cold voice sliced through the wood. "Get lost."

Isabella bit her lip, her nails sinking into her flesh.

###Chapter 181

Evelyn Sullivan and Zoe Zade lounged on the sofa in the villa's living room, cracking sunflower seeds between their fingers.

A melodramatic soap opera played on the TV. Suddenly, Zoe tossed the remote onto the coffee table with a clatter.

"That ex-husband of yours has impeccable timing. Showing up right after your parents made a scene—what a performance of devotion."

She rolled her eyes and grabbed another handful of seeds.

Evelyn's fingers stilled. The shells pattered into the dish like dry rain.

"I'm going to shower."

As she stood, the doorbell rang.

Ethan Sullivan stood on the doorstep, his expression storm-dark.

"William came here?"

Colin Keller shrank back half a step.

"Mr. Sullivan, I delivered your message exactly as instructed—"

Ethan turned toward William Jackson, each step heavy with menace.

"I made myself perfectly clear yesterday."

His voice could have frozen hell.

"If you invite me to dinner, my wife comes with me."

Beads of sweat formed on William's forehead. He retreated instinctively.

"Mr. Sullivan, we called—"

"So you thought that gave you the right to harass her?"

Ethan's sudden shout sent sparrows scattering from the trees.

William's face drained of color. His lips trembled.

"Those projects—"

"Were approved solely out of respect for my wife."

The words landed like a slap across the Jacksons' faces.

Isabella Jackson jerked her head up, nails biting into her palms.

Victoria Farley seized her daughter's wrist.

"You lied to me?!"

Her voice rose to a shrill, unrecognizable pitch.

Ethan watched the spectacle with icy detachment.

"One month."

He yanked the car door open, his tone lethal.

"If my wife doesn't forgive you, those projects terminate immediately."

The black sedan roared away, leaving three figures stranded in the night wind.

Victoria wrenched free of Isabella's grip, eyes blazing.

"I paid ten million! For nothing but your lies?!"

Isabella bit down hard on her lip. The metallic tang of blood filled her mouth.

###Chapter 182

"Mom, it's not what you think..."

Victoria Farley shook off Isabella Jackson's reaching hand and slipped into the car without looking back.

William Jackson glared at his daughter. "You ruin everything! If this deal falls through, you'll pay for it!"

The black Mercedes sped away, leaving Isabella standing alone. Her fists clenched so tightly her nails dug into her palms.

Back at the Jackson mansion, Victoria sat silent in the backseat. The scenery blurred past the window, but her heart sank like a stone.

William suddenly sneered. "Aren't you the one who's always fawning over Ethan Sullivan? Can't even control your own daughter now?"

"What do you mean?" Victoria whipped her head around.

"Exactly what I said." His eyes darkened. "If we lose this project, we're getting divorced."

Victoria froze as if struck by lightning, her face draining of color.

"William! I've given you twenty years and two children! This is how you repay me?"

"Children?" His lips curled mockingly. "What else have you done besides playing mahjong and shopping?"

The car fell dead silent. Victoria trembled, her nails leaving scratches on the leather seats.

It hit her then—the man she'd shared a bed with for two decades was no longer the doting husband from years ago.

When the Mercedes stopped at the Jackson estate, Victoria stumbled out. She missed the disgust flashing in William's eyes—like she was outdated furniture.

Isabella returned to find her mother weeping alone.

"Mom, it's all my fault..." She threw herself at Victoria's knees. "I thought Ethan only..."

Victoria lifted tear-filled eyes to meet her daughter's guilty gaze. Her trembling fingers brushed Isabella's cheek.

This was the precious girl she'd cradled since infancy.

"Not your fault," Victoria whispered. "Blame that homewrecker..."

Isabella nestled into her mother's arms, the ghost of a smirk playing on her lips.

###Chapter 183

Victoria's nails dug deep into her palms as tears welled in her eyes. "Isabella, your father said...he'll divorce me if I don't apologize to Evelyn."

Isabella's pupils constricted violently. The teacup in her hand nearly slipped. "What?!"

"After all these years of sacrifice for this family, he actually..." Victoria's voice broke with sobs.

"Don't worry, Mom." Isabella grasped her mother's trembling hands, shadows flickering in her eyes. "I'll handle this."

Victoria jerked her head up, defiance burning in her gaze. "I'll never bow to that bitch!"

"If it comes to that..." Isabella soothed softly, her fist clenching unseen behind her back.

Back in her room, Isabella swept all the bottles and jars off her vanity. The realization that Ethan would reject her pleas yet make exceptions for Evelyn cut like a knife.

She stared at her phone screen, lips curling into a cold smile.

"Ethan, remember those three wishes you owe me?"

Silence stretched for several seconds before his response came. "I remember."

"For my first wish..." Her crimson lips parted, each word dripping venom. "I want you to break up with Evelyn immediately."

Ethan's breath hitched audibly.

"Fine." The single word sounded wrenched from between gritted teeth.

Hanging up, Isabella studied her twisted reflection in the mirror. This game was hers to win.

......

Dawn light filtered through the curtains as Evelyn's phone screen illuminated.

She opened the file sent by the black-profile contact, fingers flying across the screen. A cold laugh escaped her when "Brocade" appeared in the text.

The ping of a bank transfer coincided with Zoe's voice calling from downstairs. "Evelyn, come quick!"

Tucking away her phone, Evelyn padded barefoot across the cold floorboards. Outside the window, an unexpected figure stood in the courtyard.

###Chapter 184

"Evelyn, look!" Sophia Reynolds yanked open the curtains and pointed toward the villa's entrance. "Isn't that Ethan Sullivan's secretary?"

Evelyn Sullivan walked to the window. In the morning light, Colin Keller stood out clearly, pacing back and forth with an exquisite food box in hand.

"He's been there for almost two hours," Sophia whispered. "Should we call the police?"

Evelyn smirked and headed downstairs. When she pushed open the front door, Colin immediately approached her.

"Miss Sullivan, Mr. Sullivan sent this especially for you." He handed her the box, its surface embossed with the gilded logo of "Rong's Kitchen."

Evelyn stared at the familiar emblem. Three years ago, she had waited in line for three hours just to buy their crab roe buns.

"Take it back," she said coldly. "Tell Ethan to stop wasting his time on meaningless gestures."

Colin hesitated. "But—"

"What?" Evelyn arched a brow. "Do I need to go to Sullivan Group myself?"

Before Colin could respond, a white BMW screeched to a halt by the curb. The door swung open, and Victoria Farley stormed over in her stilettos.

"Evelyn!" She grabbed Evelyn's wrist. "I came to apologize!"

Evelyn shook her off, her gaze flickering to Isabella Jackson hiding by the car. What game were these two playing now?

"Mrs. Farley, we have no ties left," she said, turning to leave.

Victoria blocked her path. "How can you be so heartless? I'm your mother!"

Evelyn laughed. "Wasn't it you who publicly disowned me at that press conference?"

Victoria's face turned ashen. Isabella rushed forward, linking arms with her. "Sis, Mom really means it this time..."

"Save it." Evelyn pulled open her car door and addressed Colin. "I'll be at Sullivan Group by noon."

The engine roared to life, drowning out Victoria's curses. Colin stood awkwardly as Isabella gave him a pitiful look.

"Colin, about Ethan—"

"Miss Jackson," he took a step back, "I'm not at liberty to discuss the CEO's affairs."

Back in the car, Victoria trembled with rage.

"That ungrateful wretch!" She slammed her fist against the seat. "I should've—"

"Mom!" Isabella cut her off. "What's the point of saying that now?"

Victoria suddenly seized her daughter's hand. "Isabella, Ethan clearly likes you. Why is he helping that bitch?"

Isabella turned away, her nails digging into her palms.

The midday sun scorched the Sullivan Group building. Evelyn stood in the elevator, watching the numbers climb. It was time to end this farce.

###Chapter 185

Evelyn Sullivan stepped through the revolving doors of Sullivan Tower, her heels clicking against the marble floor.

The receptionist blocked her path.

"Miss Sullivan, Mr. Sullivan has given strict orders not to receive any visitors today."

Evelyn narrowed her eyes, fingers flying across her phone screen. Five unanswered calls to Ethan Sullivan.

A cold smile curved her lips as she dialed Colin Keller instead.

Still no answer.

Her grip tightened around the burning phone as she typed a message: "How impressive, Mr. Sullivan. Cutting me off completely now?"

She turned to leave—only to collide with Ryan Paisley in his tailored suit.

"Miss Sullivan?" Surprise flickered in his eyes. "Here to see Ethan?"

Her expression instantly brightened, a sly tilt to her gaze. "Perfect timing, Ryan. Mind taking me upstairs?"

His Adam's apple bobbed. "You two..."

"Just a silly misunderstanding." She sighed dramatically. "He's throwing a tantrum."

Ryan's eyes darkened. Reason screamed at him to refuse, but that hopeful look undid him. "Fine."

When the receptionist protested, Ryan silenced her with a glance. "She's with me. Any issues, take it up with me."

The elevator ascended to the penthouse.

The office door swung open—Ethan's pen snapped in half.

"Ryan. Out."

Ryan shielded Evelyn. "I insisted on bringing her—"

"Get out!"

Evelyn gently tugged Ryan's sleeve. "You should go."

The moment the door closed, her smile vanished. She strode to Ethan's desk and sat.

"Using Ryan now?" Ethan's voice was glacial. "You've grown bold."

She met his icy stare. "When you refuse to see me, I find other ways."

"Stay away from him." He seized her wrist. "Or else—"

"Or else what?" She wrenched free, eyes blazing. "Ethan Sullivan, who gave you the right to control me?"

###Chapter 186

Evelyn Sullivan was utterly baffled. When had she ever provoked Ryan Paisley? She'd merely run into him by chance and asked for directions.

"I came here today to tell you—stop bothering me!" Her voice was icy.

"Are you hungry?"

Ethan Sullivan abruptly changed the subject. Evelyn frowned. "Are you even listening to me?"

"Let's eat first. I haven't had lunch yet."

She took a deep breath, forcing down her anger. "Ethan Sullivan, we're over!"

"Impossible." He set down the documents in his hand and met her gaze. "I don't agree."

Dark currents swirled in his deep eyes. Evelyn instinctively took half a step back.

"Since when do you get a say? You signed the divorce papers faster than anyone!"

"Because..." He stood and closed the distance between them. "I'm courting you again."

Evelyn let out a disbelieving laugh. "Since when did Mr. Sullivan learn to joke?"

"I'm serious."

"Enough!"

She shoved him away. "You've always loved Isabella Jackson. Stop pretending to care now! You're just not used to me ignoring you!"

She turned to leave, but a strong hand yanked her back.

"Let go!"

Ethan effortlessly pinned her to the sofa. "You're not leaving until after lunch."

"Looking at you makes me sick!"

"What a coincidence." His low chuckle sent shivers down her spine. "Looking at you gives me an appetite."

Evelyn trembled with rage. This bastard!

"Eat or not?" He leisurely undid his cufflinks. "If you refuse, you'll stay here and keep me company while I work."

Knowing he meant it, she gritted her teeth and picked up the bowl. She finished the meal in three bites.

"Can I leave now?"

Ethan glanced at the half-eaten rice still in her bowl and arched a brow. "I'm not done yet."

Her nails dug into her palms. Out of the corner of her eye, she watched him calmly eating from the dishes she'd touched. A sharp pang shot through her chest.

In the past, he'd sanitized serving chopsticks three times before using them.

###Chapter 187

Evelyn Sullivan had always assumed Ethan Sullivan suffered from severe mysophobia.

That was until the family dinner where she witnessed Old Mrs. Sullivan feeding him with chopsticks still glistening with her saliva.

He ate without flinching.

Meanwhile, the shrimp she'd meticulously picked for him grew cold in his bowl before being dumped into the trash.

Twenty minutes passed before Ethan finished dabbing his mouth with a napkin.

"Can you let go now?" Evelyn shook her numb wrist.

This time, he released her without hesitation.

As the elevator doors closed, she exhaled in relief. She needed to shake off this persistent man—fast.

"Are you alright, Evelyn?" Ryan Paisley approached, his suit sleeves stained with fresh coffee.

Warmth flickered in her chest. "I owe you a dry-cleaning bill. Let me treat you to dinner sometime."

"Then I'm picking the most expensive restaurant." He flashed a grin, his canine teeth peeking through.

Among Ethan's inner circle, Ryan was the only one who never looked down on her. The others maintained polite facades while secretly blaming her for breaking up their golden couple.

"Ryan." Ethan's voice cut through the air like ice. "Finished reviewing the contract?"

The hallway temperature plummeted.

Without turning, Evelyn strode toward the elevator. "Don't let me keep you, Ryan. We'll talk later."

The polished doors reflected Ethan's stormy expression. His knuckles whitened as he watched her retreating figure.

"You two seem close." Ethan's gaze frosted over when he turned.

Ryan straightened his files. "We exchanged pleasantries during my hospital visits."

"Stay away from her."

"But you're already—"

"Our affairs don't concern outsiders." Ethan's jaw tightened in the glass reflection.

In the taxi, Evelyn scrolled through her photos. The latest showed Ethan cornering her in the garage that morning. She needed a fake boyfriend to sever his delusions.

"You're dating?!" Sophia Reynolds sprayed奶茶 across her spreadsheets.

Evelyn handed her a tissue. "Just need someone to play the role."

"So Ethan's really stalking you?" Sophia's eyes gleamed. "I knew that look he gave you meant something!"

"Focus. I need reliable male candidates."

Sophia nibbled her straw. "I know a few, but..." She lowered her voice. "Are you sure this isn't jealousy? After that charity gala where Ethan and Isabella—"

"Stop." Evelyn massaged her throbbing temples. "This is purely strategic."

"Fine." Sophia leaned in conspiratorially. "But before you find a boyfriend, there's something you should know..."

###Chapter 188

"The plagiarism scandal is blowing up!" Sophia Reynolds burst into the room, her face pale. "MY's new collection sales are plummeting. This morning, some extreme customers vandalized our store with paint. I had to close it temporarily."

Evelyn Sullivan tapped her fingers lightly on the desk, her gaze calm as still water. "Stabilize the stores first. I'll handle this."

"There's more." Sophia handed her a file. "Yvonne Young submitted her resignation this morning."

"Expected." A faint smile touched Evelyn's lips. "The pawn has served its purpose. Of course, it's time to retreat."

Sophia stomped her foot in frustration. "When are we exposing her? If we wait any longer, MY won't survive!"

"Approve her resignation." Evelyn closed the file. "Complete the paperwork today."

"Are you insane?" Sophia's eyes widened. "This is letting the tiger return to the mountains!"

"She won't leave." Evelyn stood, sunlight casting a long shadow behind her. "This show has only just begun."

Seeing Evelyn's confidence, Sophia's tense shoulders finally relaxed. "Fine. I'll get it done."

The resignation process went suspiciously smoothly. Standing outside the MY building with a cardboard box in her arms, Yvonne felt something was off. But the thought of her new position as chief designer at Brocade quickly pushed her doubts aside.

"Uncle, I quit!" That night, Yvonne excitedly called Mason Young.

His voice was low on the other end. "Report to Brocade tomorrow. Remember—use your new pen name."

After hanging up, Yvonne rolled around on her bed in excitement. She didn’t notice the flash of a camera shutter outside her window.

Meanwhile, the glow of Evelyn’s computer screen cast an eerie blue light. Her fingers brushed over a design file, pausing at the signature—Bianca Quinn.

The next morning, Evelyn stood before a rundown apartment building. The peeling paint on the door of Unit 301 barely held the numbers in place.

The girl who answered eyed her warily. "Who are you?"

"Someone who can help you reclaim what’s yours." Evelyn pulled a design sketch from her bag. "This 'Starlight' series—the real creator is you, isn’t it?"

Bianca’s pupils contracted. Her fingers whitened around the doorknob.

Two hours later, an explosive headline dominated the trending list: #Glorious Fashion Accused of Plagiarism#. The accompanying image showed two nearly identical design drafts, dated six months apart.

Public opinion flipped overnight. Glorious, once hailed as an originality pioneer, became the target of widespread condemnation. Even more shocking—netizens uncovered the true identity of Glorious’ new designer: Yvonne Young, the very person embroiled in MY’s plagiarism scandal.

Inside Brocade’s headquarters, Yvonne stared at her computer screen, sweat soaking through her shirt. Her trembling fingers dialed Mason’s number, only to be met with a cold dial tone.

Evelyn stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows of MY’s executive office when her phone lit up with a message from Sophia: "Glorious just released a statement."

###Chapter 189

The official statement from Glorious sent the comment section into chaos.

"LOL, this press release sounds so convincing."

"Plagiarizing scum pretending to be innocent?"

"Waiting for the truth to come out."

Within five minutes, the whistleblower dropped a digital design draft. The timestamp in the bottom corner clearly showed it was created a year ago—while Glorious' new collection had only launched three months prior.

The irony? When Glorious had accused MY of plagiarism, their "evidence" only predated MY's design by a week.

Public opinion flipped instantly.

"Joke of the year: The plagiarist cries plagiarism."

"Glorious and MY should form a Plagiarists' Alliance."

"Don't drag MY into this. At least they never played the victim."

"Glorious' move is downright disgusting."

Mason Young stared at his phone, his face dark with fury.

"Get Weibo to take down the trending topic—now!"

His fingers trembled as he dialed Yvonne's number.

"What the hell happened with those designs?!"

Yvonne's panicked voice crackled through the line. "Uncle, I'll handle it—"

"Useless!" Mason kicked over his office chair. "Tell PR to issue another statement. Say we were victims too!"

Jason Zade's call came at the perfect moment.

"Mason, you'd better explain this."

"Don't worry, Jason. Brocade won't be implicated—"

By the time he hung up, his back was drenched in sweat. If their shady dealings came to light, he was finished.

Meanwhile, at MY's design department...

Sophia Reynolds burst into the CEO's office, phone in hand.

"Evelyn! Glorious just got exposed for plagiarism!"

Evelyn Sullivan didn't look up from her documents. "Hmm."

"Aren't you surprised?"

"Expected." A faint smile curved Evelyn's lips. "The show's just beginning."

Sophia's eyes widened. "You orchestrated this?"

Evelyn simply smiled.

Elsewhere, Yvonne cornered Bianca Quinn in a café.

SLAP!

The sound echoed through the private room.

"Bianca, you're dead!"

Yvonne's nails dug into her palms, snapping two of her manicured acrylics.

###Chapter 190

Bianca Quinn pushed the bank card across the table with an impassive expression. "The matter with the design drafts ends here."

Yvonne Young slammed her hands on the table and stood abruptly. "Have you lost your mind?! You agreed to this when we signed the contract!"

"That was because you deceived me." Bianca's voice remained calm. "You used my mother's illness to threaten me."

Yvonne scoffed, her crimson nails tapping against the card. "Two hundred thousand? How many design drafts did you have to sell to scrape this together?"

Bianca rose to her feet, her black trench coat sweeping behind her in a sharp arc.

"The money is yours. The termination notice has been sent to your email."

Yvonne suddenly grabbed her wrist. "Wait! My cousin is your mother's attending physician. Do you really think I won't have him halt all treatment tomorrow?"

Bianca wrenched her hand free, her gaze icy.

"Don't bother. We've already transferred hospitals."

Stepping out of the café, Bianca took a deep breath. The early spring wind carried a chill, but it was still warmer than Yvonne's fake smile.

In the VIP ward of First Hospital, Bianca's mother, Mrs. Quinn, was frantically packing her belongings.

"Mom!" Bianca rushed to stop her. "What are you doing?"

"Do you know how much this room costs per day?" Mrs. Quinn fretted, wringing her hands. "I can stay in a regular ward. Go cancel this right now!"

Bianca pulled out a contract from her bag.

"It's an advance from the company—a formal loan agreement. Look, they'll deduct five thousand from my salary each month."

Mrs. Quinn flipped through the contract skeptically before lowering her voice. "Your boss... didn't make any unreasonable demands, did they?"

"It's a female boss." Bianca couldn't help but smile. "I start work tomorrow. I've arranged for a caregiver to look after you."

"No caregiver!" Mrs. Quinn waved her hands dismissively. "I'm feeling much better now. I can—"

A violent coughing fit cut her off. Bianca steadied her frail shoulders, realizing just how thin her mother had become beneath the hospital gown—her bones protruding sharply.

"The caregiver is non-negotiable." Bianca's voice tightened. "If you don't cooperate with treatment, I'll quit my job and stay by your side every day."

Mrs. Quinn finally relented with a sigh. As she stroked her daughter's soft hair, she noticed new black strands growing at the tips.

"Bianca... did you dye your hair?"

Bianca hesitated before forcing a smile. "Yes. Just wanted a change."

She didn't tell her mother that those were white hairs from three sleepless months of designing for others. But now, those days of toiling in the shadows were finally over.

Outside the window, magnolia buds peeked through the branches. Bianca tightened her grip on the employee badge in her pocket—finally bearing her own name.

###Chapter 191

Bianca pressed a peeled apple into her mother's hands. "Mom, don't worry about the money."

Mrs. Quinn held the apple with a sigh. "This hospital room must cost a fortune..."

"The boss prepaid six months in advance," Bianca cut in. "Just focus on getting better."

Her mother's eyes reddened. "We owe them so much..."

"I know." Bianca squeezed her hand. "We'll repay them soon."

At Brocade's design department, Yvonne stared blankly at her computer screen.

She flipped through design drafts mechanically, but all she saw was the Chief Designer's icy glare.

"Ten designs in one week."

The words echoed in her mind like a curse.

Without Bianca, where would she even find ten designs?

Her phone buzzed. A trending hashtag—#GloriousStatement—caught her eye.

One glance, and her blood ran cold.

Glorious's PR statement was textbook-perfect. The comments were a sea of praise.

"Now THIS is how a top brand handles things!"

"Unlike some Y-brand that went radio silent. The difference is obvious!"

"Glorious just earned a new fan!"

Yvonne's fingers trembled. She knew exactly what this meant.

Sophia burst into Evelyn's office, where she was reviewing documents.

"Evelyn! The internet is on fire!"

Evelyn didn't look up. "I saw."

"That's it?!" Sophia stomped her foot. "Glorious just played a brutal move!"

A fountain pen glided across paper in one smooth stroke.

"Will panicking help?"

Sophia froze.

Evelyn closed the file. When she lifted her gaze, there was steel in her eyes.

"Let them enjoy their moment."

Celebrations erupted in Glorious's design department.

Mason clapped his assistant on the back. "Hot pot's on me tonight!"

Cheers filled the room.

"Boss, you're the best!"

"I want the most expensive wagyu!"

The laughter died when a gasp came from the corner.

"Check Ins! That whistleblower just posted again!"

Every face paled.

###Chapter 192

The computer screens in the PR department suddenly lit up with red alerts.

"Mr. Young! We have a situation!" The assistant's voice trembled.

Mason Young snatched the mouse and clicked on the trending hashtag. His fingers shook uncontrollably as the page loaded.

The account "Hammer of Justice" had posted a damning nine-grid exposé. Four high-definition audio clips, five surveillance videos—each timestamp meticulously aligned.

In the first recording, Mason's voice dripped with persuasion: "Yvonne, the chief designer position at Brocade is yours if you follow my plan."

The second clip featured Jason Zade's grating laughter: "Five million is nothing. Take down MY, and the entire East China market is ours."

The most devastating was the 43-minute private conversation, laying bare their schemes to bribe media and hire internet trolls.

The comments section exploded.

[Best corporate drama of the year! Glorious orchestrated this whole show!]

[How low can Brocade sink? Using such dirty tactics?]

[Everyone who bashed MY—apologize now! We were played!]

Mason's phone vibrated violently. The caller ID—Chairman—drained the color from his face.

"Fix this before trading halts, or hand in your resignation!"

Meanwhile, in Brocade's top-floor conference room...

Jason Zade was mid-presentation on their下半年 plan when his secretary rushed in, whispering urgently. His pen clattered to the floor.

"Meeting adjourned!"

In the CEO's office, Jason slammed his fist on the desk. "Get Weibo to remove that hashtag! At any cost!"

The secretary hesitated. "It's... already topped the trends."

A phone rang like a death knell. The caller ID—"Ethan Sullivan's Secretary"—made Jason's knees buckle.

88th floor, Sullivan Group headquarters.

Jason stood before the总裁办公室 door, his shirt soaked through. His knuckles turned white as he raised a hand to knock.

"Explain." Ethan didn't even look up.

"Mr. Sullivan, this is malicious editing—"

"Shall I have our tech team verify that?"

Jason's legs gave out. He collapsed to his knees. "I was wrong! Please give me another chance!"

Ethan pressed the intercom. "Security."

Ten minutes later, photos of Brocade's former CEO being thrown out of Sullivan Tower trended at #2.

###Chapter 193: Bloodstained Dusk

The setting sun stretched Ethan Sullivan's shadow long across the plaza before the Sullivan Group headquarters. He stood stubbornly before the revolving doors until security emerged for the third time. "Mr. Sullivan left through the underground garage hours ago. Please leave." Only then did the man stagger away, his tailored trousers dust-streaked.

——

In the MY Fashion Group design director's office, Sophia Reynolds nearly spilled her coffee with a startled shriek. She burst into the CEO's office like a whirlwind, embracing Evelyn Sullivan mid-signature. "Oh my god! Bianca Quinn just released a clarification video! How did you pull this off?"

Evelyn's fountain pen paused, leaving an ink blot on the document. She blotted it calmly with a tissue. "Glorious and Brocade's surveillance systems proved... more fragile than they imagined."

"Are we relaunching the Fall Collection tomorrow?"

"Mmm." Evelyn closed the file folder. "The new designer starts tomorrow. She'll take Yvonne Young's workstation directly."

Sophia's eyes widened. "That fast? Don't tell me you'd prepared—"

Evelyn's enigmatic smile caught the gilded sunset through the floor-to-ceiling windows.

——

At precisely six o'clock, the Sullivan matriarch's call arrived.

"Darling, I've pickled your favorite mustard greens," the elderly voice chirped through the receiver. "Bring that rascal Ethan home for dinner."

Evelyn's hand hesitated on the locked drawer. "He's been..."

"Working late again?" The old woman huffed. "Forget him! You must come!"

Descending in the elevator, Evelyn absently scrolled through her contacts when a bloodcurdling scream pierced the twilight.

"Die!"

White-hot pain seared her back as she crashed into a planter. Spinning around, she saw Yvonne lunging with a fruit knife, venom in her crimson-rimmed eyes.

"You ruined my life!" The blade glinted in the fading light.

A dark figure materialized. Ethan's iron grip snapped Yvonne's wrist with an audible crack. The knife clattered to the pavement as security swarmed.

"You schemed together!" Yvonne writhed against her captors. "That bitch Bianca—"

"Call the police." Ethan loosened his tie, then froze. "You're bleeding."

Evelyn glanced at her arm—blood welled from a gash, dripping onto the concrete. Ethan's suit jacket was already pressed against the wound, the fabric darkening crimson.

Sirens wailed in the distance. As officers shoved Yvonne into a squad car, the designer flashed a grotesque smile. "You think this is over?"

###Chapter 194

The moment "police" was mentioned, Yvonne Young's face turned ashen.

"Don't call them! I'm begging you!"

Her entire body trembled, nails digging deep into her palms. A criminal record would ruin her future.

Evelyn Sullivan's lips curled into a cold smile. "You didn't think about consequences when you attacked me with a knife?"

"I wasn't in my right mind!" Yvonne dropped to her knees. "You weren't hurt, were you? Have mercy for my aging parents—"

"Luck saved me, not your mercy."

"Someone put me up to this!" Yvonne suddenly grabbed Evelyn's pant leg. "After I was fired, someone gave me a flash drive with footage of you meeting Bianca Quinn—"

Evelyn shook her off, her gaze icy.

"Assault. Defamation. The court summons are already on their way."

Yvonne burst into hysterical laughter, the sound echoing down the hallway.

"Evelyn Sullivan, you've destroyed me! I'll haunt you from the grave!"

"You brought this on yourself."

Ethan Sullivan stepped forward, shielding Evelyn. "You won't get the chance."

Recognition flashed in Yvonne's eyes as she finally saw who stood before her.

Before she could speak, bodyguards dragged her away.

As Evelyn turned, a streak of crimson caught her eye.

"You're hurt!"

Ethan glanced down. Blood had soaked through his white shirt cuff.

"It's nothing."

"Stay here!"

She took off running, her hair whipping behind her.

Ten minutes later, Evelyn returned breathless, beads of sweat on her nose.

"Lift your arm."

The moment the alcohol swab touched his wound, Ethan's muscles tensed.

"Bear with it."

As she bent her head, a loose strand of hair fell forward. Ethan instinctively reached out—

Slap!

The sharp sound cracked through the hallway.

Evelyn stepped back, fury burning in her eyes.

"Ethan Sullivan, the ink on our divorce papers isn't even dry yet!"

He rubbed his stinging cheek, voice rough. "My apologies. Old habits die hard."

The night wind swept through the corridor, carrying away unspoken words into the moonlight.

###Chapter 195

Evelyn Sullivan remained silent.

Was he blaming her for losing control?

"Don't let it happen again."

She efficiently bandaged his wound, her tone distant. "Thank you for saving me today. I'll treat you to dinner another time."

Ethan Sullivan glanced at his freshly bandaged arm, smirking. "One meal to appease an injured man?"

"What do you want, then?"

"My injury affects my work. You're responsible."

Evelyn considered briefly. "Fine. How much compensation?"

His expression darkened. "You think I need money?"

"Isn't lost income the issue?"

Seeing her serious face, Ethan said coldly, "I don't want money. Move into Grand View and take care of me until I recover."

"Impossible." Her refusal was firm. "I'll hire you the best nurse."

"Evelyn!"

She met his gaze directly. "Mr. Sullivan, we ended long ago. I want us both to move on. Please don't disturb me again."

Her words carried deliberate weight.

Ethan's eyes turned stormy. "Move on?"

"Yes."

Just as she was about to mention her new relationship, her phone rang.

Seeing "Grandma" on the screen, Evelyn remembered her promise to Mrs. Sullivan.

"Grandma, I'm so sorry. I'll be right there," she answered apologetically.

Mrs. Sullivan's voice was warm. "No rush, dear. Be safe."

Hanging up, Evelyn turned to Ethan. "Grandma invited me to Harmony Manor for dinner. Are you coming?"

"Mm."

In the car, Ethan asked casually, "Have you met Anna, MY's founder?"

Evelyn's fingers twitched, but her expression stayed neutral. "I'm just an employee. Why the sudden interest?"

"Impressive how she traced that plagiarism case to Brocade."

"Very impressive." She lowered her eyes.

"Aren't you curious about your boss?"

She looked up. "What are you really asking, Mr. Sullivan?"

"Just making conversation."

"I focus on my work. That's enough."

Ethan's gaze darkened, but he pressed no further.

Silence lingered until Harmony Manor. As they exited the car, Ethan suddenly gripped her hand.

"Let go." She pulled away instantly.

He whispered near her ear, "Want Grandma to find out we're divorced?"

Evelyn scoffed. "We never held hands before. This is what's suspicious."
###Chapter 196

"Grandmother will only think we're deeply in love."

Evelyn Sullivan opened her mouth to protest, but Ethan Sullivan had already grasped her hand firmly, leading her inside.

In the living room, Mrs. Sullivan sat basking in sunlight on her rocking chair. The moment she spotted their intertwined fingers, her eyes brightened, wrinkles smoothing with delight.

"My dear Evelyn! Come, let me see—have you lost weight again?"

"Grandmother, I'm perfectly fine," Evelyn replied sweetly.

Mrs. Sullivan guided her to the sofa, patting her hand affectionately. "If work is too exhausting, just quit. Ethan earns enough to last you lifetimes. Stay home, have tea with me, go shopping—wouldn’t that be lovely?"

Evelyn nearly laughed. Who would’ve thought the once-formidable business matriarch now sounded like any ordinary grandmother urging her to become a lady of leisure?

"Grandmother, I’d go stir-crazy."

"Stubborn child..." Mrs. Sullivan sighed, handing her a teacup. "Try this. Adrian brought it from abroad."

The tea’s floral sweetness danced on Evelyn’s tongue. "This is exquisite!"

"Take it all." Mrs. Sullivan immediately summoned the housekeeper. "Mrs. Li, package the tea leaves for our young madam."

"Oh, Grandmother, that’s unnecessary—"

"Nonsense!" Mrs. Sullivan feigned sternness. "Just bring me those butterfly puffs next time."

Warmth flooded Evelyn’s chest. The humble bakery treats she’d gifted were treasured like jewels.

"I’ll inquire about the tea with Adrian," Ethan interjected.

Evelyn nodded gratefully. She’d been wondering how to contact her elusive cousin.

After dinner, Mrs. Sullivan saw them to the door, reluctance in every crease of her smile. "Visit your old grandmother often, dear!"

"Of course."

In the car, Ethan suddenly leaned close. "I’ve already sent someone about the tea."

Evelyn instinctively retreated. "Thank you."

"Just ‘thank you’?" His eyebrow arched, mischief glinting in his eyes.

"What else do you want?"

"Buy me dinner."

The simplicity startled her. "Alright. After my current project wraps up."

Back at her villa, Zoe Zade materialized behind her, curiosity radiating. "Ethan drove you home?"

"We visited Mrs. Sullivan."

Zoe frowned. "But you’re divorced."

"Keep it quiet for now." Evelyn sighed. "Her health can’t handle shocks."

Zoe hesitated, then simply embraced her. "Don’t push yourself too hard."

###Chapter 197

Zoe nodded thoughtfully. "Alright."

The villa was brightly lit. Evelyn kept Zoe company in the living room, watching a variety show before heading to the bathroom.

The warm water cascaded over her body, clearing her mind. Suddenly, she remembered the flash drive Yvonne had mentioned—the one containing footage of her visit to Bianca.

Scorpion.

The name flashed through her thoughts. No one else would monitor her like this.

Water droplets slid from her hair as she clenched her fists. She had to eliminate this threat before it endangered everyone around her.

Just as she finished blow-drying her hair, Sophia's call came through.

"Evelyn, remember when I said I'd set you up with someone?"

"Yeah. What about it?"

She put the phone on speaker and picked up a comb to detangle her damp locks.

"Now that the plagiarism scandal is over, I'm sending you photos! If none catch your eye, I'll find more!"

Amused by Sophia's enthusiasm, Evelyn chuckled. "This isn't a dating show. Anyone will do to fool Ethan."

"No way!" Sophia protested. "If you pick someone inferior, he'll never believe you'd fall for them."

Evelyn paused. "Why not?"

"You have high standards. You wouldn't settle for just anyone. Don't worry, I'll find you a perfect match!"

She sighed. "Fine, whatever."

"Wait for it—coming right up!"

After hanging up, her phone buzzed repeatedly with notifications. Evelyn opened the messages, scrolling through a gallery of handsome faces, yet none stood out.

[So? These are all the most eligible bachelors in town. Pick one, and I'll make it happen!]

Evelyn replied with a smile: [The first one, then. But will he agree to this charade?]

Sophia responded instantly: [Leave it to me!]

[Thanks.]

[Just treat me to dinner afterward!]

Something about the wording struck Evelyn as odd, but exhaustion overtook her. She set her phone aside and drifted into sleep.

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains. Evelyn checked her phone to find multiple messages from Sophia and a new friend request.

She read Sophia's texts first, then accepted the request from "Sean Reynolds" before getting ready for the day.

At the office, Sophia burst in with her usual energy.

"Lunch? I invited Sean so you two can get acquainted."

Evelyn organized her files. "Sure. I might need to face Ethan soon anyway. He can come along."

Sophia's eyes sparkled. "I'll book a table!"

At noon, they arrived at a French restaurant. By the window, a man in a gray suit stood to greet them.

"Miss Sullivan, I've heard so much about you."

Behind gold-rimmed glasses, his eyes held a warm glint. Sean extended his hand, his wristwatch gleaming subtly under the light.

"Mr. Reynolds."

As the three settled in to order, none noticed the camera lens glinting from a shadowed corner.

###Chapter 198

Lucas Laurier had just stepped into the restaurant when his gaze was drawn to the table by the window.

Evelyn Sullivan was laughing animatedly with a strange man.

He arched a brow. This woman was like a persistent shadow.

"Mr. Laurier?" his secretary whispered.

Lucas withdrew his gaze and turned toward the reserved private dining room.

In the main hall, Sophia Reynolds checked her watch and suddenly stood. "I just remembered there's an unfinished document at the office. You two enjoy your chat."

Evelyn watched Sophia leave before turning to the man across from her. "Mr. Reynolds, I assume Sophia mentioned my request?"

Sean Reynolds took a sip of tea. "The fake boyfriend arrangement?"

"Exactly."

Evelyn studied the impeccably dressed man. The second son of the Reynolds family, a rising star in real estate—hardly the type to agree to such an absurd proposal.

"Our group is planning to enter the fashion industry," Sean set down his cup. "I hear you're an expert in the field."

Evelyn's eyes brightened. "If you need assistance, I'd be happy to help."

"Pleasure doing business." Sean raised his teacup.

Back at the office, Evelyn had barely settled into her chair when Sophia burst in.

"So? Isn't my brother handsome?"

Evelyn twirled a pen between her fingers. "More agreeable than I expected."

"Of course!" Sophia lifted her chin proudly. "By the way, Mason Young and Jason Zade were fired. No one in the industry will hire them now."

Evelyn scoffed. "They brought it on themselves."

"Ethan Sullivan took over Brocade and invested a billion into it." Sophia lowered her voice. "Do you think he's—"

A phone ring cut her off.

"Ms. Sullivan, we need you to come to the station for a statement."

At the police station, after giving her statement, Evelyn requested to see Yvonne Young.

"A flash drive? What flash drive?" Yvonne's eyes darted nervously, her fingers twisting the hem of her shirt. "I don't know what you're talking about."

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. The reaction was suspicious.

Back at the office, she immediately called a shareholders' meeting.

"Let's relaunch the Fall Collection while the momentum is high." She tapped the table. "This time, nothing can go wrong."

###Chapter 199

Sophia Reynolds flipped open the report in her hands, her fingertips lightly tapping the data.

"The new collection exceeded sales expectations within hours of launch this morning."

Evelyn Sullivan took the document, her eyes swiftly scanning the numbers.

"It's not enough. What MY needs most right now is a stable supply chain. Any progress with the fabric suppliers?"

Silence filled the conference room.

Simon Reynolds cleared his throat.

"Ms. Sullivan, with raw material prices skyrocketing, our current budget makes it difficult to secure quality suppliers."

Evelyn lifted her gaze, a faint smile playing on her lips.

"Do you have a solution, Mr. Reynolds?"

"I happen to know a few textile merchants who might be willing to work with us."

"Show me the quotes first."

A flicker of satisfaction crossed Simon's face.

"I'll contact them immediately."

After the meeting, Sophia hurried into Evelyn's office.

"Evelyn, don't trust my uncle. He's pulled this bait-and-switch before—our store ratings plummeted last time."

Evelyn twirled a pen between her fingers.

"I'm aware."

"By the way, that new designer you hired is impressive. She submitted two drafts before lunch."

"She's naturally talented."

Evelyn recalled Bianca Quinn's defiant gaze during the interview. If not for her mother's medical bills, the girl would never have settled for ghostwriting.

Sophia had barely left when the housekeeper called.

Victoria Farley's hysterical sobs pierced through the receiver.

"Evelyn Sullivan! Are you trying to kill me?! Your father said he'll divorce me if we don't secure the Sullivan Group project!"

Evelyn's fingers stilled.

"Ms. Farley, you should be speaking with Ethan Sullivan."

"He said he won't reconsider unless you forgive us!" Victoria's voice trembled. "He won't even see Isabella now!"

Evelyn's brow furrowed.

"Ethan's decisions have nothing to do with me."

She ended the call and flipped her phone facedown.

Victoria hurled the device against the wall, shattering the screen.

"That ungrateful wretch! I should've smothered her at birth!"

Isabella Jackson handed her mother a steaming cup.

"Mother, don't upset yourself."

Turning to the housekeeper, she said gently, "I'll compensate you for the phone."

The housekeeper stared at the blackened screen, lips pressed tight. It had contained the only photos of her grandson's first month.

Once alone, Isabella rubbed Victoria's back.

"The project... it's hopeless now."

Tears splashed onto Victoria's knuckles.

"Are we really getting divorced?"

###Chapter 200

Isabella Jackson gently patted Victoria Farley's trembling shoulder, her voice soft but firm. "Mom, don't worry. I won't let Dad divorce you. I'll talk to him right now."

Victoria lifted her tear-filled eyes, her voice choked with emotion. "Isabella, it's all up to you now..."

"This family won't fall apart. I promise."

The sharp click of Isabella's heels echoed through the hallway as she left. She headed straight for Jackson Group and pushed open the door to the chairman's office.

William Jackson was yanking at his tie in frustration, his desk buried under stacks of documents. He frowned when he saw his daughter. "What are you doing here?"

"Dad, I'm here to ask you not to divorce Mom."

William slammed his hands on the desk and stood. "This is between adults. Stay out of it!"

"I'm part of this family too!" Isabella held her ground. "I won't accept this divorce!"

"Do you know she cost us the Sullivan Group project?" William sneered. "The shareholders have been hounding me nonstop. Unless she can salvage that deal, this conversation is over!"

Isabella clenched her fists. "Evelyn hates Mom now. She’d never agree. You're just making impossible demands!"

"Then we have nothing more to discuss." William turned to face the window.

Isabella took a deep breath. "If I can secure a better project for Jackson Group, will you call off the divorce?"

William spun around, his eyes gleaming. "Can you do that?"

"I guarantee it'll be on par with the Sullivan deal."

"Fine. It's a deal."

As Isabella left, William immediately dialed a number.

A shrill female voice answered. "William! You promised the divorce would be finalized this month! Our son is eight years old—how much longer must he live as a bastard?"

"Sweetheart, let me explain—"

"Save it! Are you still clinging to that old hag?"

William lowered his voice. "You and our son are all that matter to me. I swear, Jackson Group will be his someday."

"You'd better mean it!"

The line went dead. Rubbing his temples, William sent a text: [I’ll see you and our son tonight.]

That evening, Evelyn Sullivan received a message from Bianca Quinn.

[Ms. Sullivan, may I treat you to dinner? I’d like to thank you in person.]

Evelyn replied without hesitation: [Sure.]

She took Bianca to an affordable hot pot restaurant. As Bianca scanned the menu, the tension in her shoulders visibly eased.

"Ms. Sullivan, I truly can’t thank you enough," Bianca said, cradling her teacup. "Without you, I might’ve remained a ghostwriter forever."

Evelyn stirred the meat slices in the pot. "No need for thanks. You’ll repay every penny."

"I know you’re paying me triple the market rate..." Bianca's eyes reddened. "I’ll work twice as hard!"

"I believe in you." Evelyn placed a slice of beef in Bianca’s bowl. "Stay true to yourself, and you’ll go far."

After dinner, Evelyn dropped Bianca off at the hospital before heading home.

When she arrived at the villa, the entire house was dark. She paused at the doorway, frowning.

###Chapter 201

Evelyn had just stepped into the villa when her phone rang.

"Zoe, you're not home?"

"Got called for a last-minute shoot. I'm on my way back now."

Relief washed over Evelyn at Zoe's safety. She headed upstairs, letting the warm shower rinse away the day's exhaustion.

Freshly changed into pajamas, her screen lit up.

[Planning to skip out on our dinner?]

It was a message from Ethan.

She opened Sean's chat.

[I'm free anytime this week. Since we're acting, maybe switch to calling me Sean?]

[Got it.]

Before replying to Ethan, her phone vibrated with an incoming call.

"Evelyn." His deep voice rumbled through the receiver. "No backing out of your promise."

"Are you free tomorrow night?"

A brief silence.

"Send me the restaurant address."

The moment the call ended, Ethan dialed his assistant.

"Cancel the Chelsey meeting tomorrow."

"Sir, it's our last chance—"

"Book us on the same flight."

Colin's protest was cut off by the dial tone.

Evelyn set her phone down just as an engine roared outside.

A red sports car pulled up. Zoe emerged from the passenger side—followed by the driver. Evelyn's eyes narrowed. Lucas Laurier?

She hurried downstairs, meeting her best friend at the door.

"Since when are you two so close?"

Zoe tugged at her hair in frustration.

"Got a flat tire. He happened to pass by."

Suddenly, Zoe's eyes sparkled with an idea.

"Come to dinner with me?"

Evelyn chuckled and nodded.

"You're the best!" Zoe threw her arms around Evelyn in a tight hug.

"Can't...breathe..."

Back in her room, Sophia's call came right on cue.

###Chapter 202

"Evelyn, Mason Young and Jason Zade have caved." Sophia Reynolds pushed open the door and placed her phone on the desk. "Legal just confirmed they're willing to settle."

Evelyn Sullivan's fingers paused briefly over the keyboard before resuming typing. "Proceed with the lawsuit as planned." She didn't look up. "Handle this yourself."

"Understood."

At the next morning's meeting, Simon Reynolds beamed as he handed her a file. "Evelyn, I compiled this supplier list overnight. Please review."

Evelyn flipped through the pages, her gaze lingering on several suspiciously low quotes. She closed the folder with a faint smile. "Appreciate the effort. But I've already lined up alternative factories for evaluation."

Simon's smile didn't waver. "Happy to contribute."

The discussion shifted to MY Fashion Group's market struggles. Shareholders argued heatedly until the blame landed on weak marketing. Evelyn cut through the noise. "Marketing will submit three campaign proposals this month. Simon will oversee."

After the meeting, Sophia stifled a laugh. "Brilliant! Now the old fox won't have time for schemes."

"Idle hands make mischief." Evelyn organized her notes. "I'm visiting new factories next week. Just Quincy and the team."

As dusk fell, a white BMW waited outside. Sean Reynolds opened the car door gently. "Any preferences for Ethan? I'll inform the restaurant."

"Unnecessary." She fastened her seatbelt. "Whatever he says tonight, don't take it personally."

Sean chuckled. "Don't worry. I won't embarrass my girlfriend."

The private dining room felt icy when they entered. Ethan Sullivan sat alone at the head of the table, his gaze freezing when it landed on Sean.

"Explain." His voice was razor-sharp.

Evelyn linked arms with Sean. "This is Sean Reynolds, my boyfriend." She felt his muscles tense beneath her grip. "Sean, meet Mr. Sullivan."

As Sean extended his hand, Ethan suddenly laughed coldly. "Hired actor?" His eyes locked onto Evelyn's whitening knuckles. "You still can't lie without that tell."

###Chapter 203

The moment their fingers touched, Evelyn Sullivan froze.

Sean Reynolds' palm was warm and dry, yet every instinct screamed at her to pull away. Physical intimacy had never been her comfort zone.

"Mr. Sullivan, Lily and I are indeed in a relationship."

Ethan Sullivan's gaze sliced like a blade to their joined hands, his voice glacial. "Release her unless you want that hand broken."

Sean didn't budge, lips quirking in defiance. "Since when does holding my girlfriend's hand require your permission?"

Evelyn's pulse spiked. The audacity of this man, provoking Ethan to his face.

She seized the chance to withdraw her hand, murmuring, "Sean, let's sit."

His responding smile sent an odd jolt through her chest.

"Of course. Your wish is my command."

They'd barely taken their seats when Ethan barked, "Evelyn. Here. Now."

Before she could respond, Sean stood. "How about I join you instead, Mr. Sullivan?"

The air turned to ice.

Evelyn's eyes widened as a ridiculous thought struck—was Sean's real target Ethan all along?

Ethan's expression darkened dangerously, his gaze darting between them before settling on Evelyn's contemplative face.

"We're not acquainted, Mr. Reynolds."

Undeterred, Sean strolled over, beaming. "Few more meetings will fix that."

Ethan's knuckles whitened. "The Reynolds name will vanish from the capital by dawn. Test me."

"Perfect." Sean's eyes lit up. "Bankruptcy means Evelyn can support me properly."

Evelyn choked on her water. This act was getting absurd!

Yet Ethan's thunderous expression sparked perverse satisfaction.

"Evelyn!" he ground out. "You've outdone yourself."

She set her glass down with practiced grace. "This is a gratitude dinner, Mr. Sullivan. Order anything—my boyfriend's treating."

Ethan surged to his feet, storming toward her.

Sean intercepted him. "Mr. Sullivan, I must ask—"

"Move!"

The roar shook the private dining room. Sean paled but held his ground.

"You're divorced. Evelyn belongs to me now."

"Divorced?" Ethan's laugh was arctic, eyes churning with fury. "Who fed you that lie?"

###Chapter 204

"Ethan Sullivan, what did you just say?"

Both Sean Reynolds and Evelyn Sullivan's expressions darkened.

Ethan's gaze lingered on Evelyn's face before he turned to leave.

A sudden unease gripped Evelyn's heart.

"Mr. Reynolds, I apologize. Something urgent has come up."

Without further explanation, she hurried after him.

In the underground parking lot, Ethan leaned against his car, clearly waiting for her.

"Ethan, explain yourself! What do you mean we're not divorced?"

Without warning, he pulled her close by the waist.

Evelyn tried to struggle, but he gripped her chin firmly.

A furious kiss crashed down on her lips.

She bit him hard, the metallic tang of blood spreading between them.

Instead of pulling away, Ethan deepened the kiss, as if determined to consume her.

She shoved against his chest, but he didn't budge.

Only when she was gasping for air did he finally release her.

"Still trying to provoke me with other men?"

"We're divorced!" Evelyn wiped her mouth. "Who I'm with is none of your business!"

His eyes turned icy.

"Try me."

"What? Does the mighty Mr. Sullivan think he can control his ex-wife's personal life?"

"Any man who dares to touch you," he said darkly, "will wish he were dead."

Evelyn trembled with rage.

"You're insane!"

"If I see you with Sean Reynolds again," Ethan tightened his grip on her chin, "his company will be bankrupt within three days."

She yanked her hand free.

After a moment to collect herself, she forced her voice steady.

"What's going on with the divorce papers?"

"Figure it out yourself." His lips curled into a cold smile. "But for now, stay away from Sean."

"Or what?"

"Or I'll remind you whose name is still on your marriage certificate."

Evelyn turned to leave.

Ethan seized her wrist.

"I'll drive you."

"No need!"

"Either I drive you," his voice dropped low, "or we stay here until dawn."

###Chapter 205

Evelyn clenched her fists, nails digging deep into her palms.

"Ethan Sullivan, you'll never learn to respect others!"

Her voice trembled, eyes burning with fury.

Ethan stood before her, expressionless, radiating icy detachment.

"I told you on our divorce day—you'll always be my wife."

"Your wife?" Evelyn scoffed. "To you, I'm just a puppet on strings!"

She turned to leave, but his grip yanked her back.

"Let go!"

Ethan didn't budge, his dark gaze unreadable.

"Evelyn, when will you stop being so stubborn?"

"Me? Stubborn?" She wrenched her arm free. "You're the one who's insufferably arrogant!"

A dull thud sounded behind her.

Evelyn spun around to find Ethan collapsed on the floor, his face deathly pale.

"Stop faking it!"

She stood frozen, yet her pulse betrayed her, racing uncontrollably.

Ten seconds... twenty...

"Damn it!"

She rushed back, her stomach lurching at the scorching heat of his forehead.

The wound had swollen, inflamed, with yellowish fluid seeping through the bandage.

"Colin! Get antipyretics ready—now!"

Struggling to haul Ethan into the car, her fingers shook faintly.

At the villa entrance, Colin paced anxiously.

"Miss Evelyn, Mr. Sullivan—"

"Open the door."

Gritting her teeth, she shouldered Ethan's weight, beads of sweat forming at her temples.

Colin gaped as she effortlessly carried him to the bedroom.

"Water."

With practiced efficiency, she peeled away the bloodied gauze, movements unexpectedly gentle.

"He hasn't changed the dressing in days?"

Colin hesitated. "Mr. Sullivan rushed back to see you—"

"Enough."

As she snipped the adhered bandage, Ethan frowned in his unconscious state.

"Serves you right."

Despite her sharp words, her touch softened further.

Just as she finished, a feverish hand suddenly seized her wrist.

Ethan's eyes fluttered half-open, lashes casting shadows beneath them.

"Don't... go..."

The rasp in his voice sent an unwelcome tremor through her.

###Chapter 206 

Evelyn Sullivan froze mid-step, her fingertips trembling slightly. She took a deep breath before turning around, her eyes now icy cold.

"Mr. Sullivan, please behave yourself."

Ethan Sullivan's grip was scorching, his fingers locked around her wrist like a vise. His pale lips pressed into a thin line, dark emotions churning in his gaze.

"Is Sean Reynolds more important than me?"

The words made Evelyn's chest tighten. She wrenched her hand free, leaving faint red marks on his skin with her nails.

Colin Keller stood awkwardly by the door, holding a glass of water.

"Ms. Sullivan, Mr. Sullivan needs someone to take care of him right now..."

"Then hire a professional nurse." Evelyn picked up her bag, her voice as cold as steel. "I'm not the right person."

Ethan suddenly laughed. He released her, the light in his eyes dimming bit by bit.

"Get out."

Evelyn didn’t look back as she walked to the foyer. Only after the door slammed shut did Ethan violently sweep the glass off the nightstand.

Shards scattered across the floor.

Colin flinched. "Mr. Sullivan, I—"

"You too. Get out."

Elm Cove was eerily quiet at night. Evelyn stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, absently tracing the rim of her glass.

Zoe Zade's soft snores drifted down from the second floor.

She shouldn’t have softened. But seeing Ethan weakened against the pillows always cracked the walls she’d built.

Her phone buzzed. Sean Reynolds' name flashed on the screen.

"Let’s meet tomorrow," she murmured. "There are things we need to clarify."

At the café, sunlight gilded Sean’s white shirt. He slid a caramel macchiato toward her, his smile painfully gentle.

"I’m sorry about yesterday," Evelyn said, staring at the latte art.

Sean suddenly grasped her hand.

"Evelyn, the truth is I—"

"Call me Ms. Sullivan." She jerked her hand back, coffee splashing onto the tablecloth in a dark stain.

His expression darkened.

"Four years ago, in the MY elevator, I already—"

"Enough!" Evelyn stood abruptly, her bag knocking over the sugar jar. "This is strictly professional."

The glass shattered on the floor—just like her chaotic thoughts.

A waiter rushed over to clean the mess. Amid the noise, Sean’s voice cut through clearly:

"But I want this to be real."

###Chapter 207

Evelyn Sullivan remained silent for a long moment, her fingers absently tracing the rim of her coffee cup.

"Mr. Reynolds, I appreciate your feelings," she finally said. "But I'm not ready for a relationship right now."

Sean Reynolds' gaze lingered on her slightly trembling lashes. His voice was gentle. "I can wait."

"Don't." Evelyn lifted her eyes. "I don't even know if I'll ever fall in love again. You deserve better."

Sean suddenly smiled. "So you thought the fashion business was just an excuse?"

"I did wonder."

"It was all true." His eyes burned with sincerity. "Wanting to pursue you was too."

Evelyn took a deep breath. "If you need help with work, just ask. But when it comes to feelings... I can't give you what you want."

Sean's smile froze, then twisted into a bitter grin. "I should've known this would happen."

Her tense shoulders finally relaxed. There was another unspoken reason for rejecting him—he was Sophia Reynolds' cousin. If they dated and broke up, even her friendship with Sophia would become awkward.

"You're a great person. You'll find someone more suitable."

"The 'nice guy' speech?" He raised an eyebrow.

"I mean it!" she insisted.

Sean leaned forward suddenly. "Can you call me Sean one more time?"

"Sean."

"Thank you."

......

In the MY CEO's office, Evelyn cornered Sophia by the door.

"Care to explain?"

Sophia's eyes widened. "He confessed?!"

"Yes."

"Oh my god!" Sophia clapped excitedly. "I can't believe my cousin actually had the guts!"

Evelyn's voice turned icy. "I turned him down."

"Figured." Sophia shrugged. "I always said he wasn't your type."

"If you ever play matchmaker again," Evelyn narrowed her eyes, "say goodbye to your year-end bonus."

Sophia immediately clung to her arm. "No! I need that money for holiday shopping!"

"Nice use of idioms." Evelyn couldn't help but laugh.

"But you can't dock my pay!"

"Behave, and I won't."

Sophia stuck out her tongue. "Fine!"

After shooing Sophia away, Evelyn summoned Quincy Howard and Bianca Rose.

"You're both coming with me on a business trip tomorrow. It'll last a week."

Once they left, Bianca slipped into the restroom and made a call. "The CEO is taking me on a trip tomorrow."

A low voice issued instructions on the other end.

"Understood," she whispered.

The next morning, the three of them set off.

In Ethan Sullivan's office at Sullivan Group, Colin Keller hung up his phone anxiously. "Ms. Sullivan's phone is off."

Ethan looked up sharply from the documents he was reviewing. "Find out where she is."

A blot of ink spread across the paper where his pen had paused.

###Chapter 208

Ten minutes later, Colin rushed back into the office.

"Mr. Sullivan, we've located Ms. Sullivan. She's on a flight to Qingcheng."

Ethan's fountain pen paused mid-stroke, ink bleeding across the document.

"Qingcheng?"

His voice was glacial.

"Yes. The flight took off an hour ago."

Colin felt the temperature in the office plummet, sweat trickling down his spine.

"Find out why she's going there."

"Right away, sir."

......

Evelyn had just stepped past airport security when her phone rang.

"Evelyn! Please tell me you didn't forget about meeting Lucas with me tonight?"

Zoe's voice carried playful reproach through the receiver.

Evelyn halted mid-step, suddenly remembering her promise from last week.

"Zoe, I'm so sorry. It's a last-minute business trip—I'm already in Qingcheng."

She pressed her fingers to her temple in frustration.

"Oh..." Zoe's disappointment was palpable. "We'll reschedule when you're back."

"Dinner's on me as an apology."

After hanging up, Evelyn took a deep breath.

Near the exit, a sun-weathered middle-aged man held a sign with her name.

His faded jacket was worn but clean, his posture neat.

"Mayor Cruz?"

The man turned with a warm, unassuming smile.

"Ms. Sullivan! You must be exhausted from the trip."

He rubbed his hands nervously, eyeing her suitcase.

"Let me get your luggage."

"No need, thank you."

She declined politely, scanning the parking lot.

When the rusted minivan came into view, Quincy and Bianca both gasped.

"This..."

Bianca's stilettos tapped anxiously against the concrete.

Without hesitation, Evelyn pulled open the creaky door.

"Get in."

During the drive, Vincent detailed the village's situation.

The vehicle eventually stopped at a hillside.

"Apologies, Ms. Sullivan. The rest is on foot."

Evelyn hoisted her suitcase effortlessly.

"Bianca, change your shoes."

She noted the secretary's impractical heels.

"Yes, ma'am!"

Bianca scrambled for sneakers in her bag.

Vincent quickly took her luggage.

"Allow me, miss."

###Chapter 209

Bianca Rose came to a panting halt, beads of sweat glistening on her forehead. Too exhausted to continue, she shoved her suitcase toward Vincent Cruz.

"Mayor Cruz, I appreciate your help."

Vincent's sun-darkened face broke into a guileless smile. "No trouble at all."

The winding mountain path stretched endlessly. Half an hour later, they finally arrived at their destination. Quincy Howard and Bianca were drenched in sweat, their makeup smudged beyond recognition. Yet Evelyn Sullivan remained composed, her breathing steady as if she'd just taken a leisurely stroll.

Vincent set down the luggage and gestured toward a modest adobe house. "Miss Sullivan, this is the accommodation arranged for you. I apologize for the humble conditions."

Evelyn surveyed the surroundings with a nod. "It's more than adequate. What about meals?"

"You'll dine at my place. Rest today—I'll bring lunch shortly. Tomorrow, I'll show you the textile factory."

"Thank you."

The moment Vincent left, Bianca's demeanor shifted. She glared at the peeling walls, her nose wrinkling in disgust.

"Evelyn, is this place even habitable?"

Evelyn continued unpacking without turning. "Three bedrooms. One for each of us."

"That's not the point!" Bianca's voice rose sharply. "There isn't even a proper bathroom! I'm booking a hotel!"

"We're here to work."

"Then I quit!"

Evelyn finally turned, her gaze as calm as still waters. "Suit yourself."

Bianca stomped her foot in frustration but didn't dare leave. Lost in this wilderness, she wouldn't even find her way back.

Quincy quickly intervened. "Bianca, let's endure it for now. If you really want to resign, do it after we return to the city."

"Hmph! The first thing I'll do back in town is hand in my resignation!" Bianca hissed through clenched teeth before dragging her luggage into a room.

In the living area, Evelyn had already made her bed. She didn't glance up as the other two entered.

Quincy forced a laugh. "Evelyn, Bianca knows she was wrong—"

"It's just work," Evelyn cut in. "People come and go as they please."

Bianca's eyes reddened before she spun around and slammed her door shut.

At lunchtime, Vincent arrived with a food container. "Country fare is simple. I hope you don't mind."

The table held braised chicken, scrambled eggs with tomatoes, greens, and meatball soup. Bianca curled her lip in disdain.

Evelyn picked up her chopsticks. "It's generous. Vegetables from your own garden, I assume?"

Her gaze flicked to Bianca, who was meticulously wiping her bowl and utensils with a tissue.

###Chapter 210

Vincent Cruz's eyes lit up, his earlier restraint vanishing. "The villagers grew these vegetables themselves—no pesticides. If you'd like some, Miss Sullivan, I can pick some for you before you leave."

"Thank you in advance."

"Take your time eating. Just leave the dishes—I'll clean up later." Vincent rubbed his hands together. "I'll take you around the village this afternoon."

Evelyn Sullivan nodded.

Bianca Rose and Quincy Howard were already starving. The three ate quietly. Bianca took a bite of the simple-looking greens and was surprised by how delicious they were.

After the meal, Vincent arrived as promised.

Shili Village nestled between mountains and rivers, its cobblestone paths winding through the landscape. "Most young people have left for work in the cities," Vincent explained as they walked. "Only the elderly and children remain."

At a fork in the road, a little girl with pigtails suddenly darted out.

"Whoa!"

The girl's rough ceramic bowl nearly slipped from her hands, but Evelyn reacted instantly—steadying the child with one hand and catching the bowl with the other.

"Are you okay?" she asked softly.

The girl stared wide-eyed at the beautiful stranger, forgetting to take the bowl back.

"Autumn!" Vincent frowned. "What's the rush?"

"I'm bringing dinner to Daniel!" The girl finally snapped out of her daze, hugging the bowl like treasure. "He came back today!"

Vincent chuckled. "He's probably already eaten by now."

"I'm still bringing it!" Autumn stuck out her tongue and skipped away.

Evelyn's heart skipped a beat.

"That child mentioned... Daniel?"

"The actor Daniel Sterling!" Vincent beamed with pride. "He just won Best Actor recently!"

Evelyn paused mid-step.

"His surname is Sterling?"

"Yes! Are you a fan, Miss Sullivan?" Vincent's eyes sparkled. "Should I take you to the Sterling house? You'll run into him eventually anyway."

The sound of reading aloud drifted from the Sterling family courtyard.

Vincent had barely knocked when the wooden door creaked open.

"Uncle Cruz..." Daniel's smile froze the moment he saw Evelyn. "Evelyn?"

Sunlight filtered through the grapevines, casting golden flecks in her hair.

"Here to meet fabric suppliers," she said with a faint smile. "I didn't know this was your hometown."

Daniel's throat moved slightly. He'd retreated here to escape the chaos of the capital—only to run into the one person he most wanted to see.

"Would you like to come in?"

"No, I won't disturb your rest."

They stood on either side of the threshold, silence speaking volumes.

As they left, Vincent rubbed his hands again. "Miss Sullivan, I'll pick you up at eight tomorrow morning to visit the factory."

The setting sun stretched their three shadows long across the ground.

###Chapter 211

"Thank you, Mayor Cruz."

After seeing Vincent Cruz off, the three of them freshened up briefly before retiring to their respective rooms.

At the same moment, in Rongcheng.

Colin Keller hurriedly pushed open the door to Ethan Sullivan's office, clutching newly uncovered documents.

"Mr. Sullivan, we've located Ms. Sullivan. She's in Shili Village, south of Qingcheng."

Ethan's fingers stilled. His pen left an ink blot on the file.

"What is she doing in a place like that?"

"Likely... business-related matters."

"Leave."

Once the door closed, Ethan dialed Sophia Reynolds' number.

"Sophia, why did Evelyn go to Shili Village?"

Sophia's mocking laughter came through the line. "Since when do you care about MY Fashion's business trips?"

Ethan's eyes darkened. "She's my wife."

"Then you should ask her directly." Sophia hung up without hesitation.

Ethan stared at the darkened screen, his knuckles turning white. After a pause, he dialed a familiar number.

"Hello?" Evelyn's voice carried exhaustion.

"Visiting Grandma this weekend. Coming?"

"Can't. I'm on a business trip. Next time."

Silence stretched between them, filled only by their breathing.

"I'm going to sleep if there's nothing else." Evelyn ended the call first.

Over the next three days, Evelyn led her team through an in-depth inspection of the textile factory.

Inside the modest workshop, workers skillfully operated vintage looms. The dye house carried the fresh scent of plants, producing fabrics with rich, vibrant colors.

On the evening of the third day, Evelyn signed the cooperation agreement at the village council.

Vincent trembled with excitement, slaughtering his fattest hen that very night.

"Ms. Sullivan, this toast is for you!" He drained his glass, eyes reddening. "We won't let you down!"

Evelyn raised her cup with a faint smile. "It was your craftsmanship that won me over."

As the drinking continued, lightning suddenly split the sky outside.

Torrential rain poured down, quickly forming streams in the courtyard. Bianca Rose peered anxiously out the window. "Why is the rain getting heavier?"

A villager in a raincoat burst in, drenched. "Mayor! The Smith family's house is flooding!"

###Chapter 212

Vincent Cruz's face darkened as he shot up from his chair, the legs scraping harshly against the floor.

"Quick! Get the raincoat!"

His wife hurried from the inner room with a faded blue raincoat, her fingers trembling slightly.

Evelyn Sullivan sensed something was wrong. "Village Chief Cruz, what's happening?"

"Several downstream villages are flooded." Vincent hastily tied the raincoat strings as water seeped under the door. "Stay put for now."

Watching his figure disappear into the rain, unease settled in Evelyn's chest.

This storm was unnatural.

The downpour continued relentlessly through the night, showing no signs of easing. Outside, the water had risen past the doorstep, forcing Evelyn to move everyone upstairs.

At dawn, the village loudspeakers crackled to life with a jarring announcement.

"Emergency alert! All villagers must evacuate to higher ground immediately! Repeat, evacuate immediately!"

Bianca Rose's cup slipped from her fingers and shattered on the floor.

"Ms. Sullivan... Should we—"

Evelyn strode to the window. The murky floodwaters had already swallowed the stone bridge at the village entrance.

"Grab essentials. We're leaving."

Meanwhile, at Sullivan Group's headquarters.

Ethan Sullivan stared at his phone screen—"Call Failed"—his knuckles whitening.

"Colin!"

The office door burst open as Colin Keller stumbled in with an armful of files.

"Mr. Sullivan, all communication towers in Qingcheng are—"

"Is the helicopter ready?"

Colin wiped sweat from his brow. "The meteorological bureau just issued a red alert. It's too dangerous to—"

Ethan snatched his suit jacket, his gaze sharp as a blade.

"You have thirty minutes."

Chaos engulfed Shili Village.

Vincent directed panicked villagers toward the ancestral hall, the highest structure in the area. A deafening crash echoed as boulders tumbled down the mountainside.

"Look out!"

He shoved an elderly man aside just as a flying branch gashed his leg.

Blood instantly soaked through his pants.

"Chief!"

Villagers scrambled to carry him into Uncle West's nearby home.

Evelyn was packing medical supplies with Sophia when the news reached her.

"I'm going." She grabbed the first-aid kit.

Quincy Howard blocked her path. "The water's waist-deep out there!"

Evelyn pushed past him. "He got hurt saving others."

The icy rain needled her skin.

When she finally reached Uncle West's house, she froze at the sight of a familiar figure kneeling beside Vincent.

Daniel Sterling glanced up, deftly wrapping bandages from his medical kit.

"How did you—"

Dripping wet, Evelyn knelt beside him and took the scissors from his hands.

"Let me."

###Chapter 213

"I'm trained in first aid. I heard Chief Vincent was injured and came to check."

Evelyn Sullivan took the disinfectant supplies from Daniel Sterling's hands and efficiently cleaned Vincent Cruz's wound.

Ten minutes later, the wound was bandaged. As she closed the first aid kit, a villager rushed in, panicked.

"Autumn went home to grab something and hasn't returned! The floodwaters have already reached her house!"

The room fell silent. Everyone exchanged uneasy glances.

Under normal circumstances, they wouldn't hesitate to help. But with the raging flood and none of them knowing how to swim, going out now would be suicide.

Daniel suddenly stood. "I'll go."

Evelyn immediately stepped forward. "I'm coming with you."

"No!" His voice was sharp. "It's too dangerous!"

"And it's not dangerous for you alone?"

"You're not going. That's final."

Seeing his resolve, Evelyn pressed her lips together. "Fine."

Daniel's figure soon disappeared into the rain. Evelyn asked for Autumn's home location and turned to leave.

Vincent, who had been silent until now, spoke up. "I didn't say anything earlier because I didn't want to pressure anyone into risking their lives. But if even Miss Sullivan, an outsider, is willing to help, will you all just stand by and watch?"

Evelyn glanced back calmly. "Chief Cruz, this is my choice. Daniel and I will bring Autumn back safely."

These past few days, Autumn had always brought extra supplies for her. That kindness hadn't gone unnoticed.

For anyone else, she might have stayed out of it. Survival was instinct during disasters.

Her figure gradually faded into the rain.

When she reached Autumn's home, the floodwaters had already submerged half the house.

Daniel was waist-deep in water, struggling forward with a wooden plank. Autumn huddled on it, soaked and shivering.

Spotting Evelyn, Daniel's pupils constricted. "I told you not to come!"

Ignoring him, Evelyn dove into the water and swam to them.

"I'll take Autumn to shore first. You can't swim, can you?"

The water had risen to Daniel's chest. Any delay would put them both in greater danger.

"Get her to safety. I'll figure something out."

Without another word, Evelyn wrapped an arm around Autumn and fought her way toward the bank.

The downpour blurred her vision, but Daniel knew her eyes held the same determination as that night three years ago.

When an investor had forced him to kneel and toast, she'd shattered her glass and extended a hand. "Want to be my artist?"

A twenty-year-old girl, yet her eyes had shone like stars. He'd taken that hand and stepped out of the darkness.

The water kept rising—past his chin, his lips, his nose...

Seeing Evelyn reach the shore safely, Daniel finally exhaled in relief.

Evelyn set Autumn down and turned, but Daniel was nowhere in sight.

Her face paled. "Autumn, go to Grandpa Howard's house. I need to find your brother Daniel."

Autumn clutched her sleeve, tears streaming. "Sister Evelyn, will Daniel die? I don't want him to leave..."

###Chapter 214

"Go! I'll bring help!" Autumn shouted, her eyes red with tears.

Evelyn Sullivan nodded and plunged into the murky floodwaters without hesitation.

Visibility was near zero underwater. She groped blindly through the darkness until her fingers brushed against fabric.

Daniel Sterling!

She swam toward him, finding him unconscious. Gritting her teeth, Evelyn dragged him upward with all her strength.

When they broke the surface, the situation was worse than she'd imagined. The raging current had swept them far from shore.

"Damn it!" Evelyn cursed, spotting a rooftop barely visible above the waterline.

Struggling against the current, she hauled Daniel toward it. They barely managed to clamber onto the crumbling structure.

"Wake up!" She pressed hard on Daniel's chest.

He coughed violently, water gushing from his lips. His pupils contracted sharply when his eyes fluttered open.

"Evelyn?" His trembling hand reached for her face but jerked back at the last moment. "I...thought I was dreaming."

She ignored the moment. "Don't move. Conserve your strength."

Her heart sank as she surveyed their surroundings. The rising waters had turned the area into an isolated island.

The flood kept climbing, soon lapping at their ankles.

"You shouldn't have come back," Daniel rasped. "Too dangerous."

Evelyn didn't turn. "Would you have left me?"

"Never."

"Then shut up."

The roof shuddered violently. Weathered beams groaned under the strain.

"Look out—"

The entire structure collapsed. Evelyn locked her grip around Daniel's wrist as they plunged back into the churning water.

"Let go!" Daniel thrashed. "You can make it alone!"

"Shut up!" she snapped. "One more move and I'll knock you out!"

Battling the current, she dragged Daniel forward. Each wave hammered them like a physical blow.

Twenty meters from shore, a massive wave slammed them underwater.

Evelyn choked on the flood, her arms cramping from exhaustion. She could feel her strength draining away.

Daniel suddenly seized her wrist.

"Enough," he murmured, prying her fingers open one by one. "Thank you...for everything."

"Daniel Sterling! Don't you dare let go!" Her eyes burned with fury.

He gave her a faint smile and leaned back—

###Chapter 215

Daniel Sterling's fingertips trembled slightly.

He gazed at Evelyn Sullivan's rain-drenched profile, the words buried deep in his heart nearly escaping his lips.

But in the end, he only gently pulled his sleeve free.

"Be careful."

Before Evelyn could respond, a deafening roar erupted overhead.

The helicopter's rotors churned the air, sending ripples across the water's surface.

As the cabin door opened, Ethan Sullivan's stern face came into view.

Clad in a life vest, he descended rapidly via rope, his gaze locked onto Evelyn.

Evelyn's pupils constricted.

Why was he here?

Her heart skipped a beat, a secret hope swelling uncontrollably in her chest.

"Grab it!"

Ethan hurled the lifeline toward Evelyn, his voice icy.

But she passed it to Daniel instead. "You first."

"Evelyn!"

Ethan's roar seemed to shake the water itself.

The look he gave Daniel was murderous.

"He can't swim," Evelyn explained calmly.

Daniel opened his mouth to speak, but the lifeline was already secured around him.

The rope tightened, lifting him from the water.

Ethan descended again, preparing to throw the line once more—then his expression changed abruptly.

"Look out!"

He severed the rope and plunged into the water.

Before Evelyn could react, a powerful force dragged her toward the depths.

She turned to see a ten-foot wave crashing toward them.

"Hold onto me!"

Ethan's voice fractured in the chaos of the waves.

The next instant, frigid seawater swallowed all sound.

From the helicopter, Daniel watched helplessly as the two vanished beneath the towering whitecaps.

"No—!"

He lunged for the cabin door, only to be restrained by Colin Keller.

"Get a grip!"

"Let me go! Evelyn's still down there!"

"Going after them now is suicide!" Colin barked, then shouted to the pilot, "Call the rescue team immediately!"

The cabin door slammed shut, sealing away all hope.

Daniel collapsed to his knees, his nails digging deep into his palms.

By the time the news reached Shili Village, the rain had begun to ease.

Quincy Howard punched the wall. "This is all my fault!"

Bianca Rose slipped quietly behind the house and retrieved a satellite phone hidden in her boot.

"Target confirmed missing. Survival probability... zero."

She ended the call and gazed at the now-calm sea in the distance, the ghost of a smile touching her lips.

###Chapter 216

The man's slender fingers tapped lightly against the window frame as he listened to the report from his subordinate over the phone.

"Iris is dead?" A faint smirk curled at the corner of his lips. "More interesting than I expected."

He ended the call and turned to gaze at the churning waves outside, a shadow of ruthlessness flickering in his eyes.

Evelyn Sullivan thought she would drown.

When the tidal wave crashed over them, she instinctively grabbed Ethan Sullivan's wrist. The violent current swept them toward the shore, stealing the breath from her lungs.

Her fingertips suddenly brushed against rough bark.

Survival instinct took over. She clung to the tree with all her strength. As the water receded, she hung limply from the branches, gasping for air.

Ethan stood a short distance away, his suit soaked through, dark hair plastered to his forehead. The moonlight sharpened the angles of his stern face.

"Can you walk?" His voice was low.

Evelyn nodded and staggered down from the tree. Her legs gave out the moment her feet touched the ground. A strong arm caught her—then released just as quickly.

They walked toward the shore in silence.

"Mr. Sullivan." She spoke suddenly. "Thank you."

Ethan halted mid-step. When he turned, fury burned in his eyes.

"Evelyn." Each word was ice-cold. "For Daniel Sterling, you'd throw your life away?"

She clenched her damp clothes. "It was an emergency—"

"An emergency that made you forget your own limits?" His laugh was harsh. "If I hadn't arrived in time, you'd be dead."

The sea wind lifted her hair, revealing her pale face.

"Next time—"

"There won't be a next time." He cut her off. "If this happens again, I won't lift a finger."

He turned and walked away, his posture rigid. Evelyn stared at the wound on his shoulder from the tree branch, her throat tight.

A faint light glowed halfway up the mountain.

The elderly couple listened to their ordeal before warmly ushering them inside. The old woman rummaged through her belongings and pulled out fresh clothes. "Change into these. Don't catch a cold."

Evelyn accepted the cotton garments, their scent of soap lingering on her trembling fingers.

"You two can sleep here." The old woman smiled as she opened the door. "The blankets are freshly aired."

Ethan didn't correct her assumption. He strode straight into the room. The moment the wooden door closed, the air turned heavy.

"You take the bed." He loosened his collar. "I'll keep watch."

Evelyn glanced at the cracked wooden chair, then murmured, "The bed is big enough."

Moonlight streamed through the window, casting a silver divide between them.

###Chapter 217

Evelyn Sullivan smoothed the bedsheets with practiced efficiency, her movements crisp like someone accustomed to this routine. She lifted her gaze to Ethan Sullivan standing by the window, her voice calm. "Mr. Sullivan, it's time to rest."

Ethan turned, his dark eyes lingering on her composed face for a fleeting moment. He said nothing.

They lay side by side, the room silent except for their breathing. Evelyn stared at the ceiling, fingers unconsciously twisting the edge of the blanket.

"Mr. Sullivan, are you asleep?" she finally whispered.

"No." His voice cut through the darkness, sharp and clear.

Evelyn bit her lip. "About today... thank you. But I don’t want to owe you anything else."

The air turned icy.

"Then don’t repay me." Ethan suddenly turned to face her, his voice tight with suppressed anger. "Evelyn, how long are you going to keep pretending?"

Her heart skipped a beat.

"I—"

"If I didn’t care about you, why would I drop everything to find you?" The words sounded forced through clenched teeth.

Her grip tightened on the sheets. She understood, but the scars of the past made trust impossible.

"But Isabella—"

"That’s over." He cut her off. "Right now, I just want your answer."

Evelyn closed her eyes, lashes trembling. "Give me time... I need to think."

In the darkness, she heard Ethan exhale softly.

The night stretched endlessly. Evelyn’s mind replayed the moment Ethan had severed the rope—the shock of it still reverberated through her.

At dawn, Ethan’s assistant arrived with a rescue team. Before leaving, Ethan insisted on compensating the elderly Howards, but they refused.

"Young man, helping you was enough," Grandma Howard said kindly, pressing a talisman into Evelyn’s hand.

When the helicopter landed in Rongcheng, Zoe Zade was waiting at the villa entrance. Her eyes red, she crushed Evelyn in a breathless embrace.

"You scared me to death!" Zoe’s voice cracked. "The news said you were swept into the sea—I almost—"

Evelyn patted her back. "I’m fine."

"Fine? If it weren’t for Mr. Sullivan—"

"I need to shower." Evelyn gently pulled away, retreating to the bathroom.

The hot water did nothing to untangle her thoughts. As she towel-dried her hair, her phone lit up with a message from Sophia Reynolds.

"7 p.m. Usual place. We’re celebrating your survival."

Evelyn replied with a quick "OK" and drove to MY Fashion Group. The moment she stepped into her office, Sophia burst in.

"Next time, put your safety first," Sophia said sternly, then lowered her voice. "The Sullivan family is in chaos. Brace yourself."

Evelyn’s hand paused mid-air, the pen trembling slightly.

###Chapter 218

Evelyn lowered her lashes and murmured, "Okay."

After Sophia left, Evelyn was alone in the office. She picked up her phone and dialed Vincent Cruz.

"Mayor Cruz, how's the situation in Shili Village?"

"Miss Sullivan, the flood is under control. All villagers are safe."

"That's good. The fabric production can wait until the disaster is fully resolved."

"Thank you for your understanding."

The moment she hung up, her phone vibrated again. The screen flashed with "Ethan Sullivan." Her fingers trembled slightly.

"Hello?"

"Are you free for lunch?"

She bit her lower lip. "MY and Sullivan Group are quite far apart..."

"I can leave early."

"Mr. Sullivan, I haven't decided yet..."

A low chuckle came through the phone. "Just lunch. No pressure."

Her ears warmed. "Then... what do you want to eat?"

"I should be asking you that."

His amused tone made her heart skip. "I'm fine with anything."

"Sichuan cuisine?"

"You don't have to accommodate me. Let's pick somewhere neutral."

A brief silence. "Fine."

"I should get back to work."

After hanging up, she touched her flushed cheeks. The words on the documents blurred as her thoughts drifted away.

At noon sharp, her phone buzzed. Ethan had sent the restaurant address.

Evelyn reapplied her lipstick and nearly collided with Sophia at the door.

"Oh? Going out for lunch?"

"Yeah. Meeting someone."

"Who?" Sophia leaned in, grinning.

Evelyn stepped back hastily. "Forgot something. You go ahead."

Watching her friend flee, Sophia narrowed her eyes thoughtfully.

Evelyn lingered in the office for ten extra minutes before leaving. At the restaurant, Ethan had been waiting.

Her furtive glances made him frown.

"I haven't ordered yet." He pushed the menu toward her. "Relax. I booked the entire place."

Her shoulders finally relaxed as she focused on the menu.

Ethan's expression darkened.

"You don't want to be seen with me?"

"No..." She gripped the menu. "It's just... complicated to explain."

He fell silent. The air grew heavy.

"Are you angry?"

"No." He picked up his water glass, voice stiff.

###Chapter 219

Ethan's expression darkened visibly.

Evelyn's fingers curled slightly at her sides. She considered breaking the tension but remembered their undefined relationship, choosing silence instead.

The restaurant was empty except for their table. The waiter served their dishes promptly.

Though displeased by her avoidance of familiar places, Ethan initiated conversation. "What project takes you to Shili Village?"

"Scouting a fabric factory." Evelyn picked at her greens. "MY plans to partner with them."

"I thought you said you were a janitor?" His brow arched. "Since when do janitors handle procurement?"

Her chopsticks stilled.

"You believed that?" She met his gaze with faint amusement.

"Of course not." He set down his wineglass. "So what's your real role at MY?"

Stirring her soup absently, Evelyn remained calm. "If you could track my itinerary, why not my position?"

She'd had Sophia falsify her HR records long ago.

Ethan's frown deepened. "Do you truly trust me so little?"

After learning she despised surveillance, he'd only had Colin verify her safety—nothing more.

Seeing the hurt in his eyes, Evelyn tightened her grip on her chopsticks. "I'm sorry. That was unfair."

"I won't pry into what you won't share." His voice lowered. "Everyone deserves their secrets."

Just as he had burdens he couldn't reveal.

Evelyn blinked. The domineering Ethan she knew now respected her boundaries.

"I'm an administrative assistant," she admitted softly. "Essentially a secretary."

He recalled her education history. For a high school dropout to reach this position spoke of relentless effort.

"Ever considered continuing your studies?" he asked suddenly. "It's not too late for college."

Evelyn nearly choked on her soup.

"No need." She set down her spoon. "Degrees mean nothing to me."

When the Jacksons reclaimed her, she'd already earned a PhD. Attending high school was merely her mentor's whim—abandoned after that incident.

Ethan grew stern. "You'll settle for a middle school credential forever?"

He didn't care, but he refused to let others mock her.

"What would a college degree change?"

"At least you wouldn't face ridicule."

Her gaze turned icy. "You're mistaken about something, Mr. Sullivan."

"Oh?"

"Even if we reconciled—which we haven't—you'd have no right to demand I change." She held his stare. "If my education shames you, find some Ivy League graduate instead."

Ethan's face hardened. "I only want what's best for you."

"I decide what's best for me." She stood abruptly. "I know exactly what I want."

The meal concluded in silence.

Outside, Evelyn declined his offer to drive her home. Arriving at MY's headquarters, she found Margaret waiting at the entrance.

"Evelyn. We need to talk."

###Chapter 220

Evelyn Sullivan had just stepped out of MY Fashion Group's building when Margaret Sullivan blocked her path.

"Miss Sullivan, a word."

Margaret wore dark sunglasses, her crimson lips pressed into a tight line, radiating an aura that warned others to keep their distance.

Inside the café, Margaret slid a check across the table.

"Five million. Enough to secure your future."

Evelyn glanced at it, her lips curling into a cold smile.

"Mrs. Sullivan, is that all your son is worth?"

Margaret ripped off her sunglasses, fury blazing in her eyes.

"Evelyn Sullivan! You nearly got Ethan killed, and now you dare haggle?!"

Evelyn took a sip of coffee, her expression calm.

"No one wanted that accident to happen."

"Stop pretending to be innocent!" Margaret slammed her hands on the table, standing abruptly. "Ever since he met you, Ethan's life has been nothing but chaos!"

Heads turned in the café.

Evelyn rose slowly, looking down at her.

"If you truly care about your son, why not ask him what he thinks?"

"You—!"

Margaret trembled with rage, her manicured nails digging into her palms.

"Don’t think I don’t know what you’re after! You just want to cling to the Sullivan family. Well, as long as I’m alive, you’ll never succeed!"

Evelyn walked away without looking back.

Margaret’s shrill voice followed her: "You’ll regret this!"

When Ethan arrived, he found his mother alone in the café, wiping away tears.

"Mom."

Margaret looked up, her eyes filled with disappointment.

"You finally show up? For that woman, you’d abandon your own mother?"

Ethan frowned.

"You shouldn’t have come to see her."

"I shouldn’t?" Her voice rose sharply. "She almost killed you! Ethan, have you lost your mind?!"

"That’s my business."

"Fine. Just fine!" Margaret stood on unsteady legs. "From now on, I don’t have a son!"

Ethan caught her arm.

"Mom, calm down."

"Let go!"

Watching his mother storm off, Ethan tugged at his tie in frustration.

His phone buzzed.

[Free tonight?]

Evelyn’s reply came quickly: [Plans with Sophia.]

Ethan stared at the screen for a long moment before typing a single word: [Okay.]

In her office, Evelyn set down her phone and gazed at the sunset.

Sophia Reynolds pushed the door open. "Daydreaming? Weren’t we supposed to go shopping?"

"Let’s go."

Evelyn grabbed her coat and tossed the crumpled check into the trash.

###Chapter 221

The phone screen lit up. Evelyn's fingers danced across the keyboard.

Sophia leaned in with a gleam of mischief in her eyes. "Evelyn, something's off with you. How many times is this now? Are you secretly seeing someone?"

Evelyn quickly locked the screen, her expression calm. "Just a client."

"Please. Who are you kidding?" Sophia rolled her eyes. "There's a new hot pot place opening tonight. Wanna go?"

"Sure."

After work, they stepped into the restaurant, the air thick with the spicy aroma of Sichuan peppercorns. The crimson broth bubbled violently as Sophia dipped a slice of tripe into the pot.

"So," Sophia began casually, "Ethan went all the way to Qingcheng to save you. How are you planning to thank him?"

Evelyn's chopsticks paused mid-air.

"A man like him lacks nothing."

"Except you." Sophia blinked. "Let's be real—he's still into you. When he heard you were in danger, his face went pale."

Evelyn stirred her dipping sauce, watching the chili oil swirl.

"Do you think... I should give him another chance?"

Sophia set her chopsticks down and met her gaze. "Honestly? As long as Isabella exists, there'll never be peace between you two. But..." She hesitated. "A man who'd risk his life for you? You might never find that again."

Evelyn rotated her glass, droplets sliding down the sides.

Through the steam, Sophia changed the subject to Alexander.

"He's been sending flowers to the office every day. So annoying."

"That fast? Already moved on?" Evelyn arched a brow.

Sophia scoffed. "Lily's too busy clinging to that film tycoon's son to care." She plucked a slice of beef from the pot. "Men. They only appreciate what they've lost."

The rising heat blurred Evelyn's vision. Memories surfaced—the stormy night in Qingcheng, Ethan kicking down the warehouse door, rain dripping from his jaw onto her face.

Outside the restaurant, a familiar Maybach idled by the curb.

"Sophia, go ahead without me," Evelyn said suddenly.

Once alone, she opened the car door. Ethan closed his file, the crisp white cuff of his shirt peeking out.

"Let me drive you."

Evelyn took a deep breath. "We need to talk."

The interior fell silent, their breaths audible. Ethan turned, his gaze piercing.

"Made up your mind?"

"Yeah." Her fingers tightened around her bag strap. "Let's end this."

###Chapter 222

Ethan Sullivan's fingers tightened on the steering wheel, his knuckles turning white.

"Is this your answer?"

Evelyn Sullivan lowered her lashes, sunlight casting fragmented shadows across her face through the window.

"I'm grateful you saved me. Truly."

Her voice was soft, like a feather brushing against the heart.

"But every time I try to get closer to you, Isabella's shadow appears."

Ethan's breathing hitched.

"That was just an accident."

"An accident?" Evelyn gave a bitter smile. "During the flood in Shili Village, if it hadn't happened, would you have cut the rope and jumped down to save me?"

The air in the car turned icy.

"If Isabella had been there, would you still have chosen me without hesitation?"

Ethan's pupils contracted sharply.

"That's not fair."

"I know." Evelyn lifted her gaze, her eyes glistening. "But I don't have the courage to gamble again."

Her fingertips absently traced the seatbelt.

"Three years was enough for me to face reality."

Ethan suddenly slammed his fist against the steering wheel.

"You won't even give me a chance?"

"It's not about you." Evelyn whispered. "It's me... I can't trust you anymore."

A heavy silence settled between them.

Finally, Ethan's voice turned frigid.

"Get out."

The moment Evelyn stepped out, the black Maybach shot forward like an arrow.

She stood still, watching the car disappear into the distance, a dull ache spreading through her chest.

As she turned away, a tear fell to the ground.

Daniel Sterling stood at the villa entrance, his face alarmingly pale.

"Evelyn!"

He rushed forward and pulled her into a tight embrace, his arms trembling.

"I'm sorry... I'm sorry..."

Warm droplets landed on her neck.

Evelyn froze.

"I'm fine." She gently patted his back. "Don't worry."

Daniel's voice cracked.

"I swear, I won't let you face danger again."

His grip was too tight, making Evelyn cough lightly.

"You should let go now..."

Daniel immediately released her, guilt flooding his eyes.

"Let me take you inside."

"No need." Evelyn shook her head. "You should rest too."

Watching him leave, she leaned against the door and exhaled deeply.

###Chapter 223

The night was ink-black. Daniel Sterling stood at the villa's entrance, his fingers brushing the velvet box in his pocket. He watched Evelyn Sullivan's weary silhouette, swallowing back the confession on his tongue.

"Goodnight."

Evelyn pushed the door open. Moonlight spilled through the floor-to-ceiling windows, the only light in the dark living room. She padded barefoot up the stairs, the wooden steps creaking softly beneath her.

Hot water washed away her exhaustion but not the hollow ache in her chest. Since rejecting Ethan Sullivan, all of Rongcheng seemed enchanted—they hadn’t crossed paths once.

Her desk at MY Fashion Group was buried under stacks of files. The vacancy left by Bianca Rose’s departure remained unfilled. The resumes Sophia Reynolds had brought gathered dust. Evelyn always lost focus by the third page.

On the eve of the design competition, the Ferguson mansion blazed with light. Evelyn arrived half an hour late, pushing open the door to Frank Ferguson’s startled gaze.

"Elia?"

A teacup rattled on its saucer. Frank’s eyes lingered on her bare fingers—where a designer’s ring should have been.

The meeting minutes still carried the warmth of the printer when handed to her. Evelyn skimmed the competition rules, then froze at the sharp clatter of a falling pen.

"Miss Sullivan objects to the anonymous judging?"

"Perfectly fair rules." She closed the folder, her silver bracelet slipping from her sleeve. "Just confirming the judges won’t be visible."

Frank’s gaze flicked to the rose tattoo on her collarbone. He knew that mark too well—three years ago at Paris Fashion Week, Elia’s breakthrough piece had borne the same emblem.

"Does your father know who you are?"

Cold perfume wafted as Evelyn stood. The hallway mirror reflected her impassive profile. "Pretend we never met tonight, Mr. Ferguson."

An engine’s roar startled nightingales from the trees. Fiona Ferguson stormed in on stilettos, her perfume clashing with the evening breeze.

"Dad! Was that Elia?"

Frank studied his daughter’s crumpled contestant pass, recalling rumors of the Sullivan family’s bankruptcy. The chandelier cast shifting shadows across his face. "Don’t expect any favors from the judges this year."

###Chapter 224

"You knew Elia is my idol, yet you didn't help me get her autograph!" Fiona Ferguson stomped her foot in frustration.

Frank Ferguson shot her a cold glare. "Keep complaining and I'll send you back to training. If you fail tomorrow's preliminary round, you'll regret it."

Fiona immediately fell silent.

The next morning, Evelyn Sullivan arrived punctually at the design competition venue.

The Ferguson Group had invested heavily in this event. They'd rented Sullivan Group's facilities and installed state-of-the-art surveillance systems. Every contestant's creative process would be live-streamed nationwide, with only participant numbers hidden from view.

Alongside anonymous judging by industry experts, thousands of designers would participate in online voting. This hybrid judging system made the competition particularly high-profile.

"You're the new assistant, right?" A staff member rushed over. "Take these water bottles to the contestants' lounge."

Before Evelyn could respond, the woman disappeared into the crowd.

Evelyn scanned the area but saw no other assistants.

The competition would begin in twenty minutes.

The lounge would close in ten. Contestants wouldn't be allowed to leave for three hours. Without water, they'd have to endure the entire session dehydrated.

Evelyn checked the wall clock and turned toward the stacked water bottles in the corner.

"Sis?"

The familiar voice made Evelyn freeze. She turned to see Isabella Jackson standing nearby, arm linked with Ethan Sullivan's.

After two weeks apart, Ethan seemed even colder, as if encased in ice.

Financial news had been filled with photos of Ethan escorting Isabella to galas. Clearly, after Evelyn's rejection, he'd returned to Isabella's side.

Evelyn expressionlessly resumed her task.

"Sis, are you that desperate for money?" Isabella hurried forward. "Let me lend you some."

"Move."

"I genuinely want to help." Isabella pouted. "It hurts seeing you do manual labor."

Evelyn smirked. "Worry about yourself."

She quickened her pace, but Isabella's theatrical voice followed. "Ethan, could you talk to the organizers—"

Ethan cut her off coldly. "The competition is starting."

"But Sis—"

"Isabella." His voice dropped dangerously. "Remember our agreement."

Watching Ethan walk away, Isabella clenched her fists.

For two weeks, she'd exploited that promise to make Ethan accompany her to business events. Jackson Group's profits had skyrocketed, and her father's attitude toward her had completely reversed.

But it wasn't enough.

She wanted far more than this.

###Chapter 225

Isabella Jackson knew this was nothing but an elaborate illusion.

Ethan Sullivan treated her with tenderness in public, yet privately refused to even meet her.

Her nails dug into her palms as a shadow flickered in her eyes.

It was all that bitch Evelyn Sullivan's fault!

Now she stood on the stage of the design competition while Evelyn could only work as a temp. This was the unbridgeable gap between them.

A smirk curled Isabella's crimson lips, her eyes gleaming with determination.

Winning the championship would prove to Ethan who truly deserved him.

Evelyn placed the water bottle down and left the lounge.

At the end of the hallway, Ethan was murmuring into his phone. She walked past him without a glance, heading straight for the judging room.

The moment the call ended, Ethan turned abruptly.

The sight of her slender back made his eyes darken.

"Mr. Sullivan!" A staff member hurried over. "Mr. Ferguson is waiting for you."

He withdrew his gaze, his Adam's apple bobbing. "Lead the way."

Inside the judging room, Evelyn settled into her private booth.

To prevent cheating, each judge was isolated in a sealed space, with phones temporarily confiscated.

When the screen lit up, Entry No. 48 appeared.

Her fingers danced across the keyboard, delivering a succinct critique.

"No. 48 features an innovative structure, but the gradient color scheme feels forced. Recommend transitioning within the same color family."

The live chat exploded.

"Elia's feedback is spot-on!"

"Only a top designer could pinpoint the flaw so effortlessly!"

As submissions poured in, the judges barely had time for lunch.

Evelyn worked with remarkable efficiency, finishing all evaluations by 3 p.m.

Rubbing her stiff neck, she stepped out of the venue—only to be stopped by Colin Keller.

"Ms. Sullivan," he whispered. "Mr. Sullivan is waiting for you."

###Chapter 226

Evelyn looked up at Colin with indifference. "What is it?"

Colin gave a slight bow. "Ms. Sullivan, Mr. Sullivan requests your presence."

She followed him to the CEO's office. Ethan stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, his tall frame as rigid as a pine tree.

"You wanted to see me?"

He turned, holding out a black card between his slender fingers.

"Take it."

Evelyn didn't move. Her gaze lingered on the card. "What's this for?"

"Use it whenever you need money." His voice was low. "No more carrying water bottles."

Realization dawned. A mocking smile curved her lips.

"No, thank you."

"Evelyn." His brows furrowed. "With your abilities, you could easily re-enroll in college."

"And then what?"

"At least you wouldn't be doing manual labor."

She let out a cold laugh. "Mr. Sullivan, I earn my keep honestly. What's the problem?"

"You could have better options."

"Better by your standards." She turned to leave. "My life isn't up for debate."

Ethan watched her go, his eyes darkening.

Back at the villa, Zoe was curled on the couch with a script.

"You're home early."

Zoe stretched. "Canceled an appearance. Exhausting." She leaned closer. "Join me for dinner tonight?"

"What's the occasion?"

"Mr. Laurier helped me last time. I should show my appreciation."

Evelyn nodded. "Fine. I'll change first."

Meanwhile, the preliminary results of the design competition were announced.

Isabella stared at her advancement notice without reaction. 92.6 points—a mediocre score.

Her phone rang. Victoria's excited voice came through. "Sweetheart, your father reserved Skyview Mansion to celebrate!"

"Okay."

After hanging up, Isabella dialed Ethan's number.

"Ethan, I advanced. Tonight—"

"Congratulations." He cut her off. "I have plans."

The dial tone echoed in her ear. She clenched her phone. In the past, no matter how busy, he'd attend her exhibitions.

Now, he couldn't even spare a proper congratulations.

###Chapter 227

Ethan Sullivan ended the call coldly without another word.

Isabella Jackson tightened her grip on the steering wheel, suppressing the turmoil in her chest as she drove toward Skyview Mansion.

The private dining room was brightly lit, with Victoria Farley and William Jackson unable to hide their delight. Charles Jackson had called specifically to praise Isabella for advancing to the semifinals.

"Isabella, you've made me so proud!" Victoria beamed. "At the mahjong table today, those society ladies turned green with envy when they heard the news!"

Isabella lowered her eyes with a modest smile. "Mom, it's just the preliminary round."

"With talent like yours, the championship is practically yours already!" Victoria lifted her chin proudly.

William chuckled. "If you win first place, I have a big surprise for you."

"Really? What is it?"

"Then it wouldn't be a surprise." He winked mysteriously.

Victoria slid the menu toward Isabella. "Order whatever you like. Tonight, we celebrate."

Just as Isabella finished selecting dishes, William's phone rang. He frowned at the caller ID.

"An important client. I'll take this outside."

Around the corner of the hallway, he answered to a panicked woman's voice. "William! The baby's fever spiked to 39 degrees!"

His face paled. "I'm on my way. Start cooling him down now!"

Back in the dining room, he grabbed his coat hastily. "A company emergency. Don't wait for me."

After he left, mother and daughter's conversation drifted to Evelyn Sullivan.

"Mom... there's something I don't know if I should mention..." Isabella hesitated.

Victoria's expression darkened. "What has she done now?"

"At the competition today... I saw her carrying bottled water." Isabella's voice trailed off.

Slap!

Victoria slammed the table and stood. "That disgrace!"

"Maybe we should give her some money so she doesn't have to—"

"Absolutely not!" Victoria yanked out her phone. "I'll deal with her myself!"

Isabella feigned concern. "Mom, she'll blame me..."

The phone rang eight times before being answered.

"What do you want?" Evelyn's icy voice came through.

Victoria exploded. "Evelyn Sullivan! You took a temp job at the design competition? Are you trying to humiliate our family?!"

###Chapter 228

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Did Isabella tell you that?"

Victoria sneered. "Who said it doesn't matter. How dare you stoop so low?!"

"Mrs. Farley, we severed ties long ago." Evelyn's voice remained calm. "What I do is none of your concern."

"You—!"

Victoria trembled with rage. Even after publicly cutting ties, the Jackson family still faced gossip.

"Quit that job immediately! Or don't blame me for what happens next."

"Suit yourself."

The call ended abruptly. Victoria nearly threw her phone across the room.

Isabella quickly handed her a cup of tea. "Mom, Evelyn will understand your good intentions someday."

"I don't care!" Victoria gritted her teeth. "I'll go to the competition tomorrow myself. Let's see how long she can keep up this arrogance!"

"But wouldn't that—"

"Focus on your own competition." Victoria cut her off. "This isn't your concern."

Meanwhile, Evelyn changed clothes and left with Zoe.

At Skyview Mansion's private dining room, Lucas had been waiting.

"Miss Zade, you don't mind if I invited one more friend, do you?" His smile held a hidden meaning.

Zoe suppressed the urge to roll her eyes. "Of course not."

When Ethan walked in, Zoe's expression darkened instantly.

"What's the meaning of this, Mr. Laurier?"

Lucas feigned surprise. "Do you have a problem with my friend?"

"You know exactly what happened between Evelyn and Mr. Sullivan!"

Ethan's cold voice interrupted. "If I'm unwelcome, I'll take my leave."

Lucas stood as well. "Then consider this dinner over."

"Wait." Evelyn stopped Zoe. "It's fine. I don't mind."

Zoe looked at her worriedly. "You don't have to force yourself."

"Really, it's okay." Evelyn smiled faintly. "It makes no difference who's here."

Lucas sat back down smoothly. "Now that's what I call grace under pressure."

Zoe shot him a glare and slammed the menu onto the table. "Let's order."

###Chapter 229

The private dining room was thick with suffocating tension.

Zoe Zade and Lucas Laurier exchanged forced small talk, attempting to lighten the mood. Ethan Sullivan and Evelyn Sullivan sat like two icebergs, silently eating without so much as glancing at each other.

Lucas stole a glance at Ethan and nearly laughed. The man had dropped everything to rush here the moment he heard Evelyn was coming, yet now pretended complete indifference.

Typical stubbornness.

When the bill arrived, Zoe and Lucas tactfully excused themselves first. Evelyn lingered behind, maintaining a careful three-step distance from Ethan.

At the corner near the exit, Ethan suddenly stopped.

"I apologize for this afternoon," he said, his voice low. "I won't interfere with your choices again."

Evelyn arched a brow. An apology? From him?

"Don't flatter yourself, Mr. Sullivan. I didn't give it a second thought."

"Evelyn!" A shrill shriek cut through the air.

Victoria Farley and Isabella Jackson stood nearby, faces twisted in shock. Victoria trembled with rage while Isabella glared daggers at Evelyn.

"What are you doing here?" Victoria demanded.

Evelyn gave them a frosty once-over. "None of your business."

Isabella quickly steadied Victoria, feigning concern. "Sister, I know you're working as a temp for the design competition. This place is expensive—are you..."

"You're working here?!" Victoria exploded. "Quit immediately! You're embarrassing the Jackson family!"

Evelyn smirked. Isabella's knife twisted so smoothly behind her mother's back.

Before she could retort, a tall figure stepped between them.

"Let's see who dares lay a finger on my wife," Ethan said, his voice glacial.

Victoria and Isabella paled.

"Ethan..." Isabella's eyes welled with tears. "You said you were busy today."

"Since when do I report my schedule to you?"

Isabella went sheet-white. Evelyn, however, laughed.

"Mr. Sullivan, we're divorced," she enunciated clearly. "Stop meddling in my affairs."

The words detonated like a bomb. Victoria and Isabella gaped in disbelief.

Ethan's aura turned murderous. "Evelyn!"

"I'll play along for Grandma's sake, but there's no need to act in front of them, is there?" Evelyn's lips curled in mockery. "The whole city knows you and Isabella are the real couple."

She turned to leave, but Ethan yanked her back.

The private room door slammed shut behind them.

Ethan pinned her against the door, his eyes dark with stormy fury.

"Are you that desperate to cut ties with me?"

###Chapter 230

Evelyn's lips curved slightly, but her eyes remained cold.

"Mr. Sullivan, you're the one rushing to sever ties. The divorce isn't even public yet, and you're already parading Isabella around. I'm just helping you along."

A flicker of confusion crossed her mind. Ethan hadn't told Isabella about their divorce?

That wasn't like him. The moment the papers were signed, she'd expected him to announce it to the world.

Ethan's expression darkened, the air around him turning icy.

"It's not what you think. I'll explain when the time is right."

Evelyn pushed him away with calm indifference.

"Don't bother. Your affairs are none of my concern."

She turned and walked out, only to be intercepted in the hallway by Isabella and Victoria.

Victoria's face was livid, her voice shrill. "What did you mean by 'divorce'?"

Evelyn didn't even glance at her.

"If you don't understand, Mrs. Farley, I suggest you consult a dictionary."

"You—"

Before Victoria could finish, Evelyn brushed past her.

Ethan emerged from the private room moments later, his presence radiating cold hostility.

Isabella, eyes red, blocked his path. "Ethan, you and Evelyn really...?"

"Remember our agreement," he cut in sharply. "If this leaks, the deal is off."

Isabella grabbed his sleeve desperately.

"If you're divorced now, why won't you give me a chance?"

His gaze turned razor-sharp, each word deliberate.

"What happens between Evelyn and me is none of your business. We ended years ago."

Isabella paled, stumbling back a step.

Victoria immediately stepped forward. "Mr. Sullivan, Isabella has waited for you all this time. Are you going to abandon her now?"

"We never got back together," Ethan scoffed. "How could I abandon her?"

He strode away, leaving the mother and daughter frozen in shock.

Victoria whirled on Isabella. "What's going on? He's been taking you to events all this time!"

Isabella bit her lip hard, tears welling.

"Mom, I need space..."

She fled, her retreating figure unsteady.

Victoria watched her daughter disappear, hatred for Evelyn burning deeper in her eyes.

Meanwhile, Evelyn walked out of the restaurant with Zoe.

Zoe glanced at her worriedly. "Are you okay, Evelyn?"

Evelyn shook her head. "I'm fine. In a city this size, we were bound to cross paths eventually."

Zoe finally relaxed.

Soon, the day of the national design competition semifinals arrived.

Isabella cornered Evelyn backstage, venom in her eyes.

"If you're divorced, stay out of our lives. You don't belong here!"

Evelyn didn't even look up.

"Instead of wasting time here, you should practice your mediocre designs."

Isabella's face twisted with rage.

"Didn't you see those water bottles? Move them to the lounge now! If you delay the competition, you'll regret it!"

###Chapter 231

Evelyn Sullivan walked away without looking back.

"Isabella Jackson! Stop right there!"

Isabella's shrill voice exploded behind her, but Evelyn didn't even pause.

Isabella trembled with rage, her nails digging into her palms. How dare that temp worker act so arrogantly!

Her cold gaze swept the lounge before landing on a water bottle. Each contestant's drink had a personalized label—including staff.

A vicious plan took shape in her mind.

When the semifinal began, Evelyn reviewed designs alone in the judging room. Gradually, her vision blurred, and her body burned.

She bit her lip hard. The metallic tang of blood filled her mouth. Someone had drugged her!

Struggling to stand, her legs felt like lead. She staggered toward the back door before collapsing onto a chaise.

As consciousness faded, strong arms lifted her. Instinctively, she wrapped around the man's neck, pressing a light kiss to his Adam's apple.

"Evelyn Sullivan, you asked for this."

His deep voice seemed distant. She only remembered being pinned against the door, consumed by searing kisses.

The delicate chime of a bracelet echoed sharply in the silent lounge.

Evelyn awoke covered by a thin blanket. Ethan Sullivan sat by the window, his expression unreadable in the backlight.

"My phone..."

Her voice was hoarse, cheeks burning. Those feverish images wouldn't leave her mind.

Ethan tossed her fresh clothes without turning. "Get dressed. We need to talk."

When the rustling stopped, he faced her. Evelyn had regained her usual composure—except for the blush still coloring her ears.

"What did you want to discuss, Mr. Sullivan?"

###Chapter 232

Ethan Sullivan turned, his dark gaze settling on Evelyn Sullivan's face.

"How do you plan to handle this?"

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly. After a moment of silence, she spoke. "Same as last time. Pretend nothing happened."

His eyes turned icy. He grabbed her wrist. "Evelyn, I'm not a charity."

"What do you want?"

She took a cautious step back.

Ethan released her and adjusted his cuff with deliberate slowness. "You're good. Why not make it a long-term arrangement?"

"What?"

"Just sex. No emotions." His voice was low. "Mutual benefit."

Evelyn let out a cold laugh. "You've got the wrong person. Isabella would be more than willing."

The air froze.

Ethan's eyes narrowed dangerously. "I'm not interested in her."

"Then why keep seeing her after the divorce?" Evelyn clenched her fists. "I'm not your plaything, Ethan."

He suddenly closed the distance, his breath hot against her ear. "You enjoyed it too."

Her ears burned. She shoved him away.

"I need time to think."

Ethan retreated, his expression indifferent. "Don't worry. It won't interfere with you finding someone else."

The words stung unexpectedly.

"Deal." She gritted her teeth. "But you stay out of my personal life."

His gaze darkened. "Fine."

Evelyn grabbed her bag and turned to leave, but he stopped her at the door.

"Eight tonight. Grandeur Hotel."

She paused mid-step and slammed the door behind her without looking back.

In the hallway, her phone buzzed incessantly. The design competition organizer sounded near tears. "Elia! The judges' livestream has been down for half an hour!"

Evelyn suddenly remembered she'd left the event midway.

"I'm on my way."

She hung up and checked the trending topic #EliaMissing. The comments were in chaos.

[Was she kidnapped?]
[I heard a fan rushed the stage!]

Rubbing her temples, Evelyn hurried back to the judges' panel.

Meanwhile, Ethan stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, phone in hand.

"It's done?"

"All surveillance footage has been erased." The voice on the line hesitated. "Isabella Jackson is here."

The door opened softly. Isabella stood there in her white competition dress, eyes shining.

"Ethan! You came to watch me, didn't you?"

Ethan turned. Ice filled his gaze.

"Lock the door," he told Colin. "No one comes in."

Isabella's smile froze.

###Chapter 233

Isabella's smile froze on her face.

She sensed the icy aura radiating from Ethan, her fingers trembling involuntarily.

"Ethan..."

As the private room door clicked shut, his cold gaze lifted to meet hers.

"Sit."

The moment she took her seat, he slid a glass of red wine toward her.

"Congratulations on passing the preliminaries."

Flustered, Isabella picked up the glass, her cheeks flushing pink.

"Thank you for your support, Ethan."

She drained the glass in one gulp, oblivious to the glacial glint in his eyes.

"Did you come here just to watch my competition?"

"No."

The wineglass thudded heavily against the table. Isabella's face paled.

"Then why—"

"I came for Evelyn."

"Why?!"

She shot to her feet, sending her glass shattering across the floor.

"What does she have that I don't?!"

Ethan's lips curled into a humorless smile as he tapped the table with long fingers.

"It seems I've been too lenient with you."

A sudden wave of dizziness hit Isabella. Her legs buckled.

"You—"

"An eye for an eye."

He stood, adjusting his cuffs with terrifying calm.

"Now you'll experience what you put Evelyn through."

Isabella staggered backward in horror, knocking over the coffee table.

"You can't do this to me!"

Ethan wrenched his arm free from her grasping hands, his voice arctic.

"I gave you chances."

The door swung open. Colin entered with an unfamiliar man.

Isabella shrieked, scrambling away.

"Ethan Sullivan! The Jacksons will destroy you for this!"

"My promise to you still stands." He strode out without looking back. "But this is Evelyn's justice."

A heavy thud echoed through the hallway.

"Someone jumped!"

Colin's face drained of color. "Mr. Sullivan! It's Miss Jackson!"

"Call an ambulance."

As the black Maybach pulled away from the venue, Colin glimpsed Ethan's expressionless profile in the rearview mirror.

This man could lift you to heaven with his tenderness.

Or freeze your blood with his ruthlessness.

Staccato heels clattered down the hospital corridor.

"Isabella!"

Victoria rushed to the bedside, her eyes welling at the sight of her daughter's cast-encased leg.

"Who pushed you off that building?"

Tears streamed down Isabella's face.

"It was Evelyn... She tried to kill me!"

###Chapter 234

Flames of fury ignited in Victoria Farley's eyes. "What on earth happened?!"

Isabella Jackson merely covered her face, shoulders trembling with silent sobs.

"I'm calling her right now!"

"No!"

Isabella grabbed Victoria's wrist, tears streaming down her face as she shook her head. "Mom, please don't ask... The design competition finals are coming up..."

She bit her lip, voice choked with emotion. "After the competition, I'll tell you everything."

Victoria wiped her daughter's tears away, heart aching. "Alright, I won't ask. Just rest."

The hospital door clicked softly shut.

"It must be Evelyn's doing!" Victoria hissed through clenched teeth. "That day at the competition, Isabella saw her working as a temp..."

William Sullivan frowned deeply. "Don't make accusations without proof."

"Ethan can't protect her now!" Victoria sneered. "They're divorced."

"What?!" William's eyes widened in shock.

"It's true. Evelyn admitted it herself."

William's expression darkened. He turned abruptly. "I have business at the office. Take care of Isabella."

Victoria watched his hurried departure, muttering under her breath. "Why is he always running off to work lately..."

Outside the hospital, William dialed Evelyn's number.

"You and Ethan divorced?"

A brief silence. Then, "What do you want?"

"Come home this weekend."

"Busy."

William suppressed his anger. "Since you're divorced, move back in."

Evelyn laughed softly. "Back to what? The piano room? Or the front doorstep?"

"You—"

"Mr. Jackson, that place was never my home."

The call ended with a decisive click.

William's face turned stormy. He immediately called his secretary. "Find out Evelyn's current address!"

Elm Cove Apartments.

Evelyn tossed her phone onto the sofa, fingers absently brushing her lips.

Images from the break room flashed through her mind, making her ears burn.

But just as quickly, her gaze turned icy.

The person who drugged her was still at large.

Isabella was the prime suspect, but the surveillance footage had been destroyed. She couldn’t have done it alone.

Who was really pulling the strings?

###Chapter 235

Evelyn Sullivan stared at her phone screen, her fingertips turning cold.

She quickly tapped open the chat with the black avatar.

[Track Scorpion's recent movements]

The reply came instantly: [Scorpion's vanished without a trace. This won't be easy.]

[Do your best.]

As the screen dimmed, she clenched her phone tighter.

The sound of running water stopped, and Zoe Zade burst into the room.

"Evelyn, look!"

A blurry video played on her phone.

Evelyn's pupils contracted sharply.

The figure leaping from the second floor—she'd recognize it even in ashes.

"Where did you get this?"

"Local trending hashtag!" Zoe leaned in. "Do you think your sister jumped because she got eliminated?"

Evelyn let out a cold laugh.

This wasn't Isabella Jackson's style.

After Zoe left, she immediately called Frank Ferguson.

"Mr. Ferguson, explain."

A weary sigh came through the line. "Miss Jackson jumped from Mr. Sullivan's private lounge."

Evelyn's breath hitched.

"She was delirious, tearing at her own clothes..." Frank hesitated. "Mr. Sullivan was there too."

Her fingers dug into her palms unconsciously.

Opening WhatsApp, she sent Ethan Sullivan a message: [Did Isabella do this today?]

After an agonizing wait, her phone finally vibrated.

[Yes.]

Evelyn called him directly.

"What did you do to her?"

Ethan's voice was icy. "An eye for an eye."

"What?"

"I gave her the same drug. Arranged a man." A pause. "She chose to jump instead."

A ringing filled Evelyn's ears.

"You... loved her, didn't you?"

Silence stretched on the other end.

Outside, pale moonlight streamed in, casting a sharp shadow across the floor.

###Chapter 236

The line fell silent for a few seconds before Ethan Sullivan's deep voice came through. "Do you truly not understand the reason, or are you pretending not to?"

Evelyn Sullivan's heart skipped a beat.

She tightened her grip on the phone, her tone icy. "Mr. Sullivan, don’t forget our agreement today."

The words were as much a reminder to him as a warning to herself.

Ethan chuckled softly. "I remember it perfectly well. That’s why I’m not asking for a response."

"I need to rest." Evelyn pressed her lips together. "Goodbye."

As she ended the call, she thought she heard a faint "Goodnight" from the other end.

She drew a deep breath, forcing herself to stay composed.

The next morning, Isabella Jackson's Weibo post exploded across trending searches.

Isabella Jackson V: Thank you for your concern. There was no foul play—just an accidental fall. To those spreading malicious rumors about me jumping off a building, please don’t believe or spread lies. I will continue competing in the design competition. Unless my hands are completely useless, I won’t give up on my dream of winning the championship!

As an internationally renowned designer, Isabella had amassed a massive following. Combined with the buzz around the competition, her post garnered over ten thousand comments within five minutes.

"Isabella was sketching designs with a high fever abroad until she collapsed!"

"She could’ve lived as a pampered heiress but chose to chase her dreams with talent instead. So inspiring!"

"Her first two rounds were breathtaking. The championship is hers for sure!"

Reading the flood of praise, Isabella smirked coldly.

Once she won the championship and took Brocade from Ethan, she’d deal with Evelyn at her leisure.

Evelyn scrolled through the post and scoffed.

The more flawless the persona, the harder the fall.

Her phone vibrated suddenly. Sophia Reynolds’ frantic voice came through. "Evelyn, MY’s fall collection is in trouble!"

"What happened?"

"My uncle cut costs by using substandard fabric. Now customers are complaining about fading and allergic reactions!"

Evelyn’s gaze turned sharp. "Tell Simon Reynolds to handle it!"

"He didn’t come to work today, and his phone’s unreachable."

Half an hour later, Sophia called back. "We found him. He claims he’s sick and hospitalized."

Evelyn sneered. "How convenient."

"What do we do? Protesters are gathering outside the company."

"Full refunds. Cover medical expenses for those with allergies. Recall the entire collection."

"But the company’s cash flow will collapse—"

"I’ll handle the finances."

After hanging up, the CFO hesitated. "Ms. Sullivan, MY is a bottomless pit at this point..."

"Get to the point."

"Instead of constantly filling the hole, we should consider filing for bankruptcy."

###Chapter 237

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her phone, her knuckles turning white.

"I understand. Handle the current tasks first. The funds will arrive within three days."

After hanging up, she opened her banking app. The 55 million Ethan had refused still sat untouched in her account.

MY Fashion Group needed 100 million to survive this crisis, but at least 200 million for a full recovery. Staring at the cold numbers on the screen, her brow furrowed.

The villa she'd received in the divorce settlement remained unsold. She needed another solution.

She dialed Vanessa Cruz.

"How much liquid capital does JM Couture have?"

Keyboard clicks sounded through the phone.

"Boss, we currently have 30 million available."

"Transfer 20 million to my account."

After ending the call, Evelyn retrieved a black embossed card from the depths of her safe, her fingers tracing its surface.

In the bank's VIP lounge, the manager personally served her tea.

"Miss Sullivan, how much would you like to withdraw?"

"125 million."

When the transfer confirmation chimed, the manager discreetly stepped out to make a call.

With the funds secured, Evelyn arranged to meet Sophia Reynolds at the hospital.

The hospital door stood slightly ajar, Simon Reynolds' booming voice carrying through.

"What's the company's status?"

Evelyn pushed the door open with a cold laugh.

"Since you're so concerned about the company, Director Reynolds, why not return and see for yourself?"

Simon hastily lowered his crossed legs from the hospital bed, beads of sweat forming on his forehead.

"P-President Sullivan! What brings you here?"

"I heard you were gravely ill and came to check on you." Evelyn's gaze sharpened like a blade. "But illness doesn't absolve responsibility."

Simon's face darkened. "What do you mean?"

"Premium fabric prices on the purchase orders, yet substandard materials delivered. Who pocketed the difference?" Evelyn turned to Sophia. "Show him the evidence."

Sophia slammed a file onto the hospital bed. "This is embezzlement, Uncle!"

Simon skimmed the documents and suddenly laughed. "You think this proves anything?"

###Chapter 238

"Mr. Reynolds, these purchase orders bear your personal signature."

Simon Reynolds reclined on the hospital bed, a faint smirk playing on his lips. "The signatures are indeed mine. But that only proves I approved the procurement requests. The funds were transferred through company accounts—what does that have to do with me personally? Even if someone embezzled, that's the purchasing department's problem."

Evelyn Sullivan tapped the documents lightly with her fingertips. "So you're determined to deny everything?"

"Why should I admit to something I didn't do?" Simon spread his hands. "My annual bank statements are all traceable. Feel free to investigate if you don't believe me."

"Oh, I will." Evelyn closed the file. "But until everything is clarified, I suggest you stay in the hospital and rest. No unnecessary outings."

A mocking smile appeared on Simon's face. "Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere."

The money had long been laundered clean. He'd like to see what tricks Evelyn could possibly uncover.

"We'll see."

As the elevator doors opened, a shrill voice rang out behind her. "Evelyn Sullivan!"

Evelyn turned to see Victoria Farley standing in the corridor, clutching a thermal lunchbox, eyes blazing with fury.

"Can I help you, Mrs. Farley?"

"How dare you ask?" Victoria charged forward. "Look what you've done to Isabella! You're coming with me right now to kneel and apologize!"

Evelyn stepped back, avoiding her grasping hands. "What happened to Isabella?"

"Stop pretending!" Victoria's voice rose sharply. "She jumped off a building because of you! You were jealous of her entering the design competition, so you framed her!"

"That's what she told you?" A trace of derision flashed in Evelyn's eyes.

"She didn't need to! I've always known you were wicked at heart!"

Evelyn had long given up explaining. In Victoria's eyes, Isabella could do no wrong, while Evelyn was always at fault.

Seeing her indifference, Victoria grew even angrier. "Apologize to her now!"

"What do I owe her?" Evelyn scoffed. "If anything, she owes me."

"Lies!"

"Isabella jumped because Ethan Sullivan gave her a taste of her own medicine after she drugged me. She had no way out."

Victoria grabbed her wrist. "You just stood by and let Ethan do that to your own sister?!"

Evelyn shook her off. "I used to think you were just biased. Now I see you have no sense of right and wrong."

"Evelyn Sullivan!"

"I've repaid any debt I owed you long ago." Evelyn enunciated each word clearly. "Tell Isabella that if she dares cause more trouble, I'll leave her with nothing."

Victoria froze in place as Evelyn turned and stepped into the elevator.

Inside the hospital room, Sophia Reynolds looked at her uncle with disappointment. "Uncle Simon, the company's annual dividends are substantial. Why would you do this?"

Simon's face darkened. "Whose side are you on? I'm your own uncle!"

"I stand with the truth, not family ties." Sophia gave a bitter smile. "Did you think about us being family when you took those kickbacks?"

"How dare you accuse me!" Simon slammed his hand against the bed. "Show me the evidence if you have any!"

"If you admit it now, there might still be time—"

"Get out!"

Evelyn had just exited the hospital when her phone rang.

###Chapter 239

"Ms. Sullivan, we have a buyer willing to purchase your villa in full. The contract is ready. Are you available to come sign it now?"

Evelyn Sullivan paused while organizing her files, surprise flickering in her eyes.

"That fast?"

"Yes. The buyer didn’t even negotiate the price—just paid the deposit immediately."

After hanging up, she texted Sophia Reynolds and hurriedly hailed a cab to Grand View Villas.

The agent called three more times during the ride, growing increasingly excited with each call.

"Ms. Sullivan, this buyer is incredibly decisive. They didn’t even check the property deed before agreeing to sign!"

A faint unease settled in Evelyn’s chest.

When she pushed open the villa’s front door and saw the tall figure standing by the floor-to-ceiling windows, realization struck.

"Ethan?"

The man turned. His suit was immaculate, his tie perfectly knotted beneath his Adam’s apple.

"Long time no see."

The agent rubbed his hands together. "Oh, you two know each other? Then the contract—"

"Deal’s off."

Evelyn spun on her heel and walked out, her heels clicking sharply against the marble floor.

Ethan caught up in a few strides, gripping her wrist.

"Reason?"

"You know why." She yanked her hand free. "You gave me this place in the divorce. Now you want to buy it back? Playing games with me?"

He suddenly leaned in, his warm breath brushing her ear.

"Remember what you said by the pool that night?"

Her ears burned.

"Disgusting!"

"I’m just stating facts." He straightened, his gaze unwavering. "You’ll come back eventually."

"In your dreams!" Her chest heaved with anger. "I’ll list it with another agency tomorrow!"

Ethan adjusted his cuffs leisurely. "Go ahead and try."

Three days later, she finally understood his meaning—every agency she contacted turned her down the next day.

A ringing phone interrupted her thoughts.

"Ms. Elia, we’d like to invite you to the design competition’s award ceremony—"

"Not interested."

Hanging up, she massaged her temples and pushed open Sophia’s office door.

"Hot pot?"

Sophia looked up from her paperwork. "Perfect timing. These reports are driving me insane."

They chose a trendy new hot pot restaurant. The moment they stepped inside, they ran into Alexander King and Lucas Laurier exiting a private room.

Sophia immediately turned to leave, but Alexander had already spotted them.

###Chapter 240 

"What a coincidence, sis-in-law!" Alexander King's voice rang out behind her.

Evelyn Sullivan paused mid-step but continued walking without turning around.

Sophia Reynolds whirled around with a cold smirk. "Move aside, Mr. King. You're blocking our way."

Alexander's smile froze, pain flickering in his eyes.

Lucas Laurier stifled a laugh and muttered under his breath, "Serves you right for trampling on her feelings."

"Shut up," Alexander growled through clenched teeth. "That actress you're chasing hasn't given you the time of day either."

"Not the same." Lucas waved his phone triumphantly. "At least she texts me back."

Alexander rolled his eyes, but before he could retort, Lucas had already dialed Ethan Sullivan's number.

"Guess who we ran into at the hot pot place?"

A beat of silence.

"Evelyn's here," Lucas drawled deliberately. "Looks upset. Ordering drinks..."

"Send me the address."

Hanging up, Lucas shot Alexander a smug look. "Take notes."

Meanwhile, Sophia had poured them both generous glasses.

"Drink up, Evelyn." Her eyes were red-rimmed. "To surviving the storm. And to finally seeing certain people for who they really are."

Evelyn silently raised her glass, watching Sophia's trembling fingers.

Two drinks in, Sophia's words began slurring as she listed Alexander's countless faults. Evelyn rested her chin on her palm, the world around her blurring.

When Ethan arrived, he found two women slumped drunkenly over the table.

"What happened?" His brow furrowed.

Lucas shrugged. "Who knew they'd be such lightweights?"

Ethan strode forward and scooped Evelyn into his arms. She squirmed, pressing her flushed cheek against his cool suit jacket with a contented sigh.

"Stay still," he warned lowly.

Evelyn blinked up at him through hazy eyes, then suddenly poked his sharp jawline. "You're... really pretty..."

Ethan froze, his gaze darkening.

"See Sophia home," he ordered without looking back, carrying Evelyn away.

In the car, intoxicated fingers fumbled with buttons. Ethan caught her wrist, voice rough. "Behave."

"Hot..." she whined, eyes glistening.

His Adam's apple bobbed as he slammed the partition button. "Drive faster."

Cool autumn air slipped through the cracked window. Curled against him, Evelyn murmured unconsciously, "Ethan..."

His arms tightened around her.

###Chapter 241

Evelyn blinked her bleary eyes and shook her head in confusion. "No, my home is in Elm Cove. I need to go back."

"That's Daniel Sterling's house!" Ethan's voice turned icy. "It has nothing to do with you!"

Had he not confirmed Daniel was away filming, he would never have allowed her to stay there.

"Nonsense!" Her voice cracked with sudden emotion, eyes reddening. "That is my home! That cold mausoleum called Grand View isn't home!"

Ethan had never seen her this vulnerable. His tone softened involuntarily. "Why would you say that? You lived at Grand View for three years."

"Three years means nothing!" A sob escaped her throat. "Thirty years wouldn't make it home! Besides... Ethan Sullivan and I are divorced!"

"Divorced?" His pupils constricted. "Not in this lifetime!"

Slap!

Evelyn's palm connected sharply with his cheek.

"Disgusting mosquito! Your buzzing hurts my ears! Stay away!"

Ethan's face darkened.

She scooted toward the car door, squinting at him. "Though this mosquito is quite handsome... just too fierce-looking."

"Evelyn Sullivan!"

Her eyes widened in terror. "The mosquito can talk?! It knows my name!" She flailed her arms wildly. "Back off! I'm a black belt! Hah!"

Regret twisted Ethan's gut. He should've let Lucas take her home.

Thud!

Her head hit the window with a dull crack.

"Oww..."

Ethan yanked her into his arms, massaging the injured spot with surprising gentleness. After feeble resistance, she went limp.

The nightmare came swiftly—a giant mosquito chasing her relentlessly until it morphed into Ethan's face, whispering horrifically: "I'll make you bear a swarm of baby mosquitoes!"

"Ahh!"

Evelyn jolted awake in Grand View's master bedroom. Her last memory was sharing hotpot with Sophia before two drinks erased everything.

Running water sounded from the bathroom. As she moved to rise, a shocking realization struck—she was completely naked. Clothing littered the floor, including her lace bra and a pair of black men's briefs.

Her breath hitched. Had she...?

The bathroom door swung open. She turned away hastily, feigning composure. "You should leave. I need rest. We'll... talk another time."

Ethan froze mid-towel-dry, eyes turning glacial. "Evelyn Sullivan. Repeat that."

###Chapter 242

Ethan Sullivan's voice was laced with frost, each syllable carrying a biting chill.

Evelyn Sullivan's spine stiffened instantly. As she turned, the belt of her bathrobe nearly whipped across Ethan's face. Recognition flickered in her eyes.

"How did you get in?"

His lips curled into a mocking smile. "Did I interrupt something important?" He took a step forward. "Or were you expecting someone else?"

Evelyn averted her gaze.

He seized her chin, forcing her to meet his eyes. "Answer me."

She slapped his hand away, the collar of her robe slipping slightly. "Your memory fails you, Mr. Sullivan. We agreed not to interfere in each other's lives." She adjusted her robe. "Who I wait for is none of your concern."

Ethan's eyes darkened, and a low chuckle escaped him.

"You're right." He leisurely undid his cufflinks. "I overstepped."

As Evelyn turned to leave, he pinned her against the wall.

The minty kiss stole her breath. Only when his scorching palm pressed against her lower back did she shove him away, gasping.

"Enough," she said, voice unsteady. "We're done for tonight."

Ethan arched a brow. "What exactly do you think just happened?"

Following her gaze to the scattered clothes on the floor, realization dawned. "You vomited on me. I just changed."

Evelyn finally noticed the faint scent of alcohol lingering in the air.

"Move. I need to shower."

"Together."

Before she could protest, he swept her into his arms. Skin met skin, sending a shiver through them both.

As water rose to her collarbone in the tub, Evelyn's ears burned red. "Get out!"

Ethan shrugged off his robe with one hand. "Might as well wash again."

His kiss was relentless, demanding. Evelyn resisted at first, but soon melted under his touch. Water sloshed over the tub's edge, splattering onto the tiles.

When he carried her back to bed, even her fingertips were flushed pink.

"Your hair's still wet," he said, reaching for the hairdryer.

Evelyn buried her face in the pillow. "Leave."

The warm air lulled her toward sleep—until the mattress dipped. She opened her eyes to find Ethan's intense gaze.

"Go to the guest room," she said coldly.

His expression hardened. "Throw me away after using me?"

She pulled the covers higher. "Don't forget, Mr. Sullivan. Ours is strictly a transactional relationship."

###Chapter 243

The air turned icy.

Ethan Sullivan's gaze was frigid, but Evelyn Sullivan met it with equal defiance. Neither would back down, and the bedroom temperature seemed to plummet.

Bang!

Ethan stormed out, the roar of his engine fading into the night.

Evelyn lay in bed, wide awake.

At dawn, she headed straight to the design competition venue.

"Sis?"

Isabella Jackson limped toward her, leaning on Victoria Farley's arm. Her smile was saccharine, but malice lurked in her eyes.

Evelyn ignored her.

"Disgraceful!" Victoria hissed through clenched teeth.

"Don't upset yourself, Mom," Isabella murmured. "What can you expect from someone raised in the countryside?"

Slap! Slap!

The sharp sound of two strikes echoed through the hall.

Isabella clutched her cheeks, stunned.

"Evelyn!" Victoria shrieked, raising her hand.

Evelyn caught her wrist in a vice grip. "Insult my foster parents again, and I'll make the Jacksons regret it."

"You?" Victoria sneered. "Ethan already threw you away!"

"Oh?" Evelyn's lips curved. "At Skyview Mansion, he didn't even spare you a glance."

Victoria's face darkened.

Isabella tugged her sleeve. "Mom, the competition's starting."

Inside the judging room, Evelyn had barely sat down when her phone rang.

"Have you seen my tie?" Ethan's voice came through the receiver.

###Chapter 244

"The password hasn't changed. You can check it yourself," Evelyn Sullivan said coolly.

"Fine."

The final round's theme was evening gown design, giving contestants ample creative freedom.

Designers worked with unprecedented focus, taking noticeably longer to complete their sketches. The first submission appeared on the judges' screens only after ninety minutes.

A black velvet slip dress with a V-neckline and delicate chain belt exuded effortless elegance in its simplicity.

Evelyn swiftly assigned scores and comments before uploading her evaluation.

Inside the venue, designers remained engrossed in their creations.

Isabella Jackson, her cast and crutches drawing frequent camera attention, crafted a rose-pink strapless gown. Twenty layers of tulle cascaded in a high-low hemline, the cinched waist lending ethereal movement.

Social media erupted instantly.

【This dress is everything! Mass-produce it NOW!】
【Isabella's got this in the bag. Crown her already!】
【Designing on crutches? Queen behavior!】

Isabella's follower count skyrocketed as official accounts flooded with praise.

Another hour passed before all submissions were finalized. Judges began scoring each entry individually.

Evelyn's efficiency proved staggering—she completed evaluations in under sixty minutes. While hailing a cab outside, Frank Ferguson's call interrupted her departure.

"Ms. Sullivan, I heard you've finished judging all entries?"

"Correct. Anything else?"

A pause. "There's something you should know... Isabella Jackson is competing."

"And?"

"Current scores indicate she'll likely win."

Evelyn chuckled. "Not my concern."

The disconnected line left Frank sighing at his assistant. "Proceed with the original announcement."

Isabella ultimately claimed victory with 92.5 points. Victoria Farley immediately phoned William Jackson, demanding he spread the news to their entire social circle.
###Chapter 245

William Jackson's face glowed with excitement as he immediately instructed the butler to prepare a celebration banquet for that evening.

[Oh my god! Isabella actually won!]
[She's the pride of our domestic design industry!]
[But honestly, her work still lacks the depth of Elia's peak-era creations.]
[What do you know? Elia's been retired for years. Give Isabella time and she'll surpass her!]

The online debate grew increasingly heated.

Isabella stared at her phone screen, a cold smirk playing on her lips. She quickly typed out a Weibo post: "Elia will always be my role model. I wouldn't dare compare myself to her."

The humble statement instantly garnered countless likes.

"Mom, let's invite Evelyn tonight," Isabella suddenly suggested.

Victoria Farley's expression darkened. "Why would we invite her? Hasn't she done enough to hurt you?"

Memories of Evelyn's actions made Victoria's chest heave with anger.

"We're still family," Isabella murmured, fingers tracing the scar on her leg, her eyes glinting with something dark. "I want her to see how far I've come."

Victoria squeezed her daughter's hand. "You're too kind for your own good."

"By the way, did you get Elia's autograph?" Victoria lowered her voice. "All the society ladies will be there tonight..."

Isabella's fingers twitched.

"I'll try again," she forced a smile.

Victoria excitedly planned her outfit for the evening—tonight, the world would see what an exceptional daughter she'd raised!

Meanwhile, Evelyn Sullivan had just stepped through her front door when the design competition results notification arrived.

Her phone rang abruptly.

"I heard Isabella won?" Victoria's voice crackled through the receiver.

"And?" Evelyn's tone remained calm.

###Chapter 246

"You must come home for tonight's party."

Victoria Farley's voice was icy, as if Evelyn Sullivan owed her millions.

Evelyn arched a brow and refused outright. "I'm busy."

"Evelyn!"

Victoria's furious roar came through the phone. "If it weren't for Isabella wanting to reconcile, do you think I'd invite you? Working as a temp—how embarrassing for the Jacksons!"

Evelyn nearly laughed. Afraid she'd disgrace them, yet insisting she attend. Victoria's logic was truly something.

"If you're worried about embarrassment, don't invite me."

She hung up decisively, leaving Victoria seething.

Soon, a text arrived from Isabella.

[Too scared to come home, sister? Afraid you'll pale in comparison?]

[Don't feel bad. After all those years in the countryside, it's natural you can't keep up.]

[If I were you, I'd leave Ethan voluntarily. Save him the shame.]

Evelyn skimmed the messages and didn't bother replying.

Night fell, and the Jackson mansion blazed with light.

Isabella sat in a wheelchair, a champagne gown artfully concealing her injured leg. Her hair was elegantly coiffed, her makeup subtle—the picture of grace.

"Victoria, you're so lucky to have such an accomplished daughter!"

"If my child had half of Isabella's talent, I'd die happy!"

"Whoever marries her will be blessed!"

Victoria couldn't hide her pride, though she feigned modesty. "She's worked hard. Oh, she got those autographs you wanted."

"No way! Elia's actual signature?!"

Victoria nodded smugly, distributing them. "Only because Isabella knows her personally."

"Is Elia male or female? How old?"

"Isabella and Mr. Sullivan are perfect for each other. They'll definitely marry!"

Isabella basked in the praise, demure. "Elia's a woman in her forties. Very down-to-earth."

Just then, a commotion erupted at the entrance.

Everyone turned to see Fiona Ferguson gliding in, resplendent in white. She'd placed third in the design competition—acquainted with Isabella, but not close.

A matron rushed forward. "Fiona! Where's your mother?"

###Chapter 247

"She's not feeling well today. She's resting upstairs."

Fiona Ferguson's gaze locked onto the signature in Mrs. Wang's hand, her pupils contracting sharply.

"Is... is this Elia's autograph?!"

She had once begged her father for Elia's signature, only to be sternly forbidden from approaching the renowned designer. Now, seeing the coveted signature right before her eyes, Fiona's fingers trembled slightly.

Mrs. Wang smiled and handed it over. "Saves me a trip to deliver it to you."

"Oh my God! Mrs. Wang, how did you get this?"

"Isabella Jackson helped me obtain it." Mrs. Wang gestured toward Isabella.

Fiona immediately turned to Isabella, her eyes shining with admiration. "Thank you so much! And congratulations on winning the championship!"

Isabella inclined her head gracefully. "You were brilliant too. Third place is impressive."

Fiona's demeanor warmed instantly. "My father told me to learn from you!"

"We can learn from each other." Isabella's lips curved slightly, her gaze flickering.

Fiona suddenly leaned in, lowering her voice. "How do you know Elia? She's my idol!"

"At a design exhibition abroad." Isabella's fingers absently traced the rim of her champagne flute. "I didn't expect her to be a judge for this competition."

"Will she be here tonight?" Fiona couldn't hide her eagerness.

Isabella shook her head. "Her schedule is packed."

"Then... do you have any photos of her?" Fiona pressed.

"She doesn't like being photographed." Isabella averted her eyes.

Mrs. Wang interjected, "People our age aren't fond of taking pictures."

Fiona froze.

"Your age?"

She distinctly remembered the youthful figure she'd glimpsed earlier.

Isabella's glass wobbled suddenly, champagne nearly spilling.

"Of course. We met after the competition today." Her voice was strained.

Fiona's eyes turned icy.

"You're lying!"

Nearby guests turned to look.

Mrs. Wang quickly grabbed her arm. "Fiona!"

Fiona shook her off, her voice ringing clearly across the banquet hall. "I've seen Elia. She's definitely not older than twenty-five!"

###Chapter 248

Isabella's fingers trembled slightly, but she forced herself to straighten her spine.

She lifted her chin, her voice deliberately steady. "Miss Ferguson, I don't know why you're slandering me. Elia is indeed in her forties. We met at a café just last week."

Victoria immediately stepped forward, shielding her daughter. "Miss Ferguson, mind your words. The Jacksons won't tolerate being bullied."

Fiona curled her lips in disdain.

"How interesting." She leisurely pulled out her phone. "Before the competition results were announced today, we were all in the lounge. Elia left the venue at two. So tell me, Miss Jackson, how exactly did you meet her?"

A cold sweat broke out on Isabella's back.

She clenched her skirt, her eyes suddenly reddening. "Miss Ferguson, are you targeting me just because I won first place?"

Fiona scoffed and tossed the autographed photo onto the floor.

"Why would I envy a fraud?" Her voice rose sharply. "You've been parading around using Elia's name—it's an insult to designers!"

The banquet hall fell silent.

"What proof do you have?" Isabella's voice shook. "Are you just making baseless accusations?"

"Proof?" Fiona arched a brow. "The judges for this competition were personally invited by my father. Should I call Elia right now to confirm?"

The guests' expressions shifted instantly.

Victoria's face darkened as she grabbed her daughter's arm. "Isabella, explain yourself!"

Someone in the crowd suggested, "The manager of JM Couture must know Elia. Why not call and ask?"

Isabella's nails dug into her palms.

Seeing her daughter's ashen face, Victoria's heart sank.

But Fiona had already dialed the number.

"Manager Cruz, someone claims Elia is in her forties and is carrying a fake autograph..."

A clear voice came through the phone. "Elia is only twenty-six. Who's impersonating her?"

Gasps rippled through the room.

Fiona hung up and smirked at the deathly pale Isabella. "Miss Jackson, care to explain now?"

Isabella bit her lip hard, her eyes burning with hatred.

Victoria's card-playing friends exchanged meaningful glances.

The banquet hall was so quiet you could hear a pin drop.

###Chapter 249

Fiona Ferguson broke the silence first. "Please enjoy the rest of the evening. I'll take my leave now."

Aunt Wang quickly smoothed things over. "Young people care about their pride. Let's talk about something else."

The banquet hall gradually regained its warmth, but both Victoria Farley and Isabella Jackson knew they'd been thoroughly humiliated tonight.

After the last guest departed, Victoria turned and slapped Isabella across the face.

"Mom!"

Isabella clutched her cheek, eyes wide with shock and hurt.

William Jackson stepped forward. "Have you lost your mind?"

Victoria sneered. "She forged Elia's signature and made me the laughingstock of the entire event. This is the daughter you raised!"

"What signature?" William looked utterly confused.

After hearing the full story, he fell silent for a moment. "Isabella, don't take it to heart."

He grabbed his coat. "I have work at the office. I won't be back tonight."

The moment the door closed, the hurt in Isabella's eyes twisted into something darker.

Her phone buzzed. Lily White's name flashed on the screen.

"Congratulations on winning!" came the cheerful voice.

Isabella forced a smile. "Thanks. How's filming going?"

"Not bad. Things should pick up even more after the new drama airs."

After hanging up, Isabella stared at her chat history with Ethan Sullivan.

An entire day had passed without a single word of congratulations from him.

Her grip on the phone tightened until her nails dug into her palms.

If she was going down, she'd drag that wretched couple with her.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Sullivan had just finished drying her hair when her phone rang.

Sophia Reynolds' voice bubbled with excitement. "Evelyn, I've got some juicy gossip for you!"

###Chapter 250

"What did you say?"

"At Isabella's celebration banquet last night, she actually gave out forged signatures from Elia as gifts. She got caught red-handed—it was absolutely humiliating!"

Evelyn's grip on her phone tightened. She never expected Isabella would dare to forge her signature and shamelessly pass it off as genuine.

"That must have been awkward."

"Had I known it would be this entertaining, I would've gone to witness it myself."

Evelyn chuckled. "Is your work done?"

Silence filled the other end of the line.

Three seconds later, the call disconnected abruptly.

Evelyn tossed her phone onto the nightstand and turned off the light.

The Jacksons' drama had nothing to do with her.

The next morning, the doorbell rang urgently.

William stood outside, impeccably dressed in a suit but unable to hide the agitation in his eyes.

"Mr. Jackson, what brings you here?" Evelyn held her bag, her tone icy. "I have to get to the office."

William frowned, barely containing his temper. "I heard you divorced Ethan?"

"Yes."

"Since it's over, move back home. Not many knew about your marriage anyway. I’ll arrange suitable matches for you soon."

Evelyn’s pupils contracted slightly as she stared at him in disbelief.

"I’m not going back."

"Nonsense!" William raised his voice sharply. "You have no one to rely on now. Where else would you go?"

"The Jacksons were never my home." She enunciated each word. "My life is none of your concern."

William’s face darkened. "I’m doing this for your own good!"

"For my good, or for Jackson Group’s benefit?" Evelyn sneered. "Haven’t you schemed enough over the years?"

"You—"

"If you keep harassing me, I won’t hesitate to tell Victoria everything."

William paled instantly. "What do you know?"

Evelyn strode toward the elevator without another glance.

Even after her red sports car disappeared around the corner, William remained rooted in place, cold sweat trickling down his back.

There was no way she knew about that... Absolutely impossible!

In the conference room, Evelyn shut a folder with a cold expression.

Sophia followed her into the office.

"What happened?"

"Nothing." Evelyn massaged her temples. "Get to the point."

Sophia handed her a report. "The losses from that batch of substandard fabric exceed ten million."

"Have Legal draft an agreement to deduct it from his year-end dividends." Evelyn’s gaze sharpened. "Take it to the hospital and make him sign it."

"He might refuse."

"Then suspend him."

Before lunch, Simon kicked open the CEO’s office door.

Files slammed onto the desk.

"Evelyn Sullivan! What the hell is this?"

"You signed the approval, so you’re liable." She lifted her eyes, her stare cutting like a blade. "This company isn’t a charity."

###Chapter 251

"I will never sign this contract!"

Simon Reynolds slammed the document onto the desk, his face dark with fury.

Evelyn Sullivan remained unfazed, her fingers lightly tapping the table.

"Then you may go home and reconsider, Mr. Reynolds. Return only when you're ready to compensate the company for its losses."

"Evelyn Sullivan!" He shot up from his seat, slamming his palms on the desk. "Do you really think I'm afraid of you?"

She lifted her gaze, a cold smirk playing on her lips.

"Of course not. If you disagree with my decision, we can settle this in court."

The office fell into heavy silence.

Simon's face twisted with rage before he finally spat through clenched teeth, "You'll regret this!"

The door slammed shut with enough force to rattle the glass.

Evelyn didn't even blink, calmly turning the page of the file in her hands.

By evening, Ethan Sullivan's call came through.

"Grandmother knows about the divorce. Come to Harmony Manor tonight."

Her fingers tightened around the phone. "Alright."

Under the night sky, Harmony Manor glowed with warm lights.

Evelyn hadn't expected to see Margaret and Henry Sullivan in the living room. Absent during their wedding, they'd made sure to appear for the divorce.

Adrian Sullivan sat quietly beside the elderly matriarch, detached from the scene.

"My dear, is it really..." The old woman's voice trembled.

Evelyn gave a slight nod. "Yes."

"It's Ethan's loss..." The grandmother sighed deeply.

Margaret suddenly sneered. "Good riddance! Ethan deserves better. Isabella Jackson would be perfect—she just won the national design competition—"

"Mother!" Ethan's voice cut sharply through the air. "Stay out of my affairs!"

"If you weren't my son, I wouldn't bother!" Margaret trembled with anger.

"I've said it before—there will never be anything between Isabella and me."

"Are you trying to kill me with this stubbornness?!"

The elderly woman struck the armrest with force. "Enough! This is between them. You have no say!"

Margaret clenched her jaw, her expression sour.

The truth had been clear to the grandmother since that incident at the resort—when Ethan chose Isabella over Evelyn, the marriage was already doomed.

"What's done is done. I won't dwell on it." The matriarch scanned the room. "I called you here for another matter."

Margaret tensed.

"Now that Adrian has returned, it's time he joined Sullivan Group to gain experience."

"Absolutely not!" Margaret shot to her feet.

The old woman's gaze turned razor-sharp. "This isn't a request."

"Ethan has always managed Sullivan Group. Throwing Adrian into the mix will only unsettle the shareholders!"

"Adrian has every right to his share!" The grandmother's voice rose sharply.

If not for that accident years ago...

She turned to Ethan. "What do you think?"

###Chapter 252

Ethan Sullivan gave a curt nod. "As you wish."

"Then it's settled. Adrian will report to Sullivan Corporation tomorrow."

The elderly Mrs. Sullivan rubbed her temples as she stood. "I'm rather tired. You should all retire early tonight. Evelyn, come with me."

Evelyn followed the matriarch into the bedroom. The moment the door closed, she heard the old woman sigh. "Is there truly no chance of reconciliation?"

Her fingers tightened. "Grandmother, our issues weren't created overnight."

"But I can see Ethan genuinely cares for you now."

Evelyn's breath hitched, her nails digging into her palms.

"That's just possessiveness talking." She shook her head with a bitter smile. "Like a child throwing tantrums over a snatched toy."

Mrs. Sullivan clasped her cold hands. "What if... just what if he truly repents?"

Silence filled the room.

After a long pause, Evelyn lifted her red-rimmed eyes. "It's too late. The accumulated disappointments have eroded all affection."

Tears welled in the old woman's eyes before she simply patted Evelyn's hand.

When Evelyn exited, only Ethan's tall silhouette remained by the floor-to-ceiling window.

"Finished?" He turned, warm lighting casting fragmented shadows across his chiseled features.

"Yes."

He picked up his suit jacket. "I'll drive you home."

Evelyn instinctively stepped back, yet her pulse stuttered when she met his penetrating gaze.

The car ride passed in oppressive silence.

As they stopped before Northville Villa, Ethan suddenly leaned over, his hand covering hers on the seatbelt release.

"I'm flying to the States tomorrow."

She jerked her hand away like she'd been burned. "Not my concern."

"But I wanted you to know." His voice held an unfamiliar softness that unsettled her.

This was dangerous.

"Mr. Sullivan," she said coldly, pushing the door open, "if this continues, we won't even remain friends."

Moonlight caught the bob of Ethan's Adam's apple.

"Understood."

Watching the black Maybach vanish into the night, Evelyn slumped against her door, slowly sinking to the floor.

In the darkness, her mind replayed that figure swimming toward her through floodwaters.

She abruptly stood and flicked on the lights—this had to end.

At dawn, Simon Reynolds appeared in her office doorway just as Evelyn tore up a plane ticket to Paris.

###Chapter 253

"I'll cover all company losses, Evelyn."

Evelyn Sullivan tapped her fingers on the desk, her gaze icy. "Transfer the funds today, Simon. Next time, hand in your resignation."

Simon Reynolds' face darkened, veins bulging at his temples. "Don't worry, Evelyn. I won't forget this."

"See that you don't."

The office door slammed shut. Simon clenched his fists, malice churning in his eyes. One day, he'd take control of MY Fashion Group and make those bitches beg for mercy.

The afternoon sun glared as Sophia Reynolds burst in without knocking.

"Evelyn! Check the trending topics!"

Her phone screen displayed three explosive hashtags:
#Rising Designer Assaulted in Public#
#Identity of Attacker Exposed#
#The Feud Between the Sisters#

A shaky video clearly captured Evelyn's slap. The comments section was flooded:

[The champion designer was attacked while still recovering from her leg injury! Where's justice?]
[The attacker is the Jackson family's long-lost bastard child!]
[High school dropout trash jealous of her talented sister.]
[Heard she served tea at the competition. How pathetic!]

Sophia trembled with rage. "I'm calling PR right now!"

"Don't." Evelyn turned off the screen, her pen slashing across a document. "I'll handle it."

Two hours later, her phone buzzed incessantly. Unknown numbers flooded her inbox with hate messages. Evelyn removed the battery and continued reviewing quarterly reports.

At the Jackson mansion, Isabella Jackson lounged while scrolling through comments. Each refresh brought dozens more insults against Evelyn. Smirking, she clicked the latest trend: #Doxxing in Progress#.

A call from Ethan Sullivan suddenly flashed on her screen. Isabella's smile froze, her finger hovering over the answer button.

###Chapter 254

Ethan Sullivan's voice cut through the phone like a razor-sharp icicle, piercing straight into Isabella Jackson's heart.

"Ethan, how could you doubt me like this?!" Isabella gripped her phone so tightly her nails nearly drew blood from her palms. "I'm the one who got hurt, and instead of caring, you're blaming me?"

A brief silence hung between them.

"Better hope you had nothing to do with it."

The call ended abruptly.

Isabella hurled her phone onto the bed, her eyes blazing with fury.

——

Sullivan Group Headquarters, U.S.

Ethan stared at the escalating media storm on his computer screen, his expression darkening.

"Colin, take down these trending topics immediately."

"Understood, Mr. Sullivan."

Within half an hour, every related hashtag vanished without a trace.

Deprived of their target, the online trolls swarmed Isabella's social media comments instead.

[We stand with you, Isabella!]
[That vicious woman doesn't deserve to be your sister!]
[I've doxxed her address—DM me for details!]

Isabella's comment section exploded with tens of thousands of supportive messages per refresh.

Watching the numbers climb, she smirked.

"Let's see you wriggle out of this one, Evelyn."

She posted a carefully crafted update:

"Thank you for your concern, but this is a private family matter. Please focus on my designs instead."

The seemingly conciliatory post only fueled the fire.

Meanwhile, Evelyn's private account was uncovered, flooding her inbox with hate messages.

Unaware, she remained engrossed in work documents until evening.

When she finally checked her phone, it froze under the deluge of notifications.

She disabled social media alerts without reading them.

Dozens of unread messages piled up—from William Jackson, Victoria Farley, and socialites she barely knew.

At the top were Ethan's missed calls and texts.

The earliest timestamped 2:01 PM:
"Don't read the comments. I'll handle it."

Thirty minutes later:
"Why aren't you responding?"

Followed by travel arrangements:
"Booked the earliest flight back."
"Security deployed at the villa."

His final message, three hours ago:
"Boarding now. Wait for me."

Warmth flooded Evelyn's chest as she immediately called him back.

###Chapter 255

Evelyn's grip on her phone tightened. She didn't want to trouble Ethan, nor did she wish to owe him any favors.

The automated voice informed her his phone was switched off. He must have already boarded his flight home.

As she pocketed her phone, Zoe's call came through.

"Evelyn, don't come back!" Zoe's voice was tense. "There's a mob outside the villa. The door's covered in rotten vegetables and eggs. Someone even left chrysanthemums on the ground—"

Evelyn's chest constricted. "Where are you? Are you safe?"

"I'm in my car, unnoticed. I'm heading to a hotel for a few days. Want to join me?"

"I have another place." Evelyn's mind raced. "Stay safe."

After hanging up, she pulled up the villa's security feed. A dozen angry faces screamed obscenities at the gates. One man brandished a metal pipe.

Her lips curled coldly. She zoomed in, screenshotting the footage, then dialed the police.

Officers dispersed the crowd swiftly. Yet within minutes, an online post taunted: Evelyn Sullivan only knows how to hide behind the cops. We'll be back!

Evelyn forwarded the images to a contact with a black avatar: Find these people.

As she parked at Grand View, her phone buzzed. The investigator, Barley, had sent his findings.

The moment she opened the car door, the hairs on her neck stood up—a survival instinct honed through years of training.

The silence was unnatural. Evelyn quickened her steps toward the villa but froze at the threshold.

The faint scent of gasoline hung in the air.

She whirled around and sprinted. The explosion tore through the night, the blast wave slamming her to the ground. A wooden plank struck her back.

Darkness swallowed her as flames engulfed the sky.

——

White hospital ceilings greeted her when she awoke.

"Finally awake?"

The hoarse voice made her turn. Ethan's usually immaculate suit was wrinkled, his jaw shadowed with stubble. Bloodshot eyes met hers.

She tried to speak, but her throat burned.

Only after the doctor's examination did Ethan's shoulders relax slightly. As Evelyn attempted to sit up, a glass of water appeared in front of her, held by his long fingers.

"How long was I out?" she rasped.

"A full day." His voice was gravelly. "Do you have any idea—"

"Your business trip—"

"Evelyn!" He erupted, his grip on the glass turning his knuckles white. "You nearly died in that explosion, and you're asking about business?"

His eyes were terrifyingly red.
###Chapter 256

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly as she clutched the edge of the blanket.

"You shouldn't have come."

Ethan's eyes turned icy, his lips curling into a mocking smile.

"Indeed, I shouldn't have."

A cold gust followed his abrupt turn before the door slammed shut.

Evelyn stared at the closed door, a dull ache spreading through her chest. With every step he took toward her, the walls around her heart crumbled further.

She took a deep breath, forcing herself to stay composed.

The moment she pushed open the hospital room door, she met a pair of dark, penetrating eyes.

Ethan leaned against the wall, his suit jacket draped over his arm, tie slightly loosened.

"You—"

Before she could finish, she was swept off her feet.

The warmth of his chest seeped through the fabric, his heartbeat loud against her ear. Her ears burned, her breath hitching involuntarily.

"Put me down."

"Keep struggling, and I'll drop you."

His jaw tightened, voice sharp, yet his arms only held her tighter.

As the black Maybach pulled into Oceanview Mansion, Evelyn frowned.

"Take me back to Elm Cove."

Ethan scoffed. "Got a death wish?"

Colin quickly interjected, "Miss Sullivan, Elm Cove isn't safe. The repairman installed a pressure-sensitive device in the lock—it would detonate the moment the door opens."

"Did you find out who's behind it?"

"The suspect is dead." Colin lowered his voice. "He was killed an hour after planting the bomb."

Evelyn's gaze sharpened.

Too convenient.

A fanatic would've left traces of boasting. A clean execution like this? It reeked of...

She quickly messaged Wheat: Scorpion's back.

The reply was instant: The bomber had contact with Scorpion's men.

Her fingers went cold.

This wasn't murder. It was a warning.

Can you track him?

He might have a new identity now, Wheat replied. He could be right beside you.

As her screen dimmed, a shadow fell over her.

Ethan held out a pill and a glass of water.

"Take it."

Backlit by the light, his silhouette was edged in gold. She swallowed the pill, the rustle of his clothes loud as he turned away.

"Ethan."

His steps halted.

###Chapter 257 

"Mr. Sullivan, thank you."

Ethan Sullivan's steps faltered slightly, his tall frame radiating distance.

In the study, the man's slender fingers tapped lightly on the desk, his gaze icy.

"Did you verify everything?"

"Mr. Sullivan, the video was indeed filmed by a passerby and has no connection to Isabella Jackson. The uploader recognized her as the design competition champion."

The chill in Ethan's eyes deepened.

"Keep investigating that repairman. This isn't as simple as it seems."

"The backlash on Weibo..."

"Continue deleting it," he said coldly. "Ban accounts if necessary."

Colin Keller accepted the order and left.

In the bedroom, Evelyn Sullivan stared at the surveillance feed. A crowd still swarmed outside Elm Cove Villa.

She needed to resolve this quickly.

After the video went viral, Isabella's following exploded, inflating her ego. She plotted to leak more dirt on Evelyn to climb even higher.

"Evelyn was born to be my stepping stone," she smirked at her reflection.

Suddenly, her phone buzzed with a notification.

Evelyn had posted on Weibo.

The moment Isabella played the audio clip, her face drained of color. It was a recording of her berating Evelyn backstage at the design competition!

"Evelyn! Are you insane?!" She dialed with trembling fingers. "Delete it now!"

A calm voice answered, "Have you lost yourself in all the recent praise?"

"I didn't post that video! But you hitting me is a fact!"

"You insulted my adoptive parents. Did you expect no consequences?"

Isabella's tone suddenly softened. "Sis... I was wrong... I just won the championship. Don't ruin this for me..."

"Your reputation matters, but mine is disposable?" Evelyn hung up with a cold laugh.

Isabella frantically redialed, but the calls went unanswered.

Hands shaking, she opened the comments—only to find them flooded with attacks against Evelyn.

[Fake audio? How pathetic!]
[No wonder she dropped out of high school—zero brains!]
[LOL, queen of staged drama!]

Isabella froze, then burst into manic laughter.

"Idiot! Who'd believe such obvious fake evidence?"

Just as she prepared to mock Evelyn in a new post, two fresh Weibo updates appeared.

The moment she read the titles, her face turned ashen.
###Chapter 258

Evelyn Sullivan's first Weibo post read: "I have obtained the personal information of all slanderers and harassers. Any further provocation will result in public exposure."

The second post contained a recorded phone call with Isabella Jackson.

Isabella stared at her phone screen, fingers trembling. The realization hit her—Evelyn never had evidence. That post was a trap, and she had walked right into it.

"Evelyn Sullivan!" Isabella hurled her phone against the wall, chest heaving with rage. How dare that bitch set her up?

The two posts exploded online like thunder, instantly shifting public opinion. A tidal wave of condemnation crashed onto Isabella.

"Perfect move! This is the best revenge!"

"Isabella is disgusting—stealing her sister's life and slandering her adoptive parents."

"I heard the Jacksons only brought Evelyn back to donate bone marrow for Isabella."

Former supporters turned against her, their attacks fiercer than before. Isabella was forced to disable comments as her follower count plummeted.

Curled in a corner of her bedroom, tears soaked her clothes.

Meanwhile, Evelyn coldly watched the flood of apologies. Internet mobs were always like this—driven by emotion, convinced of their own righteousness.

Her phone buzzed. Ethan Sullivan entered, his presence icy.

"If you're here for Isabella—"

Before she could finish, she was pulled into a mint-scented embrace.

"Next time, let me handle it," he murmured, voice low.

Evelyn pushed him away. "What are we to each other?"

"Even if we're just bedmates," Ethan's gaze darkened, "I won't let you suffer."

"Don't cross the line." She turned her face away.

The air turned frigid.

After a long silence, Ethan scooped her into his arms. "Dinner."

The table was set with light, bland dishes. Evelyn frowned. "I want spicy food."

"After you heal." He placed a piece of fish in her bowl.

###Chapter 259

Evelyn Sullivan set down her chopsticks, leaving most of her meal untouched.

"I'm done. I want to go back to Elm Cove now."

Ethan Sullivan didn't look up. "You're not going anywhere until your injuries heal."

"I know my own condition!"

"My answer is no."

Evelyn abruptly stood, her chair scraping loudly against the floor.

"Ethan Sullivan, we're divorced! What right do you have to control me?"

Finally, he lifted his gaze, his eyes icy.

"Because you're living in my house."

"Then I'll leave right now!"

She turned to storm out, but Ethan grabbed her wrist.

"Let go!"

"Stop this," he said darkly. "You know there are still people watching you."

Evelyn wrenched free, her eyes reddening.

"I don't need your fake concern!"

His expression darkened, and without warning, he scooped her into his arms.

"What are you doing?! Put me down!"

She thrashed, pounding her fists against his shoulders.

Ethan paused, glancing down at her.

"Keep struggling, and I'll kiss you."

Evelyn froze, trembling with fury.

"You're shameless!"

He chuckled and carried her toward the bedroom.

"Ethan, what do you want from me?"

"To take care of you."

"I don't want it!"

"Whether you want it or not isn't your decision."

Evelyn bit her lip hard, nails digging into her palms.

"Do you enjoy this? Watching me play the fool while you manipulate me?"

Ethan hesitated.

"I've never thought that."

"Then why won't you let me go?"

He met her eyes, his gaze burning.

"Because I can't."

Her heart skipped, and she quickly looked away.

"Spare me the act. You—"

Before she could finish, Ethan leaned in close.

"Evelyn, you're scared."

"Don't be ridiculous!"

"Scared of falling for me again."

Her breath hitched before she scoffed.

"Narcissism is a disease. Get help."

Ethan smirked. "Then why won't you look at me?"

"Who says I won't?"

She forced herself to meet his eyes, but the intensity in them made her pulse race.

His lips curved.

"See? You're blushing."

"You—!"

Furious, she shoved at him, but he only held her tighter.

"Behave. Let me treat your wounds."

"Have the housekeeper do it!"

"No."

"Why not?"

His voice dropped, rough with possessiveness.

"Only I get to see your body."

###Chapter 260

Evelyn Sullivan gripped the bedsheet tightly, her fingertips turning pale.

"Either call the maid or I won't take the medicine." Her voice was icy. "Your choice."

Ethan Sullivan toyed with the ointment box, the metal lid flipping between his fingers with a crisp sound.

"I choose the third option."

"There is no third option!"

He suddenly leaned in, his shadow looming over her. Evelyn instinctively shrank back, her spine pressing against the headboard.

"What are you afraid of?" Ethan chuckled lowly. "I just want to help you apply the medicine."

"I don't need it!"

"Then we'll wait." He straightened, leisurely undoing his cufflinks. "Let's see who gives in first."

Evelyn's chest heaved with anger. Three minutes later, she abruptly flipped onto her stomach, burying her face in the pillow.

"Hurry up!"

Ethan unscrewed the ointment, its faint medicinal scent filling the air. His gaze settled on the tense line of her back, the fabric of her nightgown rising slightly with each breath.

"Lift your shirt."

Her fingers clenched the hem, knuckles whitening. The fabric inched upward, revealing pale skin marred by a shocking bruise across her waist.

Ethan's eyes darkened.

"Had enough?" Evelyn's voice was muffled by the pillow. "If you're not going to do it, get out."

The cool ointment touched her skin, making her shiver. Then came the searing heat of his palm, stealing her breath.

"Don't move." His voice was rough.

Evelyn bit her lower lip. His fingers circled the injury with perfect pressure. Heat spread from her waist, her ears burning.

"Is... is it done?"

Ethan didn't answer. His breathing grew heavier against the back of her neck, sending tiny tremors through her.

After what felt like an eternity, he finally withdrew.

Evelyn yanked her shirt down and scrambled to the far corner of the bed like a startled rabbit.

"You can leave now."

Ethan wiped his hands slowly, his gaze lingering on her flushed earlobes.

"Kicking me out after getting what you wanted?"

"You—" She cut herself off, turning her face away. "Out!"

He chuckled and headed for the door, pausing just before closing it. "Remember to reapply tomorrow."

The moment the door shut, Evelyn hurled a pillow at it.

###Chapter 261

Evelyn's ears burned as she glared at Ethan. "Must you always speak like that? 'Use and discard'? What kind of phrase is that?"

It made her sound like some heartless villain who abandoned people after getting what she wanted.

"Am I wrong?"

Meeting his teasing gaze, Evelyn turned her face away. "Think whatever you want. Just leave."

Another minute alone with him, and she might actually hit him.

Ethan tossed the tissue into the trash with perfect aim before strolling to the bed. He leaned down, murmuring something against her ear.

Evelyn's face flushed crimson. She grabbed a pillow and hurled it at him. "Ethan Sullivan! You—you rogue!"

Her furious reaction only amused him. Chuckling, he easily dodged the flying pillow and stepped back.

Only after the door clicked shut did Evelyn collapse onto the bed, his words still ringing in her ears: My body is for your eyes only.

She pressed her hands to her burning cheeks, taking deep breaths to steady her racing heart.

The sudden ring of her phone made her brow arch.

William Jackson flashed on the screen.

The moment she answered, his suppressed roar blasted through. "Delete that post immediately!"

Evelyn's lips curled coldly. Of course—this was about Isabella again.

"Why should I?"

"Do you have any idea how much damage this has caused Jackson Group? Your sister has admitted her mistake! She'll apologize to you in person tomorrow!"

Her fingers tapped lightly against the bedsheet. "When I was being cyberbullied, why didn't anyone call it a 'family matter' then?"

Silence.

"I was too busy—"

"Too busy to see your own daughter being slandered?" Her voice turned glacial. "But now it's a 'family matter'?"

She hung up before he could respond.

——

In the Jackson mansion, William's face darkened as he slammed his phone onto the table.

"She refused."

Victoria immediately shrieked, "That ungrateful wretch! Isabella is being torn apart online! What more does she want?!"

Isabella wept pitifully. "My career as a designer is ruined..."

Suddenly, she clutched Victoria's arm. "Mom, Ethan promised to fund my design studio!"

With trembling fingers, she dialed the number she knew by heart.

###Chapter 262

The call was about to end when the other line finally connected.

"Ethan..." Isabella's voice trembled with obvious tears. "Please... help me."

Ethan's fingers tightened slightly around his phone, his eyes icy cold.

"What is it?"

"Those recordings Evelyn posted online..." Her voice shook violently. "Everyone's calling me a homewrecker now. Some are even threatening to kill me..."

In the past, hearing her cry like this would have shattered his heart.

But now, all he could see was Evelyn's pale face lying in that hospital bed.

"The Jacksons will protect you."

His indifferent response made her breath hitch. She bit her lip hard. "Ethan... have you really given up on me?"

"Isabella." His voice was glacial. "The moment you chose to leave three years ago, you should have known our ending."

"No!" Her voice rose sharply. "I never wanted to marry anyone else—"

"But for me, it ended three years ago."

A broken laugh escaped her. "So you've fallen for Evelyn now, haven't you?"

"Yes."

That single, decisive word shattered her last delusion.

She finally understood how laughable her self-deception had been.

"Fine. I see." Her voice steadied unnaturally. "But you still owe me Brocade. And those two conditions..."

"Brocade will be transferred to you tomorrow." He cut her off. "Contact Colin if you need anything. The conditions stand whenever you're ready."

A glint of triumph flashed in her eyes.

She knew it—he still couldn't let her go completely.

"But I have one condition."

"What?"

"Stay away from Evelyn." His tone turned lethal. "Or everything I've given you, I can take back."

Her nails dug into her palms.

"Understood."

The call ended abruptly.

Isabella slowly lowered the phone, her tears long dried.

Victoria rushed over. "What did Mr. Sullivan say?"

"He agreed."

Victoria exhaled in relief. "I knew he still cared—"

"Mom!" Isabella snapped. "Never mention him again."

"Why? He just helped you!"

"That was the last time." She stood, walking toward her bedroom without looking back. "We're even now."

The door closed behind her.

She sat before her vanity mirror for a long time.

The woman in the reflection had bloodshot eyes—but her lips curved in a chilling smile.

She'd once believed Ethan would always be hers. Now she saw how wrong she'd been.

But it didn't matter.

Evelyn would pay for this.

Meanwhile, Evelyn was finally permitted to leave Oceanview Mansion.

Returning to her villa at Elm Cove, she found the entrance restored to its original state.

Security footage showed the property management had sent cleaners. Every trace of those vile messages had vanished.

Her lips curled slightly.

That HOA fee was worth every penny.

###Chapter 263

Evelyn Sullivan dealt with the troublemakers swiftly and decisively.

She compiled their dirty secrets and uploaded them online with detailed evidence. Within hours, their social media accounts were flooded with angry comments, and their employers issued termination notices.

Back in her familiar apartment, Evelyn exhaled deeply.

She tidied up efficiently, had a quick lunch, then headed straight to MY Fashion Group headquarters.

"Looks like Ethan took good care of you," Sophia Reynolds teased, eyeing her with amusement. "You're glowing."

Evelyn shot her a wry look.

Sophia had nearly rushed to the hospital after the bombing incident, only backing down when she learned Evelyn was recuperating at Ethan's villa. In Licheng, no place was safer than by Ethan Sullivan's side.

"We have business to discuss."

"My office."

Once seated, Sophia hesitated.

"Maybe... you should tell Ethan the truth about who you are?"

Evelyn arched a brow. "Why?"

"Brocade just stole three major clients from us. If this continues—"

"Business is war," Evelyn cut in. "Victory depends on skill."

Ethan owed her nothing now. Why would he sacrifice Brocade's interests for her?

Sophia lowered her gaze. "Understood."

"Anything else?"

"Ethan is meeting our core client tonight at seven." Sophia handed her a file. "If we lose this channel..."

Evelyn skimmed the document. "Book the private room next to theirs."

As soon as Sophia left, Simon Reynolds entered with the quarterly report.

"Evelyn, here's the supplier list for next season."

Evelyn crossed out several names. "Terminate these contracts."

Simon's face darkened. The scratched-out suppliers were his connections—each brought him seven-figure kickbacks annually.

"But these are long-term partners—"

"Charging 30% above market rate for average-quality goods." Evelyn met his gaze. "Surely you knew?"

Simon forced a smile. "They deliver on time—"

"The new suppliers offer 15% lower prices with stricter penalty clauses." Evelyn closed the file. "Redo it."

Exiting the office, Simon's eyes turned venomous.

If this brat wanted to play hardball, he'd show her no mercy.

As night fell, White Harbor Restaurant glittered under the lights.

"What's the plan?" Sophia asked, gripping the steering wheel.

###Chapter 264

"You'll understand soon."

Evelyn Sullivan linked arms with Sophia Reynolds as they walked down the hallway toward their reserved private room.

As they passed Ethan Sullivan's private room, Evelyn suddenly stopped. Without hesitation, she pushed open the door.

"Evelyn!" Sophia gasped. "That's not our room—"

Ignoring her, Evelyn strode inside.

The laughter and conversation inside died instantly. Ethan, an unfamiliar client, Isabella Jackson, and Colin Keller all turned to stare at the doorway.

Evelyn's gaze lingered on Isabella for a split second, a flicker of coldness in her eyes before she replaced it with perfect surprise and apology.

"My apologies. Wrong room."

Under the table, Isabella's fingers clenched, nails digging into her palms. She forced down the hatred in her eyes, though her lips twitched uncontrollably.

That persistent bitch!

Evelyn subtly shifted, fully exposing Sophia behind her to the room's occupants.

The client's face paled as he scrambled to his feet. "CEO Reynolds! What a coincidence!"

Sophia's lips curved into a knowing smile. "Indeed. MY Fashion's fall collection has been selling well. I've been discussing collaborations with several distributors."

The implication was clear.

Beads of sweat formed on the client's forehead. "I just happened to run into Mr. Sullivan tonight—"

"Understood." Sophia cut him off, turning to Evelyn. "Assistant Sullivan, aren't you going to apologize?"

Evelyn looked at Ethan, her gaze so distant it was as if he were a stranger. "Apologies for interrupting your meal."

Ethan's chest tightened. The coldness in her eyes sent an unfamiliar pang of panic through him.

"Is that really how you apologize?"

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. "What would satisfy you, Mr. Sullivan?"

"At least a toast."

"Fine."

She briskly poured a full glass of wine and raised it to drink, but Ethan spoke again.

"Standing so far away lacks sincerity."

Evelyn took a deep breath and stepped closer to him. As their glasses clinked, his low voice reached her ears.

"Wait for me after this."

She ignored him, downed her drink, and turned to leave without another word.

Ethan stared at the closed door, unable to stay seated any longer. Five minutes later, he stood to excuse himself.

"Ethan!" Isabella frantically grabbed his sleeve. "Don't go—"

He pulled his arm free. "Colin will assist you."

The door closed again. Left staring at the empty seat, Isabella finally understood the bitterness Evelyn had once endured.

###Chapter 265

Evelyn Sullivan strode briskly from White Harbor with Sophia Reynolds in tow, the night breeze cooling her flushed cheeks.

"Evelyn, you were amazing back there!" Sophia clapped excitedly. "Did you see Vincent's face? He looked ready to explode!"

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "I refuse to be played for a fool."

Under the dim parking lot lights, her slender frame seemed especially fragile.

"Evelyn!"

Ethan Sullivan's commanding voice cut through the night.

Before she could react, his iron grip clamped around her wrist.

"Let go." Her voice was ice.

His knuckles whitened. "Don't you want to know why Isabella was there?"

"Not my concern."

She tried to wrench free, but he swept her off her feet.

"Ethan!" Evelyn trembled with fury.

Sophia tactfully stepped aside as Ethan shoved Evelyn into his Maybach.

The doors locked with a decisive click.

"Have you lost your mind?" Evelyn clenched the seatbelt.

Ethan slammed the accelerator. "Yes. For you."

The luxury car tore through the night, the atmosphere inside suffocating.

Watching the city blur past, Evelyn spoke suddenly: "We should end this."

The wheel jerked.

"Reason." Ethan's voice could freeze hell.

"You're dangerous." She met his gaze. "I wanted a fleeting affair. You built a cage."

Tires screeched.

As the car halted before his villa, Ethan seized her chin.

"You don't get to decide."

His punishing kiss tasted like possession and retribution. Evelyn shoved against him, but he cradled her head, deepening the contact until blood flavored their clash of wills.

###Chapter 266

Evelyn Sullivan pressed her hands against Ethan Sullivan's chest, but his strong arms held her captive. His kiss was relentless, leaving her no escape.

Only when they were both breathless did Ethan finally release her.

Slap!

Evelyn raised her hand to strike him, but he caught her wrist effortlessly.

"Want another round?" His deep voice carried a dangerous edge.

"You're shameless!" Her eyes burned with anger.

Ethan chuckled, his thumb brushing over her wrist. "Don't be mad."

"Mr. Sullivan, you're overestimating yourself." She yanked her hand back with a cold laugh. "I just think we should end this."

"Tonight isn't the time for that conversation." His expression darkened.

Knowing further words were pointless, Evelyn pushed the car door open and stepped out. The night wind lifted her hair as she walked away without a backward glance.

Ethan watched her retreating figure, a resigned smile tugging at his lips.

The moment she entered her home, Sophia Reynolds called.

"Evelyn, did Ethan hurt you?"

"I'm fine. He just dropped me off." She sank onto the sofa, exhausted. "Sorry for worrying you."

After hanging up, Evelyn buried herself under the covers. Over the next few days, she drowned herself in work, ignoring every message Ethan sent.

Friday evening arrived in a blink.

As Evelyn finished organizing the last file, the city lights had already illuminated the skyline. Rubbing her sore neck, she grabbed her bag and left the office.

Outside the lobby, a familiar black Maybach waited.

Evelyn hesitated but approached.

"What do you want?" she asked coldly through the window.

"Get in." Ethan rolled down the window, his sharp profile visible.

"Say what you need to say. I have plans."

"With who?" His piercing gaze locked onto her.

"None of your business."

The car door swung open. In one swift motion, Ethan scooped her into his arms.

"Ethan! Put me down!" She struggled, pounding his shoulders.

Ignoring her protests, he deposited her into the backseat and slammed the door shut, sealing them in privacy.

"You're impossible!" She trembled with fury.

Ethan fastened his seatbelt calmly. "Would've been easier if you'd just listened."

Evelyn turned away, refusing to engage. The smooth motion of the car lulled her into an unexpected sleep.

In her drowsy state, she felt someone drape a blanket over her and adjust the AC.

When she woke, the sound of waves filled the air.

"Awake?" Ethan's voice cut through the darkness.

She realized she was wrapped in a cashmere blanket, its scent faintly cedar. Pushing it aside, she sat up to see moonlight dancing on the ocean.

"Where are we?"

"Our beach house." He opened the car door. "Hungry? Dinner's ready."

The villa glowed warmly, its dining table laden with exquisite dishes. Evelyn was stunned—every one was her favorite.

Her anger momentarily forgotten, she ate heartily. Ethan watched with quiet amusement.

Servants cleared the plates silently, replacing them with fresh fruit. The sea breeze drifted through the open windows, carrying its briny whisper.

###Chapter 267

"Stay tonight. I'll take you boating tomorrow morning."

Evelyn frowned. Fishing held no appeal for her. All she wanted this weekend was to catch up on sleep at home.

"I don't go out on weekends."

"Then we'll have a barbecue and watch movies at the villa."

It suddenly dawned on Evelyn that Ethan was planning a date. She immediately took a defensive step back. "I'm going home."

"This is your home."

"It's your villa."

"You like it? I'll transfer the deed to you right now."

"..."

Evelyn took a deep breath. "Mr. Sullivan, you know exactly what's wrong between us."

Ethan's gaze burned. "I prefer what you called me last night over 'Mr. Sullivan.'"

Every serious conversation got derailed by him. Furious, Evelyn turned to leave.

A hand suddenly closed around her wrist.

"Sophia says you've been working too hard lately," Ethan said, his voice low. "Take this weekend to relax."

"There's a bioluminescent jellyfish migration tonight. I'll take you home after."

The intensity in his dark eyes made Evelyn's heart skip.

She yanked her hand free. "You'd better keep your word."

When Ethan returned to the living room after finishing work, he found Evelyn curled in a corner of the sofa.

On screen, a ghostly pale woman was crawling out of a well—

"Ah!"

Evelyn grabbed the hands that suddenly covered her eyes and flipped their owner over her shoulder with a harsh thud.

She froze when she saw it was Ethan.

"Help me up," he ground out through clenched teeth.

"You shouldn't have sneaked up on me!" Evelyn retorted.

"You're scared of ghosts but you watch horror movies?"

"It's artistic appreciation!"

Ethan arched a brow. "Then who was trembling just now?"

Before he could finish, a grotesque face filled the screen.

Evelyn shrieked and threw herself into Ethan's arms.

"Artistic appreciation?" His chest vibrated with silent laughter.

"An accident!" She frantically turned off the TV.

As she tried to leave, an arm hooked around her waist and lifted her off her feet.

When his scorching kiss descended, Evelyn thought dazedly—he'd derailed her again...

The next afternoon.

Evelyn's face paled as she read Sophia's text.

"I'm leaving now," she said coldly, heading downstairs.

Ethan was preparing the barbecue in the courtyard. "At least stay for lunch."

"No need." Her grip tightened on her phone. "Any later and it'll be too late."

"What do you mean?"

Evelyn's smile was icy. "You deliberately kept me away so Isabella could steal my client?"

###Chapter 268

Ethan Sullivan's eyes turned icy. "What do you mean by that?"

Evelyn Sullivan's lips curled into a cold smile. "Am I wrong? Isabella couldn't have intercepted all my clients without your approval."

"Is that really how you see me?"

"Trust between us died long ago."

She turned and walked toward the street, her back rigid with resolve.

Thirty minutes later, Sophia Reynolds' red sports car pulled up in front of her.

"Get in." Sophia opened the passenger door. "It's worse than we thought."

Evelyn fastened her seatbelt. "Cut to the chase."

"Every potential client signed with Isabella." Sophia's grip tightened on the steering wheel. "And there's more... Brocade has been transferred to her name."

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms.

That dinner had been nothing but a trap.

"Ethan is ruthless." Sophia gritted her teeth. "If you hadn't returned when you did, MY Fashion Group would belong to Isabella by now."

"Take me home first." Evelyn closed her eyes briefly. "We'll rebuild our client base."

Sophia shot her a worried glance. "Do you want me to stay with you?"

"No."

As Evelyn stepped out of the car at her villa, she spotted Ethan waiting at the entrance.

"We need to talk." He blocked her path.

Evelyn unlocked the door without expression. "Come in."

Her detached demeanor stung him. "It's not what you think."

"Then what is it?" She turned to face him. "When your plan to acquire MY failed, you gave her Brocade as consolation?"

Ethan's pupils constricted. "You knew?"

"Does it matter?" She laughed lightly. "The show's over. Time to drop the act."

"If this was just an act, why would I go to Qingcheng to find you?!"

Her hand rested on the doorknob. "I've had enough of your games, Mr. Sullivan."

Ethan slammed his palm against the door. "I'll get to the bottom of this."

"Don't bother."

As the door clicked shut, she heard the sound of her own heart shattering.

###Chapter 269

Evelyn's gaze was icy, making Ethan's expression darken instantly.

"Evelyn, won't you even give me the most basic trust?"

As the door closed, her voice came through the wood.

"After the divorce, we should be strangers."

Ethan stood motionless for a moment before turning and driving away.

Meanwhile, Isabella received a call from Colin, saying Ethan wanted to see her. Overjoyed, she immediately began getting ready.

"Ethan, you wanted to see me?"

His cold stare pinned her in place. "What's going on with those distributors you signed?"

Her heart skipped a beat, but she forced calm. "Is there a problem?"

"Those same distributors were in talks with MY just days ago!"

Isabella shrugged. "Isn't business competition normal?"

His eyes turned glacial. "Tell me how you found them."

She paled. The contacts had come from an anonymous number, promising easy deals under the Sullivan name. What she thought was luck had backfired spectacularly.

"Someone... sent them to me anonymously..."

Ethan ordered Colin to investigate immediately. This was clearly an attack on MY—and possibly the Sullivans.

An hour later, Colin returned with a report.

"Sir, the trail leads to someone codenamed 'Scorpion.'"

"Background?"

"Former assassin guild member. Now operates independently against his old employers."

Ethan considered this. "Keep digging. Don't tell Evelyn yet."

For the next week, Evelyn was away on business, and their cold war continued.

On her return day, rain poured relentlessly.

Drenched, she reached the villa and spotted Ethan's car parked outside. She pretended not to see it, but footsteps followed as she unlocked the door.

Turning, she found him right behind her.

"Mr. Sullivan, I said—"

Before she could finish, she was yanked into a burning embrace.

###Chapter 270

"Ethan Sullivan, let go!"

Evelyn Sullivan's voice dripped with irritation as she shoved against the man before her. To her surprise, Ethan stumbled back easily this time.

Her breath caught when his towering frame suddenly pitched forward. Instinct made her grab his collar—the heat radiating from his skin burned her palm.

"You—"

Only then did she notice Ethan's tightly shut eyes and the unnatural flush staining his cheeks. She pressed her fingers to his forehead, jerking them back from the scalding temperature.

"Stop faking!" She slapped his face sharply, but got no response.

After a tense hesitation, she hauled him onto the sofa. The thermometer's reading made her stomach clench: 103.3°F.

"What a nuisance." Muttering, she forced antipyretics between his lips.

Colin Keller's voice crackled through the phone, strained with apology. "Ms. Sullivan, I'm out of town—"

Hanging up, Evelyn glared at the unconscious man before kicking the sofa leg.

"Did I owe you in a past life?"

Two hours later, Ethan's fever finally broke. As Evelyn turned toward the kitchen, a faint rustling stopped her.

The aroma of rice porridge filled the air. Ethan stirred awake, following the scent to the kitchen doorway. He leaned against the frame, drinking in the sight of her bustling figure.

"Awake?" Evelyn didn't turn around. "Wait in the living room."

"I want to watch you."

Her hands stilled briefly before resuming their work. She ignored the heat of his gaze—and the warmth creeping up her ears.

At the table, Ethan spoke suddenly. "Thank you."

"Don't." Evelyn set down her chopsticks. "Your ride's coming."

His utensils froze mid-air. "In such a hurry to get rid of me?"

"We ended things long ago."

Lightning split the sky outside, unleashing a torrential downpour. Ethan rose, his tall frame casting a shadow across the table.

"I'll visit another day."

"Don't bother."

The door clicked shut. Evelyn yanked open the curtains—watching his silhouette dissolve into the rain. She snapped them closed again, but couldn't shake the inexplicable ache in her chest.

One week later, Evelyn nearly dropped her champagne flute at a business gala. Her gaze snagged on a familiar figure surrounded by admirers.

Sophia Reynolds followed her stare, gasping. "Isn't that Mr. Sullivan?"

###Chapter 271

The gala sparkled with dazzling lights and clinking glasses. Evelyn Sullivan stood amidst the crowd, effortlessly charming several business partners. Her crimson V-neck dress accentuated her delicate collarbones, shimmering under the chandeliers.

"You're truly remarkable for your age, Ms. Sullivan. A toast to you." A partner raised his glass.

Evelyn lifted her champagne flute with grace, her red lips curving. "To our successful collaboration."

Just then, murmurs rippled through the entrance. Her peripheral vision caught Ethan Sullivan entering with Isabella Jackson on his arm. They looked like a perfect pair.

"Ethan, isn't that my sister?" Isabella feigned surprise, covering her lips. "Dressed like that while entertaining clients... How inappropriate."

Ethan's piercing gaze locked onto the striking figure in red. The effortless allure in her every movement drew admiring glances from the men around her. His fists clenched, knuckles turning white.

"Poor sister," Isabella sighed with faux sympathy. "Perhaps I could arrange a cushy position for her at Brocade?"

"Enough." Ethan's voice was glacial. "One more word against her, and our deal is off."

Isabella paled, her nails digging into her palms. She forced a smile. "I only meant to show concern—"

"She doesn’t need it." Ethan strode toward Evelyn, his back rigid with resolve.

Left behind, Isabella's eyes darkened with malice. Spotting Ryan Paisley nearby, his attention fixed on Evelyn, her lips twisted into a knowing smirk.

"How... interesting."

Evelyn was mid-conversation when an icy shiver ran down her spine. She turned to find Ethan approaching, and her brows instinctively furrowed.

"Mr. Sullivan!" The partner greeted him with flustered enthusiasm.

Ethan gave a curt nod. "I need a word with Ms. Sullivan."

Once alone, Evelyn dropped her polite facade and turned to leave.

"In such a hurry?" Ethan caught her wrist. "You seemed quite engaged earlier."

She wrenched free. "We have nothing to discuss, Mr. Sullivan."

"Sullivan Group has a project for MY."

"Not interested." Her voice was frosty. "Save it for Brocade."

He stepped closer. "What if it's personal?"

"Don’t you have better things to do?" She retreated, putting distance between them.

"For you? Always." His low voice carried a dangerous allure.

Evelyn scoffed and walked away without a backward glance, heading for the dessert table. As she picked up a slice of cake, a shadow fell over her.

"Ethan, must you—" She froze upon meeting Ryan Paisley's gaze instead. "Mr. Paisley?"

His expression was unreadable. "So you're the founder of MY."

###Chapter 272

Evelyn Sullivan noticed the peculiar look in Ryan Paisley's eyes, but she had long been prepared to reveal her identity.

"Something wrong?"

A flicker of complex emotions passed through Ryan's gaze. "My apologies. I didn't realize you were the CEO of MY."

Evelyn frowned slightly, sensing an underlying meaning in his words.

"No need for formalities, Mr. Paisley. Business is business."

Ryan's expression dimmed. "If the opportunity arises, I'll prioritize working with MY in the future."

Evelyn arched a brow in surprise, about to respond politely when a cold voice cut in from behind.

"Having a pleasant chat?"

Without turning, she replied, "None of your concern."

Ethan Sullivan sat beside her with a dark expression, replacing her wine glass with warm milk.

"Drink less."

Too tired to argue, Evelyn stirred the milk absently.

"Ryan, you have other matters to attend to," Ethan dismissed him outright.

Ryan gave Evelyn one last lingering look before walking away.

"Stay away from him," Ethan said abruptly.

Evelyn scoffed. "What? Afraid I'll seduce your friend?"

Before Ethan could respond, Sophia Reynolds rushed over in a flurry.

"Evelyn, Mr. Wang and the others are waiting."

Grateful for the escape, Evelyn stood immediately.

Only when they turned the corner did Sophia lower her voice. "Ethan parades Isabella around like some trophy, then comes crawling back to you. Does he think he's some emperor picking concubines?"

"That's not the right idiom," Evelyn sighed, rubbing her temples.

"That's what you're focusing on?!" Sophia stomped her foot. "He's humiliating you!"

Evelyn's gaze drifted to the mingling crowd in the distance, her fingers unconsciously digging into her palms.

"I know my limits."

By the end of the gala, Evelyn was slightly tipsy. Sophia anxiously instructed the designated driver before watching her leave.

Through the car window, neon lights blurred into streaks. Leaning back, Evelyn let her thoughts wander into the night.

###Chapter 273 

Ryan Paisley had just stepped into the underground parking lot when he spotted Isabella Jackson leaning against his black Maybach. Her beige trench coat stood out starkly under the dim lighting.

"Mr. Paisley, there are a few clauses in the Brocade contract I don't quite understand." Isabella tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear, offering a perfectly calculated smile.

Ryan expressionlessly pulled out his car keys. "Take it to Legal."

She suddenly stepped forward, her heels clicking sharply against the concrete. "Or we could talk about my sister. I heard you—"

"Enough!" Ryan whirled around, his gaze sharp as a blade. "Don't mention her in front of me."

The next morning, Sophia Reynolds burst into Evelyn Sullivan's office, waving a document.

"Paisley Group offered us a partnership! They're giving us their prime retail space!"

Evelyn's pen froze mid-signature, leaving a small blue ink blot on the paper. "Decline it."

"Are you insane? That's prime real estate!" Sophia slammed the file onto the desk. "It could boost our sales by 80%!"

Evelyn looked up, sunlight filtering through the blinds to cast fragmented shadows across her face. "Ryan Paisley and Ethan Sullivan grew up together."

"So what?" Sophia braced her hands on the desk. "Business is war. Why turn down free profit?"

Evelyn eventually relented but insisted on personally inviting Ryan to dinner as thanks.

When the call connected, Ryan was reviewing documents. At the sound of Evelyn's voice, his pen dragged a long line across the page.

"Seven tonight, Royal View Steakhouse." Her voice carried through the receiver. "Are you available, Mr. Paisley?"

His Adam's apple bobbed. "I am."

After hanging up, he rose and walked to the floor-to-ceiling window. Sunlight caught the faint upward curve of his lips.

The moment of quiet was shattered by Ethan's call.

"What's this about Brocade's storefront?" Ethan's voice was glacial.

Ryan watched the steady stream of traffic below. "It better suits MY's needs."

The sound of crumpling paper came through the line. "Stay away from her." Each word was enunciated with lethal precision before the call abruptly ended.

Ryan tossed his phone onto the sofa. His tie suddenly felt suffocating. He loosened the knot, his eyes dark with unreadable emotion.

###Chapter 274

"Understood."

Ethan Sullivan set down his phone, his long fingers tapping twice on the desk. He lifted his gaze to Colin Keller standing nearby, his voice low. "Inform Isabella that the Paisley Group has chosen another partner."

Colin nodded and turned to make the arrangements.

Isabella Jackson was reviewing documents in her office when the news reached her. Her fountain pen jerked to a halt, ink bleeding across the paper. She slowly raised her head, her eyes dark and venomous as she stared at her secretary. "Find out. Who did the Paisleys choose?"

Thirty minutes later, the secretary nervously handed her the investigative report.

"MY?" Isabella let out a cold laugh, her nails digging deep into her palms. She snatched her phone and dialed Ryan Paisley's number, her voice sickly sweet. "Mr. Paisley, is this your way of taunting me?"

A derisive snort came through the line.

"You overestimate your importance, Ms. Jackson," Ryan's voice was icy. "Business is business. It's all about capability."

Isabella narrowed her eyes, her red lips parting. "Aren't you afraid I'll expose your feelings for Evelyn—"

"Isabella." Ryan cut her off sharply, his tone dangerous. "If you dare breathe a word, I'll make sure you never set foot in Rongcheng again."

The call ended abruptly.

Crack! Her brand-new phone shattered against the wall. Isabella's chest heaved violently, her eyes burning with hatred.

She would make Evelyn pay.

At six in the evening, Evelyn pushed open the glass door of the restaurant. Ryan was already seated by the window and stood immediately when he saw her.

"Sorry, rush hour traffic was terrible."

Ryan smiled warmly. "I was just early."

The candlelit dinner was pleasant. Ryan was witty, drawing soft laughter from Evelyn behind her hand. Neither noticed the camera lens trained on them from a corner table.

"Let me drive you home," Ryan offered as they settled the bill.

They had just stepped outside when a black Maybach screeched to a halt at the curb. The window rolled down, revealing Ethan's sharp profile.

"Get in."

Evelyn froze. "How did you—"

"Sophia told me," Ethan said flatly.

Evelyn frowned skeptically. Sophia, with her fiery temper, would voluntarily contact Ethan?

"That's not necessary. I can—"

"It's about the divorce," Ethan interrupted, his voice low.

Evelyn pressed her lips together, then turned to Ryan with an apologetic smile. "Thank you for dinner."

Before Ryan could respond, Ethan stepped between them. The two men locked eyes, tension crackling in the air.

"Ryan," Ethan's voice was glacial. "Stay away from her."

Ryan remained unruffled. "You're crossing a line, Ethan."

The car door slammed shut. The Maybach roared away, leaving Ryan standing in its wake, his expression darkening as he watched the taillights disappear.

###Chapter 275

The car door slammed shut. Ethan Sullivan's face was icy as he ordered the driver to go.

The black Maybach merged into traffic. He turned to glare at Evelyn Sullivan, his eyes dark. "I warned you to stay away from Ryan Paisley."

"Mr. Sullivan, MY Fashion Group has business dealings with Paisley Corp. Having dinner with him is perfectly normal." Evelyn smirked. "Should I pretend not to know him when we meet?"

Ethan's jaw tightened. After a moment of silence, he spoke. "That's not what I meant."

"Your meaning doesn't matter." Evelyn stared straight ahead. "Last night you said we needed to talk. About what?"

"About what you proposed. I want you to reconsider."

Evelyn frowned. "There's nothing to reconsider. You and I—"

Before she could finish, Ethan suddenly cupped the back of her head and crushed his lips against hers.

Caught off guard, Evelyn struggled, but he held her firmly. The kiss was relentless, leaving her breathless by the time he finally pulled away.

"You still feel something for me." Ethan brushed his thumb over her swollen lips. "Why won't you give us another chance?"

Evelyn shoved him away, her eyes clear and cold. "So what if I do? You and Isabella Jackson are always tangled up together. I won't make the same mistake again."

"There's nothing between us."

"Nothing? Then why do you take her to every event? Why let everyone think she's your girlfriend?" Evelyn's lips curled in mockery. "Ethan, don't treat me like a fool."

His gaze darkened. "Some things can't be explained right now. But I swear, Isabella and I will never be together."

"Save your lies for someone else."

"I'll prove it to you."

Silence filled the car. When it stopped in front of the villa, Evelyn turned to him before getting out. "Don't waste your effort, Mr. Sullivan. Nothing you do means anything to me now."

She'd given him too many chances in those three years. It was too late now.

Ethan clenched his fists as he watched her walk away without looking back.

For the next few days, Ethan didn't appear again. But the entertainment pages were flooded with photos of him and Isabella. Soon, news broke that Isabella had been appointed CEO of Brocade.

"Making it look like a coronation," Sophia Reynolds muttered, flipping through the headlines.

Evelyn raised a brow. "You really dislike her, don't you?"

"I've hated her fake act since we were kids! Now I hate her even more for scheming against you." Sophia snorted. "She's just a fraud propped up by Sullivan Group."

"Don't underestimate her." Evelyn handed her a file. "Brocade has Sullivan Group's backing. We need to stay sharp."

Sophia took the file. "With you here, we won't lose to that impostor!"

"We've lost before." Evelyn chuckled.

"Only because Sullivan Group interfered!" Sophia fumed. "That's all she's good for."

Meanwhile, in Simon Reynolds' office...

"Brother, are you ready?" he asked into the phone, his tone deceptively gentle.

The voice on the other end wavered. "Simon, I'm still scared carrying this fake bomb..."

"Relax, it's just mud inside." Simon's eyes turned cold. "Think about how Sophia abandoned you. If Evelyn hadn't poisoned her against you, she wouldn't have left you to rot."

"But—"

"I paid off all your gambling debts. Would I really harm you?" Simon lowered his voice. "We're just scaring her a little—making her back off."

###Chapter 276

Samuel Reynolds' hand trembled slightly as he gripped his phone. Silence stretched between both ends of the call.

"Fine. I'll do as you say."

Simon Reynolds' sinister chuckle came through the line. "Big brother, opportunities are fleeting. Miss this one, and the next won't be so easy."

"Understood."

After hanging up, Simon slammed his phone onto the desk, eyes glinting with cold fury.

Evelyn Sullivan, you brought this upon yourself.

At exactly 3 PM, Quincy Howard burst into the CEO's office, face pale.

"Ms. Sullivan! There's a madman downstairs with a bomb—he's demanding to see you!"

Evelyn shot to her feet, sending documents scattering. "What? Do we know who it is?"

"Not yet, but it's too dangerous! The police are on their way—"

"We can't wait!" Evelyn strode toward the elevator. "What about the reception?"

Quincy's voice shook. "He...he's taken the receptionist hostage..."

Evelyn froze mid-step, her gaze turning razor-sharp. "Why didn't you say so sooner?"

As the elevator doors opened, she saw an unexpected figure.

"Sophia? Get out of here now!"

Samuel suddenly lunged forward, glaring at Evelyn. "You're the bitch who turned my family against me!"

Sophia's eyes reddened with panic. "Dad! Do you realize what you're doing?!"

"Shut up!" Samuel tightened his grip on the hostage with a vicious grin. "Today, this woman pays the price!"

Evelyn noticed the hostage swaying unsteadily and spoke calmly, "Let her go. Take me instead."

Meanwhile, live footage of the scene was spreading like wildfire online.

At Sullivan Group's headquarters, Colin Keller stumbled into the conference room.

"Mr. Sullivan! MY is under attack!"

Ethan Sullivan's heart nearly stopped when he saw the familiar figure on screen. Grabbing his jacket, he bolted for the door—only to have his calls repeatedly rejected.

[Evelyn! Fall back immediately!]
[The bomb is real!]
[Answer me!]

His messages vanished into the void. On the surveillance feed, Evelyn was steadily approaching the madman.

"No tricks!" Samuel barked.

Evelyn's trained eyes instantly assessed the explosive device at his waist—powerful enough to level the entire floor.

"Relax," she slowly raised her hands. "I'm just an unarmed woman."

###Chapter 277

Samuel Reynolds curled his lips into a sinister smirk. "Be smart. Hands up and come here to exchange places!"

Evelyn Sullivan slowly raised her arms and stepped toward him. The entire lobby fell silent. Everyone held their breath, their eyes locked on Samuel's finger hovering over the detonator.

After three steps, Sophia Reynolds suddenly rushed forward and grabbed Evelyn's wrist.

"Evelyn, don't go!"

Sophia turned to Samuel, her eyes blazing with fury. "Dad, when will this end?! Do you really want to ruin my life?!"

Samuel sneered. "If it weren't for her poisoning your mind, you wouldn't have abandoned your own father! Everything that's happened to me is her fault! Once she's dead, you'll come back to me!"

"You're insane! Fine, if you want to die, I'll die with you!"

Sophia lunged at him.

Samuel staggered back, dragging the receptionist with him, panic flashing in his eyes. "Stop! One more step and I'll blow us all up!"

Evelyn yanked Sophia back. "He's unstable. Don't provoke him. Since he wants me, I'll talk to him. Once the receptionist is safe, evacuate everyone to the floors above the sixth. Ideally, get them out of the building entirely."

Sophia shook her head desperately, tears welling. "No, let me go instead."

"He won't agree." Evelyn lowered her voice. "I think someone's pulling his strings."

Sophia's pupils constricted. "What do you—"

"What are you whispering about?!" Samuel barked. "Evelyn, you have thirty seconds! Come here or we all die!"

"Remember what I said." Evelyn gave Sophia's hand a reassuring squeeze and walked toward Samuel.

Watching the unrecognizable madness in her father's eyes, Sophia felt her heart shatter. The man who had once carried her on his shoulders to watch fireworks and brought her dolls was gone—just like the Reynolds Corporation.

"Let her go," Evelyn said, stopping in front of Samuel.

He shoved the receptionist away. "Turn around!"

When Evelyn didn't move, he brandished the detonator. "Now! Or I'll send us all to hell!"

Evelyn slowly turned. Cold metal pressed against the back of her neck.

Sophia seized the moment, helping the trembling receptionist flee.

"Who said you could leave?!" Samuel roared.

"You wanted me," Evelyn said calmly. "Let them go. I'm staying."

"Shut up! If it weren't for you, Sophia's money would already be mine!"

"And?"

Samuel faltered. He'd only meant to intimidate Evelyn into forcing Sophia's compliance—not face this unnerving composure.

"You're not afraid to die?!" He jammed the gun harder against her skull.

Evelyn chuckled. "Terrified. But what good would that do? Though I doubt you really want to die for someone else's agenda."

The words ignited him. "Shut your mouth! If I die, you're coming with me!"

He slammed his thumb down on the detonator.

Beep.

The display on his chest lit up. Crimson numbers began their relentless countdown:

30:00.

###Chapter 278

The grand hall plunged into dead silence.

Every eye froze on the flashing red numbers strapped to Samuel Reynolds' chest. The air turned glacial.

Sophia Reynolds' face drained of color, her lips trembling uncontrollably.

"Transfer the money now, Sophia!" Samuel snarled, his fingers digging into Evelyn Sullivan's shoulder. "Or we all die together!"

Evelyn suddenly laughed.

"What's so funny?!" Samuel's grip tightened violently.

"I'm laughing at how easily you were manipulated." Evelyn's voice held terrifying calm. "Military-grade explosives? You really think someone like you could obtain these?"

Samuel's pupils contracted sharply.

"What are you implying?"

"It means—" Evelyn tilted her head slightly, "you've been played. These explosives are very real, and—"

Her words were cut off by rapid footsteps.

Ethan Sullivan's imposing figure appeared in the doorway, his tailored suit immaculate, his expression stormy.

"Release her."

Three words that made the temperature in the hall plummet.

Samuel's hands began shaking. "M-Mr. Sullivan..."

"Three seconds." Ethan checked his watch. "Or the Reynolds family cemetery gets relocated to the landfill tomorrow."

Evelyn felt Samuel's entire body stiffen behind her.

"Impossible..." Samuel muttered. "He said this was just a performance..."

Evelyn seized on the slip. "Who said that? Simon Reynolds?"

Samuel's eyes widened comically at being exposed.

Suddenly, the bomb's countdown accelerated with an ear-piercing beep.

"Two minutes left." Evelyn announced coolly. "Convinced now?"

Beads of sweat formed on Samuel's forehead as his entire frame shook violently.

"N-no... this can't be..."

Ethan strode forward.

"Stay back!" Samuel scrambled away in panic.

"One minute." Ethan continued advancing. "Either let me disarm it, or we all die here."

Evelyn stared at Ethan in shock.

He knew bomb disposal?

Samuel finally collapsed, knees hitting the marble floor. "D-disarm it! Quickly!"

Ethan moved like lightning. His long fingers expertly opened the bomb's casing.

The timer froze at 00:23.

Not a sound could be heard in the hall. Everyone held their breath.

A soft click echoed.

Ethan tossed the detached detonator aside and fixed his gaze on the crumpled figure of Samuel.

"Now. We settle accounts."

###Chapter 279

Evelyn Sullivan withdrew her hand with cold indifference. "Suit yourself."

Samuel Reynolds' forehead glistened with sweat. He'd only intended to extort money from Sophia, not gamble with his life.

Ethan Sullivan glanced at the timer, his voice icy. "Eighteen minutes left. The bomb squad won't make it."

"Then... I'm dead?"

Samuel's eyes flashed with venom. "If I die, you're all coming with me!"

Evelyn lowered her gaze, considering. "I can disarm it."

"How do I know you're not trying to kill me?"

She nearly laughed at his stupidity. "I'll be right beside you. If it blows, we all go."

His Adam's apple bobbed as he hesitated.

"Well?" Evelyn checked the timer impatiently. "Keep wasting time and everyone dies."

"Fine... Fine! Do it!"

A deep voice cut in.

"I'll help."

Evelyn frowned at Ethan. "Stay out of this!"

Bomb disposal left no room for error. She wouldn't risk him.

He stepped beside her anyway.

"Don't be afraid. I'm here."

"I said no!" Her glare could freeze lava. "Get out now!"

"I know some bomb mechanics."

"I don't need—"

"Fifteen minutes left." Ethan watched the timer. "Keep arguing?"

Her jaw clenched. "Your funeral."

When the scissors arrived, only the three remained in the hall. Samuel's legs shook—he finally believed the bomb was real.

Each tick echoed like Death's footsteps. Beads of sweat formed on Evelyn's brow. The device was simple, but every wire glowed crimson.

With two wires remaining, time nearly expired.

"Do you even know what you're doing?!" Samuel's voice trembled.

"Shut up!"

Evelyn inhaled sharply and turned to Ethan. "Step back."

Once he retreated to safety, she gripped the scissors.

Snip.

One red wire severed.

###Chapter 280

The bomb's countdown suddenly stopped, plunging the space into eerie silence.

Evelyn Sullivan and Samuel Reynolds exchanged glances, their tense nerves beginning to relax—until a piercing beep shattered the quiet.

The red numbers began flashing wildly.

A pair of strong hands suddenly grabbed the bomb and sprinted outside.

"Ethan!"

Evelyn's scream tore through the air as she stumbled after him, catching only a glimpse of his retreating figure.

Boom—

The deafening explosion sent her flying backward.

In the last moment before darkness claimed her, all she saw was Ethan being swallowed by flames.

"Evelyn!"

Sophia Reynolds' frantic voice jolted Evelyn awake. The sharp scent of disinfectant stung her nose as she realized she was in a hospital.

"Where's Ethan?" She yanked out her IV, blood trickling down her hand.

Sophia quickly restrained her. "He's in the next room. His injuries are serious, but—"

Before she could finish, Evelyn was already barefoot and running.

Her heart nearly stopped when she pushed open the door.

Ethan sat propped up in bed, crimson seeping through the bandage at his temple. Hearing the noise, he lifted his head slowly, his deep eyes reflecting her disheveled state.

Evelyn threw herself into his arms, her trembling fingers clutching his hospital gown.

"You scared me to death..." Hot tears soaked through the fabric.

Ethan stiffened for a moment before gently wrapping his arms around her slender shoulders. "I'm okay."

"I'm sorry... I dragged you into this again."

"I did it willingly."

Evelyn pulled back, her red-rimmed eyes locking onto his. "Ethan, let's start over."

The air froze.

His Adam's apple bobbed. "Don't pity me."

"I want to be with you." Her voice was soft but clear. "When that bomb went off, I finally understood."

After a long silence, Ethan finally cupped her face. "Okay."

Evelyn smiled through her tears, only then noticing her bare feet. Ethan frowned and lifted her onto the bed, his warm hands enveloping her icy toes.

"Ethan!"

A shrill voice shattered the moment. Isabella Jackson stood in the doorway, her meticulously applied makeup unable to mask her twisted expression.

Ethan didn't even glance up. "Get out."

"I came to visit—"

"Do I need to repeat myself?"

Isabella's gaze burned into their joined hands before she finally slammed the door. As the glass rattled, Evelyn secretly hooked her pinky around Ethan's.

###Chapter 281

Isabella Jackson's beautiful eyes burned with venom as she shot Evelyn Sullivan one last glare before leaving.

Ethan Sullivan moved to approach, but Evelyn shoved him away.

"Wasn't the great Mr. Sullivan always so tender toward delicate flowers?" Her lips curled in mockery. "Why so cold to your First Love now?"

He chuckled low, his thumb grazing the delicate skin of her wrist.

"Jealous?"

"Don't flatter yourself." She wrenched her hand free. "I'm just curious when your tastes changed."

Suddenly, his hand cradled the back of her head, his breath scorching against her skin.

"Now."

Before she could react, his lips captured hers in a searing kiss. Evelyn struggled briefly before melting into its intensity.

"Bastard..." she gasped when they finally parted.

Ethan nuzzled her flushed cheek with his nose.

"Now do you know who I want?"

She turned her face away. "I can let the past go. But from now on, if you dare have even the slightest connection with Isabella—"

Her words were cut off as his mouth claimed hers again.

"As you wish, Mrs. Sullivan," he murmured against her lips, amusement lacing his rough voice.

At the mention of Samuel Reynolds, Ethan's gaze turned icy.

"The police are interrogating him. But..." He paused. "The mastermind won't stay quiet for long."

Evelyn's eyes flashed.

"Simon Reynolds?"

Ethan arched a brow. "Seems we're on the same page."

He pressed a kiss to her hair. "Leave this to me. Focus on recovering."

Meanwhile, a loud crash echoed through the office at Sullivan Corp.

"Useless! Can't even handle a woman!" Simon Reynolds kicked over a coffee table and grabbed his phone. "Arrange a meeting with Samuel immediately!"

Outside MY Fashion Group, bystanders swarmed the explosion site, phones raised to capture the chaos.

The hashtag #SullivanProtectsHisWife rocketed to the top of trending.

[Shocking! Ethan Sullivan's wife is actually Evelyn Sullivan?!]

[Rich people drama! Wasn't he always parading her sister around?]

[Wrong focus! This is the second bombing!]

[Waiting for the catfight!]

Evelyn hurled her phone at Ethan's chest.

"Calculating as always, Mr. Sullivan. Still tying me to you after divorce?"

He calmly locked the screen.

"It was an emergency."

"Issue a clarification statement now!"

In one swift motion, he pinned her to the hospital bed, his breath hot against her ear.

"Darling, do you really think anyone would believe it now?"

The door burst open.

Lucas Laurier's fruit basket hit the floor with a thud.

"You two...reconciled?"

Ethan didn't release her, tightening his embrace instead.

"As you see." His challenging gaze lingered on the stunned trio in the doorway, especially Ryan Paisley.

###Chapter 282

"Let go or I'll really get angry!" Evelyn Sullivan's cheeks burned crimson as she pushed against Ethan Sullivan's chest.

The tips of her ears turned pink. Only then did Ethan release her with an amused smile.

The moment she was free, Evelyn leaped off the bed. She fled in such a hurry that she even stepped into Ethan's slippers. She didn't stop to greet Lucas Laurier and the others waiting in the living room.

"Tsk tsk. Bad timing, huh?" Lucas leaned against the doorframe with a teasing grin.

Ethan calmly adjusted his hospital gown. "Then leave."

"Prioritizing love over friendship!" Lucas shook his head with a laugh.

Ryan Paisley suddenly spoke up. "You two made up?"

"Yes."

Ethan's gaze lifted to meet his. The temperature in the room instantly dropped.

Ryan's throat moved as he silently looked away. He thought his chance had finally come. Turns out it was just false hope.

"Let's go." Sensing the tension, Lucas was the first to turn around.

Once they left, Ethan dialed Colin Keller. "Find out who's behind Samuel Reynolds."

...

In the visitation room, Samuel Reynolds stared blankly at his brother Simon Reynolds across the table.

The moment those explosives detonated, he knew this brother never considered him family.

"Simon. I knew you'd come." In the end, Samuel chose silence. His ungrateful daughter Sophia was unreliable. His only hope now was this brother.

An unspoken agreement passed between them—Simon would pull strings outside while Samuel kept his mouth shut.

Exiting the police station, Simon exhaled deeply. He called Sophia, his voice icy. "Come to my place."

Thirty minutes later, Sophia stood in his living room.

"Just say it, Uncle."

Simon sighed. "Your father's too old for prison. You're close with Evelyn..."

"You want me to beg for leniency?" Sophia let out a cold laugh. "He nearly killed two people!"

"He's your father!"

Sophia clenched her fists. "The day my mother jumped off that building, I became fatherless."

As she turned to leave, she didn't see Simon retrieving the recorder hidden under the coffee table.

He never intended to save his gambling addict brother. But Samuel needed to know—no one else would care about a failed murderer except him.

###Chapter 283

Evelyn Sullivan and Ethan Sullivan's injuries weren't severe, so they were discharged quickly.

"Move into Imperial Court with me." Ethan stood at the hospital room door, his tone leaving no room for refusal.

Evelyn packed her belongings without looking up. "Fine. But I take the guest room."

His brow furrowed slightly before he relented.

The move went smoothly. Evelyn wheeled her suitcase into the guest room and locked the door behind her.

The aroma of food drifted from the living room.

"Did you order takeout?" She eyed the elaborate spread of four dishes and soup on the dining table, surprised.

Ethan was setting the table. "Eat first."

Over dinner, Evelyn picked at the steamed sea bass. "Any progress with Samuel Reynolds?"

"He insists the bombing was his idea alone." Ethan ladled soup into her bowl. "But Simon Reynolds paid off his five-million gambling debt."

She smirked. "No wonder he's so loyal."

After dinner, Ethan's phone rang. Glancing at the caller ID, he excused himself to the study.

"Mr. Sullivan, should we continue pursuing the Brocade project?" Colin Keller's voice came through the receiver.

Ethan stood by the window, the night casting shadows on his sharp profile. "Withdraw as soon as Isabella Jackson takes over."

Hanging up, he massaged his temples. He needed to fulfill those three conditions with Isabella quickly.

Meanwhile, Isabella stared at her phone screen, face darkening.

"Sullivan Group is pulling funding?" She hurled her phone onto the couch. "Evelyn, this is your doing again!"

With trembling fingers, she dialed Margaret Sullivan, voice quivering. "Aunt Margaret, there's something important you should know..."

In an upscale café's private room, Isabella stirred her latte.

"My sister wasn't lost as a child," she whispered. "My parents abandoned her on purpose."

Margaret's spoon clattered against the saucer.

"A feng shui master claimed she'd bring ruin to the Jackson family." Isabella's eyes gleamed strangely. "That master died suddenly soon after."

Margaret returned to the Sullivan estate shaking uncontrollably.

"What's wrong?" Henry Sullivan set aside his newspaper.

"Remember Master Zhang who did our feng shui readings?" Her voice trembled. "He was right—Evelyn is a jinx!"

Henry's expression darkened. "Nonsense!"

"The Jacksons knew it, that's why they discarded her!" Margaret stood abruptly. "Ever since Ethan married her, our family's been plagued with misfortune!"

Outside, lightning split the night sky.

###Chapter 284

Henry Sullivan's gaze was sharp as a blade, sweeping coldly over Margaret Sullivan's face.

"Instead of being paranoid all day, why don't you go out and relax?" He adjusted his suit cuff. "I have a meeting at the company."

Margaret grabbed his arm.

"Ethan must cut ties with Evelyn Sullivan completely! That woman will be the death of him!"

"Don't be ridiculous!" Henry shook off her hand. "Adrian just joined the company. Ethan already has enough on his plate."

Flames of anger burned in Margaret's eyes.

"Henry Sullivan! All you care about is the company. Do you even care if your son lives or dies?"

"Suit yourself."

He walked toward the elevator without looking back.

"Stop right there!"

The elevator doors slid shut, reflecting her distorted image.

This business marriage had long been a hollow shell. After giving birth to twins, Henry never stepped into her bedroom again. Years of hysterical arguments had only resulted in icy civility.

Ethan was her only pride.

She would never let anyone ruin him.

Confronting Ethan directly wouldn’t work. She needed another plan.

Evelyn Sullivan had just stepped into her office when Simon Reynolds blocked the doorway.

"President Sullivan, for Sophia's sake, let my brother go."

She set her bag on the desk without glancing up.

"Are you pleading for a murderer?"

"He was just following orders! Sophia has already lost her mother. She can’t lose her father too!"

Evelyn suddenly smiled.

"You seem to be missing the point."

"What do you mean?"

"This is a criminal case." She lifted her gaze. "No one involved will escape justice—including the mastermind."

Simon's face paled.

"Don’t push this too far!"

"Save that speech for the judge." Evelyn flipped open a file. "By the way, starting today, you’ll handle customer service. I’m taking over the fabric division."

"You can’t just demote me!"

"Twenty-three percent complaint rate, Mr. Reynolds." She twirled a pen. "Focus on improving service quality."

Simon slammed the door so hard the glass rattled.

Unfazed, Evelyn picked up the intercom. "Replace this with a soundproof door."

As evening fell, her phone lit up with Ethan’s call.

"Grandmother wants us to have dinner at Harmony Manor."

Evelyn’s fingers stilled.

"She knows?"

"I told her."

"..."

"Not happy?"

She rubbed her temples. "You couldn’t wait, could you?"

"We can reschedule if you don’t want to go."

"No need." She glanced at her lipstick. "Pick me up after work."

After hanging up, she pressed her lips together in the mirror.

The rose-tinted gloss shimmered under the light.

###Chapter 285

The elevator doors slid open, revealing Sophia Reynolds standing directly in Evelyn Sullivan's path.

Sophia's eyes swept over Evelyn with an amused smirk.

"My, my. Someone's glowing today. Ethan must be treating you well."

Evelyn's ears turned pink. She shot her friend an indignant glare.

"Stop talking nonsense!"

Sophia blinked innocently.

"I merely meant you two have reconciled. Your mind went somewhere else, didn't it?"

Evelyn fell silent.

Leaning closer, Sophia lowered her voice. "That blush... Did something happen last night—"

"Director Reynolds!" Evelyn gritted her teeth. "Seems like your workload isn't heavy enough."

Sophia immediately raised her hands in surrender. "I'm off to work overtime!"

As they walked toward the lobby together, Evelyn suddenly remembered something.

"Is Alexander still bothering you?"

"Rejected him ages ago." Sophia waved a hand dismissively. "I'm seeing someone new now."

Evelyn's eyes lit up. "Who?"

"Top secret." Sophia flashed a mysterious smile. "I'll introduce you when things are more serious."

Outside the building, Ethan's Maybach waited by the curb.

Evelyn opened the car door to find a bouquet of sunflowers resting on the seat.

"You remembered these are my favorite?"

Ethan kept his eyes on the road. "The vase in our living room never runs out of them."

That simple statement warmed Evelyn's heart.

At Harmony Manor, a gray Rolls-Royce stood out conspicuously.

Inside, Adrian Sullivan was entertaining Grandma Sullivan with jokes.

His smile faded slightly when he saw them enter.

"I'll let you spend time with Grandma. I need some air in the garden."

As he passed by, Evelyn distinctly felt the weight of his lingering gaze.

Grandma Sullivan grasped Evelyn's hand tightly. "You've really made up?"

Ethan opened his mouth to speak, but Grandma cut him off with a glare.

"No one asked you! If this girl suffers again, you'll answer to me first!"

"Grandma..." Ethan's expression darkened.

Evelyn suppressed a laugh and intervened. "He's been good to me lately."

Grandma snorted. "He'd better be!"

Ethan pinched the bridge of his nose impassively.

Evelyn secretly squeezed his hand before turning back. "How is Adrian adjusting at Sullivan Corp?"

###Chapter 286

Ethan's eyes darkened slightly. His fingers tapped twice on the armrest.

"Passable."

Grandma Sullivan sighed, fine wrinkles forming at the corners of her eyes. "Adrian is struggling right now. After all, he's your cousin..."

She turned away before finishing.

Ethan's expression remained unchanged. "As long as he behaves."

The position of Sullivan Group's CEO should have been Adrian's.

After that car accident years ago, Adrian fled overseas.

It was Ethan who single-handedly built Sullivan Group into what it was today.

"Once he's settled, I'll provide him with startup funds," Grandma Sullivan murmured, tracing the rim of her teacup. "Look out for him."

"Mhm."

The study lights burned late into the night.

Grandma Sullivan clasped Evelyn's hand, her palm warm. "Thank you for giving him another chance, dear."

She often wished Evelyn was her own granddaughter.

"Grandma, the future is unpredictable."

"If that boy messes up again, I'll be the first to skin him alive."

Evelyn's eyes grew moist.

"By the way," Grandma Sullivan suddenly lowered her voice, "do you know any suitable young ladies?"

"For Adrian?"

"His parents are gone. I worry about him."

Evelyn thought for a moment. "How about throwing a welcome banquet?"

Grandma Sullivan's eyes lit up. "This weekend!"

Under the chandelier's glow, four people sat with hidden thoughts.

Adrian remained silent throughout, only giving curt replies when Grandma spoke.

When Evelyn glanced at him for the third time, Ethan abruptly set down his fork.

The car ride home was suffocatingly tense.

"Mr. Sullivan?" Evelyn poked his rigid profile. "Who pissed you off?"

###Chapter 287

Ethan Sullivan's eyes turned icy, his voice laced with bitterness.

"At dinner, your gaze was practically glued to Adrian Sullivan. Anyone would think you two were the couple."

Evelyn Sullivan couldn't help but laugh, tilting her head. "You're upset over that?"

"Isn't that enough?"

"More than enough." She smiled, explaining, "Grandmother wanted me to introduce him to potential girlfriends. I suggested hosting a welcome banquet to invite socialites from Rongcheng."

Ethan snorted. "Welcome banquet? More like a matchmaking event."

Evelyn fell silent.

After a pause, she ventured, "You seem to have issues with Adrian?"

"I don't." He turned away. "I just don't like him."

Noticing his dark expression, Evelyn wisely dropped the subject.

When they returned to Imperial Court, Margaret Sullivan was waiting.

Spotting Evelyn, Margaret's eyes dimmed, clearly surprised they had reconciled.

Evelyn nodded politely. "I'll head to my room."

"Wait." Margaret suddenly stopped her, smiling warmly. "I brought dumplings. Freeze them, and you can cook them whenever you like."

Evelyn hesitated before accepting the insulated box, puzzled by Margaret's sudden kindness.

"Thank you, Mrs. Sullivan."

Margaret patted her hand. "I was too stubborn before. Your relationship is your business. I shouldn't interfere."

After seeing Margaret out, Evelyn turned—only to be pinned against the refrigerator by Ethan.

"Eth—"

His lips crushed hers before she could finish.

Clutching his collar, Evelyn arched into the kiss.

He only pulled away when she gasped for air.

"Move into the master bedroom tonight."

"No." She was firm. "We agreed on separate rooms."

He studied her determined gaze before sighing. "Fine."

As Evelyn turned to leave, he yanked her back.

"Compensation."

Their heated kiss was interrupted by a ringing phone.

Ethan checked the caller ID. "Work emergency. I have to go."

"Go ahead."

He gave her a long look before turning—only to freeze when she suddenly called out, "Wait!"

His back stiffened, fingers clenching unconsciously.

###Chapter 288

Evelyn rose on her toes, her slender fingers smoothing the wrinkles from Ethan's tie. A soft smile played on her lips, her eyes shimmering with warmth.

"Your tie was crooked."

Ethan suddenly pulled her close, his arm wrapping around her waist. His deep voice brushed against her ear. "Wait for me."

"Mm."

She watched his car disappear down the driveway before turning back to the house. She didn't notice the vehicle accelerating sharply around the corner.

Inside a private room at the Royal Emperor Club, Isabella pressed herself against Colin, her cheeks flushed. Colin stood rigid, beads of sweat forming on his forehead.

"Where's Mr. Sullivan...?"

The door burst open. Ethan's imposing figure appeared in the doorway, and Colin nearly wept with relief.

"Mr. Sullivan!"

Ethan's cold gaze swept over Isabella's dazed state. "The doctor is on the way."

Colin looked miserable, his shirt unbuttoned at the collar.

"The business partners spiked her drink. By the time I realized—"

"Handle it," Ethan cut him off. "Next time, call a doctor immediately."

An hour later, the doctor put away his stethoscope.

"She'll be fine once the drugs wear off."

Ethan turned to leave. Colin hurried after him. "Sir, my phone broke—"

Ethan paused, tossing him a keycard. "Use mine."

After settling Isabella in a room, Colin exhaled in relief. The moment he stepped out of the hotel, Ethan's call came through.

"Find Evelyn."

Meanwhile, Evelyn stood before the largest private room at LoseDemon. She took a deep breath and pushed the door open.

The room fell silent.

A man wearing a demon mask lounged on the sofa, idly tapping his glass.

"Iris, did you like my gift?"

Evelyn met his gaze. "Scorpion, we need to talk."

He chuckled, his eyes glinting coldly behind the mask.

"Talk? You didn't want to talk when you slaughtered twelve of my men."

Her fists clenched. "That was a mission."

"Pity." Scorpion rose slowly. "I don't take missions anymore. Only revenge."

The bodyguards in the room stepped forward in unison. Evelyn narrowed her eyes, her hand subtly moving toward her waist.

"Then only one of us walks out alive tonight."

###Chapter 289

"I could let you go... if you do something for me."

Evelyn Sullivan stepped out of LoseDemon, Scorpion's icy voice still echoing in her ears. Though he claimed to give her time to consider, she knew there was no real choice.

Her mind weighed heavy as she walked toward the parking lot. Just as her fingers brushed the car door, a sharp voice cut through the silence.

"Evelyn!"

She spun around. Ethan Sullivan stood three meters away, impeccably dressed in a suit, his eyes frosty.

"What are you doing here at this hour? You should be home asleep."

Her breath hitched. She hadn't sensed his approach.

"Did you come looking for me?" she asked softly.

He closed the distance in long strides, his shadow engulfing her. "Answer the question."

"It's personal." She turned her face away. "Do I have to explain?"

The air turned glacial.

After a long pause, Ethan turned and yanked open the car door. "Get in."

The ride was suffocatingly silent. Evelyn stared at the neon lights flashing past the window while Ethan's knuckles whitened around the steering wheel.

At the villa, she muttered a quick "goodnight" and retreated to the guest room. Ethan stared at the closed door, his gaze darkening.

They'd started over, yet her secrets only multiplied.

The next morning, Colin Keller placed an investigation report on Ethan's desk.

"Ms. Sullivan entered a VIP room at LoseDemon last night, but all surveillance footage was erased. We can't identify who she met."

Ethan crushed the pen in his hand, ink splattering across the documents.

"Keep digging."

"Sir..." Colin hesitated. "Unless Ms. Sullivan herself tells us—"

The office temperature plummeted. Colin held his breath until Ethan finally growled, "Get out."

Once alone, Ethan dialed an encrypted number.

"I need everything on Scorpion."

Meanwhile, in the MY conference room, Sophia Reynolds nudged Evelyn for the third time.

After the meeting, Sophia cornered her. "Trouble with Ethan?"

"Just tired." Evelyn rubbed her temples.

"Take a break."

"No need." Evelyn hesitated. "About your father..."

"Follow the law." Sophia's voice was firm. "No special treatment."

Silence reclaimed the office. Evelyn stared at her phone, then finally dialed a memorized number.

"Changed your mind?" Scorpion's voice dripped with amusement. "My dear Iris."

###Chapter 290

"I accept your terms from last night."

Scorpion's laughter crackled through the phone, laced with amusement.

"Smart people make smart choices."

Evelyn Sullivan's grip tightened around her phone, her knuckles turning white.

"Remember your promise. If anyone I care about loses so much as a single hair, I'll make you wish you were never born."

"See you in three months."

The call ended, plunging the office into silence. She stared at the darkened screen, exhaling slowly.

——

The penthouse suite of Grand Hyatt.

Isabella Jackson woke with a body that ached as if it had been run over by a truck. Her panicked gaze darted around the room until she confirmed her clothes were intact.

Fragmented memories flashed through her mind—the drink, the dizziness, and... Ethan Sullivan's silhouette?

Her trembling fingers dialed Colin Keller's number.

"Was there something in my drink last night?"

After hearing his explanation, her nails dug into her palms unconsciously.

"Did... Ethan come?"

The unnatural pause on the other end made her pulse quicken.

"You must have imagined it."

Hanging up, Isabella stood before the bathroom mirror with a cold smile. The front desk had confirmed her suspicion—the room was registered under Ethan's name.

"Colin..." She wiped the smudged lipstick from her mouth, her eyes glinting with malice.

——

The Jackson family villa blazed with light.

William Jackson's expression darkened further at the sight of her.

"Why did you hide the MY situation from me?"

Isabella hesitated briefly before donning an innocent look.

"Brocade has been keeping me too busy..."

Of course she wouldn't admit she'd planned to take this secret to her grave.

Grandma Eleanor's call came sooner than expected.

"Evelyn's status has changed now. You must—"

William cut her off impatiently. "I know my limits."

After hanging up, father and daughter exchanged loaded glances. The chandelier's light cast shifting shadows across Isabella's face, revealing the storm brewing in her eyes.

###Chapter 291

"How could she become CEO of MY when she knows nothing?" Victoria Farley's voice dripped with disbelief.

William Jackson pondered for a moment before speaking slowly. "Ethan Sullivan must have given it to her. Weren't the Sullivans acquiring MY recently?"

"He gave Brocade to Isabella, and now MY to Evelyn. What's his game?" Victoria's voice rose sharply. "Does he want both of them?!"

William narrowed his eyes. If Ethan truly intended that, he wouldn't mind offering both daughters. To him, they were merely bargaining chips. Only his illegitimate son, raised in secret, was the true heir to the Jackson fortune.

"I'll find a way to sound Ethan out."

After hanging up, William hesitated before dialing Evelyn's number.

In the conference room, Evelyn was reviewing quarterly reports when her phone screen suddenly projected onto the display—William's caller ID glaringly obvious.

Quincy Howard tensed. "Ms. Sullivan, this—"

"Decline it." Evelyn didn't even glance up. "Continue the presentation."

William listened to the dial tone, his expression darkening. The girl was still holding a grudge. He'd have to visit MY in person. It was a perfect opportunity to assess the company's potential—perhaps a stepping stone for Jackson Group's expansion into fashion.

The vision of his empire growing brought an unconscious smirk to his lips.

"Ms. Sullivan, your father is waiting in the reception room," River Blue said cautiously.

Evelyn paused mid-step, her gaze turning icy. "Turn him away next time."

River realized her mistake and quickly apologized.

Pushing open the reception room door, Evelyn didn't bother sitting. "What do you want, Mr. Jackson?"

William suppressed his anger and forced a smile. "Evelyn, it's been so long since you came home. Join us for dinner tonight. Your mother and sister miss you."

Evelyn nearly laughed out loud. Victoria and Isabella missing her? More like wishing she'd vanish forever.

"Mr. Jackson, we severed ties long ago." She turned to leave. "This had better be your last visit to MY."

"Wait!" William stood abruptly. "Blood is thicker than water. We're still family!"

Evelyn looked back, her eyes mocking. "You're only here because you found out I'm MY's CEO. Suddenly, I'm useful?"

William's face twisted. "Nonsense! I'm your father. Do you really think I'd harm you?"

"You abandoned me twenty-three years ago on a fortune teller's whim. You cut me off for the White family's sake. And let's not forget a lifetime of favoring Isabella." Evelyn enunciated each word. "Whatever you're after, forget it."

Leaving William seething, Evelyn walked away without a backward glance.

Back in her office, Sophia Reynolds lounged with crossed legs, waiting. "Sign this." She leaned in conspiratorially. "Guess who Design just hired?"

###Chapter 292

"Who?" Evelyn Sullivan didn't look up from her desk.

"Fiona Ferguson!" Sophia Reynolds leaned excitedly over the office table.

Evelyn's fountain pen paused mid-stroke. After a moment's thought, she shook her head. "Don't recall."

Sophia's eyes widened. "The designer who exposed Isabella's forged signature at the charity gala last time!"

"Oh." Evelyn resumed signing documents.

"She won third place in the National Design Competition!" Sophia slapped the desk enthusiastically. "If she joins us, our new collection launch will be the talk of the industry!"

Evelyn handed over the signed file. "Noted."

"That's all you have to say?" Sophia pouted. "Back when we started MY, we fought tooth and nail just to hire a fresh art school graduate."

Evelyn smiled faintly. "MY deserves better designers now."

Sophia's eyes sparkled. "You're right! We'll dominate the industry soon enough!"

After seeing Sophia out, Evelyn's phone buzzed violently.

Isabella's name flashed on the screen.

Evelyn declined the call immediately. The calls kept coming. On the fifth attempt, she finally answered.

"What do you want?"

Isabella's smug laughter crackled through the receiver. "Ethan stayed with me all night yesterday, dear sister."

Evelyn's gaze turned icy. "Shall I forward this recording to him for verification?"

"You—" Isabella's voice sharpened. "That CEO who drugged me? His company went bankrupt this morning! I'll always be Ethan's priority!"

"Finished?" Evelyn's tone remained calm.

"Stop pretending! I'll always be the one who—"

Click.

Evelyn ended the call and blocked the number without hesitation.

Isabella stared at her phone, then burst into laughter. She turned to her secretary mid-report. "What happened to last quarter's sales figures?"

Lily Lu nervously presented the documents. "Only half of MY's numbers..."

"Are all our designers incompetent?" Isabella slammed the papers on her desk. "Tell them to redo everything in a week!"

"That timeline might be..."

"Fire anyone who can't deliver!" Isabella snapped. "I want designs that crush MY, not this garbage!"

Lily bowed her head and retreated, quietly closing the office door behind her.
###Chapter 293

"Isabella, do you have too much free time on your hands?" Evelyn slammed the documents onto the desk. "The design department's progress is unacceptable. What kind of director are you?"

Lily Lu paled. "Evelyn, we've been working overtime—"

"I don't want excuses!" Evelyn cut her off coldly. "I want fifty new designs within a week. Otherwise, someone else will take your position."

Lily clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms.

Stepping out of the office, she took a deep breath and called the design team.

"Everyone, meeting room. Now."

The moment the new demand was announced, chaos erupted.

"Fifty?! Is she insane?"
"She still hasn't explained the plagiarism scandal from the last competition, and now this?"
"I heard she and Ethan—"

Lily slammed the table. "Enough! Anyone who wants to quit can leave right now!"

Meanwhile, in the MY CEO's office.

Evelyn stared at her computer screen, unable to focus.

Last night, Ethan had claimed a company emergency. But Sophia had seen him escorting a drunk Isabella into a hotel.

Her phone rang.

"Evelyn." Ethan's voice came through the receiver. "What would you like for dinner? I'll have the kitchen prepare it."

Her grip tightened on the phone. "Where were you last night?"

A noticeable pause.

"There was an urgent matter at the office—"

"Ethan!" She shot to her feet. "You're still lying to me?"

After a long silence, he finally spoke. "Isabella was drunk. I just took her to the hotel."

"And then?" Her voice trembled. "What happened there?"

"Nothing! I left right after dropping her off. You can check the security footage!"

Evelyn hung up with a bitter laugh.

Thirty minutes later, Ethan's text appeared: I'm outside your office. We need to talk.

In the underground parking lot.

Ethan grabbed her arm as she tried to leave. "At least let me explain."

"Explain what?" She yanked free. "How you keep making exceptions for her? Or why you lied to me?"

"It was an accident. Her client kept pressuring her to drink, and Colin was unavailable—"

"Enough!" She cut him off. "The same excuses every time. I gave you chances, Ethan."

As she turned to leave, he pulled her into an embrace from behind.

"Trust me one last time." His voice held rare desperation. "I swear I'll cut all contact with her."

She pried his hands away. "I can't believe your promises anymore."

For the next week, Evelyn stayed at the office.

Until the call came from Harmony Manor: "Madam, the family expects you at Master Adrian's welcome banquet tonight."

###Chapter 294

The morning sun had just begun to filter into Harmony Manor when Mrs. Sullivan eagerly sent the driver to fetch Evelyn.

"Evelyn dear, come try these freshly made osmanthus cakes," the elderly woman said warmly, guiding her to the dining table with a smile.

Evelyn obediently took her seat. The sweet pastry melted on her tongue.

"Grandmother, you look radiant today."

Mrs. Sullivan patted her hand affectionately. "Stay by my side at tonight's gala. I've been out of society for years and hardly recognize any of these socialites anymore. You'll have to introduce them to me."

"Of course. Don't worry."

Though the event wouldn't begin until evening, the manor buzzed with activity. Gardeners trimmed hedges, chefs prepped ingredients in the kitchen, and maids flitted about, polishing every surface.

With time to spare, Evelyn selected a poetry book from the study and retreated to the garden pavilion.

A gentle breeze rustled the pages as she read. After two poems, a tall figure blocked her light.

"Cousin?" She looked up, surprised.

Adrian Sullivan, dressed in a casual blazer, settled gracefully across from her. "Grandmother mentioned you were reading. I thought I'd join you."

His gaze lingered on the book in her hands.

"Did you need something?" Evelyn closed the volume.

Adrian chuckled. "You know Grandmother's intentions. But I have no interest in romance right now. I'd like your help."

Her fingers absently traced the book's spine.

"You want me to dissuade her?" She shook her head. "I'm afraid I can't."

"Miss Sullivan," Adrian leaned forward, "you of all people understand what it's like to be tied to someone you don't love. I won't lead anyone on or pretend for Grandmother's sake."

Evelyn's fingertips whitened against the book.

"What are you two discussing?"

Ethan Sullivan's icy voice cut through the pavilion. He strode to Evelyn's side, his glare sharp as a blade toward Adrian.

"If you have business, take it to Grandmother. Don't disturb my wife."

Adrian rose, giving Evelyn a meaningful look. "My apologies, sister-in-law."

Once he was gone, Ethan turned to Evelyn. "Stay away from him."

She frowned. "Mr. Sullivan, we still have unresolved matters between us. Keep your distance."

Before she could react, she was pulled into a warm embrace.

"I just helped you," Ethan murmured against her ear. "Doesn't that count for something?"

Evelyn shoved him away, retreating to the pavilion's edge.

"If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have been subjected to your cousin's barbs," she said coldly. "Everyone in New York knows how little regard the great Mr. Sullivan has for his wife."

Ethan's eyes darkened.

As Evelyn turned to leave, his arms encircled her from behind. His warm breath against her neck sent a shiver down her spine.

"What will it take for you to forgive me?" he whispered.

She broke free. "That's not for me to say."

Without looking back, she left the pavilion—though her traitorous heartbeat betrayed her.

Back in the main house, Mrs. Sullivan beckoned.

"Evelyn, come see these jewels."

###Chapter 295

"Evelyn, come help me pick a dress." Mrs. Sullivan stood in front of the walk-in closet, beckoning her over.

Evelyn approached, her fingers gliding over the hangers before stopping at a Dior haute couture set. "Grandmother, this would suit you perfectly."

The elderly woman's eyes lit up. "You always understand me. I had my eye on this one earlier."

At lunch, Margaret and Henry Sullivan arrived late. Mrs. Sullivan set down her chopsticks. "Tonight's gala will be filled with society's elite. Keep an eye out for a suitable match for Adrian."

Margaret's expression tightened, her grip on the chopsticks turning white-knuckled. If Adrian married someone of equal status, wouldn't that threaten Ethan's inheritance?

"Understood," she replied stiffly.

Evelyn glanced at Adrian, hoping he would speak up. But he kept his head down, silently shoveling food into his mouth.

After lunch, Evelyn was about to rest when Ethan barged in with a styling team.

"What are you doing?" She frowned in annoyance.

Leaning against the doorframe, he said, "Every debutante will be dressed to the nines tonight. Are you really going bare-faced?"

Evelyn sighed and resignedly sat at the vanity.

Three hours later, the makeup artist gently called, "Miss Sullivan, we're finished."

Blinking awake, Evelyn saw her reflection—flawless makeup, a blush-pink gown that made her skin glow like snow, and a pearl necklace shimmering at her collarbone. She looked every inch the aristocrat.

"Thank you." As she stood, she met Ethan's intense gaze.

"Well?" She twirled.

His Adam's apple bobbed. "Stunning."

The ballroom glittered under crystal chandeliers. When Evelyn entered on Ethan's arm, all eyes turned toward them.

"My God, Evelyn is far more beautiful than Isabella!"
"Her skin practically glows, and her features are more refined."
"Shh, Isabella looks ready to explode."

In a shadowed corner, Isabella clenched her wineglass so hard her nails dug into her palm. Those compliments should have been hers! Evelyn had stolen everything from her!

She drained her glass in one gulp, venom flashing in her eyes.

###Chapter 296

Isabella Jackson stood listlessly in the corner when someone suddenly called her name.

"Lily, finally found you!"

She turned to see Lily White striding toward her in high heels. The once-naive girl now radiated star power with every move.

"Lily?" Isabella raised a surprised brow. "Aren't you supposed to be filming?"

Lily linked arms with her affectionately. "Just wrapped up a project. Came specifically for this gala."

Lowering her voice, she added, "Rumor has it the Sullivans are throwing this party to welcome Adrian back—but secretly, they're scouting for his future wife."

Isabella scanned the room, spotting numerous impeccably dressed socialites.

"You're well-informed."

"Mom told me." Lily winked. "But I'm not interested in Adrian."

Noticing the shadow in Lily's eyes, Isabella probed, "Still thinking about Alexander?"

Lily's smile faltered briefly before she changed the subject. "Enough about me. How are things with Ethan lately?"

"Didn't you see him walk in with my sister?" Isabella's laugh was bitter. "She's all he sees now."

"What? He just gifted you Brocade recently!"

The words stabbed Isabella's heart. That was severance pay—Ethan's way of cutting ties completely.

"Things have changed, Lily." Her gaze drifted meaningfully toward Evelyn. "Because of her."

Following her line of sight, Lily's lips curled into a faint, knowing smirk. The entertainment industry had taught her to recognize such games.

"You can't force love." She patted Isabella's hand. "Maybe Ethan will come around someday."

Isabella forced a smile while silently cursing Lily's evasion.

After exchanging more pleasantries, Lily excused herself to the restroom.

Isabella watched her leave, eyes icy. So what if Lily had grown wiser? As long as she still pined for Alexander, she remained a pawn.

Meanwhile, Evelyn released Ethan's arm the moment they entered the ballroom.

"I'll go keep Grandma company."

Ethan frowned. "Stay away from those men trying to chat you up."

"Got it." She headed toward Margaret without looking back.

Beside Margaret, Margaret Sullivan checked her watch anxiously.

"Evelyn, perfect timing." She rushed out, "I have an emergency. Keep Grandma entertained."

Before Evelyn could respond, Margaret hurried away.

###Chapter 297

Evelyn couldn't bring herself to sincerely help Adrian choose a wife. She'd rather find a quiet place to be alone.

"Grandmother, which young lady has caught your eye?"

The elderly Mrs. Sullivan smiled kindly. "My opinion doesn't matter. It's Adrian's heart that counts. That boy slipped away as soon as this began. I just sent the butler to find him."

Remembering Adrian's words this morning about not wanting a relationship, Evelyn hesitated about telling the old woman.

The butler returned with an exasperated Adrian in tow.

"Madam, the young master was in the music room."

Mrs. Sullivan's eyes instantly welled up.

The music room had been Jane Sullivan's favorite place. The pianist had first met Zachary Sullivan there. Later, Mrs. Sullivan had a music room specially built at Harmony Manor.

Adrian knelt on one knee before his grandmother. "Forgive me, Grandmother. I just... missed them."

She patted his hand gently. "I understand."

Evelyn studied Adrian quietly.

His bowed head hid his expression. But losing both parents in his teens must have left wounds that never fully healed.

When Mrs. Sullivan regained her composure, she suddenly straightened. "Adrian, accompany me to the stage."

Evelyn sensed something momentous in the old woman's demeanor.

Adrian helped his grandmother ascend the platform.

"Thank you all for coming. As you know, my eldest grandson Adrian has returned..."

Her speech grew increasingly impassioned.

"If not for the accident, Adrian would have rightfully inherited the Sullivan Group."

The crowd erupted in murmurs.

"Is she asking Ethan to step down?"

"The Sullivan Group's success is all because of Ethan!"

"This is completely unfair!"

Unfazed, Mrs. Sullivan continued, "I haven't forgotten Ethan's contributions. Therefore, I've decided to leave Harmony Manor to Adrian."

Gasps filled the room.

Harmony Manor was worth billions—equivalent to half the Sullivan Group's value!

Understanding dawned on Evelyn. Mrs. Sullivan had made this decision after learning Adrian went to the music room.

She scrutinized Adrian's calm demeanor on stage.

Was the music room visit coincidence or calculation? Was he truly as indifferent to wealth and status as he appeared?

Suddenly, Adrian turned. His gaze locked directly onto hers.

###Chapter 298

Their gazes met. A faint smile touched his lips before he casually looked away.

Evelyn's lashes fluttered. Her suspicions grew stronger.

The elderly Mrs. Sullivan, visibly weary, leaned on the butler's arm as she retired to her room.

Margaret stormed into the bedroom upon hearing Harmony Manor had changed hands. "Mother! How could you just hand over Harmony Manor? Adrian barely joined Sullivan Group and already receives such favoritism. Are you planning to give him the entire family next?"

A flicker of irritation crossed the old woman's eyes. "My private assets are mine to dispose of as I please. This is none of your concern."

The thought of Adrian's deceased parents and his uncle and aunt's constant wariness twisted her heart.

"Ethan has poured his soul into Sullivan Group all these years. How do you think he'll feel about this blatant partiality?"

"You and Henry dote on Ethan. What's wrong with me favoring Adrian?" The old woman scoffed. "If you still consider him your nephew, start preparing for his wedding."

Margaret opened her mouth to argue, but the matriarch had already turned her back.

As the door opened and closed, Adrian stood outside holding a bowl of sweet wine, his eyes dark and unreadable.

"Leaving so soon, Aunt?" His smile didn't reach his eyes.

After Margaret hurried away, Adrian placed the porcelain bowl gently on the bedside table.

"Rest well, Grandmother," he said softly.

Beneath the moonlight in the pavilion, Adrian's knuckles whitened. Harmony Manor was just the beginning. He would make Margaret watch as the Sullivan empire changed hands.

"Soon," the night wind carried away his whisper. "None of those who owe me will escape."

Back in the ballroom, socialites whispered among themselves.

"They say the deed to Harmony Manor is worth this much—" Someone gestured. "If one could marry the eldest Sullivan heir..."

The chandelier illuminated their greedy gazes, leaving nowhere to hide.

###Chapter 299

"Rumor has it Madam Sullivan is hosting this banquet to find Adrian a wife. Now that he's inherited billions, every socialite in the city must be lining up for him."

"Don't celebrate too soon. The old lady's still alive. Harmony Manor won't truly be his until she passes. Those billions are just pie in the sky for now."

...

Isabella Jackson listened to the chatter with a cold smirk.

Madam Sullivan's actions tonight perfectly confirmed the fortune teller's prophecy from years ago—anyone associated with Evelyn Sullivan was cursed!

She'd seen Margaret Sullivan's face earlier, pale as if she'd been publicly slapped.

Circling the ballroom, Isabella finally spotted Margaret returning and approached with a dessert plate.

"Aunt Margaret, you've been busy all evening. You must be starving. I brought you some cake."

Margaret, still seething over Harmony Manor, reluctantly accepted the offering.

"Such a thoughtful girl."

Isabella smiled demurely. "There's an empty sofa over there. Shall we sit?"

Once seated, Isabella sighed.

"Aunt Margaret, don't you think it's improper for Grandma Sullivan to give Harmony Manor to Adrian?"

Margaret's fork paused. "Explain."

Though she agreed, she wouldn't voice her true feelings to an outsider—even one she favored as a future daughter-in-law.

"Doesn't the whole situation feel... unnatural?"

When Margaret stopped eating, Isabella lowered her voice. "I never believed that fortune teller who said Evelyn would ruin our family. But look—hasn't the Jackson fortune declined since her return?"

Margaret frowned. "That's poor management, not Evelyn's doing."

"Father hasn't had a single successful investment in years. Even the unluckiest person gets lucky sometimes. Yet..."

After a long silence, Margaret looked up sharply. "Are you suggesting Madam Sullivan gave Adrian Harmony Manor because Evelyn is with Ethan?"

Isabella bit her lip. "I can't be certain. But no matter what happens, I only want Ethan to be safe."

"Keep this to yourself." Margaret stood abruptly, leaving the cake untouched. "I need to think."

"Call me anytime, Aunt Margaret."

Watching Margaret's distracted retreat, Isabella's eyes darkened. Skeptics could only resist the truth for so long.

Meanwhile, Evelyn finally found Ethan Sullivan on the terrace.

The man sat alone in shadow, long fingers pressed to his temple. Moonlight traced the rigid line of his jaw.

"Mr. Sullivan?"

###Chapter 300

Ethan Sullivan turned to look at her, a faint smile in his eyes. "Thinking about how to make you happy again."

Evelyn Sullivan's anger had mostly subsided over the past few days, but she still kept a stern expression. She didn’t want to forgive him too easily—otherwise, he’d make the same mistake again.

She pressed her lips together and sat quietly beside him.

"Evelyn!" Sophia Reynolds hurried over. "Mr. West wants to discuss a collaboration with you." She froze when she noticed Ethan. "Mr. Sullivan... mind if I borrow Evelyn for ten minutes?"

Evelyn shot her a glare before turning to Ethan. "I’ll be right back."

Ethan nodded, watching her leave.

Isabella Jackson approached in her high heels, her voice trembling. "Ethan... can we talk?"

Ethan lifted his gaze, his eyes icy.

"That night, you didn’t have to come for me..." Isabella clenched her skirt. "But you did. That means—"

"Colin’s phone was broken." Ethan cut her off. "I promised to deal with the person who drugged you. That’s all."

Isabella paled, her nails digging into her palms.

"You taught that man a lesson..."

"Just keeping my word." Ethan scoffed. "How many times do I have to repeat myself?"

Tears welled up in Isabella’s eyes. "You really—"

"My answer hasn’t changed."

Watching Isabella stagger away, Ethan loosened his tie in frustration. If he hadn’t gone to Royal Emperor that night, Evelyn wouldn’t still be giving him the cold shoulder.

As the banquet neared its end, Evelyn finally returned. Seeing the empty glasses piled in front of him, she frowned. "How much have you had to drink, Mr. Sullivan?"

Ethan pulled her into his arms, the scent of alcohol heavy on his breath.

"Evelyn..." He rested his chin on her shoulder. "Stop being angry..."

She pushed against him. "You’re drunk."

His arm tightened around her waist.

"Still won’t forgive me?"

Evelyn stayed silent for a moment. "We’ll talk when you’re sober."

Suddenly, his grip loosened. His expression cleared. "I’ll take you home."

"Let’s say goodbye to Grandma first."

The elderly Mrs. Sullivan took Evelyn’s hand. "About Harmony Manor being given to Adrian..."

"Your assets are yours to decide." Evelyn smiled. "We’re just dating right now."

The old woman sighed. "That boy Adrian... I have to leave him something..."

"Don’t overthink it."

At the entrance, they ran into Adrian Sullivan. He nodded politely before quickly walking away.

Evelyn opened the car door, only to hear Ethan mutter, "What did he say to you?"

"Just a greeting." She fastened her seatbelt. "Take me to Elm Cove."
