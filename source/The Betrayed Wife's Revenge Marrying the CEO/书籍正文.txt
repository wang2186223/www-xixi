###Chapter 1: My Son's Wish

Annie's POV

"Can you and Daddy get divorced?"

My five-year-old son's question hung in the air of his dimly lit bedroom.stopping my bedtime story mid-sentence. Brian looked up at me. fighting to keep his eyes open.


I carefully set down the story book I was reading to him. "Why would you ask that,sweetheart?"


"Because you never let me have any fun," he mumbled sleepily,words slurring slightly. "You won't let me have McDonald's or pizza for lunch like Max does. Sarah says it's okay to have treats sometimes, but you always make me eat those special foods..."


My heart clenched. Brian's food allergies and digestive issues had been a constant battle since he was a toddler. The endless doctor visits, the strict dietary restrictions, the nights spent worrying when he accidentally ate something he shouldn't have-all of it flashed through my mind. "Honey,why would you think-" But he had already drifted off to sleep, his small body curled around his stuffed dinosaur. Sometimes I wondered if my strict attention to his diet was pushing him away.The truth was clear as the memories flooded into my mind - his sudden reluctance to hug me after school, the way he'd stopped sharing his daily adventures at dinner, how he always seemed distracted when I read him stories. I had been too careless before, or too busy trying to balance the roles of mother and wife, leaving no room for myself. But what choice did I have when he was a delicate boy? As I was about to turn away from his bed, a soft chime broke the quiet of the room. A blue glow suddenly lit up from beneath his pillow, drawing my attention. Moving closer, I found an iPad hidden there, its screen displaying a WhatsApp group chat titled "My Perfect Family."

The profile picture knocked the breath from my lungs: my husband Philip standing in Central Park with an elegant woman beside him, Brian and a chubby boy about his age grinning in front of them. This must be Sarah and Max, I realized with a sickening jolt, the names from Brian's sleepy complaints now taking human form.

My hands trembled as I opened the chat. Photos filled the screen -museum visits, park picnics, afternoons at Coney Island - documenting a family life I knew nothing about. Sarah's contact was saved as "Mommy."

A voice message from my son: "I wish you could be my new mommy for real. You're so much more fun than my real mom."

Sarah's honey-sweet response made me sick: "I'd be honored to be your mommy in our special group, sweetheart. We can have all the fun times you want."

The messages continued-Brian complaining about his special diet, Max bragging about eating whatever he wanted, Philip arranging their next"family" outing. "Next Saturday at the Natural History Museum?" he wrote."Brian's been wanting to see the new dinosaur exhibit." Each revelation felt like another knife in my heart. My hands were shaking so badly I almost dropped the iPad. I needed answers, and I needed them now. With one last glance at Brian's peaceful sleeping face, I quietly closed his bedroom door and headed to Philip's study at the other end of our apartment. Each step felt heavier than the last, my mind racing with questions I wasn't sure. Or maybe the truth was another rude awakening. But I had to. I found Philip in his study, surrounded by financial data on multiple monitors. He looked up, concern crossing his face."Annie? Is everything okay? You look pale."

I placed the iPad on his desk, screen up. I watched his expression shift from concern to calculation as he saw the messages.


"It's not what you think," he started smoothly, using hisbusiness voice that I'd grown to hate when he was talking to me. "The kids came up with the group chat idea themselves. It's just their way of playing family."

"Playing family?" My voice cracked slightly. "With my husband and another woman? With my son calling her 'Mommy?"

Philip stood, hands raised placatingly. "Listen, Annie, you're right. I should have told you. It was inappropriate, and I'm sorry." He moved closer. "I'll end it. We'll both leave the group immediately."

"Just like that?" I wrapped my arms around myself. "And what about Brian? What about the damage that's already done? He needs to be careful with his food."

"I promise I'll fix this," Philip murmured, cupping my cheek. His thumb traced my lower lip, a familiar prelude to what he wanted. When I flinched,his eyes darkened with something primal, demanding. He pressed me against his desk, hands already working at my clothes. The wood bit into my back as his mouth found my neck, sucking hard enough to mark. My body betrayed me instantly - nipples hardening against my silk blouse, heat pooling between my legs. Years of marriage had conditioned my responses to his touch, even as my mind screamed in protest. "Let me make it up to you," he growled, yanking my blouse open. Buttons scattered across his office floor. The cool air hit my exposed skin as he roughly pushed my bra aside, his mouth descending hungrily. I gasped,arching despite myself. His hands gripped my thighs, hiking my skirt up around my waist.

This is wrong, my mind protested. He betrayed you. He let another woman mother your child.

But my body had its own memories - countless nights of pleasure,the way he could make me forget everything but sensation. His fingers traced the edge of my underwear, and I shuddered, caught between desire and disgust.

I felt him hard against my thigh, his suit pants doing nothing to hide his arousal. His breathing was ragged as he ground against me,one hand already working at his belt. "Annie, Annie, Annie." he rasped,fingers hooking into the waistband of my panties. "I want you, Annie."


The raw desperation in his voice sent another wave of heat through me.This was how we'd always communicated best-not with words, but with touch, with passion, with the language of flesh against flesh. His fingers found me wet, ready, and he groaned in triumph.

But as he pushed closer, as his hands grew more demanding, that voice in my head grew louder. This wasn't love- this was manipulation, control,ownership. The same skills that made him a ruthless CEO were at wvork here. Each touch was calculated to overwhelm, to make me forget, to bind me closer. My body screamed for completion, for the oblivion of orgasm that would let me forget everything- Sarah, the messages, my son's rejection. Philip's expert touch promised that release, that temporary escape into pure physical pleasure. His fingers worked with practiced skill, drawing out responses he knew by heart. I have to push him away. But I can't. What should I do?
###Chapter 2: A Day of the Housewife

Annie's POV

The early morning light hadn't yet breached our bedroom windows when I found myself staring at the ceiling, my body heavy against the headboard.Philip's steady breathing beside me felt like a metronome counting down the minutes until dawn. My skin still tingled from his touch hours before,but my mind refused to quiet. It just didn't feel right. Was he lying?Enough. Enough of questions like this. I told myself.

The clock on my nightstand blinked 6:30 AM. A sleepless night was completed.


I slipped out of bed, careful not to wake Philip. The floors were cold against my bare feet as I made my way to the kitchen. The morning routine beckoned - Brian's gluten-free breakfast wouldn't prepare itself.His food allergies didn't care about my emotional exhaustion or the growing chasm in our family.


After washing up, I had settled into the familiar rhythm of morning preparation. The organic smoothie ingredients lined up like soldiers on the pristine countertop: frozen berries, spinach, the special protein powder that didn't upset Brian's stomach. The gluten-free pancake mix waited nearby,along with the non-dairy butter that actually tasted decent.


I pulled out my phone,adding items to my grocery store shopping list while the färst pancake sizzled. Philip's dry cleaning needed pickup.The gynecologist appointment at 4:00 PM loomed in my calendar-a routine check-up that suddenly felt loaded with new significance after last night.

The sound of small feet padding down the hallway announced Brian's arrival. "Morning, sweetheart," I called out, sliding a perfectly golden pancake onto his favorite dinosaur plate. "I made your special-" "Did you delete Sarah and disband my family group?" His voice trembled with accusation.

The spatula clattered against the counter. "No, sweetheart."

"Who else would do it?" Tears welled in his eyes. "No wonder she says Daddy doesn't like you!"

My heart stuttered. "What do you mean?"

"Daddy likes Sarah! He told me he's liked her since college!" Brian's small fists clenched. "You're just mean and boring and make me eat stupid food!"

Before I could react, he grabbed his plate and hurled it across the room.The ceramic dinosaur shattered against the wall, pieces of gluten-free pancake sliding to the floor like fallen stars. The organic smoothie followed,purple liquid exploding across our cream-colored cabinets.

Philip appeared in the doorway, his CEO persona already firmly in place despite the early hour. "What's going on here?"

"Mommy deleted Sarah!" Brian ran to Philip, wrapping his arms around his father's legs. "She ruined everything!"

I watched my husband's face, searching for any crack in his perfect mask."Brian, buddy," he soothed, patting our son's head, "sometimes grown-ups need to make difficult decisions."

"But you said you liked Sarah better! You said-" "That's enough, Brian," Philip's voice carried just enough edge to silence our son. "Why don't you go get dressed for school?" After Brian stomped away, Philip straightened his tie. "I'll handle this," he said, not meeting my eyes. "You should start your day - don't you have errands to run?" That was the end of morning I guessed. Yet the morning told me that was just the start.

Traffic snarled hopelessly around Philip's dry cleaner on 86th Street where I watched the minutes tick by on my dashboard clock, knowing his suit needed to be ready for tomorrow's board meeting. The cab driver in front of me laid on his horn as if that would magically clear the gridlock. My head throbbed.


The line at Whole Foods stretched endlessly, each person ahead of me seeming to have a cart overflowing with items to debate with the cashier.I clutched my basket of Brian's special gluten-free items, fighting to keep my eyes open. The fluorescent lights were too bright, making my fatigue-induced headache worse. A baby wailed somewhere in the store, the sound piercing through my skull.

After a lunch that was way past my usual lunchtime, I trudged back to our apartment at around 2 PM.


Usually, I would do some painting at this time to enjoy my quiet afternoon.But today, I just wanted to head straight to the bedroom, where my cozy bed awaited. I could definitely use a nap even for just a few hours before my appointment with my gynecologist at 4:00 PM.

However, as I walked past Philip's home office, something made me pause in the doorway. I saw a photo on his desk. I walked in.

Sarah, younger but unmistakable, laughing on what looked like a college campus. Behind it, folded letters that made my hands shake as I read: "Sarah, despite how you hurt me at college, I can forgive you. Say the word and I'll call off the wedding with Annie." Her response was shorter: "I'm content with my life now. Please don't contact me again." The words blurred as tears threatened to fall. My knees felt weak, and I gripped the edge of his desk to steady myself.

My phone buzzed. Philip's voice came through, rushed and businesslike:

"Annie, I need you to pick up Brian from school today. Something urgent came up- an emergency board meeting."

"What about the ph-" I started, but he cut me off.

"I really can't talk right now. You'll handle it, right?"

The familiar pattern of him delegating parental duties while claiming "important business" suddenly took on a new, bitter meaning.

"Okay," I managed, the word barely a whisper. But he had already hung up.

I thought he loved to pick up Brian too much to let me do it once.

And my nap could wait of course. A mother was a full-time job. At least I could go straight to my gynecologist after that, I said to myself.

At around 3 PM, before the entrance of Brian's school, Several parents were already waiting at the entrance when I arrived.

The electric gates opened, and teachers carefully checked parent names before releasing each child.

"Brian!" the teacher called. "Is Brian's parent here?" "Yes!" I stepped forward, but another voice joined mine. I turned to find Sarah-the woman on the photos - standing there in her red dress, makeup perfect and smile radiant. "Hello, I'm Brian's parent,"she said confidently. The teacher looked at me suspiciously and said to Sarah as if they had seen multiple times, "Ms. Johnson, do you know this woman?"

My blood ran cold. They thought Sarah was Brian's mother?

Sarah extended her hand toward my son. "Brian, come here. Do you know this lady?"

Brian walked to Sarah's side, gripping her hand while staring at me with unfamiliar eyes. After a long pause, he shook his head. "Mommy, I don't know her!"


The world spun as tears filled my eyes. Sarah maintained her polished smile. "Perhaps this woman has confused Brian with someone else."

"I haven't confused anyone," I wiped my tears. "Brian,come here!"

"No!" He hid behind Sarah. "You're not my mom."

The teacher stepped forward protectively. "Should we call the police?"

Sarah nodded. "Just to be safe."

But Icouldn't stop myself. "Brian, I'm your mother!"

"No, you're not!" Brian pressed himself against Sarah. "She's my mommy!"

A cold voice cut through. "Call the police now."
###Chapter 3: Good News?

Annie's POV

I sat in the police station, my hands trembling as I handed over my driver's license. The events at Brian's school kept replaying in my mind-my son's face twisted in fear, his body pressed against Sarah as if seeking protection from a stranger. From his own mother.
"Mrs. Baker," the officer's voice was professionally neutral as she examined my documentation. "We've confirmed your identity and verified your relationship to Brian Baker through the school records."
My throat felt dry. "So you understand now? That I'm his mother?"

She nodded, typing something into her computer. "Yes, ma'am. We've also confirmed Mr. Baker's status as your husband through marriage records."She paused, glancing at me with what might have been sympathy. "The


*Misunderstanding*.Such a mild word for what had happened. For my son looking at me like I was a threat. For Sarah Johnson somehow being listed as a parent at his school.

"Has Mrs. Johnson been frequently visiting the school?" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.

The officer consulted her notes. "According to the school logs, she's been authorized to pick up Brian Baker several times over the past month." She hesitated. "The authorization appears to have come from Mr. Baker's office.
"

Of course it had. Everything about this situation carried Philip's perfectly manicured fingerprints.

"We apologize for any distress this has caused," The officer said,standing."You're free to go, but I think you need a conversation with your husband,Mrs.Baker."


As I could finally suck in the air of freedom, the sleepless night was catching up with me. My head throbbed. Of course I couldn't head home just yet. At least, I should find out where my son was first. "Yeah,indeed."I said weakly.


Out of the taxi, I made my way into Philip's office building. I'd been here countless times before, but now everything felt different, tainted.

The security guard recognized me and waved me through. The elevator carried me to the top floor where Philip's office was located.


I heard Philip's voice before I saw him, drifting from the partially open door of the executive lounge.


"...what was I supposed to do?" His familiar laugh, the one he used to charm board members and potential clients, carried clearly. "Sarah left me during our senior year at Harvard. I was devastated."

I froze just outside the door, my hand hovering over the handle.

"But Annie..." a male voice I didn't recognize prompted. "I only married Annie because Sarah was gone," Philip said, his tone matter-of-fact. "Until Sarah came back into my life, I thought I could settle for a life with Annie. And I'm starting to like her. She's a good mother,understanding, and even a bit gullible. And Sarah..." He sighed. "Sarah was my first love after all." My phone buzzed in my purse, making me jump. It was my gynecologist,which seemed trivial compared to the words still hanging in the air.

Philip's voice inside the lounge cut off abruptly.

"Annie?" His face appeared in the doorway, composed as ever except for a slight widening of his eyes. I stared at him, this man I thought I knew,wondering how many other conversations like this he'd had when I wasn't there."What are you-"

His phone rang abruptly, interrupting whatever excuse he'd been about to make. His expression changed as he listened, color draining from his face.

"Brian did what?" His voice sharpened. "We'll be right there."

He grabbed my arm, all pretense forgotten. "Brian's hurt himself. We need to go. Now."

The shock of his words pushed everything else aside- the overheard conversation, the betrayal, all of it disappeared beneath a wave of maternal panic. My legs moved automatically, following Philip to the elevator,to his car, my mind racing ahead to Brian.

Brian lay in the hospital bed, small and pale, his left arm wrapped in gauze. A mild sedative dripped through his IV line.

"He used scissors which are not found yet," the nurse explained quietly. "It's not deep, but given his age..."

I moved toward the bed, but Brian turned his face away.

"Don't," he mumbled. "I don't want you here."

"Brian,sweetheart,please-" He looked at me then, his young face twisted with an expression no five-year-old should wear. "Mom,I know cutting myself makes you upset."

My heart stopped at his words, at the innocent look in his eyes.

"But the more you care, the more I'll hurt myself." His voice was eerily calm. "Until you divorce Dad and let Sarah be my real mom."

The room spun. I heard Philip shouting something, felt hands catching me as my knees buckled. The last thing I saw was Brian's face, watching with that terrible, knowing expression as darkness claimed me. Finally,my exhausted body gave in.

A dreamless sleep I had hoped until I heard the steady beep of a heart monitor. Opening my heavy eyelids, I found myself in an unfamiliar hospitaI room bathed in sunlight - morning sunlight, streaming through the windows. The wall clock read 7:30 AM. I'd lost an entire night to unconsciousness, though in my bone-deep exhaustion, I could have easily slept for days more. The endless hours of worry and heartbreak had finally caught up with me.

Philip sat beside the bed, his suit wrinkled but his expression perfectly controlled.

"How are you feeling?" he asked, reaching for my hand. I pulled away.

"Annie." He leaned forward, his face earnest. "I know things seem difficult right now, but,there's good news." He looked at me then, his young face twisted with an expression no five-year-old should wear. "Mom,I know cutting myself makes you upset."

My heart stopped at his words, at the innocent look in his eyes.

"But the more you care, the more I'll hurt myself." His voice was eerily calm. "Until you divorce Dad and let Sarah be my real mom."

###Chapter 4: Life Is a Bitch

Annie's POV

Morning sunlight filtered through the hospital room's blinds,casting thin golden lines across the starched white sheets. The steady drip of the IV marked time like a metronome as I struggled to process Philip's words.
"Pregnant?" The word felt foreign on my tongue. "That's your good news?"

Philip nodded, his perfectly pressed suit at odds with the institutional sterility of the hospital room. He pulled an ultrasound image from his breast pocket. "The gynecologist called yesterday while you were...indisposed. The hospital ran tests when you collapsed. We're going to have another baby,Annie."

I stared at the grainy black and white image, trying to reconcile this unexpected spark of life with the chaos of the past twenty-four hours. My fingers trembled as they traced the tiny form. Another child. Another chance.


Memories of my own childhood flooded back - lonely dinners with mom,the empty chair at school events, the constant ache of absence.The thought of this new baby never knowing a complete family...

"I guess we could move on," I whispered, my hand instinctively moving to my still-flat stomach. "For Brian, and for this baby." Philip's expression softened into something that might have been genuine remorse. "Maybe... I mean, of course. I promise things will be different."He reached for my hand, and this time I didn't pull away. "I'll change." The morning light caught something glinting in his other hand-a small jewelry box, "And I got you something," he said, opening it to reveal a pair of delicate lily-shaped earrings. They were beautiful, if surprisingly modest for Philip's usual taste.

"They're perfect," I lied, forcing a smile as he fastened them to my ears.The cool metal felt like shackles.

"I'm glad you like it but I have to go, you know-an emergency board meeting." He kissed my forehead, already reaching for his phone. "Get some rest."

Alone in the hospital room, I let my hand rest on my abdomen, imagining the tiny life growing there. A fresh start. A reason to try again. Right?

\---

The cheerful ping of my phone shattered the fragile peace I'd constructed.A WhatsApp message from Brian. My heart leaped, hoping for reconciliation. "Meet me in the emergency stairwell. I want to talk."

I stared at those words, my thumb hovering over the screen. After everything that had happened - the police station, his threat about self-harm and his act before the teacher. The memory of his cold eyes watching me collapse made my hands shake.

But maybe he was manipulated by Sarah. I could still talk sense into him. And yet... this was my son. My little boy who used to crawl into my bed during thunderstorms. Who would beg me to check under his bed for monsters, then insist on checking under mine too, "just to keep you safe,Mommy." When had that sweet child become this stranger? Hope and dread warred in my chest as I disconnected the IV and made my way into the corridor. The hospital's antiseptic smell burned my nostrils.

Turning left down the corridor, I caught sight of an imposing figure standing ramrod straight before a bench. A man with strong build cut an impressive figure, a father I would say but a young one. Following his gaze, I glanced at the small blonde girl sitting on the bench, her head bowed,eyes fixed on the floor.

As I hurried past them, I caught the pleasant blend of tobacco and cologne.
The scent cleared my head momentarily, I could die sniffing it,but I had no time to dwell on it as I made my way toward the stairwell.

"Lucy,life is a bitch, but you need to learn to love yourself," The man's gentle voice carried through the corridor. He quickly added, "Pardon my language. But you know what I mean,don't you?"

I couldn't help but turn back. His voice was so magnetic and absorbing.I wondered what kind of handsome face could match that manly voice. As I beheld his side of face, I found a vision of rugged handsomeness,his features perfectly chiseled. I followed his gaze and saw Lucy's small face a mask of isolation that startled me. Why?


If I'd had a father tocomfort me like that, I would have given him my brightest smile.


But who knows? Life is a bitch indeed. Maybe I could find time to love myself as well after my conversation with Brian. Squaring my shoulders, I reached for the stairwell door. Brian might be confused, manipulated, even angry, but he was still my son. And sometimes loving yourself meant having the courage to face the hard conversations, no matter how much they might hurt. Pushing open the door to the stairwell, I stepped forward and saw Brian standing ominously on the steps.




The emergency stairwell was bathed in harsh white light,the smell of disinfectant even stronger here and it was mixed with something I couldn't tell. Brian stood halfway up the first flight, his expression unreadable.

"Mom," he said, the word falling like a stone. "Sarah told me to tell you something."

My heart clenched as I forced a smile. "Yes? Sweetie?"

"She said to tell you that you're not wanted anymore. That you should just go away and let her be my real mom." His voice was eerily calm and mechanical as if he were reciting an article from his textbook. "She said you're too weak to fight for us anyway."


I took a step forward, my shoe sliding unexpectedly on the stairs.Looking down, I saw an oily sheen coating the white tiles.

"Brian,wait-"


But he was already turning away, his small shoulders squared with purpose. My foot slipped again, and this time there was nothing to grab onto. The world tilted sickeningly.


My last conscious thought was of the baby - No, don't. Don't leave me,please. This innocent life, my final thread of hope in a tapestry of betrayal,slipping away on these cold tiles. Was this what I deserved for trying so hard to be a good mother?

As I fell to the ground, I let out a piercing scream and clutched my
stomach in agony. I saw a pool of blood spreading on the floor.

The fluorescent lights blurred above me, their harsh glare a fitting witness to my failure. As darkness crept in at the edges of my vision. I thought of the man in the hallway's words to his niece: "Life is a bitch." How right he was!


The world faded to black, leaving me alone with the echo of my son's footsteps walking away from his mother. I'd start to love myself if I couald
###Chapter 5:A Job

Annie's POV

"The baby didn't make it."

Philip's words hung in the sterile hospital air.I kept my eyes fixed on the privacy curtain, refusing to acknowledge his carefully neutral expression or the way his CEO persona never wavered, even now.

"Annie?" His voice carried that familiar note of authority-the tone that expected immediate response. But I remained silent, letting the steady beep of the heart monitor fill the space between us.

The door burst open, and Brian rushed in, his face pale and drawn."Mom!" His voice cracked. "Mom, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to - I wasn't trying to 11

I watched him struggle with his words, noted how his apparent distress never quite reached his eyes. The memory of the fall just hours ago flashed through my mind: the oily sheen on the stairs, his retreating back.the calculated nature of it all.

"I didn't know about the baby," he continued, voice rising hysterically. "I swear I didn't mean for you to -"

"Brian." Philip's sharp tone cut through our son's rambling. "Perhaps this isn't the best time."


But the memories were already flooding back- the cold tiles against my skin, the spreading warmth between my legs, the knowledge even then that I was losing something precious. Something that represented my last hope for this family. I closed my eyes, suddenly exhausted beyond words. When I opened them again, I found Brian staring at me with an expression that shifted between guilt and something else - something harder to define.

"It's okay,"II said finally, my voice surprisingly steady. "You can stop pretending now."


Brian's facade cracked, guilt giving way to defiance. "I'm not pretending! I really am-"


"Sorry?" I finished for him. "No, you're not. And that's okay." The words felt strange on my tongue, but they carried a weight of truth I couldn't deny anymore. "You don't have to pretend to love me anymore, Brian."

His eyes widened, then narrowed. The transformation was remarkable -like watching a mask slip away to reveal the stranger beneath. "I don't," he said,his voice suddenly cold and clear. "I don't want you to be my mom anymore. I want Sarah."

Philip shifted uncomfortably beside me, but remained silent. Always calculating the most advantageous position.

"I know." I said quietly. "And from today, you don't have to worry about that anymore. I'm giving the position to Sarah."

The joy that lit up my son's face felt like a physical blowv,but I forced myself to meet his eyes. To memorize this moment, this feeling. To let it burn away the last threads of hope I'd been clinging to. "Really?" Brian's voice trembled with excitement now, not distress. "You mean it?" "I do." I turned to Philip. "We should start discussing divorce arrangements soon." Philip's mask slipped for just a moment, surprise flickering across his features before the composed CEO persona reasserted itself. "If you prefer that way, I can't see how I can change your mind."

And you made yourself sound like you have tried a great deal to change my mind. I said in my heart sarcastically.

Brian was practically bouncing now, all pretense of remorse forgotten."Can I go call Sarah? Can I tell her?"

"Go ahead," Philip said softly, and our son - no,*Sarah's* son now -practically ran from the room.

The silence that followed felt heavier than before, weighted with the death of something that had been dying for longer than I'd wanted to admit.




The morning passed in a haze of medical checks and paperwork. Around eleven-thirty, a knock at my door pulled me from my daze. Instead of another nurse, I found myself looking up at a man I vaguely remembered from this morning's corridor.

The familiar scent hit me first - that pleasant blend of tobacco and cologne that somehow made the sterile hospital air breathable again. I could lose myself in that scent, let it carry away all my pain. Or maybe just die wrapped in its warmth. That thought scared me enough to look up. "Mrs. Baker?, I'm Howard Thompson. We.,. sort of met yesterday,though you might not remember," His voice was composed and controlled, which took me by surprise. He looked too sunny to carry a tone like that, too absorbing to sound so distant. Maybe life had fucked him as well. But I just got divorced. What did I know about life?

I nodded slowly. "Thank you."

I couldn't help but drink in the details of his face. His sharp jawline was softened by a precisely trimmed black beard that made my fingers itch to trace its line. High cheekbones that caught the fluorescent lights. Deep-set eyes that seemed to hold both warmth and steel. His broad shoulders practically begged to be leaned on, to the way his tailored shirt hinted at a well-maintained physique beneath.

The sudden urge to collapse against that strength, to let someone else carry my burdens for even a moment, was so overwhelming it frightened me. I had the grace to shut down that voice in my mind immediately.How foolish of me! He was way out of my league.

Behind him stood a small blonde girl, her eyes fixed on the floor.

"This is Lucy," he continued, gesturing to the silent child beside him."My niece."

Lucy raised her eyes to meet mine, and I was struck by the depth of emotion in them - so much feeling, contained in such careful silence. She offered a small, tentative smile that seemed to carry equal parts warmth and caution. "Lucy's parents - my brother and his wwife-died in a yacht accident years ago," Howard explained, his hand resting protectively on Lucy's shoulder."She has selective mutism, the doctors call it, But actually she hasn't talked until this morning." I watched as Lucy's fingers twisted in her dress, recognizing something in her careful guardedness. "I mean, she hasn't spoken until she saw you," Howard continued, his voice carrying a hint of warmth I thought I captured. "She asked me to help you when she saw you were out cold on the floor."

"Why me?"

"She wouldn't say." Howard said simply. "But I think you might find the answer yourself." He trailed off, looking down at his niece with a mixture of concern and hope.

"What do you mean?"

"A job." Howard said. "Working with Lucy. Helping her find her voice again-whatever that means for her."

I looked between them - the silent child and the man who carried distance despite his sunny and manly face. I thought about the wreckage of my own family. the sudden emptiness of my future. The strange symmetry of a child who couldn't speak and a mother whose child no longer wanted to hear her voice.

"I'll need timne to think about it," I said finally.

"Of course. Take all the time you need. And this is my business card."Howard nodded, still in that distant tone which didn't match his face.
###Chapter 6: Drugged

Annie's POV

The apartment felt different when I returned from the hospital. Howard's business card was still in my pocket, his job offer and Lucy's silent plea lingering in my thoughts. But all ideas of fresh starts vanished the moment I stepped inside.

Laughter drifted from the dining room - the kind that's practiced until perfect. I found them gathered around the table: Philip at the head, Sarah in my usual seat, and the boys on either side of her. She was opening gifts,her makeup artfully done to project warmth and vulnerability. She was a beauty for sure, but with flaws that men like Philip seemed blind to. Her smile was a masterpiece of calculation, and I wondered how many hours she'd spent perfecting it.

"I'm so glad to join this family," Sarah was saying, her voice trembling with practiced emotion.

Philip noticed me first. "Annie. Join us? We're celebrating."

"Celebrating?" The word tasted bitter. "My miscarriage,perhaps?"

Sarah's hand flew to her throat. "Oh, Annie, I had no idea... I'm so sorry for your loss."


"This is *our* celebration," Brian declared, glaring at me, "You're not invited." I took a step toward my son, but he jumped up, positioning himself between me and Sarah. "You can't come near my new mom!" "Brian," Philip's voice carried that familiar note of authority. "Could you make do with the guest room?"

"The guest room?" I gasped.

"Mom's staying in your old room now," Brian announced triumphantly."
You can't go in there anymore."

I moved toward the master bedroom, but Brian darted ahead, blocking the doorway. "This is Sarah's room now! You don't belong here anymore!"

"Please, Annie. Don't make it difficult for us all," Philip said firmly, his tone making it clear it wasn't really a plea.

Sarah rose gracefully. "I could stay in the guest room instead,"she offered,voice dripping with false modesty. "I wouldn't want to impose..."

"No!" Brian clutched her hand. "You're staying here with us!"

I looked between them-my husband, my son, and the woman who had so expertly orchestrated their devotion.

"Brian, I promised to divorce your dad and that's all you'll receive from me. But this one isn't the promise I made." My voice was steadier than I felt.

I shoved Brian aside, forged into my room, and locked the door. I could use some sleep.




Morning sunlight streamed through the guest room window as I methodically packed my belongings. Each item I placed in my suitcase felt like shedding another layer of the life I'd built here - clothes I'd never felt comfortable in, jewelry that marked occasions now tainted by lies, photos I


couldn't bear to look at anymore.

My hand brushed against something in the dresser drawer - a phone I didn't recognize. Sarah's, I realized, my heart quickening. She must have left it when she'd moved her things into what used to be my bedroom.The screen lit up at my touch, unlocked. She must've been careless with her possessions.


A notification banner caught my eye: "Lab Results Available- Mount Sinai OB/GYN."


My hands trembled as I opened the message. The words swam before my eyes: "Pregnancy confirmed - 9 weeks." The date stamp was from three weeks ago.


Nine weeks. The timeline spun in my head as I opened her WhatsApp,knowing I should stop but unable to tear my eyes away. A conversation with "Rob" filled the screen.

Robert: "What do you mean you're pregnant?"

Sarah: "Don't worry. Everything's going according to plan."

Robert: "Our weekend in Paris..."

Sarah: "Exactly. Philip hasn't touched me. This baby is yours." I felt sick. Sarah wasn't just trying to take my place-she was playing both men, orchestratingsome elaborate scheme that I was only beginning to understand. I stuffed Sarah's phone into my pocket. I should show this to Philip?Despite everything, some foolish part of me still loved him enough to hesitate, to want to protect him from this pain. But then I remembered how he'd said nothing but telling Brian to prepare for school while Brian rounded on me for his perfect disbanded family group, how he'd talked behind my back with his colleagues, how he'd never once truly stood up for me. Was this really love I was feeling, or just the habit of putting his feelings before my own?

Nevertheless, before I could decide, the front door slammed,followed by rapid footsteps. Philip burst into the room, his composure completely shattered.

"Brian's gone," he said without preamble. "Robert took him."

The world tilted sideways. "What?"

"Robert, Sarah's ex-husband kidnapped Brian. He's demanding..." Philip's voice cracked. "He wants Sarah. Says she belongs to him."

"Then go find Sarah, and speaking of Sarah...." I asked, my voice steady despite the fear clawing at my throat.

"He's demanding a trade." Philip's voice had cut me off as if he had made a decision. "Sarah for Brian. But Sarah's disappeared. She's not answering her phone.We need... I need..."

Understanding dawned with horrifying clarity. "No."

I turned to head back to the bedroom, my voice cold. "Then call the police."

Philip blocked my path. "Robert's the one who took him. Sarah's ex-husband."

"So what?" I tried to step around him, my voice growing colder. "Philip Baker, are you even a man anymore?"

"Annie, Brian is your son! You can't just let him die!"

As he spoke, his hand emerged from behind his back,holding a small spray bottle. Before I could react, he sprayed it directly in my face several times.


My body instantly went weak, my thoughts growing sluggish. This monster-he'd drugged me! After everything we'd been through, after losing our baby just hours ago, this was his solution? Trading one parent's dignity for another's betrayal?


It was in this moment I finally saw the man before me for who he truly was. "You already agreed, didn't you?" I managed to ask,my eyes going blurry. The room tilted sickeningly as I fought to stay conscious.


"I had no choice!" Philip almost shouted. "He said if you don't appear in front of him within two hours, he'll kill Brian!" His voice dropped,manipulative again. "That's our son we raised together. Can you really watch him die?"

I tried to struggle, but my limbs felt lke lead. The irony of it all struck me as darkness crept in at the edges of my vision -how quickly my perfect family had unraveled. From Brian's rejection to losing the baby, and now this final betrayal. Was this wvhat I deserved for trying to be a good mother? For loving too much?
###Chapter 7:Awakening

Annie's POV

The smell of whiskey pulled me from unconsciousness. My head throbbed from Philip's sedative spray, each pulse a reminder of his final betrayal.Tears welled up instantly as the reality of my situation crashed over me.

Why is it always me? What did I do wrong?

First Brian's request for me and Philip to get a divorce, then Brian's lie,and the loss of my baby, and now this. A sob escaped my throat. The universe seemed determined to break me, piece by piece.Even my own husband had drugged me, ready to offer me up like some sacrificial lamb.

I can't... I can't take this anymore, I thought to myself, tears streaming down my face. Another sob racked my body as images of Brian's cold eyes and Philip's calculated betrayal flashed through my mind.

Stop crying. Stop it right now.

But the tears wouldn't listen. The accumulated pain poured out in the dusty darkness of this strange place.

Annie, get it together. Crying won't help.You will NOT fall apart here.


ENOUGH!

My inner voice was sharp.
You survived your father's death. You could survive Philip's betrayal. You can do this.I forced myself to take deep breaths, counting each inhale and exhale. Minutes passed.

Think,Annie. THINK.

I forced my eyes open, fighting the lingering drowsiness. The room swayed slightly, but I made myself catalog every detail. I was lying on a narrow folding bed in what appeared to be an abandoned photography studio.Dust-covered equipment and old light stands filled thespace.Empty whiskey bottles littered the floor, their labels catching what little light filtered through the grimy windows.

My mind was clearing. And so were my eyes.

A small table near the bed held my belongings - phone, wallet, car keys -along with Sarah's phone from my drawer, Howard Thompson's business card and a standing picture frame with a photo of a hubby boy,Max,that was not mine. Time-worn fashion magazine covers were scattered nearby,including one showing Sarah with a man on a yacht, their smiles frozen in a happier time. I studied the man's face in the photo, then looked around the studio with growing understanding.

"Brian?" My voice was barely a whisper. "Where's Brian?"

A man stood across the studio, methodically adjusting an old camera.Despite his disheveled appearance, traces of professional expertise showed in his movements. The sharp smell of whiskey carried across the space. As he shifted to check another piece of equipment, I caught a clearer view of his face-Sarah's ex-husband. The man from the yacht photo.

"Took him to the Natural History Museum," he said without looking away from his camera settings. "Kid wouldn't shut up about the dinosaurs.Sarah picked him up after that." "So Sarah planned all of this..."

His laugh held no humor. "Smart. Want to know why you're really here?"He turned back to adjust his lens, momentarily focused on the equipment.

I have to do something, I thought as my eyes focused on the table at hand.

"You tell me," I said, trying to keep my voice steady.

I shifted slightly, reaching out. My fingers had almost brushed my phone when a slight shift in his posture made me think he was turning. I yanked my hand back instinctively, heart pounding - but he remained absorbed in his work, never actually looking my way. The sedative was making me jumpy.

He picked up another piece of equipment. "You're quick witted. You can figure it out yourself as well."

My hand inched toward the phone again while his back was turned.Through the sedative's haze, my movements felt sluggish, dangerous.

"Because Sarah knew I'd find those messages on her phone," I ventured,watching as he became absorbed in cleaning a camera lens.

This time my fingers closed around the phone. I barely managed to slip it behind me as he looked up. It was so close. And thank god he didn't notice anything. "You surprise me again." His smile was empty as he turned back to his equipment, fiddling with an old flash unit. "What else do you know?" With trembling fingers, I typed Howard's number blindly, praying muscle memory would guide me through my fog. "You're Robert, I saw your name on the phone. " I maintained a steady voice despite my inner thrill. "But you... you're divorced from her. Why are you still doing her bidding?"

The camera wobbled in his hands. "You wouldn't understand."

"Try me."

"I wouldn't fall for that." He stared at my eyes.

"What? Are scared a woman would outrun you?" I locked eyes with him,summoning all my strength.

"Alright. I used to be someone. A top photographer for all the major magazines. Then everything collapsed." He slurred and went back to work with his camera, unseeingly.

"So it's about money?" I asked carefully.

"Wrong, okay. Enough of the game." He snapped back to the reality.

"Max, then." I ventured with a forlorn hope.

Instantly, his hands shook as he set down the camera. "You think you understand?" His voice rose sharply. "You think you know what it's like to lose everything?"

He suddenly lurched towards me, the sharp stench of whiskey growing overwhelming as he grabbed my wrists. His weight pinned me against the wall, his breathing ragged and hot against my face.

"Maybe I should show you what it feels like," he boomed,his grip tightening. "To be helpless. To have everything taken away."

The alcohol on his breath made me dizzy. Or maybe it was fear. I forced

myself to stay still, to keep my voice steady despite my racing heart."Like Sarah took everything from you?"

His grip loosened slightly, confusion flickering across his face.

"She's doing it again, isn't she?" I pressed on, though my voice shook."Taking Max away, just like she took your career, your dignity..."

His eyes focused on mine, a moment of clarity breaking through the drunken haze. Hlis hands dropped away as he stumbled backward.

I said quietly. "My father died when I was young. I know what it's like to watch your world fall apart."

His face twisted. "Sarah... she has ways of making you do things.She knows things. About Max, about the accident..."

"She's using you," I said gently.

"Shut up!" He stepped forward unsteadily. "You don't know anything about me!"

"I know what it's like to love your child so much it hurts. To want to protect them from pain. But Max needs his father to be strong. Not... this."

Something broke in his expression. He sank to the floor, head in his hands."I can't... I can't lose him too..."

The door crashed open. Howard Thompson stood there. In three strides,he had Robert pinned against the wall.

Then he started to punch him like a mad beast.

"Howard,wait!" I charged forward, holding him from the back.
###Chapter 8: Divorce

Annie's POV

"Stop!" My voice echoed through the dusty photography studio as my arms were still wrapped around Howard from behind. His fist was already drawn back for another blow, Robert's unconscious form slumped against the wall. "He wasn't going to hurt me!"

Howard's muscles tensed beneath my grip. "But I heard it on the phone.I assumed he was trying to rape you."

"Not all of it, apparently. We talked it through. And it was Philip who drugged and brought me here." I tightened my hold, shaking off my inappropriate thoughts at a time like this. "Robert... he's just another one of Sarah's victims."


Howard turned to face me, a slight confusion on his composed face "Should we call the police?"

"No, he's a nice man. He didn't hurt Brian," I met Howard's gaze steadily.

“How do you know?”

"He took him to the museum. And he loves his son, Max. There's a photo of his son on the table. What's more, if he'd really meant harm, I would have called the police, not you."

A shadow crossed Howard's face. He seemed a bit disappointed.

Howard let go of Robert. "That's very smart of you." He said to me, his controlled voice softening as he turned to face me. Our eyes met,and something shifted in the dusty air between us. The blend of tobacco and cologne that I'd noticed earlier wrapped around me again, steadying my nerves even as it made my heart flutter unexpectedly.

"I'm not smart," I jolted out of my trance. "but I am amother."The words caught in my throat. "I was..."

"You can still be if you want." Howard interrupted firmly.




Howard had dropped me at the apartment that used to be my home.

It felt hollow when I entered. Gladly, I found no one at home. Maybe they were in some fancy restaurant, celebrating their victory.

Divorce papers I saw waited on the dining table like a tombstone marking the death of my marriage. Of course Philip would want to get rid of me so quickly, right after what he thought I would've been through.

My belongings sat packed by the door, a life reduced to a few boxes and bags.


I signed the papers without hesitation, my pen moving swiftly across the dotted line. Each signature felt like breaking another chain,setting me free from a life built on lies.

As I gathered the last of my things, I took one final look around. This place had never truly been home - I saw that clearly now. It had been a stage for Philip's performance, a cage gilded with luxury but empty of love. I wanted nothing to do with this family, with that man. Supposedly, I wouldn't sue him for what he had done. And the evidence would be hard to gather anyway. I just wanted to get rid of this place as soon as possible. I turned off the lights and strode downstairs where Howard was waiting for me, each step steadier than the last.

As I got in the car, he said firmly, "I think we need a talk." His voice carried that distinctive controlled warmth I was beginning to recognize.

I nodded, heart pounding in my chest. "Okay."

"I heard everything on the phone. Your conversation with Robert and...about what has befallen you."

My mind raced with questions I didn't dare ask. What did he really think of me? A divorced mother, someone else's castoff, damaged goods with more baggage than any sensible man would want to deal with.

I snuck a glance at his profile, then immediately looked away, scolding myself for the way my heart skipped. Why should his opinion matter so much? I'd only met him a handful of times. And yet... The thought of him pitying me, or worse, regretting his offer to help with Lucy, made my stomach twist.


I caught myself mid-thought and almost laughed at the absurdity. Howard turned to me, his gaze sincere despite the shadow of restraint that seemed to follow him everywhere. "I mean, I don't mind your past.What impressed me was your composure today-staying calm in crisis,using wisdom to defuse it." He paused, something gentler entering his voice. "And your compassion in  forgiving Robert... that shows remarkable strength." The air in the car grew warmer. Howard took a deepbreath,and when he spoke again, his voice caried a note of hope that made my heart skip. "So I'd like ask you to move in, to be Lucy's mother. What do you say?" I dissolved into a hearty smile. "I'm in."




Howard's Long Island mansion was everything my former home wasn't-spacious yet warm, modern yet inviting. And Lucy's bedroom was a fairy-tale dream, all soft colors and gentle light.

"Lucy," I said softly, kneeling beside her bed. "I know things are hard right now. But if you'd let me, I'dlike to stay and take care of you."

She remained silent, her eyes fixed on the pastel butterflies dancing across her bedspread. My heart sank a little, though I'd expected as much. I stood slowly, smoothing my skirt.

"Well, I'll just-"

A small hand shot out, catching mine. Lucy's fingers were impossibly delicate, yet they held on with surprising strength. When I looked back,she gave a tiny, decisive nod.


My throat tightened as I settled back beside her bed. "Would you like me to stay until you fall asleep?"

Another small nod. I began humming softly, an old lullaby my mother used to sing. Lucy's grip gradually relaxed as her breathing deepened into sleep, though her fingers remained loosely twined with mine. As I carefully extracted my hand, that now-familiar blend of tobacco and cologne wrapped around me. I turned to find Howard in the doorway, his broad shoulders filling the frame. The warm light from the hallway caught his profile, highlighting the controlled set of his jaw that contrasted so sharply with his sunny features. "She needs time," Howard said quietly, his voice carrying that measured warmth that made my heart skip. "But that's more than she's done with anyone else."


I watched Lucy's peaceful sleeping form, questions swirling in my mind. "Do you know why?" I finally asked. "Why she specifically wanted me to..."I trailed off, still uncertain how to phrase my role in this arrangement.

Howard shifted in the doorway, his elegant fingers drumming absently against the frame. The hallway light caught in his carefully trimmed beard,and I found myself noticing how the shadows played across his features.

No, Annie. This was not the time.


"I wish I knew," he said softly. "She barely speaks - hasn't really,since..."He exhaled slowly. "If she would just talk to us, everything would be so much simpler."


Another waft of his cologne - that intoxicating blend of tobacco and something warmer - made my pulse quicken. I needed to focus,to break this charged moment before I did something foolish.

"Howard," I said, fighting to keep my voice steady. "I have an idea."
###Chapter 9: A White Lie

Lucy's POV

I woke up when the sun was playing peek-a-boo with my curtains.Something smelled yummy downstairs - Annie was making breakfast! All our helpers had a day off today, so it had to be Annie in the kitchen. She was the only grown-up who could make pancakes smell this good!

I jumped out of bed and ran to my window. The grass looked all sparkly in the morning sun. Our big house felt different now that Annie was here.Better. The other ladies who took care of me always left quick, but Annie felt...special.

I wanted to say good morning to her so bad. The words were in my head,but they got stuck in my throat, like they always did since Mommy and Daddy went away. The doctor said there was a reason I couldn't talk, but I just knew it felt like my words were locked up tight.

"Lucy? Time to wake up,sweetheart!"

Annie came to my door in her pretty blue dress. Her smile wasn't fake like other grown-ups. It was real and warm, like Mommy's used to be.

"Ready for school?"

I nodded and sat at my mirror. Annie was super gentle when she brushed my hair- not pulling at all! In the mirror, I watched her make silly faces while she concentrated. "Let's make your hair extra pretty today!" She started doing twisty braids. "We should get you some new hair ties soon. These old ones are getting tired." The way she did my braids reminded me of Mommy. My chest got tight thinking about that, so I wwatched Annie instead. She made the whole house feel less empty. Even Uncle Howard's serious face got softer when she was around.


"All done!" Annie finished my braids. She turned to get something from her bag.

This was my chance! I slipped down from the chair super quiet, like a ninja. Annie was still looking in her bag when I tip-toed out.

I knew exactly where to go. Yesterday, when Annie was unpacking, I saw her hang up a pretty blue dress in her room. It looked just like the one she was wearing today!

When Annie came looking for me, I was standing in her room pointing at her dress, then at myself. This was howv I talked - not with words, but with showing things.

Annie's eyes got all sparkly when she understood. "You want us to match?



I nodded so hard my new braids bounced everywhere.

"That's perfect!"

Soon I was twirling in my own blue dress just like Annie's. She watched me spin with that special mommy look that made my heart feel warm and fuzzy. I showed her my biggest, happiest smile ad a extra twirl in my matching dress. She and Uncle Howard could make a perfect couple, it hit me. Morning at school was always the same. Uncle Howard would drop me off early,his goodbye smile carrying that hint of worry I pretended not to notice. My Teachers would greet me with her gentle "Good morning,Lucy,"not expecting an answer anymore.

I liked being early. The classroom was quiet then, peaceful.I could arrange my colored pencils in rainbow order, each one perfectly straight.

During circle time, I sat in my usual spot by the window, where I could watch the leaves dance in the breeze. We sang our morning songs-I moved my lips without sound, but my fingers tapped the rhythm on my knees. When my teacher read us "The Very Hungry Caterpillar," I traced the butterfly patterns I'd memorized on my palm.

But then came art time, and everything changed.

Something was wrong with Brian. Really wrong.

I watched from my corner as he pressed his red crayon into the paper. His hand moved back and forth, back and forth, angry lines getting darker until the paper tore. It wasn't like before, when he'd draw perfect green dinosaurs and show everyone how to make the spikes just right. I knew he learned it from his mother, my Annie. I felt sad that he changed. He was good at painting. "Careful with the materials, Brian," My art teacher said softly. But Brian just grabbed another crayon, his face all scrunched up like he was trying not to cry. At recess, Brian stood alone by the slide. Tommy tried to play with him,like he used to, but Brian shoved him hard into the sandbox. As Tommy started crying, I saw Brian's hands shake - just like mine do when the memories get too big and the words get stuck.

"He's mean now," Emma whispered to Jenny. "Since his mommy went away. But I thought he wanted it."

I looked down at my drawing-a family of butterflies, free and together.Carefully, I folded it and put it in my pocket. Maybe I could show it to Uncle Howard and Annie later. If they could just be together,then I could have mom and dad again.




Uncle Howard picked me up from school today. He was talking on his phone about boring grown-up stuff the whole way home, quite unusual but I didn't know why. I was excited to see Annie! She always waits by the door with my favorite apple slices and that special warm smile that makes my whole day better.

But when we got home, Annie wasn't there.

Annie, I said out loud though only I could hear. I peeked into the living room, my heart doing happy little jumps. Maybe she was hiding! She likes to play games with me sometimes.

I tiptoed to check behind the big armchair where we read stories. Not there!I giggled,feeling like a detective on a mission, Next, I looked in the sunroom where we watch birds together. She wasn't there either,but I saw a pretty red cardinal that made me wish Annie was there to see it too.I checked my bedroom, then the art room where she loved to do her painting. With each empty room, my excitement grew bigger. Annie must be planning something really special! Uncle Howard went straight to his office for more phone calls.Grown-ups are so boring sometimes! But that was okay-I had an important mission!

I ran up the stairs, checking every room. My legs were getting tired, but I didn't care. Finding Annie was like a treasure hunt, and she was the best treasure ever!


Then I reached the kitchen.

My heart stopped doing its happy dance.

Annie was lying on the floor, her face white as the snow we made angels in last winter. Just like Mommy and Daddy looked before the real angels came for them.


My legs got all wobbly. I knelt beside her and touched her arm really gentle.


She didn't move.

I shook her arm a tiny bit harder.

Nothing.

My eyes got all hot and blurry. No, no, no! Not like Mommy and Daddy! I can't lose another mommy!But then I remembered what my teacher at school says: when scary things happen, take a big breath and think about what to do. So I did. Annie needed help. And Uncle Howard could help! I ran to his office so fast my socks slipped on the floor. He was still on his phone, talking about numbers and meetings and other boring things. I pulled his sleeve, but he did that annoying grown-up "one minute" 
finger wiggle.

I pulled harder, but he just turned away. Why? He was so different today after my school. He usually gave his time whenever I needed. What is happening?

Annie needed help NOW!

My chest felt like it would explode. I saw Annie's white face in my mind,and suddenly all the words that had been stuck inside me for so long came rushing out like a tidal wave.

"Mom's on the kitchen floor!"

Uncle Howard's phone crashed to the ground just like last time in the hospital.

"Lucy?"

Annie was standing in the doorway! Her face wasn't white anymore-it was pink and pretty. She recovered so soon and it was so strange.

"Did you just call mne Mom?"
###Chapter 10: Everyone's Watching

Howard's POV

The morning light hadn't yet breached the horizon when I found myself awake, earlier than usual. The merger negotiations ahead demanded preparation, yet my mind refused to focus on the financial projections waiting in my briefcase.

I gathered my papers and headed toward the dlining room for breakfast.My footsteps echoed in the quiet hallway, each one carefully measured until -without conscious thought-I found myself slowing outside Annie s door.


The familiar scent of lilacs stopped me completely. It drifted through the small gap beneath her door, the same gentle fragrance that had caught my attention that day in the potography studio. Suddenly I was back there:feeling her small form pressed against my back, her voice steady as she told me to stop.

"He's a nice man." She had made such a quick and accurate judgement.which saved both her and a poor man's life.

But why did you drop everything to save her that day? You had just met her twice and it turned out she didn't quite need it. And now you had to work harder this whole week to keep merger going.

It was for Lucy, I told myself firmly. My niece needed stability, needed someone who could help her find her voice again. That's all it was.

But even as I formed the thought, I knew it wasn't the complete truth.Something about Annie's presence in our home had shifted the very air we breathed. The way she smiled at Lucy and at me, the way she pored over selective mutism treatment books late into the night, her quiet determination to help Lucy... I'd catch glimpses of her from my study,bent over medical texts or sketching thoughtfully, and something in my chest would tighten inexplicably.

Standing at my bedroom window. I watched the sun begin to paint the manicured grounds in shades of gold. When was the last time I'd truly been present for Lucy's bedtime? The merger negotiations had been consuming my days and nights. The guilt settled heavy in my stomach,mixing uncomfortably with thoughts of Annie's gentle way with Lucy,how naturally she'd stepped into the role I'd been struggling to fill alone.

"Mr. Thompson?" Maria's voice startled me from my reverie. "Your coffee,sir."


I caught the housekeepers exchanging glances at my rumpled appearance-the same suit from yesterday, my usually immaculate appearance showing signs of strain.Their whispered concerns drifted through the halls: "Never seen him like this before... working too hard... not even changed..."

The mirror confirmed their observations. Dark circles shadowed my eyes.and my hands trembled slightly as I adjusted my tie. The CEO of Howard Technologies couldn't afford to show weakness, especially not today. But the face staring back at me looked more human than I'd allowed myself to appear in years. The gleaming headquarters of Howard Technologies rose like a monument.Employees nodded respectfully as I passed, their whispered conversations carrying notes of admiration. "Mr. Thompson's leadership during the merger talks has been incredible..." "Did you see the stock price since he tookover..."

"Following in his father's footsteps..."

Alone in my office, I let the mask slip slightly. My father's words echoed in my mind: "A Thompson carries the weight of generations. Personal desires are secondary to family legacy." I'd lived by those words since inheriting his position. Every decision calculated, every move strategic.

Until Annie.

The thought of her sent an uncomfortable ripple through my carefully maintained control. There was nothing strategic about the way my heart rate increased when she was near, nothing calculated about the warmth that spread through my chest when I saw her with Lucy.


The intercom buzzed, interrupting my dangerous train of thought."Your mother on line one,sir."


I suppressed a sigh. "Put her through."

"Howard, darling." My beloved mother, Margaret Thompson's voice carried its usual blend of authority and social refinement. "I've arranged lunch with Catherine Morgan next week. She's just returned from Europe,and her family's influence could be quite beneficial."

"Mother, we'vediscussed this." I pinched the bridge of my nose. "I'm focused on Lucy right now." "About that." Her tone sharpened. "The board has expressed concerns about your ability to balance CEO responsibilities with single parenthood.Perhaps it's time to consider more... traditional arrangements for Lucy's care." Ice spread through my veins. "Lucy stays with me."

"Don't be difficult. Howard. A child needs a proper family structure. You know the court wouldI agree that a grandmother's care might be more appropriate than a busy CEO's..."

The implied threat made my jaw clench. I drew a slow breath,forcing myself to respond diplomatically. "I'Il consider your concerns, Mother.But I have a meeting starting now."


"Consider carefully, Howard. The Morgan family's daughter would make an excellent match. Think of what's best for Lucy."

I ended the call, my fingers white-knuckled around the phone. Mother had always wielded Lucy's wellbeing like a weapon, but this felt different.More calculated. My eyes strayed to the family photo on my desk- Lucy's silent smile,forever frozen in happier times.

The weight of being both CEO and father pressed down on my shoulders.




The afternoon dragged interminably. Project delays mounted,pressure from the board increased, and I found myself adjusting my tie for the third time in an hour - a nervous tell I thought I'd eliminated years ago.

My phone buzzed with a message from Annie: "Will you join us for dinner tonight? I want to discuss something." The simple text shouldn't have sent such a jolt through my system. I stared at the words, mind racing. Lucy had been different lately-more responsive, almost speaking at times, but only to Annie . Was that what Annie wanted to discuss? Or was there somethng else? I realized I was smiling at my phone like a teenager and quickly schooled my expression. What was happening to me? I was Howard Thompson.CEO of a tech empire, known for my unshakeable control. I didn't get flustered by text messages.


Yet here I was, checking the time again,willing the hands to move faster so I could return home. Return to that soothing smell of lilacs.

The thought stopped me cold. When had home started meaning more than just the place where Lucy waited? When had Annie's presence become something I looked forward to with such... anticipation?

Focus, I commanded myself. The merger documents demanded attention.

Everyone's watching, the housekeepers, the employees, my mother,Lucy and Annie. I was supposed to keep my clothes clean, to make this project work.and to live up to my mother's expectation so there would be time for Lucy,and maybe for Annie.
###Chapter 11: Longing

Annie's POV

It was another day of sun. How lovely the morning was after whatever had happened these days. I thought as I made my way toward Lucy's room. A week of late nights researching selective mutism treatments had left me exhausted, but Lucy's progress made every bleary-eyed morning worth it.


As I passed Howard's bedroom, I noticed a warm glow beneath the door-the same gentle light I'd seen from his study last night as he worked late again. The familiar scent of his morning coffee was notably absent, and something in my chest tightened at the realization.

"A week now," I murmured to myself, the words barely a whisper."Always leaving early, coming home lae..." I caught myself and shook my head. What right did I have to mniss his presence? I was here for Lucy,nothing more.

"Mr. Thompson left for the office at five this morning, ma'am,"Maria informed me as I passed the kitchen. "Another early meeting."

I nodded, ignoring the small pang of disappointment. Focus on Lucy,I reminded myself. She needed consistency, routine, care - not a guardian distracted by inappropriate feelings for her uncle. Lucy's room was awashin morning sunshine when I entered. She sat at her vanity, already dressed in her school uniform, waiting patiently for our morning ritual. I gathered her golden hair in my hands, marveling at how this simple act of braiding had become something sacred between us. "How about a French braid today?" I suggested, meeting her eyes in the mirror. Her answering smile lit up her face, and then she spoke softly: "Can we do the special braid like yesterday?"

"Of course,sweetheart," I said, my voice thick with emotion. JuIst a week ago, she wouldn't have spoken at all. This small request, this tiny step forward, meant everything.




After sending Lucy to school, the mansion felt cavernous. I tried to lose myself in my usual routine - dividing time between studying selective mutism treatment books and sketching in my notebook.

Drawing had been my escape even before the divorce, a way to connect with Brian through art. Now, alone in the sunny study, my pencil moved almost unconsciously across the paper, capturing memories of teaching him how to draw his beloved dinosaurs.

I paused, studying the half-finished sketch. Without Brian, even art felt different. More solitary. And lately I'd found myself drawn to new subjects - Lucy's delicate profile as she watched birds through the window, the way sunlight played across the mansion's elegant architecture. My fingers itched to capture the quiet strength in Howard's bearing,how his controlled demeanor contrasted with his warm eyes... I quickly closed my sketchbook, cheeks warming. He has more important things to worry about than my amateur drawings, I scolded myself. Still, I couldn't help but notice how the study felt colder without his presence,how the halls echoed a little too loudly with just Lucy and me to fill them. My eyes drifted back to the selective mutism texts spread across the desk.Somewhere in these pages lay the key to helping Lucy find her voice again.If only Howard could see her small but steady progress - the almost- words that sometimes trembled on her lips, the way she was beginning to communicate through art just as I once had with Brian...

Stop it. I told myself firmly. He's working. The last thing he needs is to be bothered with my observations.




The afternoon sun beat down mercilessly on the Upper East Side Private Preschool. As Lucy and I approached the gates, I saw Brian standing near a teacher, his small shoulders set in that stubborn line I knew so well.

"Your father said he's still in a meeting and you mom's in charge of picking you up," The teacher was saying gently. "And your mother..."

"My real mom is coming!" Brian snapped, but I caught the tremor beneath his bravado. "Sarah promised she'd be here!"

Lucy's hand tightened in mine as she sensed the tension.

"She's just running late," Brian continued, his voice rising. "She has to come.She promised!"

"Brian," I said softly, unable to stop myself.

He whirled around, his face flushed. "Why are you here? Picking up Lucy?



The words were meant to wound, but something in his eyes - a flicker of uncertainty,a shadow of fear.


"Yes," I kept my voice steady. "I'm picking up Lucy."

"I don't care!"His shout echoed across the nearly empty schoolyard."You're not my mom anymore. Sarah loves me more than you ever did!" Lucy pressed closer to my side as Brian's voice cracked on the last word.

"T'm sure she's just stuck in traffic," The teacher offered weakly, checking her phone again. "These streets can be unpredictable."

But something felt wrong. Sarah, who had orchestrated every detail of stealing my son, who never missed an opportunity to play the perfect mother- she wasn't here? The Sarah I thought would never waste a chance to showcase her victory, to twist the knife deeper. Her absence felt deliberate.calculated.

Maybe I should take him home, back to his of course.

I watched as he furiously wiped his eyes with his sleeve, determined to hide his tears. The memory of the hospital stairs flashed unbidden through my mind - his cold eyes as I fell, the calculated cruelty of it all.Even knowing Sarah had manipulated him, the wound was still too fresh to ignore.

Lucy's small hand tightened in mine, her silent support grounding me in the present. As we turned to leave, I stole a glance at Brian until we rounded the corner.

I could forgive him, but not now.

After the hiccup, I took Lucy toward the car.

"What's this?" I asked as Lucy tugged my sleeve, pointing a poster in her hands.

"Emma says there's a new theme park near her house,"she said, not very fluently or loudly. Her hopeful eyes met mine in the rearview mirror.

"Would you like to go this weekend? But of course we would need your uncle's approval." Theenthusiastic nodding that followed made me laugh.My heart leaped - this was the most initiative she'd shown yet! Howard would want to know about this. The thought of starting a conversation with him sent an unexpected thrill through me.

This was no news to talk about on the phone. I would tell him in person!

Stop it, I chided myself. He's Lucy's uncle, your employer essentially.These feelings are inappropriate. But as Lucy started planning our weekend adventure, I couldn't help wondering if Howard might join us.The image of him watching Lucy play, that careful mask softening into genuine joy, was almost painfully appealing.

I was so weak.
###Chapter 12: Out of Control

Howard's POV

The merger documents sat neatly stacked on my desk, having endured three rounds of meticulous review. Everything was finally in order. I allowed myself a moment to think of home-of Annie's message about having something to discuss, of Lucy's silent but expressive presence. The corners of my mouth lifted slightly at the thought.

Rapid footsteps in the hallway shattered my momentary peace. My secretary burst through the door, her usually composed demeanor noticeably strained.

"Mr. Thompson, the acquisition team just called."

I raised an eyebrow,waiting.

"There's a significant discrepancy in the valuation model submitted by Wilson's team."


I leaned forward in my chair,maintaining my composure despite the surge of frustration. "Have Wilson's team send over their complete calculation sheets. I'll review them personally."

My secretary nodded, already tapping on her tablet. "They're preparing the files now, sir. Should I push back tomorrow morning's board meeting?"

"No." The word camne out sharper than intended, and I softened my tone."The schedule stays as is. We'll resolve this tonight." The briefcase I'd been reaching for remained untouched as I reopened my laptop. Of course the investment team would make a critical error now,when I'd finally started looking forward to something beyond these glass walls.

While the computer booted up, I reached for my phone. "I won't make it for dinner. But I'll try to get back early." The words came out with my usual restraint, though something in my chest tightened as I sent the message.

The typing indicator appeared, disappeared, then appeared again. Finally:

"Okay, I will put Lucy to bed early."

Such a simple response, yet I could picture her careful smile, the way she'd explain my absence to Lucy.

I set the phone face-down and pulled up the first batch of spreadsheets.Numbers. Calculations. These I understood. These followed rules, made sense, didn't create this uncomfortable warmth in my chest whenever I thought about Lucy and...Annie perhaps.

"Mr. Thompson?" My secretary's voice crackled through the intercom."Your mother's on the phone."

Twice in a day?

"Howard, darling. I've just had the most interesting conversation with Catherine."


I said briefly,"Yes?" "I just found out she may not want to be a mother so soon.Perhaps it would be best if Lucy stayed with me for a while? You're clearly overwhelmed..." "I'm handling a merger." My tone carried a warning edge. "At this hour? This is exactly what concerns me. You have no time for-"

"We'll discuss this later." I ended the call before she could continue.

My grip on the pen tightened until my knuckles whitened. Then slowly relaxed. Control. Always control. I forced my attention back to the Laptop before me, but Mother's words lingered like smoke, mixing toxically with the pressure of the failing merger.

Two hours passed, I was still in the conference room, personally reviewing each correction. Then I saw it - a crucial clause I'd somehow missed in my earlier reviews. The revelation was pounding my chest and for a second. I found it hard to breathe.

Every modification we'd made tonight would need to be recalculated.

I, Howard Thompson, had made a rookie mistake.

The entire night had been wasted.

"We'll continue tomorrow." I announced to my team as I headed for my car.


The mansion was silent when I finally arrived home. No soft scratching of pencils on paper from Lucy's art room. No gentle turning of pages from where Annie usually read. Just empty spaces filled with moonlight and the weight of my failures. The pressure that had been building all day finally cracked my careful control. I yanked open the refrigerator door, grabbed the whiskey and took a long swallow. The liquid burned but did nothing to ease the chaos in my mind. I need another distraction. Anything. Alcohol would not be enough to do it. "Howard?"

Annie's voice cut through the haze. She stood in the doorway, her expression a mix of concern and something deeper.

I crossed the space between us in three strides and pulled her close."Annie..." My voice emerged rough with need. A week of suppressed longing crumbled in her presence.

I kissed her.

She drew in a shaky breath, her chest rising and falling rapidly against mine. "I should go. It's late and-"

"Stay." The word escaped heavy with everything I'd been holding back."Please."


Her body betrayed her hesitation, pressing closer even as she protested."Howard,stop.We can't."

"Why not?" My hands slid to her waist, feeling her shiver at my touch.

"I just got divorced. Lucy needs stability, not... complications." Her hands trembled as she pushed against my chest. "You've been drinking. This isn't-"


"I know exactly what I'm doing." I traced her cheek with my thumb,watching her lean into the caress despite herself. "I've wanted you since that day in the photography studio." Her breath caught. "Think about Lucy. About your company. About-" "I'm tired of thinking." I rested my forehead against hers, breathing in her lilac scent. "For once, I want to feel." Something shifted in her eyes at those words. Her resistance wavered as I pressed her against the wall, one hand tangling in her hair while the other traced down her side. EachI touch drew a soft gasp from her lips.

"Howard..." This time my name was a plea as she arched into me, her body responding even as her mind fought for control. When my mouth found her nec, she moaned, her fingers curling into my shirt.

The sound shattered my restraint. I claimed her lips in a deep kiss,swallowing her whimpers as my hands roamed her body. The silk of her dress did nothingto hide how she trembled beneath my touch. Her skin burned everywhere I caressed, betraying her need even as she weakly protested.


"We shouldn't..." But her legs parted as my thigh pressed between them,her body growing pliant as my fingers traced the lace edge of her underwear. Years of maintaining perfect control dissolved in theface of how desperately she responded to each of my touch.

"I need you," I growled against her throat, feeling her pulse race beneath my lips. The words seemed to break something loose in her. Her hands,which had been pushing me away, now pulled me closer.

"Yes," she breathed, finally surrendering to what we both wanted. I lifted her against me, her legs wrapping around my waist as I carried her upstairs. Each step was exquisite torture with her pressed against me,leaving hot kisses along my jaw. For once, I didn't care about control or appearances or responsibilities.There was only Annie, and the overwhelming need to claim her as mine.
###Chapter 13: A Rude Awakening

Brian's POV

"Your dad isn't answering his phone. He must be in a meeting." my teacher said for the third time, frowning at her cell phone. "And Mrs.Johnson's number, I mean you step mom's number goes straight to voicemail."


I stood by the school gate, trying to look brave even though my stomach felt funny. Sarah promised she'd come. She promised. She said we'd go get ice cream after school,just like she always did before.

"Perhaps we should call your birth mother-" my teacher started.

"She's not my mother anymore!" The words burst out before I could stop them. "I don't want her to comne. She's mean and boring and only cares about stupid food rules!"

My teacher sighed that grown-up sigh that means they think you're being difficult. "Brian, someone needs to pick you up. It's already past four."

"I want to go home." I crossed my arms tight against my chest, like a shield."I can walk."


"You know we can't let you do that." She checked her phone again. "I'll have to escort you home myself." The walk felt longer than usual. My teacher kept trying to talk to me,asking about my day and my friends, but I just stared at my shoes.They were new ones Sarah had bought me -sparkly blue with real lights that blinked when I walked. Annie never let me have light-up shoes. She always said they were a waste of money and would break too quickly.
But Annie also never forgot to pick me up.

Our apartment building looked different somehow when we finally got there. Bigger. Emptier. The doorman nodded to my teacher and called the elevator, but nobody said anything on the rideup.

"Will you be alright by yourself?" my teacher asked when we reached our door. "Is there someone inside?"

"Dad will be home soon," I lied. "And Sarah too. They're just busy."

She didn't look like she believed me, but she finally left after making me promise to call the school if I needed anything. As soon as the door closed behind her, the apartment felt huge and quiet, like a museum after everyone goes home.

I dumped my backpack by the door- something Annie would have never allowed-and headed straight for the kitchen. Sarah had filled our freezer with my favorite ie cream flavors, all the ones Annie said had too much sugar. I grabbed the biggest spoon I could find and started eating right from the container.

That's when I saw Sarah's Instagram post.

"Perfect afternoon with my perfect boy! #BlessedMama #QualityTime"

The photo showed her and Max at the new theme park, the one she'd promised to take me to. They were both smiling, and Max had ice cream all over his face. The time stamp said "1 hour ago,"

My stomach started to hurt, but I couldn't tell if it was from all the ice cream or something else. I scrolled through more photos-Sarah and Max at the movies, at the park, getting fancy lunches. All posted today, while I was at school. While she was supposed to be too busy to pick me up. The ice cream didn't taste good anymore, but I kept eating.Annie would have stopped me by now. She always seemed to know exactly when I'd had too much, even before I did. She'd take away the ice cream and make me drink water, then rub my belly when it hurt.

But Annie wasn't here anymore. Because I'd wanted Sarah instead.

My stomach cramped sharply, making me curl up on the couch.The empty ice cream container fell to the floor, but I couldn't make myself pick it up. Annie would be so disappointed in the mess...

"Brian?" Dad's voice startled me. I hadn't even heard him come in. "What s wrong? Why are you home alone?"

"Sarah was supposed to..." The words got stuck as another cramp hit. "She promised..."


Dad's face did something complicated, like he was trying to figure out a really hard math problem. Then he saw the ice cream container and sighed."Let's get you to the doctor."




The next morning, Sarah was already at our kitchen table when I woke up.She looked perfect as always in her fancy clothes, but something felt different. Her smile didn't reach her eyes anymore.

"Finally awake?" she said, not looking up from her phone. "There's cereal if you're hungry." I stared at the box of sugary cereal on the table. Annie never let me have this kind for breakfast. She said my body needed real food to grow strong and healthy. She'd make me special pancakes instead, the ones that didn't make my stomach hurt. "I don't feel good," I said quietly. "Can I have something else?"

Sarah's perfect eyebrows drew together. "If you don't want cereal,you can go hungry. I'm not your servant."

Max snickered from his seat, his mouth full of colorful cereal. "Mom says only babies need special food."

"But yesterday you said-"

"Things change, Brian." Sarah's voice had an edge I'd never heard before."And if you tell your father about any of this, you'll regret it. Understood?"

I nodded quickly, my throat feeling tight. This wasn't the Sarah I knew.
Where was the one who bought me toys and let me eat whatever I wanted?The one who said she'd be a better mom than Annie?

"Max, honey, ready to go to the new theme park?" Sarah's voice turned sweet again as she turned to her son. "I got us VIP passes!"

"But you promised we'd all go together..." The words slipped out before I could stop them.

Sarah's perfect smile turned sharp. "Plans change. Maybe next time."

I watched them leave,Sarah's designer heels clicking against the floor, Max shooting me a smug look over his shoulder. The apartment felt even bigger and emptier than before.

Sitting alone at the kitchen table, I stared at the soggy cereal turning the milk weird colors. Annie would have never left me alone like this. Even when she was mad at me, she always made sure I ate properly.She'd sit with me and ask about my day, even if I didn't want to talk. The door opened again hours later, and for a second I thought maybe Dad had come home early. But it was Sarah, her perfect makeup not quite hiding how angry she looked.

"You little brat," she hissed, grabbing my arm. "Max got hurt at the park because of your stupid mother!"

"Annie? But she wasn't even-"

The slap caught me by surprise, my cheek stinging as tears sprang to my eyes.


"Your mother got my son beaten up!" Sarah's perfect nails dug into my arm. "Well, if my son has to suffer, so do you!"

I tried to pull away, but she was stronger than she looked. "Please, I didn't-"


"Max!" she called out. "Take Brian's breakfast and throw it away. We can't let Brian's Dad see that."


Max appeared with a mean grin, grabbing my untouched cereal bowl. I watched him dump it in the trash and then take out the trash,remembering all the times Annie had made sure I ate, even when I was being difficult.

"Go to your room," Sarah ordered Max. "And don't come out, no matter what you hear." As Max's door closed, Sarah's face changed. She wasn't even trying to look nice anymore. She looked... scary. "Your father wants us to be a happy family," she said, her voice getting weirdly calm. "But you're making that very difficult, Brian. Very difficult indeed."
###Chapter 14: Daddy

Annie's POV

In the morning, I was painting the living room. I hummed softly as I packed sandwiches into the picnic basket, each movement measured and careful despite the giddy warmth in my chest.

"Mom's in a really good mood today," Lucy's voice came softly from behind me.


I nearly dropped the thermos I was holding. Even after a week, hearing her speak still felt like a small miracle. But this morning, her observation made heat rise to my cheeks as memories from that night a few days ago flooded back...

*Howard's fingers tangled in my hair as he deepened the kiss. The taste of whiskey on his lips should have been a warning, but when he whispered"I need you" against my mouth, all my carefully constructed barriers crumbled. We'd stumbled upstairs, hands exploring, hearts racing...*

"Annie?"

Howard's voice jolted me from my reverie. He stood in the doorway,tablet conspicuously absent for once, wearing casual clothes that made him look years younger. "Ready for our adventure?" I ducked my head, hoping he couldn't read the memories in my eyes.That night, after our passionate encounter, I'd curled against his chest and whispered Lucy's wish to visit the new theme park. He'd promised to take us after his work was simply done. I hadn't expected him to follow through so quickly. "Almost ready!" I called out, packing the last few items. Lucy stood nearby,carefully arranging her backpack, her eyes darting between Howard and me with a knowing smile that made me wonder just how much she'd noticed.


The lingering sweetness from our passionate encounter days ago seemed to hover in the air as we drove to Manhattan, broken only by Lucy's occasional excited comments about the attractions she wanted to try. I caught Howard watching me in the rearview mirror more than once, his controlledexpression softening whenever our eyes met.




The theme park buzzed with weekend energy. Lucy's eyes grew wide at the sight of the carousel, its painted horses gleaming in the midday sun.

"Would you like to try it?" Howard asked gently.

Lucy nodded eagerly, and we joined the line. I watched in wonder as she perched atop a golden horse, Howard standing protectively beside her. His hand brushed mine as we both reachedto steady her,sending electricity skittering across my skin.

The picnic that followed felt like a scene from someone else's life-Lucy actually giggling as she bit into her sandwich, Howard's usual CEO persona nowhere in sight as he stretched out on the blanket beside us. For a moment, we were just a normal family enjoying a sunny day.

But the peace shattered shortly after Lucy's second carousel ride.

I noticed the change immediately - her shoulders hunched, her earlier joy evaporating. Howard tensed beside me, his protective instincts kicking in.

"Sweetheart?" I knelt beside her. "Don't you want to play anymore?" She shook her head, making the writing motion we'd developed. I pulled out the small notebook I always carried now. Her hands trembled slightly as she wrote:


"Max said I'm a mute freak. Said Mom isn't good enough for our family.His mom says you are just after Uncle Howard's money."

My heart clenched, but years of teaching experience took over. "Max needs to apologize for those unkind words."

Sarah sauntered forward with Max sulking behind her, her red lips curved in a smile that didn't reach her eyes. She gave Howard's impeccable appearance an appreciative once-over before turning to me with barely concealed disdain.

"Apologize?" She laughed, the sound like wind chimes with razor edges."Oh Annie, I'm just pointing out what everyone can see." Her gaze swept over my simple dress before returning to Howard. "Some of us understand the finer things in life.. and some of us are clearly out of our depth.Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Clearly-Somebodly?”

The words hit deeper than I wanted to admit. She was right - I didn't belong in their privileged sphere. What was I thinking, imagining I could... "Excuse me." Howard's voice cut through my spiral of doubt. He stepped forward, placing himself between us. His voice carried that familiar CEO authority that could make board members squirm in their seats. "You have a sharp eye. So you should know what would happen if you and your son don't apologize to my family." The color drained from Sarah's perfectly made-up face. Her eyes darted around frantically, probably counting how many witnesses were within earshot. Howard's subtle reminder clearly hit its mark. "I... I didn't mean..." she stammered, her earlier confidenceevaporating.Then,switching tactics with desperate efficiency, she turned to Max. "Sweetheart,that wasn't nice. You need to apologize right now." When Max just crossed his arms defiantly, panic flashed across her face. "Max!" She shoved him forward, her careful poise completely shattered. "Apologize.Now!"


When he just glared sullenly, she did something I never expected - her hand whipped out,catching him across the face. "I said apologize!"

"S-sorry," Max mumbled, tears welling in his eyes.

Right after that, Sarah dragged him away, leaving us in stunned silence.Lucy's small hand found mine, squeezing tight.

She was quite fluctuating. Yet she was pregnant. Maybe that could explain it. Pregnant women could be unpredictable. Or she was just jealous.

"Don't let her words bother you," Howard murmured, his arm sliding around my shoulders. The warmth of his touch steadied me, even as my heart raced at his closeness.




That evening, Lucy surprised me by asking if we could sleep together.As we lay in her bed, her small body curled trustingly against mine. I felt a surge of maternal warmth. She held onto me tightly, as if afraid I might disappear. Lucy curled against me, her small head tucked under my chin. As I stroked her hair, the tender moment brought a fleeting memory of Brian,but it didn't hurt as much anymore. Lucy's warmth and steady breathing had become its own kind of comfort, especially tonight when she'd asked to sleep beside me.

"Lucy, sweetheart?" I whispered, my fingers still gentle in her hair. She stirred against me, tilting her face up to meet my gaze. Those clear eyes blinked up at me, filled with trust.

"Would it be okay..." I began softly, careful not to disturb the delicate peace between us, "if I asked you something?"

She nodded.

"First, why did you choose me? What made you want me to stay?"

Lucy was quiet for a moment, then spoke softly: "I saw Brian's drawings at school. They were better than everyone else's. He said you taught him."She paused. then added, "I thought you maust be good at drawing. Like my mommy was."

My heart constricted at her words. Such a simple reason, yet it carried so much meaning.

"For my second question..." I hesitated, "Would you try talking to Howard?Just a little?"

She nodded again and slipped out of bed. I followed as she padded down the hallway to Howard's study. He sat at his desk, reading through documents, but looked up as we appeared in the doorway. When we entered, his eyes were suspiciously bright as he gathered Lucy into his arms. "Daddy" What? Did she know something?
###Chapter 15: She's My Girlfriend

Annie's POV

The morning sun painted the mansion's kitchen in shades of gold as I prepared breakfast alone, the usual staff having the day off. The familiar scent of coffee filled the air, but my hands trembled slightly as I measured out the grounds. This morning felt different.

Keep it professional, I reminded myself for the hundredth time. Lucy needed stability, not complications. But even as I arranged her breakfast with meticulous care, my mind wandered to the warmth of Howard's embrace, the tenderness in his eyes when he'd whispered my name...

No.Focus.

Lucy bounded into the kitchen, her golden hair catching the sunlight."Morning, Mom!" The word still made my heart skip, even as guilt gnawed at me. What right did I have to let her call me that when I was jeopardizing her stability with my inappropriate feelings for her uncle? He was way out of my league. Sarah was right. I was just nobody.

"Morning!" Howard appeared moments later, impeccable as always in his perfectly tailored suit. Our eyes met briefly before I looked away,busying myself with Lucy's lunch. The weight of his gaze lingered, carrying all the unspoken words between us.

"Morning,Daddy!" Lucy's innocent words struck me hard. I nearly dropped the coffee pot,my hands suddenly unsteady. The domesticity of the scene - Lucy's happy greeting, Howard's warm presence, the golden morning light streaming through the windows -it all felt simultaneously perfect and terrifying. I was desperately trying to ignore how natural this felt. How right. But beneath that warmth lurked the cold reality of my position here. I was Lucy's caretaker. Howard's employee. Nothing more.

Or was I?

The memory of his kiss burned through my carefully constructed defenses.The way he'd held me, touched me, whispered my name...

"Annie?" Howard's voice jolted me from my thoughts. "Is everything alright?"

I turned, forcing a smile. "Jus tired." The lie felt heavy on my tongue.

Lucy watched our interaction with those observant eyes of hers, a small smile playing at the corners of her mouth. Did she know? Could she sense the change between us? The thought sent panic fluttering through my chest. She'd already lost so much-what if this ruined everything? What if she resented me for complicating her relationship with her uncle?

I wanted to ask her directly: Would you be okay with this? With us? But the words stuck in my throat. Better to maintain professional distance than risk shattering this fragile peace we'd built.

"Your pancakes are getting cold," I said instead, sliding the plate toward Lucy. She accepted it with a knowing look that made my cheeks burn. The drive to school felt endless. I sat in the back with Lucy, watching the mansions of Long Island roll past as she hummed contentedly. Sarah's words from the park echoed in my mind: "Some of us understand the finer things in life... and some of us are clearly out of our depth." My reflection in the window looked small and plain beside Howard's commanding presence in the driver's seat. "Mom,can we get ice cream after school?" Lucy's innocent question pulled me from my spiral of self-doubt.

"We'll see, sweetheart." I managed a smile, grateful for the distraction.

The school gates loomed ahead, but as we approached, my heart stopped.Philip stood there.

Howard's hands tightened imperceptibly on the steering wheel.

"Hurry up. Go greeting with your teachers," he murmured to Lucy as we parked.

Lucy quickly got into the school.

Philip's smirk widened as Howard and I was here together. "Well, well.Moving on faster than I expected, Annie."
"We're divorced, Philip. My life is none of your concern." The words came out steady,though my pulse raced.

His eyes swept over Howard's elegant appearance with a calculating gaze. "That's quite an upgrade. Everything he's wearing probably costs more than your annual salary." His voice dripped with false concern.

"Where are you driving at?" I asked,afraid of the answer. "Tell me, Annie,do you really think you can fit into his world? A divorced woman from Boston, playing at being Upper East Side? You're just his latest charitable project." The words struck deeper than I wanted to admit. Everything Sarah had said at the park suddenly felt painfully true. What was I thinking,imagining I could belong in Howard's world? "Again, that's not your business. And where's Sarah by the way. I thought she would love to sent Brian to school. "I said,trying to remain calm.

"Sarah's pregnant." Philip continued, clearly enjoying my discomfort,but a bit unprepared by my question, "She needs rests."

A bitter laugh escaped before I could stop it. "Congratulations. Of course she's pregnant so soon. Or a bit too soon?"


Philip's smug expression faltered. "What are you talking about?"

I thought of Sarah's texts with Robert about their romantic weekend in Paris, her calculated plan to trap Philip with another man's child. The irony was almost painful - Philip Baker, master manipulator,completely blind to being manipulated himself.

But before I could respond, Howard stepped forward. His hand found mine, fingers intertwining with deliberate purpose. "Annie isn't a project or a charity case," he said, his controlled voice carrying an edge of steel. "She's my girlfriend."

The world seemed to stop. I stared at our joined hands, then up at Howard's face. His usual mask of careful restraint had fallen away,replaced by something fierce and certain.

Philip opened his mouth, then closed it. Without another word, he turned and walked away.
###Chapter 16:Manipulation

I dabbed at my eyes with exquisite precision, carefully smudging my makeup just enough to suggest recent tears without looking messy. The humiliation at the new theme park still burned fresh in my mind.

Everything had to be perfect now. The kitchen counter gleamed under the afternoon light, except for the artfully scattered flour and the pot of congee simmering on the stove - evidence of my "maternal efforts." The aroma of rice and ginger filled the air, a motherly touch that even Philip couldn't ignore.

"Max, darling?" I called softly towards his room. "Remember what Mommy said?"

"Yes, Mommy!" His eager response brought a genuine smile to my lips. At least one child knew how to appreciate me properly.
I settled onto the sofa, smoothing my dress carefully, and allowed myself to sink into the bitterness that had been building since the park incident.The scene kept replaying in my mind - having to apologize, to grovel in public. And all because Howard Thompson chose to defend that Boston nobody as if she belonged in our world.

My hands clenched involuntarily. Howard would pay for that humiliation. They all would. I'd worked too hard to let everything slip away now. I still remembered my first entry into this world, how I'd methodically charmed my way into Robert's life when his family's fortune still gleamed. Oh, Robert. I almost felt sorry for him sometimes. Almost. He never saw how I orchestrated his family's downfall, one extravagant purchase at a time. The endless shopping sprees, impromptu trips to Paris,charitable donations that happened to benefit my social connections - by the time he realized what was happening, it was too late. I'd already secured my position in society and jumped ship with perfect timing.

I scattered a few more crumpled tissues on the coffee table. Philip would be home soon, and this little scene I was setting would make the park incident work to my advantage after all.

The memory of Howard defending Annie at the park sent fresh waves of humiliation through me. Having to slap Max to maintain my facade...but it was necessary. Everything I did was necessary. The ends always justified the means, didn't they?

The sound of a key in the lock pulled me from my thoughts. Showtime.

I hunched my shoulders slightly, making myself look smaller on the sofa.Years of practice had taught me exactly how to position myself to appear most vulnerable. The first sob escaped just as Philip entered - perfectly timed, if I do say so myself.

"Sarah?" His concern was immediate, just as I knew it would be. "WNhat's wrong?"

I lifted my face, letting him see the carefully crafted distress. "Oh, Philip..."I made my voice tremble just slightly. "I'm trying so hard with Brian,but...
 He sat beside me, exactly as expected. Men were so predictable when it came to damsel in distress scenarios. "What happened?" 
"His stomach was still upset from yesterday, so I made him congee." I gestured toward the kitchen, pride swelling at my own attention to detail. "A mother's touch, you know? But he refused to even try it..."

"That's not true!"

Ah, right on cue. Brian stood in the doorway, face flushed with anger.Such a predictable child, really. Just like his mother- no sense of subtlety or finesse.

"You never made any congee!" Brian continued, voice cracking. "You only gave me cereal and then left with Max!"

I flinched delicately, pressing closer to Philip. Amateur hour, Brian. Really."See how he treats me?" I whispered, letting my voice catch. "After everything I've done..."


Philip's eyes narrowed as he studied Brian's face, then mine. Then,he checked Brian's arms for any signs of abuse, finding nothing but normal childhood scrapes. His gaze swept the kitchen, noting the perfectly arranged cereal boxes, the pristine countertops.

"Show me where she hit you," he demanded.

Brian's hand flew to his cheek, but of course, hours had passed. No mark remained. I'd been careful about that.

"It... it was here," Brian stammered. "But it doesn't show anymore!"

Philip's expression hardened. He turned to me, protective instinct overriding parental insight. "Apologize to Sarah right now." "But Dad, she's lying! She took Max to the theme park and left me alone!Then she hit me when she came back!" Oh, the wonderful irony. The truth sounds so much like a lie when it comes from a child's mouth, doesn't it?

"Enough!" Philip's shout echoed satisfyingly through the apartment. "Sarah has been nothing but kind to you. She's trying to be a mother to you.and this is how you repay her?"

I touched Philip's arm gently, the perfect picture of a concerned stepmother. "It's okay, really. I understand it's hard for him..." The weight of the bracelet he'd given me last week felt particularly satisfying against my wrist.

"No, it's not okay." Philip stood, towering over his son. "Go to your room and think about how you're treating someone who only wants to help you.And don't come out until you're ready to apologize properly."
I watched Brian's smaIl fists clench at his sides, noting with satisfaction how his eyes filled with tears. "You never believe me anymore," he whispered. "Never."

The slam of his bedroom door was music to my ears.

I let my shoulders shake with perfectly calibrated sobs. "Maybe...maybe this was a mistake. Perhaps Max and I should go..." The threat hung in the air like expensive perfume. "No!" Philip's response was instant, desperate - exactly as I'd known it would be. He gathered me into his arms, and I had to suppress a smile of triumph. "Please, Sarah. I'll talk to him. I'll make him understand." I buried my face against his chest, allowing myself a moment of satisfaction. Then, time for the coup de grâce. "I just want us to be a family," I whispered. "Like Howard and Annie are becoming with Lucy."

I felt him stiffen instantly. Men are so transparent when it comes to their exes.


"What do you mean?" His voice carried exactly the edge I'd been hoping for.


I pulled back slightly, studying his face with practiced innocence. "Oh...you haven't heard? Lucy's calling her 'Mom' now. They're quite the happy little family from what I saw at the park." I traced patterns on his chest,keeping my voice soft and vulnerable. "It must be nice, finding someone who fits so perfectly into your world..."


His jaw tightened - another predictable response. I pressed closer,playing my role to perfection. "I try so hard to fit into yours," I murmured. "To be what you and Brian need..."


His arms tightened possessively around me, fingers tracing fire across my skin. Through half-lidded eyes, I caught our reflection in the hallway mirror- his tall frame pressed against my curves, my head tilted back in calculated surrender. Down the hall, Brian's muffled sobs provided the perfect accompaniment to my victory.

"All mine," Philip growled against my throat. I smiled, letting my nails scrape lightly down his chest. The pregnancy test in my purse felt like a crown jewel - my final trap ready to spring. Whose child it actually was hardly mattered.

 I arched into his touch, knowing exactly how to make him lose control.Men were such simple creatures, so easily led by their desires. Robert had been the same before his fortune crumbled. "Only yours." I breathed, the lie tasting sweet on my tongue as his grip tightened further
###Chapter 17: I Was Just a Divorced Woman
Annie's POV

Philip's retreating figure had barely disappeared when Howard's phone rang. I was still tingling from his touch, the warmth of his fingers intertwined with mine sending electricity through my entire body. The way he'd claimed me as his girlfriend made my heart race - not just his words, but the possessive edge in his voice that hinted at desires barely contained beneath his controlled exterior.


His expression shifted as he answered the call, but his eyes remained on me, dark with an intensity that made my breath catch. "Yes... I understand... I'll be there immediately." He ended the call, stepping closer."The merger..."

"Go," I said quickly, though every nerve in my body screamed to stay near him."I'll catch a cab home."

"Wait." He caught my hand, his thumb tracing slow circles on my palm that made my skin burn. The simple touch somehow felt more intimate than our passionate encounter days ago. "The company library has an excellent collection, and there's a professional art studio. Would you like to spend the day there?Drawing,reading?" I looked up at him, catching the flicker of desire in his eyes before his careful mask slipped back into place. My pulse quickened at the memory of how that mask had shattered when he'd kissed me in the kitchen,how his controlled demeanor had crumbled under the force of our mutual need. "Won't I disturb your work?" My voice came out breathier than intended. His lips curved in that smile that made heat pool in my belly. "Not at all."
He leaned closer, his cologne - that intoxicating blend of tobacco and something darker - wrapping around me like a caress. "And we can pick up Lucy together after work."

How could I resist when he looked at me like that, his controlled voice carrying undertones that made me shiver? I nodded, already anticipating hours of sweet torture, knowing he was just rooms away.




Howard Technologies headquarters rose like a monument to power and success,but all I could focus on was Howard's hand at the small of my back as he guided me through the lobby. Each touch, though perfectly professional, carried echoes of that night -his fingers tangled in my hair,his mouth hot against my neck...

The curious glances and whispered conversations that followed our progress barely registered through the haze of awareness that surrounded us. This was his domain, where he was king, and watching him command this space with such effortless authority only heightened my attraction to him.


"This will be your space," he said, opening the door to a bright corner room. The windows offered a stunning view, but not as stunning as the way the morning light played across his features, highlighting the strong line of his jaw, the subtle gold in his carefully trimmed beard. An easel had been set up near the natural light, but my fingers itched to trace his profile instead. The women exchanged knowing looks. "Just a caretaker?" Amanda's perfectly sculpted eyebrow arched, "Mr. Thompson has never brought a woman to the office before. And that private art studio..." "He must really trust you with Lucy," another chimed in. Her name badge read 'Jennifer - HR'. "Though with his position and looks,he has plenty of "The library's through that door, and my office is just down the hall." His voice remained steady,but his eyes burned with barely concealed heat as they met mine. The air between us crackled with tension, heavy with everything we couldn't say or do in this professional setting. "I have meetings all morning, but my secretary can helpif you need anything." He stepped closer, fingers brushing my cheek in a touch that seemed to sear my skin. The careful restraint in his movements only emphasized the passion simmering beneath the surface. "I'Il try to join you for lunch."

After he left, I explored the room, trying to calm my racing heart.Everything was perfect, professional-grade -just like Howard himself,with his impeccable exterior hiding such delicious depths of passion. The memory of how that passion had finally broken free made me press my thighs together, fighting a wave of desire.

But lunch brought me crashing back to reality.

\---

The company cafeteria was sleek and modern, like everything else in the building. I'd barely settled at a corner table when three women approached,their designer outfits and perfect makeup making me acutely aware of my own appearance.

"You must be the lady Mr. Thompson brought in this morning," the tallest one said, sliding into the seat across from me. "I'm Amanda from Marketing."

"Annie," I replied, forcing a smile. "I'm Lucy's caretaker." options. Half the women here would kill for a chance with him."

"Well,well," the third added with a knowing smirk. "Mr. Thompson has...particular tastes in companionship. Not that anyone's had much luck."

The women exchanged meaningful glances that made my cheeks burn.

"Though his mother keeps trying to arrange proper matches," Amanda sighed. "As if someone like Mr. Thompson would be interested in settling down."


My appetite vanished as their insinuations hung in the air. The way they spoke of Howard painted a picture of a man far removed from the gentle soul who cared so deeply for Lucy. For me, our night together had meant everything. But for someone like him... perhaps it was just another fleeting moment.


They were right-what was I doing here? The passionate moments we'd shared suddenly felt like a dream.Howard could have anyone. Someone who understood his world, who could navigate board meetings and charity galas. Not a divorced mother who'd never even owned designer shoes.




The drive to pick up Lucy was heavy with unspoken words. Howard sat close enough that his warmth tantalized me, his cologne making my head spin with memories of passion. But the doubts had taken root too deeply to be erased even by the magnetic pull between us. "How did you find the company?" His voice carried that controlled warmth that both thrilled and terrified me now. "The studio was lovely," I managed, fighting the urge to reach for him."The library too." "Would you like to come back tomorrow?"

I made a noncommittal sound, staring out the window. How could I explain that every minute in his world only emphasized how much I didn't belong there, no matter how right we felt together?

Lucy was waiting at the school gates, but something was wrong. Her usual bright smile was missing, and she climbed into the car without her customary "Mom!" greeting. My heart sank further- had she somehow sensed the change between Howard and me? Was she upset about it?

"Lucy, sweetheart?" I tried, but she just stared out the window, silent as she'd been before I entered their lives.


All I could feel was darkness closing in. What was I doing? Playing at being a girlfriend to a CEO? Pretending I could be a mother to his niece?Sarah and Philip were right-I was out of my depth.

Howard's earlier words - "She's my girlfriend" - had seemed so certain this morning. Now they felt like a dream, something too beautiful to survive in the harsh light of reality. I was just Annie Baker, a divorced mother who'd somehow stumbled into a world she didn't understand.

As we pulled up to the mansion, Lucy rushed inside without a backward glance. Howard reached for me, his touch sending sparks of electricity through my body even now. But I pulled away, ignoring the flash of hurt in his eyes. "Annie..," The way he said my name still made my heart race, but I couldn't let myself be swept away again. "I should check on Lucy," I said quickly, fleeing before he could see the tears threatening to fall, before the magnetic pull between us could override my common sense again.

What had I been thinking? Some fairy tales weren't meant to come true.no matter how passionate the chemistry between its characters.
###Chapter 18: Mother and Catherine

Howard's POV

"Meeting adjourned."

The last board members filed out. I remained seated, my mind far from the merger discussions we'd just concluded. Instead, my thoughts drifted to Lucy's behavior last night -specifically, the way she'd suddenly stopped calling Annie "Mom."

The change bothered me more than I wanted to admit. Just days ago,Lucy had been making remarkable progress. I remembered how she'd curl up next to Annie during story time, the way her eyes would light up at Annie's gentle smiles of encouragement. More importantly, I recalled Annie s remarkable ability to understand Lucy's needs without words. Her professional knowledge combined with natural intuition had proven invaluable to Lucy's progress.

I believed she would find a way to work this out,just like before.

Then, the memory of that night sent heat coursing through me-Annie's soft skin under my hands, her gasps against my neck as I moved above her. She'd tried bringing up Lucy between kisses, but I'd silenced her with my mouth, my touch, until she could only whisper my name. The way she'd looked beneath me, hair spread across my pillows, eyes dark with desire... Even now, the memory of her body trembling against mine had my heart racing. It was nearly noon-time for lunch. I could spend it with Annie. The art studio door opened silently. Annie was asleep at her desk, and the sight made my breath catch. Her blouse had slipped, revealing the slightest marks I'd left on her shoulder from our passionate night together. The memory of her pressed against me, skin flushed and hot under my lips,made my body tense with want.

Watching her sleep so peacefully, all I could think about was how she'd felt in my arms, the soft sounds she'd made as I'd claimed her mouth.

I gripped the doorframe, fighting the urge to wake her with kisses.The children's illustrations on the walls just reminded me of how she looks when she's drawing - that unconscious lip bite that drives me wild with desire. Maybe I should make her position here official... though seeing her in meetings,remembering how she tastes, how she trembles when I touch her...

My phone's sudden vibration shattered the peaceful moment. I fumbled frantically for the mute button, my eyes darting to Annie's sleeping form.The screen displayed "Mother" - of course it would be her, at this precise moment.


Confirming Annie hadn't stirred, I backed carefully out of the studio.Leaning against the wall outside, I stared at the still-vibrating phone with a mixture of resignation and amusement. Howard Thompson,CEO of Howard Technologies, sneaking around like a teenager. The irony wasn't lost on me.

"Howard," Mother's voice carried its usual blend of authority and disapproval. "About Lucy and your meeting with Catherine." I str ode toward my office, keeping my voice low. "We've discussed  "Catherine would make an excellent wife for you. She comes from an impeccable background, and her family's connections. But she doesn't want to be a mother so soon-"this." "No," I closed my office door firmly behind me, my tone hardening. "Lucy stays with me."

"You're being unreasonable. A child needs proper guidance, not just a busy uncle who can barely manage his own life." Her voice sharpened."Though I hear you've found... alternative arrangements."

I tensed. "What do you mean?"

"That divorced woman you hired. Really, Howard? Do you think the board will approve of such... complications?"

"Annie is a qualified professional who's helping Lucy make significant progress."

"Is that all she is?" Mother's tone dripped with skepticism. "Meet with Catherine. Once. That's all I'm asking."

I pinched the bridge of my nose, calculating the least problematic response."Fine. Once. But my position regarding Lucy won't change."



The afternoon light was fading when an urgenat knock interrupted my work. Before my secretary could intervene, Catherine swept into my office,her designer heels clicking against the hardwood floor.
"I'm sorry, Mr. Thompson," my secretary hurried in after her."Ms.Morgan insisted-" "It's fine." I waved her out, though everything about this situation was far from fine. Catherine settled gracefully onto the visitor's couch,crossing her legs with practiced elegance. "Your mother sent me." Her smile held a predatory edge. "She says I should invite you out in person."

"Yes." I remained standing, maintaining distanace. "But you made your position clear regarding Lucy."

"Oh, that." She waved dismissively. "But I've learned a lot about you from your mother,Howard. I think we could be good together. Perhaps in time,you'll realize I'm more important than Lucy." Her smile widened. "Then we could send her to live with her grandma, where she belongs."

"Impossible." The word came out sharp as steel. "I won't pursue a relationship with anyone who won't accept my daughter."

Her eyes gleamed at my rejection. "Such devotion. It makes you even more attractive." She rose smoothly, moving closer. "I do enjoy a challenge."

I stepped back, my voice dropping to a dangerous register. "This isn't a game, Catherine. Lucy is my niece, but I take her as my daughter. This is not a negotiable condition."


"We'll see." She reached for the door, pausing to glance over her shoulder.
###Chapter 19: Reconciliation

Annie's POV

I set down my stylus and massaged my cramping fingers. The dinosaur illustration I'd been working on for hours was nearly complete, but my concentration was slipping. Howard's voice drifted through the half-open door as he conducted his business call next door. Something about his steady, measured tone helped anchor me when my thoughts started racing.It was strange how quicklyI'd come to rely on his predictable presence.

I noticed a photo on the bookshelf-Lucy with her parents before the yacht accident. The smiling, carefree child in that picture was nothing like the quiet, hesitant girl who now lived with us.

Her sudden regression worried me more than I wanted to admit. She'd stopped calling me "Mommy." No more nods or head shakes. No eye contact.It was like watching our former progress vanish overnight.

At dinner yesterday, when I'd offered her more dessert, she'd just stared at her plate with hunched shoulders. I caught Howard's frown across the table. He'd noticed too.

Something or someone had hurt her. I needed to find out what.

I tapped my tablet screen, an idea forming. If Lucy couldn't talk to me directly, maybe I could reach her through drawing-the one language I truly understood. I opened my neglected social media account and checked my illustration portfolio. The comment section was filled with messages I hadn't noticed before: "*My daughter asks for your dinosaur pictures every night before bed.*"

"*My son has your pterodáctyl taped above his bed.*"

"*As a preschool teacher, my students love your work. When will you publish a book?*"


"*Have you considered art therapy? Children connect with your style.*"

That last comment stopped me cold. I'd studied illustration in Boston before giving it up for Philip. "Just a hobby," he'd called it whenever I mentioned pursuing it seriously.

Yet here were strangers telling me my work mattered.

My gaze drifted to Lucy's family drawing on the wall. Three stick figures-Howard,Lucy,and me-holding hands under a yellow sun. I remembered her concentrated expression as she'd carefully labeled each person.

Maybe this was my answer. If Lucy couldn't talk about what was bothering her,perhaps she could draw it.

I grabbed some sketchbooks, pencils, and markers and headed to her room,hoping I was right.



Lucy sat on her bed with hands folded tightly in her lap, watching her butterfly mobile. When I walked in, she glanced up but didn't smile. "Want to help me with some drawings?" I asked, dumping my supplies on the edge of her bed. "I could use a creative partner tonight." Lucy's eyes flickered with interest. I opened my sketchbook and started drawing. "Look, it's us-you, me, and your dad." I sketched three simple figures. "What do you think?"

She leaned forward and nodded-barely, but it was something.

"Your turn." I handed her paper and colored pencils. "Draw whatever you want."


She hesitated before picking up a blue pencil. Her first marks were tentative, but grew bolder with each stroke. I drew alongside her, letting the quiet build a bridge between us.

When she finished, she pushed her picture toward me. Three figures-Howard,herself, and me-holding hands under a tree.

"This is beautiful," I said, meaning it. "You've captured us perfectly."

The corner of her mouth twitched upward.

"Let's do another," I suggested, handing her fresh paper. "Maybe those butterflies you like?"

With each drawing, Lucy inched closer until our shoulders touched.Her body relaxed, the wall between us crumbling sketch by sketch.
After our fifth drawing, I put down my pencil. "Lucy, you've been very quiet lately. Is something wrong?" Lucy froze, her marker suspended over the paper. Then, barely audible,she whispered, "Mommy..." Relief washed over me."Yes,sweetheart?" "Why didn't you call me your daughter today?""What? When?" I asked, confused.

"At school..." Her lip trembled. "Brían said you weren't really my mom.He said you're just taking care of me until... until I'm better... because my real parents are dead."


My stomach dropped. Brian-Philip's son-had found Lucy at school despite my careful efforts to keep tem apart.

"He said I stole his mommy," she continued, almost inaudibly. "He said you'll go back to him and his dad later."

I clenched my jaw, fighting back anger. A five-year-old couldn't have invented these ideas-they came from Sarah1, had to. I took a deep breath before my rage showed on my face.

"Lucy," I took her hands in mine. "Listen carefully. You are *not* stealing me from anyone. I'm here because I *want* to be here with you."

She searched my face. "But I'm not really your daughter."

"Family isn't about blood," I said, squeezing her fingers. "It's about love.And you,Lucy Thompson,have my whole heart."

I grabbed a fresh paper and drew a quick heart. "See? I'm putting the people I love inside this heart." I wrote "Lucy" in the center, then "Howard" beside it. "The truth is," I admitted, "I've always wanted a daughter. I feel lucky I found you." Her eyes filled with tears."Really?" "Really. You are my daughter in all the ways that matter.Nothing will change that."

Lucy threw herself into my arms so hard I almost fell backward.She buried her face against my shoulder, trembling. "I love you, Mommy," she whispered fiercely.

"I love you too, sweetheart," I said, blinking back tears. "So much."

We stayed tangled together until her breathing steadied. When she finally pulled away, her expression had cleared, the doubt replaced by certainty.

"Can we draw more?" she asked, her voice stronger.

"Of course," I handed her fresh paper. "What would you like to draw next?






The front door opened, but we barely noticed until footsteps echoed down the hallway. Lucy's head snapped up, her body instantly rigid.

"What's wrong?" I asked.

Without answering, she slipped off the bed and crept to the doorway.I followed,puzzled by her sudden fear.

Through the crack, I saw Howard walking toward his study, his shoulders stiff. Beside him walked an elegantly dressed older woman I recognized from photos-Margaret Thompson, his mother. Lucy backed away from the door and grabbed my hand. "Grandma's here..." she whispered, voice shaking. Hler fear confused me. What had Margaret done to make Lucy so terrified?

###Chapter 20: I Had to Do Something.

Howard's POV

I was reviewing the merger documents for the fourth time tonight. The familiar scent of aged whiskey lingered in the air - a habit I'd picked up lately, though I'd been more careful since that night with Annie. The memory of her in my arms still sent heat through my veins, even as I forced my attention back to the financial projections before me.

The door opened without a knock. Only one person would dare.

"Howard, darling." Mother's signature perfume preceded her into the room.She settled gracefully into the chair across from me, every inch the society matron in her perfectly tailored designer suit. "We need to discuss your situation with Catherine."

I continued reviewing the document before mne,letting the silence stretch.Years of boardroom negotiations had taught me the power of calculated indifference.

"You must start dating her properly," she continued, undeterred. "A few business meetings aren't enough."
"We've already met." I signed the bottom of the page, still not looking up.

"In the office." She gave a delicate sniff of disapproval. "The Morgan family's influence could be crucial for the company. You need to cultivate a more...personal connection." Finally, I set down my pen and met her gaze. "Once. That's all." Her face lit up. "Wonderful! Catherine is such an accomplished young woman-Harvard Business School, impeccable family background..." "On one condition," I interrupted. "Lucy stays with me."

The light in her eyes dimmed. "Howard, be reasonable. This merger requires the Morgan family's support. Their connections could make or break the deal."


"Is that a threat, Mother?" My voice dropped dangerously low.

She lifted her chin. "It's reality. The board..."

"Let me be very clear." I rose slowly from my chair, each word precise and measured. "Lucy is non-negotiable. And since you seem to have forgotten who provides your lifestyle..."

I reached for my phone with deliberate calm. "Susan? Please suspend all financial support to the Thompson estate, effective immediately."

Mother's perfect composure cracked. "I'm your mother!"

"Then act like it." My voice remained steady, though my grip on the phone tightened. "If you're going to rely on my financial support, you need to understand who makes the decisions now."

"I'm only thinking of your best interests!" Her voice took on that wounded tone I knew so well. "Lucy needs a proper family structure..."

"Lucy's guardianship is not up for discussion." I rose from my chair.making it clear the conversation was over. "You can either accept that, or find alternative living arrangements." The threat hung in the air between us. Mother's lips trembled slightly before pressing into a thin line. "Fine. You promised one proper meeting with Catherine. And I will talk about Lucy with her." Then, she swept from the room, her heels clicking sharply against the hardwood floors.

I waited until her footsteps faded before allowing my shoulders to slump slightly. The familiar weight of expectations - CEO,son.guardian-pressed down on me. But for once, the choice felt crystal clear. Lucy needed stability, not my mother's manipulations. And Annie...

A commotion in the hallway pulled me from my thoughts. I stepped out of the study to find Mother confronting Annie outside Lucy's room.

"You're far too pretty to be just a caregiver." Mother's voice dripped honey-coated venom. "The Thompson family is very particular about who we trust with our children. Some people have... ulterior motives."

Annie maintained her professional smile, though I could see the tension in her shoulders. "I assure you, Mrs. Thompson, my qualifications are entirely adequate."

Mother ignored her, reaching for Lucy's door. "I simply want to check on my granddaughter."

"Lucy just fell asleep," Annie said firmly, not moving from her position."Disturbing her now would disrupt her sleep schedule..."

"Oh?" Mother's voice sharpened. "So now I need a nanny's  permission to see my own granddaughter?" I'd heard enough. "That's sufficient, Mother." I'd heard enough. "That's sufficient, Mother." "Annie is Lucy's special education instructor," I said coldly, "and someone I trust implicitly. If you can't respect that, you can leave."

Mother's expression froze for a moment before her social mask slipped back into place. "Of course, dear. I'm only concerned about Lucy..." Her gaze lingered meaningfully on Annie. "Though I see you've found suitable...help."

We watched her retreat down the hallway, her perfect posture never wavering. Only when she'd disappeared did I notice how close Annie and I were standing, her lilac scent mixing intoxicatingly with my cologne.

"I'm sorry about that," I said softly.

Annie shook her head, though I could see the slight tremor in her hands."Don't be. I understand she's protective of Lucy."

"It's more than that." I gestured toward the window seat at the end of the hall. The moonlight streaming through the glass painted silver highlights in Annie's hair as we sat. "My family has... traditional views. They never approved of Lucy's parents' marriage. My brother married for love, chose his own path. It drove a wedge between him and our parents."

"Is that why Lucy rarely saw her grandparents before...?"I nodded, watching the play of emotions across Annie's face. Even discussing such painful topics, she remained breathtakingly beautiful."They thought he was throwing away his potential. Now Mother sees Lucy as her second chance-a way to mold the next generation of Thompsons properly." "You've sacrificed a lot forLucy." Annie's voice was soft, understanding.Her hand found mine in the darkness, our fingers intertwining naturally." Protecting her from that pressure, giving her space to heal..."

"We've protected her," I corrected, squeezing her hand gently. "Since you came, she's made more progress than I ever dreamed possible."

Annie's eyes met mine, dark and serious in the moonlight. The moonlight caught her hair, reminding me of how she'd looked that night in my bed.her skin glowing as she arched beneath me. The memory of her soft gasps,the way she'd trembled at my touch, sent heat coursing through my veins.

But it was more than just desire. So much more.

"Annie..." I tightened my grip on her hand, trying to focus despite how her proximity made my pulse race.

She turned to face me, and the simple movement brought her scent- that intoxicating blend of lilacs that had caught my attention ouatside her door.Memories flooded back - her body pressed against mine in the kitchen,her lips parting under my kiss, the way she made me lose control in the best possible way.

She was nothing I could lose. Lucy was doing better because of her. And she was the solace I could scarcely find. But mother must set her eyes on her. She would get rid of her no matter what. I had to do something.

"Will you marry me?"
###Chapter 21: You Should Have Told me Sooner
Annie's POV

"Will you marry me?"

Yes.

The word "yes" formed instantly in my heart, but my lips wouldn't move.

Howard's words hung in the moonlit hallway, his dark eyes fixed on mine with an intensity that made my breath catch. In that moonlit hallway,every insecurity I'd been fighting since coming here crashed over me like a wave.


The whispers in the company cafeteria, the disapproving glances at charity events, Sarah's cutting remarks about my background- they all echoed in my mind,drowning out the yes my heart wanted to scream.

I thought of Howard in the boardroom, commanding respect with every gesture. Howard at social events, moving effortlessly through a world I barely understood. Howard in his perfectly tailored suits that probably cost more than I used to make in a month. Then I thought of myself -a divorced mother from Boston who still felt lost in this glittering world of his "I apologize." Howard's voice cut through my spiral of self-doubt, his usual controlled tone carrying a hint of uncertainty. "That was... abrupt." "It's fine," I mnanaged, though nothing about this situation felt fine. I was torn between wanting to run and wanting to throw myself into his arms,to pretend for just a moment that I could belong in his world. "But you should give it serious thought." His steady gaze made my heart race, even as my mind whispered that I would never be enough for someone like him.


"Can I ask why?" The question slipped out, part of me hoping his answer would somehow bridge the chasm I felt between us. "Why do you want to marry me?"


"Because Lucy likes you very much."

His practical response hit differently than it might have before. It wasn't that his words hurt-they just confirmed what I already knew. I wasn't the sophisticated woman his mother wanted for him. I wasn't the polished socialite his board would approve of. I was just Annie Baker, who happened to be good with his niece.

"She hasn't accepted any other woman since I became her guardian,"Howard continued, in a hesitant voice- or maybe I was just imagining that hesitation. "I don't plan to waste time on relationships, so I've thought this through carefully. Us being together would be the best choice."

A small, bitter smile touched my lips. Even if he did have feelings for me beyond practicality, how long until he realized I would never fit into his world? How long until the magic of our stolen moments faded and he saw me as everyone else did- the outsider playing at belonging?

"Sorry," I whispered, the word carrying the weight of all my fears and inadequacies."I can't." Sorry,not in this way. The next afternoon, Lucy burst through the mansion's doors with unusual energy,her face flushed with excitement.

"Mom!" She ran straight into my arms, and I pushed aside the guilty pleasure I still felt at hearing that word. "Brian apologized to me today!"

I knelt to her level, studying her bright expression. "He did? What happened?"


"He came up to me at recess and said he was sorry for being mean." She fidgeted with the hem of her uniform. "Then he left really fast."

Something about that struck me as odd, but Lucy was already moving on to her next thought.

"Mom, I want to learn gymnastics."

I blinked at the sudden change of subject. "Why suddenly want to learn?"

Lucy's expression grew serious. "So next time someone says mean things,I can defend myself."

My heart ached at the implication, but I kept my voice steady. "Self-defense is important, but there are many ways to handle mean words.Would you like to talk about what happened?"

"Nothing happened since last time Brian had said those mean words.I'd just like to learn stuff." She shook her head, determination shining in her eyes."Then that's fine. I will talk to Howard." At the mention of Howard,I couldn't help but find myself a bit distracted. But actually, I had been thinking about him all day. "I want to ask daddy directly." A small smile played at her lips."I promised to talk to him more, remember?"

The casual way she said "daddy" now brought back memories of last night,after Howard's proposal.




"Grandma Margaret used to come when I was trying to sleep," Lucy had whispered in the darkness of her bedroom, her small body curled against mine. "She would call me a little mute."*

My arms had tightened around her instinctively as she continued,her voice barely audible. "She told me I was a burden. That if it wasn't for me.daddy would have found a wife already."

"That's not true, sweetheart." I'd stroked her hair, fury building in my chest at the thought of Margaret's cruel words.

Lucy had looked up at me then, hope shining in her tear-filled eyes."I want you and daddy to get married."

"You should have told me sooner, sweetheart," I'd whispered, my heart breaking at how simple the solution seemed in her young mind.

Maybe I'd been wrong about everything - about not belonging, about being out of my depth. The easy affection in her voice suggested she saw us as a real family, regardless of social standing or background. But even as hope bloomed, Margaret Thompson's perfectly controlled voice echoed in my mind: "The Thompson family is very particular about who we trust with our children." The weight of her disapproval hung over me like a sword. Lucy tugged at my sleeve, her eyes bright with enthusiasm as she planned her martial arts pitch to Howard. The trust in her gaze made my heart ache. She wanted this - wanted us - to work. And if I was honest with myself,so did I.

But Margaret would never accept someone like me as her son's wife.

Oh. god.Is this just another hope that was doomed to fail me again?
###Chapter 22: Compromise

Howard's POV

I stood before the full-length mirror, methodically buttoning a fresh dress shirt. Mother's voice echoed in my head: "Just one dinner with Catherine Morgan, Howard. That's all I ask." I'd finallyagreed,if only to keep her from interfering further with Annie and Lucy. The idea of spending an evening with Catherine held all the appeal of a hostile takeover meeting.but sometimes tactical retreats were necessary.

My hand froze mid-button as I noticed something tucked between my folded shírts - a delicate piece of black lace. Annie's underwear, forgotten in the heat of that passionate night. The sight of it sent a rush of memories flooding back: her soft gasps against my neck, the intoxicating scent of lilacs that seemed to linger on my sheets for days, the way she'd trembled in my arms...

"Damn it." I sank onto the edge of my bed, the lace material crushed in my fist. What kind of CEO was I? I could negotiate billion-dollar deals without breaking a sweat, but I'd managed to botch the most important proposal of my life with all the finesse of an intern's first pitch meeting. "Will you marry me?" The words haunted me now - how I'd blurted them out like some impulsive proposal at a board meeting. No heartfelt speech about how she'd become as essential to me as breathing. No mention of how her presence had transformed my carefully ordered world into something vibrant and alive. Just those four stark words, hanging in the air between us like an ill-prepared business proposition. I'd seen the hurt flash in her eyes before she'd covered it with that professional mask she wore so well. Of course she'd refused. What woman wants to hear that marriage is just a practical solution for childcare?

The truth caught in my throat even now, in the empty silence of my bedroom: I was terrified1. Terrified that if I revealed the depth of my feelings, she'd run. Terrified that my mother would use the Morgan family's influence to destroy her career if she became more than Lucy's caretaker.Terrified of losing the one person who'd made me feel truly alive for the first time in years.

"I should have told her," I whispered to the empty room. "Should have said it was because I love_"

My phone's sharp ring shattered the moment. Wilson's name flashed on the screen, accompanied by a video call request. I straightened my shoulders. CEO mask sliding back into place as I accepted the call.
"Mr. Thompson." Wilson's tired face filled the screen, the dark circles under his eyes testament to long hours. "The team wanted you to see our progress."

The screen filled with character designs and user interface mockups.Months of work spread before me in neat digital rows, yet something felt fundamentally wrong.
"This is what we've developed over the past year," Wilsoncontinued,pride evident in his voice. I studied the data carefully, years of experience highlighting the crucial flaw. "The entire user experience needs to be reconstructed. You're missing the core appeal for our female demographic." "Sir?" Wilson's confidence wavered. "Look at the market research." I pulled up the relevant data."Female players prioritize emotional resonance over mere numerical progression.
Your team's focus has been misplaced."

"But restructuring would take considerable time-"

"Time isn't the issue. Direction is." I leaned forward, letting my authority fill the frame. "Form a specialized user experience team. Focus on emotional design elements. We're not just creating a game; we're creating emotional value."

"Yes, sir. I'll adjust the team immediately."

As the call ended, my eyes caught on one of the character designs.The artwork was technically proficient but lacked something essential- that spark of warmth that made Annie's illustrations so captivating.I remembered Lucy's words about her mother's drawings, how they made her feel safe and understood.

Before I could second-guess myself, I was already walking toward Annie's studio. The door was ajar, soft afternoon light spilling across her workspace. She sat at her desk, completely absorbed in her work, pencil moving with confident strokes across the paper.

"Annie?" My voice came out softer than intended. "Do you have a moment?"

She looked up, and the sight of her - cheeks slightly flushed from concentration, a smudge of graphite on her chin-made my chest tighten. "I'd like your opinion on something." I approached her desk, tablet in hand. "It's a gaming project we're developing, targeted at female users.The character designs aren't connecting as they should." Annie took the tablet, her fingers moving expertly across the screen. "The proportions are technically correct, but the emotional elements are missing."She began sketching, quick strokes transforming the rigid design. "See how softening these lines changes the entire feeling? And the eyes-they need to invite connection, not just observe."


I watched her work, mesmerized by her quiet confidence. This was Annie in her element - professional, insightful, absolutely brilliant. The same woman who had transformed Lucy's world, who had somehow worked her way past my own carefully constructed walls.


The familiar scent of lilacs teased my senses as I leaned closer, supposedly to study her modifications. "The key is understanding what users truly need?"


"Exactly." She turned slightly, and suddenly we were inches apart. "It's about creating an emotional bridge, making them feel-"


My hand moved of its own accord, brushing a strand of hair from her cheek. She froze, eyes widening at the contact.

"Would you consider joining the project team and you can publish your work through our company?" The words came out rough with everything I was trying not to say. I miss you. I need you. I love-

Her lips parted in surprise, and for a moment, I almost confessed everything- how my hasty proposal had been about so much more than Lucy's welfare, how she'd become as essential to me as breathing, how the thought of tonight's dinner with Catherine made me physically ill because she wasn't- My phone buzzed again. Wilson, probably with questions about the restructuring. The moment shattered like fine crystal. Annie pulled back first, professional mask sliding into place. "I should review these designs more thoroughly before making any decisions."

I nodded, my own CEO persona providing familiar shelter. But as I headed back to my room to preparefor tonight's unwanted dinner, my hand still tingled where it had touched her skin.

Mother would be pleased with my compliance regarding Catherine, but she'd never understand. How could she, when I barely understood it myself?In the boardroom. I could orchestrate million-dollar deals without breaking a sweat. Yet here I was, undone by a simple touch, unable to tell the woman I loved the three words that mattered most.

The delicate lace still lay hidden in my pocket, a reminder of everything I stood to lose if I couldn't find the right words soon.

###Chapter 23: Date with Catherine

Howard's POV

The private dining room's muted lighting did nothing to improve my mood. Catherine Morgan sat across from me, maintaining perfect posture as the maitre d'presented our menus. Myeyes fell on a familiar dish - one I'd ordered countless times during business dinners here.

Just as I was about to speak, Catherine smiled with quiet confidence."The seared foie gras for Mr. Thompson. It's his usual choice here."

"The sea bass," I stated quietly, my tone carrying just enough authority to discourage further discussion. "With the seasonal vegetables."

Catherine's smile faltered for just a moment before she recovered with practiced grace.

"You should have been at the Met Gala last month," she began,swirling her wine with elegant precision. Her diamond bracelet caught the light with each practiced motion. "The Vanderbilts hosted the most extraordinary after-party. Charlotte - you know Charles Vanderbilt's daughter?- she had this absolutely scandalous moment with the son of that tech mogul from Silicon Valley..." I made a noncommittal sound, finding more interest in the condensation gathering on my water glass than her carefully curated society gossip.My thoughts kept drifting to Annie's genuine laugh, so different from the artificial tinkling sound Catherine was making now. "And then there was that charity auction at the Plaza," Catherine continued,leaning forward slightly in what I assumed was meant to be an enticing manner. "Mother insisted I bid on this ghastly modern art piece-all splashes and circles, really - but apparently the artist is the next big thing.Cost a fortune, but that's what tax write-offs are for, right?"

"Indeed." I checked my phone under the table, hoping for a message that could provide an excuse to end this charade early. The screen remained stubbornly empty.

"Oh, and you'll never believe who I ran into at the Morgan Stanley dinner last week." Catherine's laugh echoed like expensive crystal against fine china. "Remember Jonathan Pierce? From Harvard Business School? He's still trying to make that ridiculous startup of his work. Something about sustainable energy- as if that hasn't been done to death. His mother keeps trying to set us up, can you imagine?"

She paused, clearly expecting some sign of jealousy. I merely signaled the waiter for more water, remembering how Annie could convey more genuine emotion in a single glance than Catherine managed in this entire performance.

"Though speaking of arrangements," her tone shifted subtly,becoming more purposeful, "you should see the list Mother's compiled. All these eligible bachelors from 'suitable' families." She rolled her eyes with calculated charm. "Half of them I've already met through these tedious matchmaking dinners. Like last month, there was this absolutely dreadful evening with the youngest Sullivan heir..." I let her words fade into background noise, my mind drifting to Annie-how she would have filled this stilted silence with genuine warmth instead of practiced small talk, how her eyes would have sparkled with real humor rather than social calculation. Even Lucy's selective mutism felt more authentic than this carefully choreographed performance. "Don't you agree?" Catherine's expectant voice pulled me back to the present.

"My apologies," I said, not bothering to fake interest. "You were saying?"

I maintained my polite mask, offering minimal responses. The evening stretched ahead like an overlong board meeting, each moment measured in careful sips of wine and perfectly crafted small talk.

When the food arrived, my attention caught on the herb garnish-arranged exactly as Annie often did for Lucy's breakfast. I realized with a start that despite all our time together, Annie and I had never gone on a proper date. No quiet dinners, no evening walks, no moments that were just ours.

"I attended the most fascinating exhibition last week," Catherine offered."The artist-James Morrison? I remember you wrote that paper about his early works in college."

"He's talented," I acknowledged simply. He was an artist I admired. Then,my mind had already drifted to Annie's illustrations - how she captured emotion with such simple, elegant lines. My hand slipped into my pocket,fingers brushing against the forgotten lace there.

Yes, I brought a woman's underwear to a fancy restaurant.

And the touch brought back the memories when I returned home today. We'd just returned home with Lucy when we found Thomas Anderson,Lucy's gymnastics coach, waiting in the front yard,looking slightly uncomfortable in the heat. "Should Alfred have shown him inside?" I asked our butler quietly. "I requested to wait outside," Thomas Anderson explained quickly. "To get a feel for the space."

"It's too hot out here," I observed calmly. "We usually return around this time. In the future,please wait inside."

"Thank you," Thomas Anderson nodded, understanding the statement wasn't mere politeness. "When would you like to begin?"

I looked to Lucy, who was clutching Annie's sleeve.

Annie knelt beside her. "What is it, sweetheart?"

Lucy whispered something in Annie's ear.

"She'd like to start now," Annie explained to Thomas Anderson. "But I should mention - Lucy is a bit special. She prefers not to speak to others."

Thomas Anderson nodded understandingly and knelt to Lucy's level. "I'm Thomas Anderson. And you are...?"

Lucy darted behind Annie before he could finish.

"I'm sorry," Thomas Anderson apologized. "I forgot..."

"It's alright," Annie smiled. "Lucy, would you like me to stay with you?"

A vigorous nod.

"Where should we train?" Annie asked, looking to me. "I've had a room prepared on the first floor," I replied evenly, leading the way. The training space was large, with floor-to-ceiling windows and a spacious baleony. Thomas Anderson began with basie movements, but Lucy's stamina quickly flagged. When he tried to ask about her comfort level,she remained silent.

"For the first month. I'd recommend focusing on building her endurance through running," he told me. "Then we can progress to actual techniques."

I nodded. "You're the expert here. Make whatever adjustments you feel necessary to the training plan. No need to consult me."

After concluding the business call, I made my way downstairs,only to pause at the doorway. Thomas Anderson was leading both Annie and Lucy through warm-up exercises, but my gaze was immediately drawn to Annie.

She moved with an endearing lack of polish that was so quintessentially her-none of the affectedI grace Mother's society friends would display.Her brow furrowed in concentration, tongue caught between her teeth as she struggled to mirror the instructor's stance. The sight stirred something in my chest - how she threw herself into everything with such genuine enthusiasm, completely unconcerned with looking perfectly poised. Even in her slight awkwardness, she possessed a natural grace that I found charming. My fingers traced the lace in my pocket asI returned to the present moment, thinking of how Annie would soon bemore involved in both my work and personal life. A smile crossed my face, realizing my hasty proposal had been premature. We had time. "The Giants really dominated last weekend's game," Catherine was saying.her eyes lighting up at my smile. "What did you think of their defensive strategy?"

Lost in pleasant thoughts of Annie, I replied absently, "Very good."

"We should do this again," Catherine said eagerly.

Her words snapped me back to reality. "No," I said firmly. "I'm sorry, but I haven't followed football since college. That was just a phase, Catherine.And for future reference? Don't rely on my mother's outdated briefing about my interests. I'm not the son she thinks she knows anymore."

Without waiting for her response, I paid the bill and stood. The lace in my pocket reminded me of where I'd rather be.
###Chapter 24: A Rude Awakening of Philip

Philip's POV

Late in the morning, I woke up in our king-sized bed in our new Upper East Side mansion. I stretched lazily, enjoying the rare luxury of a weekend morning. From here, I could see the meticulously manicured garden below-another of Sarah's essential upgrades to our living situation.

My gaze drifted to her vanity, crowded with elegant bottles and jars. The sight brought a fleeting thought of our previous home, which had been perfectly adequate. But Sarah had insisted Brian needed "the right environment to thrive," and I couldn't deny that she seemed to know what was best for our family's social standing.

A piercing scream shattered my contemplation.

"Philip!" Sarah's voice carried from the kitchen. "Oh God, it hurts!"

I rushed downstairs to find her cradling her hand, face contorted in pain.The kitchen counter was cluttered with cooking implements-an unusual sight, given that Sarah had always proclaimed her disdain for cooking since we moved here and hired a chef to manage our meals.

"I burned myself," she whimpered, extending her finger for inspection.The skin looked barely pink. "I just wanted to make you a special breakfast..."

"We have a chef for this now," I reminded her gently, even as she pressed herself against me.

"But I wanted to do something special for you." Her lower lip trembled."To show how much I appreciate everything you've done for Max and me.""Let me make it up to you," I heard myself say. "How about some shopping to cheer you up?"

A radiant smile suddenly transformed her face, erasing all traces of her earlier pain from the burn. Before I could process the abrupt change, she leaned in and pressed her lips against mine. Lost in the moment, I returned her kiss without a second thought.




The jewelry store's lighting seemed designed tomake everything sparkle,including Sarah's eyes as she made a beeline for the most elaborate pieces in the display. She selected an ornate piece with barely a glance at the price tag, which she did so proficiently and rapidly that it surprised me a bit.


"Max needs something special," she declared, her perfectly manicured fingers trailing along the glass display cases. "A piece to remember his childhood by." Her eyes lit up as they landed on a sterling silver compass pendant. "This is perfect. He's always been fascinated by exploration and adventure."


The pendant was beautifully crafted, with a polished finish and clean design that would appeal to a young boy, quite expensive for a child's accessory. But Sarah was already waving over the sales associate, her voice carrying that soft, vulnerable tone she used when she wanted something."It's just... he's missed out on so many special moments. I wwant him to know how precious he is to us."


The sales associate began wrapping the pendant in a plush velvet box while Sarah detailed how she wanted Max's name and the date engraved on the back. Watching her fuss over every detail, I was struck by her maternal devotion. It made me think of Annie, how she'd always... Speaking of Annie, it seemed that she had found her new love. So soon?And after what Robert had did to her? Maybe that man beside her was just an actor or a dumb fool. No way she could be in a new relationship so soon.I would find out.

"We should get another one for Brian," I found myself saying, and for a moment, something flickered across her face. But she recovered so quickly I was sure I'd imagined it.

"Oh, darling, we spent a lot today." she purred. "We could give this one to Brian. Max would be fine..."

Before I could respond, the sales associate returned with an apologetic expression.

"I'm sorry, Sir, but your card has been declined."

My stomach dropped. For a moment, I couldn't process the words. This platinum card had accompanied me through countless power lunches and billion-dollar deals. I was Philip Baker, for God's sake. My cards didn't get declined.

"There must be some mistake." The words came out strangled,foreign to my own ears. With trembling fingers, I pulled another card from my wallet,painfully aware of the growing line behind us, the barely concealed whispers. "Try this one." Sarah's perfect composure wavered for just a second. "It must be the renovations," she laughed lightly. "All those little upgrades add up..." I nodded, though something about her explanation nagged at me. Hadn't we discussed the renovation budget in detail? But she was already moving on, suggesting lunch at her favorite restaurant, and I let the thought slip away.




Back home, Sarah pulled out an ornate box from her shopping bag presenting it to Brian. "Look what your father and I bought for you,darling. Do you like it?"

Brian took the box without much enthusiasm, opening it quietly. His subdued reaction was unusual for a child receiving a gift.

Sarah nudged Max with her elbow.

Max lifted his head and looked at the box in Brian's hands."I wish I had a pendant like that..."

"My dad never bought me anything like this," he continued softly. "Not once in my whole life..."
He glanced at me, while Sarah watched expectantly.

"I did suggest buying two," I said, absently running my hand through Brian's hair.

"I was just trying to be mindful of your money," Sarah explained quickly."But now that Max wants one too..." She lowered her voice. "You wouldn't want to play favorites,would you?" Something felt off about the whole scene, but I couldn't quite grasp what.The way Max and Sarah looked at each other, how quickly the situation had turned... or was I just being paranoid? Sarah was trying to make everyone happy,wasn't she? "I'll go to the store and pick another oe tommorrow after I got off work. And I'll hear no more about it." I said to Sarah curtly.

That evening, alone in my study, I opened my laptop to review some contracts. A notification from my banking app caught my eye-a reminder about the credit card statement I'd been meaning to check. Might as well get it over with.


The screen filled with transaction after transaction. At first, the numbers blurred together as usual.

My eyes widened as I scrolled through the endless list of transactions.Designer boutiques, five-star restaurants, luxury spas, private car services...The amounts were astronomical. Sarah had spent more in a month than most people earned in a year.

I sat back in my chair, stunned. What exactly had I gotten myself into?
###Chapter 25: I was too naive.

Annie's POV

Crisp autumn air swirled around us as we stood before the imposing facade of Upper East Side Private Preschool. Lucy's small hand felt warm in mine, her fingers tightening nervously as other children streamed past us into the building. She kept glancing back at Howard and me,her blue eyes wide with an emotion I couldn't quite read.


"Have a wonderful day, sweetheart," I said softly, giving her hand a gentle squeeze before letting go.

She took a few steps toward the entrance, then turned back again. This time, she lifted her hand in a tentative wave, her smile small but genuine.I waved back, watching as she disappeared into the building, my heart squeezing with a familíar mixture of pride and protectiveness.

"Mom?"


The quiet voice behind me made me freeze. I knew that voice-had heard it in my dreams and nightmares for months. Brian stood there, looking smaller somehow in his perfectly pressed uniform, his usual defiance replaced by something that looked almost like...remorse?

Howard's deep voice came from the direction of his car. "I'll wait in the car."The subtle support in his tone gave me strength.

"Mom..." Brian's voice cracked on the word. "I'm sorry."

Those two words hung in the air between us,stirring memories I thought I'd carefully packed away. How many times had I imagined hearing those words? But now, facing my son's tear-filled eyes, I felt oddly detached. "Sarah... she always said bad things about you," he continued, words tumbling out in a rush. "She told me you were too strict, that you just wanted to control me. But after you left..." His voice wobbled. "I realized you were just wvorried about my stomach problems. You weren't being mean when you made me eat healthy food."

I maintained my composure, though every maternal instinct screamed to gather him in my arms. "I can forgive you, Brian." The words came out steady, measured. "But your sister won't."

His face crumpled in confusion. "Sister? You mean Lucy? But she's not-"

"The baby I lost." The words hung between us like shards of glass. "When you pushed me down the stairs that day... you didn't just hurt me."

Understanding dawned in his eyes, followed by horror. "I didn't mean it...Mom,I didn't-"

"You know you meant it better than I do. Also, you followed Sarah's instruction." My voice remained calm, though my hands trembled slightly.
"What I am saying is I need time, Brian. Time to heal."

He burst into tears, his small frame shaking. "Why do you care more about Lucy than me? I don't understand why you can't accept my apology.Why? I looked at my son - this child I'd carried, birthed, loved with every fiber of my being-and felt an ocean of grif and love and hurt surge through me. Fora moment, I almost reached for him. Almost.I said softly. "Because you still don't understand what family really means." Turning away from his sobs was one of the hardest things I'd ever done. Each step toward Howard's waiting car felt like walking through quicksand,memories of happier times with Brian threatening to pull me under.

No, not so easy. The voice inside my head told me. The baby I lost wouldn't let it go so easily.

Inside the car, silence settled around us like a heavy blanket,broken only by the soft hum of the engine. My hands twisted nervously in my lap as I wondered how much Howard had overheard. The carefully constructed balance we'd found lately felt suddenly fragile, like a pencil sketch one errant move could smudge beyond repair.

I snuck a glance at his profile, remembering how elegantly he'd dressed for last night's dinner.

If only I was the one who had been out with him.

The memory of Lucy's words about Margaret echoed in my mind:"Grandma says daddy needs a proper wife." The thought of him dining with some polished socialite made my stomach clench.

Howard's voice, when it finally broke the silence, carried a gentleness that caught me off guard. "You handled that well with Brian," he said quietly."Sometimes love means maintaining boundaries."

His words loosened something in my chest, even as fresh anxiety bloomed.If Margaret had noticed my growing closeness with Howard... A woman like her would never accept someone like me in her son's life. Someone divorced,someone with my background. "Did you enjoy your dinner last night?" The question escaped before I could stop it, laden with all the insecurities I couldn't voice. I kept my eyes fixed on the company drawing near, watching Howard's reflection in the window grow still.

"Annie," he began, his tone carrying something I wasn't ready to hear."About that dinner-"


"We're here," I cut in quickly, relief flooding through me as I spotted his secretary's purposeful stride through the garage. I wasn't sure why I kept running from these conversations. Maybe because accepting Margaret's inevitable interference would make everything too real. "Your secretary looks like she has urgent news."

Howard's expression in the reflection suggested he had more to say,but his secretary was already opening his door, her professional demeanor barely masking her urgency. "Mr. Thompson, there's a document that needs your signature."

"Ms. Baker." The secretary's professional tone carried a note of surprise."Mr. Thompson, the document..."

"Go ahead," I managed a smile that felt brittle. "I remember the way to the art studio."

The executive elevator carried me upward in solitary silence. I used the time to compose myself, pushing thoughts of Brian's tears and Howard's dinner date into a mental box to be examined later. The doors opened onto the executive floor-and directly into Margaret Thompson's perfectly coordinated presence. "Well." Her practiced smile didn't reach her eyes. "What an...unexpected pleasure." I fought the urge to step backward, forcing myself to meet her appraising gaze. Her gaze swept over me with the kind of calculated assessment that made me feel like every thread of my clothing was being weighed and found wanting.


"I would have thought you'd be at home," she continued, her voice honey-sweet with underlying steel. "Isn't childcare rather... demanding?"

I straightened my spine, remembering every obstacle I'd overcome to get here. "Howard invited me to design character illustrations for the company's female-oriented gaming project. He feels my style would resonate well with the target demographic."

"How... industrious." Margaret's smile turned razor-sharp. "Though I do wonder about poor Lucy's after-school hours. One child is quite enough responsibility, wouldn't you agree?"

The implied criticism hung in the air between us. I opened my mouth to respond when a familiar cologne announced Howard's presence.

"Mother." His voice carried a warning edge. "I wasn't aware you were visiting today."

"Just checking on the Catherine situation, darling." Margaret's tone transformed instantly. "She said your dinner was lovely."

I felt the blood drain from my face. Of course Catherine would be perfect-probably some Harvard-educated heiress who knew which fork to use for each course. "Annie." Howard's hand brushed my elbow, feather-light but grounding."The design team is waiting in my office." I seized the escape route gratefully, slipping past Margaret's perfectly coordinated form. But I couldn't miss her parting shot, delivered with devastating precision: "Howard,deat, remember what we discussed about proper matches."

The words followed me down the hallway, echoing with all my deepest insecurities. What was I doing here.pretending I could bridge the chasm between our worlds?


I was too naive.
###Chapter 26: Lucy's Custody

Howard's POV

The autumn sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of my office at Howard Technologies, casting long shadows across the antique mahogany desk. I turned from the windows, where construction cranes dotted the horizon like mechanical sentinels, to face my mother, who sat perfectly poised in one of the leather visitor chairs, every inch the society matron in her impeccable Chanel suit.

"Catherine says she's willing to accept Lucy now!" Mother's voice carried a note of barely contained triumph as she straightened in her seat. The morning light caught on her designer jewelry, a calculated display of Upper East Side refinement. "She's a Morgan, Howard. Harvard Business School,family connections throughout Wall Street..."

"I'm busy." My voice carried the kind of frost that would have sent most board members scrambling for cover. "I don't have time for dating."
"This is unacceptable!" The rejection transformed Mother's carefully maintained composure into barely contained fury, her perfect makeup twisting with anger. "You must make time to see her again!"

I maintained my silence, focusing instead on the merger documents awaiting my signature. The familiar rhythm of corporate life felt like a shield against her manipulations. "Howard, you're nearly thirty-five!" She lowered her voice to that precise pitch that had once made me feel like a disappointing child."When do you plan to marry? To have children of your own?" "I don't plan to have children." The words came out measured, controlled. Mother's face turned ashen. "Is this why I just found that Annie woman wandering around your executive floor?" Mother's voice dripped with disdain. "A divorced caretaker from Boston, suddenly designing games for Howard Technologies-"

"Leave Annie out of this." The warning in my tone could have frozen the Hudson.

"I will not allow this!" Mother clutched at her pearls, perfectly groomed eyebrows contorting with rage. "She's completely unsuitable for someone of your position!"

"Planning to interfere again?" Though my voice remained steady, danger lurked beneath its surface. "Mother, remember what I said last time."

Her eyes glittered dangerously. "Oh? And what about Lucy's custody arrangement?" Her voice dropped to a silken whisper. "The court might find it...concerning that her guardian is mixing business with pleasure,especially with an employee responsible for her care. Such conflict of interest..."

The implied threat hit its mark. Lucy's wellbeing was the one area where I couldn't afford any risks.

"I'm only thinking of the family's best interests, dear," she said softly,victory evident in her measured steps as she left my office. Only after Mother's clicking heels faded down the hallway did I allow my shoulders to relax slightly. The antique clock in the corner marked time with soft ticks, a counterpoint to my racing thoughts. My mind drifted to Annie's face in the car this morning - how she'd skillfully deflected my attempt to explain the dinner with Catherine,her usual warmth carefully masked behind professional courtesy. Why was she dodging me? I thought it was a perfect chance to reveal my feelings for her.

The memory of her lilac scent lingering in the confined space made my fingers tighten on the armrest.

Everything had changed since Annie entered our lives. Before her,I'd shouldered the weight of the family business alone, thrust into leadership too young after my brother and sister-in-law's yacht accident. Mother's expectations had been a constant pressure, but I'd managed by focusing solely on work and Lucy. Until Annie arrived and showed me everything I'd been missing.

I stood at my office window, watching the morning sun reflect off the neighboring skyscrapers. The weight of the company, of Lucy's future,of Mother's expectations - it all used to feel manageable when I kept my world carefully compartmentalized. Work was work. Home was home.Everything had its proper place.

Then Annie walked into our lives with her gentle smile and quiet strength,and suddenly those carefully constructed walls began to crumble. She was a strong woman who had saved her own life and a man's.

A knock at my door pulled me from my thoughts.

"Come in," I called, turning to findSusan, my secretary, entering with a portfolio. "The character designs from Miss Annie Baker, sir." She placed them on my desk with practiced efficiency. "The design team just reviewed her initial sketches. They're quite impressed with her artistic vision." I opened the portfolio, and immediately understood what they meant. Annie's artwork carried that same warmth she brought to everything-the characters seemed to breathe with life and emotion. Just like how she'd breathed life back into our home, into Lucy... into me.

"The emotional elements in her designs are exactly what we've been looking for," Susan continued professionally. "The team believes her style would resonate strongly with our target demographic."

"They're right," I agreed softly, thinking of how naturally she'd connected with Lucy, breaking through barriers that countless specialists hadn't been able to touch. "She has a gift for understanding what people need."

Susan hesitated, then added carefully, "Several board members stopped by earlier. They were quite interested in her portfolio."
I stared at Annie's signature in the corner of one illustration,remembering how she looked when she worked - that slight furrow of concentration between her brows, the way she bit her lip when she was particularly focused. The memory stirred something in my chest.
"Sir?" Susan's voice brought me back to the present. "Should I begin preparing any paperwork regarding her position?" The rooftop garden offered a refuge from the corporate atmosphere below,autumn wind carrying the faint scent of late-blooming flowers. I found Annie at her spot near the rose trellis, completely absorbed in her sketchbook. The October sunlight caught in her hair, highlighting subtle auburn threads I'd never noticed before. I allowed myself a moment to simply watch her work, admiring the way she bit her lower lip in concentration, how her hand moved with suchcertainty across the paper. The familiar surge of desire mixed with something deeper, more dangerous.

"Your designs are excellent," I said finally, moving to lean against the railing beside her. "Would you consider working here permanently?" I held out the contract I'd had legal prepare this morning.

Annie accepted the document, but her eyes widened when she reached the salary figure. "A hundred thousand?"

"Too low?" I couldn't quite suppress my smile.

"It's too much!" She looked up at me, genuine shock written across her features. "The market rate for illustration work isn't nearly-"

"You're surprisingly un-mercenary." The observation carried more weight than I intended.

"I'm already fortunate." Annie set down her sketchbook, autumn wind tugging at loose strands of her hair. "Having work I love, being abe to care for Lucy..." She turned to face me, sincerity shining in her eyes. "It's more than I ever expected."

"Annie." Her name came out softer than I intended,weighted with everything I couldn't seem to say. "You don't need to be so careful with me."

"And what about Lucy's custody arrangement?" However, my mother's voice rang in my head just as I thought I could tell my feelings for Annie.
###Chapter 27: A Tie

Annie's POV

The late afternoon sun streamed through the large windows of my new office at Howard Technologies, painting my workspace in warm golden light. I sat at my desk, staring at the contract Howard had handed me on the rooftop garden. My fingers traced over the salary figure again -a hundred thousand dollars. The number still felt surreal.

But it wasn't the generous salary that kept pulling my thoughts back to that moment on the roof. It wasthe way Howard had looked at me, the weight of unspoken words hanging between us. I'd seen something in his eyes then, something that made my heart race even now. He'd opened his mouth as if to say more, but then closed it again, that familiar mask of control sliding back into place.

The memory of his cologne, mixing with the scent of autumn roses,made my fingers tighten on the contract. Howard Thompson was a mystery I couldn't quite solve -one moment the commanding CEO, the next showing glimpses of vulnerability that made me want to reach out and...

I shook my head,forcing my attention back to the present. The design team had already welcomed me warmly, showing me around the creative department and setting up my workstation. They'd been impressed by my portfolio,treating me with a professional respect I hadn't experienced in years. Yet I couldn't shake the feeling that I was living in a dream that could shatter at any moment. "Miss Baker?" Howard's secretary appeared at my door. "Mr.Thompson asked if you needed a ride home." "No, thank you." I smiled, gathering my things. "I have some errands to run first."

I needed time to think, to process everything that had happened. And maybe, just maybe, find a way to express what I couldn't seem to say in words.




The Manhattan shopping center buzzed with early evening activity as I made my way through the men's department. My fingers ghosted over various ties, considering and dismissing each one until I reached a deep blue jacquard piece. The subtle pattern caught the light beautifully,and I could imagine how it would bring out the blue in Howard's eyes when he was deep in thought at his desk.

A smile tugged at my lips as I remembered how he looked during meetings-commanding yet somehow vulnerable when hethought no one was watching. The tie felt rich and substantial between my fingers,worthy of a CEO but not flashy. Just like Howard himself.

"Change the color. I don't like it."

The familiar voce froze me in place. I turned slowly to find Philip standing behind me, his expression caught between amusement and something darker.

"That man with you at Upper East Side Private Preschool," he continued,his casual tone belied by the sharp look in his eyes. "What exactly is your relationship with him?" I met his gaze steadily. "Just like I don't concern myself with your affairs with Sarah, my personal life is none of your business. We're nothing more than strangers now." "We were married, Annie..." Philip stepped closer, using his height to loom over me in that way that used to make me feel small.

"That's in the past." I cut him off firmly, no longer the timid woman who had once sought his approval.

"You can't just marry some random man for revenge." His tone carried that patronizing note I'd grown to despise.

"Revenge?" I let out a short laugh. "What makes you think you're worth taking revenge on?"

Philip's expression shifted, smugness replacing concern. "Because you loved me so much, of course!"

"You're right." My quiet admission seemed to catch him off guard."I did love you. But that's all in the past. I've moved on from that relationship,built a new life. Every day now, I wake up happy." I met his gaze directly."Please don't interfere with my life anymore."

Philip moved to block my path. "After sharing a bed for years, how can I stand by and watch you make a mistake?"

"Philip Baker." I felt steel enter my voice, strength I'd discovered since leaving him. "I'm single, divorced, and perfectly entitled to build a new family. As for mistakes?" My lips curved in a bitter smile. "You should examine your own actions. Having an affair while we were married,turning Brian against me with Sarah - you never stopped yourself then.What right do you have to lecture me now?" Philip's perfect facade slipped for just a moment. I turned away without waiting for his response - I'd already spent too many years of my life caring about Philip Baker's feelings. At the register.I pulled out my own credit card - not the supplementary one Philip had given me, which I'd returned along with my wedding ring.The tie was expensive, but it would be the first gift I'd bought with the salary I earned from taking care of Lucy. The thought made me smile - for the first time in years, I was spending money I'd earned through my own efforts.





The warmth of the Thompson mansion welcomed me home, chasing away the chill of my encounter with Philip. I found Howard in his study,the desk lamp casting a gentle glow over his concentrated expression as he reviewed documents. The familiar scent of tobacco and cologne wrapped around me like a comfort blanket.


He looked up at the sound of my entrance, his features softening almost imperceptibly. "You're back late."


"I bought some things for Lucy." I paused, then pulled out the carefully wrapped box. "And... this is for you."

Howard accepted the gift, his dark eyes lingering on my flushed cheeks for a moment that seemed to stretch into eternity.


"It's just... thank you for everything." My voice grew softer, more uncertain.

Howard opened the box with careful precision, studying the deep blue tie with an unreadable expression. After what felt like hours, he looked up."Would you help me put it on?"

I blinked in surprise. "You don't know how to tie a tie?"

"I usually buy pre-tied ones." A hint of embarrassment colored his admission. "Just slip them on when needed." The confession startled a small laugh from me.Howard Thompson,the powerful CEO who could command a boardroom with a single look, didn't know how to tie a tie. It was endearing in a way I hadn't expected - this tiny imperfection making him suddenly more human, more real. The thought warmed something in my chest.

I stepped closer, taking the silk length in my hands. Howard's proximity made my pulse quicken - I could feel the warmth radiating from him.smell the lingering traces of his cologne mixed with coffee and tobacco.In the quiet study, our breathing seemed unnaturally loud.

"Annie." Howard's voice dropped to nearly a whisper. "Would you..." He trailed off, just as he had on the rooftop garden.

"Yes?" My fingers stilled on the tie, heart thundering in my chest.

"Would you... be willing to help me with my ties from now on?"

The question hung between us, weighted with everything neither of us seemed able to say. I nodded, not trusting my voice. My hands trembled slightly as I finished the knot, smoothing the silk against his chest.

"Perfect," Howard murmured, though his eyes weren't on the tie.

I stepped back, suddenly aware of how close we were standing. The lamplight caught the blue threads in the tie, making them shimmer like the depths of Howard's eyes. I'd been right - it suited him perfectly.

"I should check on Lucy," I managed, though leaving was the last thing I wanted to do.


Howard nodded, that masklike control settling back over his features. But as I reached the door,his voice stopped me.
"Annie?"

I turned,heart leaping at the intensity in his gaze.

"Thank you." The words carried a weight far beyond the simple gift. "For everything."
###Chapter 28: Do You Still Love Her?

Philip's POV

The polished glass and steel of Howard Technologies' executive conference room made me feel distinctly out of place. My fingertips drummed an anxious rhythm against my leather portfolio as I sat across from Howard Thompson, the sterile modernity of his office a stark contrast to the old-money comfort of my own. Something in the air felt charged with tension,though I couldn't quite place why.

Our companies needed each other - Philip Investment Group's emerging tech portfolio desperately required a strong technology partner,and Howard Technologies was the only viable option in the current market.Simple business logic. Yet something about watching Howard adjust that deep blue jacquard tie made my stomach clench.

That tie. The same one I'd watched Annie select with painstaking care at Saks Fifth Avenue yesterday. I'd followed her movements through the store,convinced she was there hoping to run into me. The thought of her carefully choosing a gift for another man made something dark and possessive twist in my chest.

Howard's eyes met mine, catching my fixed stare on his tie. A slight smile played at the corners of his mouth - an expression I'd never seen on his usually controlled face. "A gift from Annie," he said, his voice carrying a warmth that set my teeth on edge. "Do you like it?"
I forced myself to look away, bitterness rising in my throat like bile. So it was true- Annie had moved on completely. She was buying gifts for other men now. The same Annie who used to spend hours coordinating my wardrobe, who knew exactly which colors brought out my eyes..."My ex-wife does have excellent taste," I said, aiming for casual indifference. "When we were married1.she chose all my and Brian's clothes."The words tumbled out before I could stop them, a desperate attempt to remind him of my prior claim on her.

Howard's smile deepened, and something about it made my skin crawl. "Is that so?Then perhaps I should ask her to help with my entire wardrobe.I've been meaning to update my style."


The casual intimacy in his tone made my fists clench involuntarily. "Are you interested in her?" The question burst from me like an accusation.

Howard's silence was worse than any answer. My mind raced with unwelcome possibilities. He was objectively attractive, successful, Ivy League-educated -exactly the type of man who could make Annie forget about me entirely. The thought of them growing closer day by day, of Annie's gentle smile being directed at him instead of me, sent a wave of panic through my chest.

Why would I still care about my ex-wife? A good question I asked myself.

The memory of Brian's words from breakfast that morning haunted me:"Dad, Sarah's different now. She got really mad when I spilled juice on Max's new gaming console. She said I was clumsy like..." He'd trailed off, but I knew he meant like Annie. The old Sarah would have laughed it off,helped him clean up. Now she seemed to measure everything against some invisible standard of perfection.

"And she keeps asking to use your credit card," Brian had continued,pushing his cereal around. "She said Max needs special tutoring, but I saw her buying jewelry yesterday." His eyes had met mine, confused and a little hurt. "Mom never did that. She always said we should save money for important things." I'd dismissed his concerns then, but now they nagged at me along with other warning signs I'd been ignoring. Sarah's recent behavior flashed through my mind - maxing out my black card on shopping sprees, using her supposed pregnancy as an excuse to avoid taking Brian to school while lavishing attention on Max.

If I was honest with myself, things had been simpler before Sarah's unexpected pregnancy had forced my hand. Back then, I'd had the best of both worlds - a stable home life with Annie handling alI the domestic details. plus the excitement of stolen moments with my college sweetheart.

"At least Mom helped me with homewor," Brian had muttered yesterday when Sarah brushed off his request for help with math. "She never said she was too busy getting her nails done."

Looking back now, I should have left Annie some room for reconciliation.After all, she was an excellent mother. The memory of her at Brian's kindergarten graduation surfaced-how she'd beamed with pride,taking photos from every angle while I checked work emails. She'd made our house feel like a home, something I hadn't fully appreciated until it was gone. If things didn't work out with Sarah eventually, getting back together with Annie wouldn't be such a bad option.

"She's divorced," I blurted out, hoping to taint Annie in Howard's eyes. If he knew about her past, surely he'd lose interest. Then she'd never find anyone betterthan me. She'd realize I was the best she could do, regret leaving me... Howard's expression remained maddeningly neutral. "Does that matter?""She has a child with me!" I pressed, desperation creeping into my voice.

"When you truly care for someone," Howard said with maddening composure, "such things are irrelevant. The only regret is not having entered their life sooner."

Panic clawed at my throat. "She slept with another man while we were married."


Howard's eyes turned to steel, all trace of warmth vanishing."Now I understand why she left you."

His words hit a nerve I hadn't known was exposed. It was the question that had haunted me since our divorce- why had Annie chosen to leave?Logically, she should have stayed, should have been grateful for my support.

"I haven't known her long," Howard continued, his voice carefully measured, "but I know she's not the type of woman you're implying. And I know exactly what happened."

Ice slid down my spine. "What do you mean?"

"You seem very concerned about the possibility of her being with me."Howard's gaze pinned me in place as he didn't seem to hear my question."Do you still love her?"

"Love her? Don't be ridiculous!" The denial sprang to my lips automatically.

"Good to know." Howard's satisfaction at my answer made something twist uncomfortably in my gut.

"Wait," anxiety crept into my voice, "what did you mean about knowing what happened?"

Howard ignored my question again, pulling out a stack of investment documents instead. "Let's discuss your company's requirements for the partnership."
###Chapter 29: Gossip

Annie's POV

"Knock-knock!" The cheerful voice interrupted my attempt to organize the mountain of art supplies on my new desk. Susan Moore, Howard's executive secretary, stepped into the office with the kind of graceful efficiency that made even the simplest movement look choreographed. "Time for your official welcome package."

I set down the bundle of pencils I'd been sorting, still trying to wrap my head around the fact that this spacious corner office was now mine. The drawing tablet, dual monitors, and rows of storage cabinets seemed almost too perfect- like a dream I might wake up from at any moment.

"Getting settled in?" Her smile was warm but evaluating as she placed a security badge and stack of papers on my desk. "These need your signature."

I accepted the ID badge and building access card, studying my surprisingly professional-looking photo. "Thank you for helping me get settled in."


Susan lingered, adjusting papers that didn't need adjusting. After a moment, she glanced at the doorway before leaning in slightly. "what do you think of our CEO?" Her tone carried that specific blend of professional discretion and carefully measured friendliness. "He's a fair and generous employer," I replied, proud of how steady my voice remained despite the way my pulse quickened at just the thought of him.I smoothed my skirt, grateful for the excuse to avoid eye contact. "Just an employer?" Her arched eyebrow spoke volumes.I met her gaze steadily. "What else would he be?"

Susan's laugh tinkled like expensive crystal. "Oh, you're good. No wonder he..." She caught herself, switching topics smoothly. "Let me get you set up on our internal communication channels."

Within minutes, my laptop pinged with Slack notifications. The channels appeared one by one:


\-#general-announcements

\-#office-social

\-#design-team

And finally, a private invitation to #tea-room.

"That last one's our unofficial water cooler," Susan explained with a conspiratorial wink. "Keep certain conversations away from Mr. Thompson's attention, if you know what I mean."

I nodded, maintaining my professional mask even as my stomach twisted.The #tea-room channel was already buzzing with activity:

"Today's suit count: Navy pinstripe. That makes three navy suits this week.Not that anyone's keeping track..."

"Mr. Thompson just walked through the finance department carrying some cartoon mugs. Anyone else's heart melt?" "He's been hitting the gym more lately - not that I'm keeping track." "My cousin works at Le Bernardin and swears she saw him having dinner with Catherine Morgan last week. But like, was it a DATE date or a business thing? Need details!" "Pretty sure his coffee order is just plain black coffee. How does someone so successful drink something so basic?"

"New theory: he has a secret family somewhere. No way someone that perfect is really single."

"Um, did anyone else notice he actually SMILED today during the morning meeting?"

I nearly dropped my laptop. The messages blurred together, a mix of workplace gossip and wistful speculation about Howard's carefully guarded private life. My fingers tightened on my mouse as I scrolled past their desperate attempts to piece together fragments of the man I was starting to know- the way his voice softened when he spoke to Lucy,how he actually preferred tea to coffee but drank coffee to stay alert, the tiny crease between his brows when he was truly concentrating rather than just being polite.


"But seriously," a new message popped up, "has anyone ever seen him actually date anyone? Like,ever?"

"Margaret Thompson's been trying to set him up with every eligible socialite in Manhattan. But he never seems interested."

"Maybe he's just really dedicated to his work and Lucy? That's kind of hot tbh."


"Oh,before I forget," Susan's voice pulled me back to the present, "Caroline Gluck from publishing wants to meet you. She's quite influential in the children's book world."

As if summoned by her name, a private message popped up on my screen:

*Caroline Gluck: You're the new creative director?* I typed carefully: *Yes. I'm the new creative director.

*Caroline: I'm swamped with deadlines, but I'd love to review your portfolio when things calm down.*

*Annie: No rush, I'm still settling in.*

The exchange felt loaded somehow, as if Caroline was testing waters I couldn't quite see. Before I could analyze it further, a familiar cologne announced Howard's presence. He stood in my doorway,two coffee cups from the executive lounge in hand.

"Excuse us, Susan." His tone was polite but firm. Susan extracted herself with practiced grace, though I noticed how her eyes darted between us before she left.

The rich aroma of dark roast coffee filled my senses as Howard set the ceramic mug on my desk. Even this simple gesture showed his attention to detail-he'd noticed I preferred real mugs to disposable cups. Just like he noticed everything, with those dark eyes that seemed to see straight through my professional facade.

"How are you finding the new position?" His voice carried that subtle warmth that seemed reserved for private moments like this.

"Busy, but in the best way." I wrapped my hands around the warm mug.trying not to notice how his rolled-up sleeves revealed strong forearms,or how his cologne-that intoxicating blend of tobacco and something darker - made my pulse quicken, "It's challenging and fulfilling." "It's gratifying to see you thrive here." The intensity in his gaze made my breath catch. How did he manage to make such a professional comment sound so intimate? The moment stretched between us, charged with everything we couldn't say. My eyes flickered to the still-open #tea-room channel on my screen.where messages continued scrolling:

"Has anyone noticed the CEO seems different lately? More relaxed..."

"That dinner at Le Bernardin with Catherine Morgan must have gone well.11


"Mr. Thompson never brings women to the office. But that Catherine Morgan - apparently she's exactly what his mother's been hopingfor."

I forced myself to look away from the chat, even as my mind wandered treacherously. Living under his roof had given me glimpses of a different Howard- one who wore reading glasses while reviewing documents late at night, who took his coffee black and sometimes hummed unconsciously while lost in thought. The Howard these employees desperately tried to understand through company gossip.

His phone buzzed, shattering the moment. Howard straightened, CEO mask sliding seamlessly into place. The transformation was fascinating-watching him switch from the man who made my heart race to the executive who commanded respect with a single glance.

The afternoon passed in a blur of project briefings and software setups.I was deep in a character sketch when my phone buzzed with an unknown number.


"Annie Baker speaking." "I'm Philip's friend."

###Chapter 30:My Good Friend

Sarah's POV

From behind the tinted windows of our Mercedes SUV, I watched the aftermath of Brian's conversation with Annie. The boy had clearly not expected her response to be so distant. Now Philip leaned against the car door, his gaze fixed on our crying son near the school entrance. Despite Brian's obvious attempt to maintain composure in front of his classmates,tears streamed down his face. Each sob made Philip's expression tighten in a way that fascinated me.

"Are you feeling sorry for Brian?" I studied Philip's reaction carefully.noting the slight clench of his jaw. When he remained silent. I pressed further. my voice deliberately casual. "Or perhaps... you're thinking about getting back together with Annie?"

Instead of answering, Philip yanked open the back door and slid inside.My heart skipped a beat. Why wasn't he responding? Had I accidentally stumbled onto something?

I took a deep breath, fighting to maintain my composure while my mind raced through possible ways to redirect his thoughts. Finally, he spoke:"No."


I lounged against the door, adopting a playful tone that masked my inner tension. "I didn't think so. After all, Annie's hardly wife material, is she?” "She didn't even wait until your divorce was final before sleeping with Robert," I continued, watching his reflection in the rearview mirror. "He even had video evidenace. And now she's already cozying up to Howard Thompson."

 I knew Philip's feelings for Annie better than anyone. That's why I had to systematically poison his perception of her, make him believe his lingering attachment was meaningless. More importantly. I needed him to believe I was the one he truly loved.

"You're being crude." Philip's voice carried an edge of displeasure as he fastened his seatbelt. "Sarah, we both know exactly why she ended up with Robert that night."

He paused, then added that he wasn't sure about Annie and Howard's relationship, but insisted there couldn't be anything romantic between them. He claimed he'd seen enough couples to know that Annie and Howard's interactions were too formal,too distant.

My fingers instinctively tightened on the hem of my designer blouse. Was he actually defending her?

"I'd prefer if you acted like none of this ever happened," Philip said firmly.

I turned away, struggling to keep my expression neutral. The mention of Robert's video had actually calmed my nerves somewhat. As long as that evidence existed, Philip and Annie could never reconcile. The thought was oddly comforting.

"Did you hear me?" Philip's tone sharpened at my silence.

"Mm-hmm," I murmured noncommittally, already plotting my next move. Eager to shift away from Annie-related topics, I brightened my voice. "Oh,don't forget about tonight's party." The mention of his friend's gathering finally brought a smile to Philip's face."Are you coming?" I shook my head, letting my hand drift to my stomach in a practiced gesture. "Not tonight. In my condition, I shouldn't party too hard. It might harm the baby. You go ahead, darling."

"Take care of yourself while I'm gone." His voice softened with concern.

I laughed lightly. "You're worrying about me after just a short outing?"Even though my relationship with Philip was purely transactional -his money for my carefully crafted perfect wife act-his genuine concern still sent a pleasant warmth through my chest. "Don't worry, I'Il be fine."




The unexpected call from Caroline interrupted my peaceful evening at home. I was curled up on my imported Italian leather sofa when her name flashed across my phone screen.

"What made you think of calling me?" I asked,curiosity piqued.

"Guess whose work I'm editíng at Howard Technologies?" Her voice dripped with smug satisfaction.

I sat up straight. "Annie?"

"Exactly!" Caroline confirmed. "I've reviewed her work - it's all warm and fuzzy family stuff. Not likely to be a hit. But the company's throwing so many resources at it..." "And me?" I continued, warming to my plan. "I'll be the loving mother who saved Brian, the devoted wife Philip deserves." "Perfect!" Caroline exclaimed. "Once your work is ready, I'll tell management that Annie's stories aren't connecting with readers. For the company's future, we'll need to pivot to promoting your series instead."turned serious,"I could ensure most of those resources go to your project instead."

When I didn't immediately respond, she pressed on. "Think about it-if your manga takes off. you could make more than whatever you're getting from Philip. It could be your safety net, just in case things go south with him."


"What exactly is Annie drawing?"I asked, my mind already spinning with possibilities.


"Aside from the project, she would draw some stories about her life with a child."

My eyes narrowed as an idea took shape. "That does sound boring.Caroline, what if I drew something based on my experiences? We could portray Annie as a gold-digger who abandoned her child to climb the social ladder. Once readers figure out who inspired the character,they'll despise her."

Philip might want to keep Annie's scandal with Robert private, but I intended to make it public knowledge. Even if Philip still harbored feelings for Annie, he'd never choose her once her reputation was destroyed. Then I could rightfully maintain my position as his wife.

"They absolutely would!" Caroline's enthusiasm was palpable. We shared a laugh, reveling in our scheme. They thought they were setting up a new project for Annie? In the end, it would serve our purposes instead.

As I ended the call, satisfaction settled over me like an expensive cashmere throw.Everything was falling into place. Annie might have her little fantasy with Howard Thompson for now, but soon enough, she'd learn what happens to people who try to take what's mine.
###Chapter 31: Regrets

Philip's POV

From our private booth in the upscale bar, the city stretched out below like a carpet of lights. The half-empty bottle of scotch commanded more of my attention, its amber depths promising temporary relief from thoughts I couldn't seem to shake.


"You might want to slow down there, Phil." Allen's voice carried that irritating note of concern from across the table.

"Did you know," I said, ignoring his suggestion, "that Annie bought Howard a tie?" The words burned worse than the scotch. "Navy jacquard.With some kind of pattern on it."

"A tie?" Allen exchanged glances with James and Marcus. "That's what's got you drinking like this?"

"Six years of marriage..." My glass hit the table harder than intended."She used to spend hours picking out my ties, matching them with my suits.She knew exactly what I liked." I took another sip, the memory of Annie's thoughtful smile twisting something in my chest. "And now she's doing the same thing for Howard. Like those six years meant nothing."

"And Sarah doesn't pick out your ties?" Marcus's question hit a nerve. "Sarah?" I laughed bitterly. "Sarah doesn't even help Brian pick out his clothes for school. This morning he wore the same shirt as yesterday because she was too busy shopping for herself. Annie would've..." I caught myself,draining the glass instead of finishing that thought. Marcus leaned forward in his seat. "Phil, buddy, is this really about a tie?" "You don't understand." The alcohol was making my tongue loose, my carefully constructed walls beginning to crumble. "She used to spend all her time taking care of our home, making everything perfect for me and Brian. And now..." Another sip. "Now she's working for Howard. Howard Thompson."


I stared into my glass, the bitter taste in my mouth having nothing to do with the scotch. The thought of Annie in Howard's world, in his company,made something twist painfully in my chest.

"Isn't that what you wanted?" James cut in. "For her to move on?"

"Not like this," I muttered. "Not with him."

"I thought you wanted the divorce," James pointed out carefully. "Wasn't that the whole point? To marry Sarah?"

The mention of Sarah's name sent an uncomfortable ripple through my stomach. Or maybe it was the scotch. "Sarah," I muttered, "keeps maxing out my card at high-end stores. Twelve thousand dollars last week. For shoes."


"At least Annie was practical," I continued, the words spilling out unchecked. "Always budgeting, making grocery lists... God, I used to find that so embarrassing. The CEO's wife, using coupons..." Allen's eyebrows drew together. "Speaking of Annie... there's something I've been meaning to ask. That video with Robert-the one that triggered the divorce.Was that really..." "There's video evidence!" I snapped, but even to my own ears,the protest sounded hollow. "She slept with him!""Did she?" Marcus's voice was quiet but pointed. "Because last time you were this drunk, you said something about Sarah setting the whole thing up."

The room seemed to tilt slightly. "That's not... I mean..." I reached for the bottle again, but Allen moved it out of reach.

"What I don't get," James mused, "is how she went from being your supposedly unfaithful ex-wife to Howard Technologies' new creative director. That's quite a career jump."

"Howard," I spat the name like a curse, "keeps giving her everything. The job, the office... Did you know Brian's private school tuition is probably more than Annie's old annual salary? And she just..." I waved my hand vaguely, "She just gets it all handed to her!"

"Handed to her?" Allen's laugh held no humor. "Phil, she's been working on children's books for years. Those sketches she used to do for Brian?The ones you called a waste of time? Turns out they were pretty valuable after all."


My head was swimming, memories blurring together. Annie at her deskin our old apartment, working late into the night on her illustrations. Annie trying to show me her portfolio, while I checked emails. Annie's face when I told her to focus on being a proper CEO's wife instead of chasing pipe dreams...


"She's supposed to be struggling," I mumbled, slumping against the seat."She's supposed to regret leaving me..." "Leaving you?" Marcus's voice seemed to come from very far away. "That's not how I remnember it." The room was spinning now. I closed my eyes, but that only made itworse. Through the alcoholic haze, I heard my friends' voices growing distant:

"You know what's really ironic about all this?"

"What's that?"

"Philip thought divorcing Annie would punish her. Instead,he basically gift-wrapped her a better life. Have you seen how Howard looks at her?"

"Better than how Sarah looks at Philip's bank statements, that's for sure."

"Speaking of Sarah, did you hear about her ex-husband's latest scandal?"

"Robert? Yeah,apparently..."

The voices faded into a dull roar as consciousness slipped away. My last coherent thought was of Annie - not the polished professional who now moved so confidently through Howard's world,but*my* Annie,sitting cross-legged on our old couch, sketching while Brian napped beside her.The memory carried a sharp ache Icouldn't quite blame on the scotch.

\---

"Should we call him a car?"

"Already done. His driver's waiting downstairs." I surfaced briefly to find Allen and Marcus supporting me toward the elevator.Everything blurred into indistinet shapes through my half-closed eyes. "You know," Allen's voice floated somewhere above my head, "for someone who claims to be happily remarried, he sure spends a lot of time thinking about his ex-wife." "The best part?" Marcus's reply felt like a final twist of the knife. "Annie's probably not thinking about him at all."


The truth in those words hurt more than any hangover could.
###Chapter 32: Confrontation

Annie's POV

Howard's car pulled up to the preschool just as classes were letting out.Through the afternoon crowd, I spotted Lucy standing apart from her classmates. My heart tightened as I watched hertry to suppress a smile at seeing us - an unconscious habit that spoke volumes about her struggle to express joy.


"How was your day, sweetheart?" I asked as we approached.

Lucy's fingers twisted in her skirt as she stared at the ground. Her silence felt heavier than usual, carrying an weight that made Howard straighten beside me. Without a word, he strode toward Lucy's teacher, his CEO presence commanding immediate attention even in this casual setting.

I knelt to Lucy's level, noting how she held herself - too composed for a five-year-old. She gave a tiny nod when I squeezed her hand, then quickly looked around as if checking who might have noticed this small display of emotion.

Howard returned moments later, a slight crease between his brows. "The teacher noticed nothing unusual," he said quietly, "but she'll pay closer attention and keep us informed." The careful way he delivered this message suggested he wasn't entirely satisfied with the response.




In the sanctuary of Howard's car, Lucy's rigid posture gradually relaxed.I watched her small fingers trace patterns on the leather seat,her mind clearly elsewhere. "You know," I began carefully, "when I first moved to New York, I felt very alone too." Lucy's eyes flickered to mine in the rearview mirror."I started small - just saying good morning to the doorman each day. It wasn't much, but it was a start."


Lucy's gaze shifted to Thomas, our driver who had been with the Thompson family for years. I could see her wanting to try, the way her lips parted slightly before closing again in frustration.

"I'm sorry," she whispered, fingers curling into tight fists in her lap."I want to,but..."

"Hey." I turned in my seat to face her fully. "You have nothing to apologize for. The fact that you want to try? That's already incredibly brave."

Howard's hand moved almost imperceptibly on the armrest between us, as if he'd started to reach out before catching himself. These moments of restrained tenderness were becoming more frequent, each one making my heart flutter in ways I tried not to examine too closely.

"I have something that might cheer you up." I reached into my bag.pulling out a carefully wrapped package. "I saw this and thought of you."

Lucy accepted the gift with characteristic care, her fingers ghosting over the ribbon before carefully untying it. Inside lay a dress in the softest shade of lavender, with tiny embroidered butterflies along the hem.

Lucy's small fingers traced the embroidered butterflies with wonder. Then she looked up at me with those solemn eyes. "But you already taught me how to draw butterflies this morning," she whispered, carefully pulling out a folded paper from her school bag to show me her practice attempts. "I wanted to draw more before..." My throat tightened at her response-this sweet child who wanted to prove herself worthy of every small kindness. "That's what family does.sweetheart. We share what we love." "You know what I think we need?"I kept my voice light. "A celebration. What do you say we grab some dinner out?"


Lucy's eyes lit up. though she quickly glanced at Howard before allowing herself to show too much enthusiasm. "Could we... could we go to the food stalls?"


Howard's reflection in the window couldn't quite hide his smile. "Thomas,take us downtown."




Lucy led our unlikely procession through the maze of food stalls with surprising confidence. She might struggle with words, but her strategic thinking was impressive - efficiently dispatching Howard to wait in the longest line while she guided me to collect other delicacies from shorter queues.

We claimed a small table, spreading out our feast. Lucy's eyes sparkled as she surveyed our haul, carefully selecting which dish to try first.

"Careful with the spicy ones," Howard cautioned, reaching across to move certain dishes further from her reach. The gesture was so paternal it made my chest ache. Lucy was lost in the simple joy of her meal, savoring each bite with childlike delight. For a brief moment, she was just a carefree five-year-old enjoying dinner with her family. As we were cleanng up, a sharp voice sliced through the peaceful evening atmosphere.

"Well, well. Annie Baker." Allen's tone dripped with condescension as he approached our table, his lip curling slíghtly. "Playing happy families with the Thompsons now? I have to say, you've certainly moved up in the world since Philip."

The insinuation in his voice made my skin crawl, but I refused to shrink under his judgmental stare. The old Annie might have apologized for simply existing. Not anymore.

"Allen." I met his gaze steadily. "Still fighting Philip's battles for him? Or did Sarah send you this time?"

His face reddened. "At least Sarah and Philip's relationship is honest.Unlike whatever..." he waved his hand dismissively at our little group,"scheme you're running here. Using a traumatized child to worm your way into a wealthy family? That's low, even for you."

Howard,who had been watching the exchange with deceptive calm,shifted almost imperceptibly. When he spoke, his voice carried the quiet authority that could silence a boardroom. "I don't believe we've been introduced.Though I must say,your eagerness to criticize arrangements you know nothing about is... telling."

"Look, I'm just trying to-" Allen started, but Howard cuit him off. "To what? Defend Philip's honor?" Howard's tone was precise,surgical."Or perhaps you're simply uncomfortable seeing Annie succeed without your...approval?" I couldn't help adding, "You know what's truly disappointing, Allen?Learning how quickly your moral compass adjusts to suit your audience." Allen opened and closed his mouth, clearly unprepared for both of us to stand our ground. His face flushed with a mix of embarrassment and anger.

"Tll make sure Philip knows about this," he finally managed, trying to regain some authority in his voice. "He should hear how you're... taking advantage of people's sympathy."

The threat fell flat, sounding more like the desperate final play of someone who'd lost an argument. I almost felt sorry for him. Almost.

"By all means, tell him," I replied calmly. "I'm sure he'll be fascinated by your sudden concern for my career choices."
###Chapter 33: A Peaceful Night

Annie's POV

Lucy was still holding my hand as we walked into the house, practically skipping with leftover excitement from our outing. Her notebookclutched tightly against her chest, she kept stealing glances up at me with bright eyes,clearly bursting to show off her latest drawings. That infectious joy vanished the instant she spotted Thomas waiting in the living room.

She ducked behind me with the practiced stealth of a child who thought she couldn't be seen if she couldn't see others, though her fluffy pigtails still poked out on either side of my legs. When Thomas stood up with his usual cheerful greeting, Lucy responded by trying to make herself even smaller, her little fingers twisting anxiously in my skirt.

"Time for today's training!" Thomas announced, and Lucy immediately thrust her notebook forward like a shield, pointing earnestly at her unfinished drawings. When that didn't work, she tilted her head back to give me her best puppy-dog eyes -a new technique she'd been perfecting lately, though the effect was somewhat spoiled by her trying too hard not to smile.


Howard stepped forward, clearly fighting back a smile at her theatrical display. "Perhaps we could all join in today," he suggested,already loosening his tie. Lucy's eyes lit up at this unexpected development. She straightened up,though she kept a firm grip on both my hand and her precious notebook as we made our way to the backyard. Her excitement at having us participate was obvious in the way she bounced on her toes, even if she tried to maintain what she probably thought was a serious expression. She nodded sleepily, making no protest when Howard scooped her up.Her head nestled naturally against his shoulder, one small hand still clutching her notebook while the other reached out to grab a fistful of my sleeve, as if to make sure I was coming too. By the time we reached her awing to running. She took off with all the coordination of an excited puppy, her little legs moving in their own unique rhythm as her arms windmilled enthusiastically. Her ponytails bobbed wildly out of sync with each other, and she kept glancing down at her feet as if to make sure they were still doing what she told them to. Howard and I jogged beside her,trying not to chuckle at her endearingly wobbly run. As she passed the hundred-meter mark, her face scrunched up in concentration, tongue peeking out slightly at the corner of her mouth - a habit that appeared whenever she was trying extra hard at something.

The final stretch proved to be the biggest challenge. Her pace slowed, but that determined little frown stayed firmly in place. Just when it seemed her energy might give out, she caught sight of a butterfly near the finish line. Suddenly energized, she made a wobbly dash toward it,arms outstretched, completely forgetting this was supposed to be a serious training session. She crossed the finish line in pursuit of her winged friend,then promptly flopped onto the grass, her chest heaving with exertion but a triumphant smile on her face.

"Did you see?" she whispered breathlessly to me, pointing at the butterfly that was now well out of reach. "It was purple!"

Howard knelt beside her, gently brushing grass from her disheveled pigtails. "Well done, little one." The warmth in his voice made Lucy beam with pride, even as she tried to stifle a huge yawn. "Should we get you cleaned up for bed?" room,she was already drifting off, murmuring something about purple butterflies and running shoes.




The night air had grown cooler as Howard and I stood on the balcony.The city lights spread out below us, but my attention was focused on the conversation at hand.

"I spoke with her teacher today," Howard broke the silence, his voice carrying an edge of frustration. "They claimedto be unaware of any specific issues."

I turned to study his expression, noting the tension in his jaw. "Then perhaps we should focus on her classmates. If they're the ones isolating her, they must know why."

The implications hung heavy in the air between us. Lucy's selective mutism made her an easy target for exclusion, but lately, I'd begun to suspect there was more to the story.

"I've been thinking," I ventured carefully. "Initially, I believed we shouldn't rush Lucy's progress - that she should heal at her own pace. But after what we've seen recently..." I paused, organizing my thoughts. "I think we need to be more proactive about helping he communicate with others.What's your take on this?" Howard's hands tightened imperceptibly on the railing. "I share your concerns." "She seems to open up more easily with people she's comfortable with,"I continued, thinking aloud. "People she trusts." "Her grandparents," Howard nodded. "She's always been closest to them." "Why don't we invite them over tomorrow?" The suggestion felt right the moment it left my lips. "Having more people she trusts around might help her feel secure enough to take those first steps."

"I'll make the arrangements." Howard's approval was immediate.A comfortable silence settled between us as we both contemplated the evening s small victories.


"Stay a while?" Howard's invitation was casual, but something in his tone made my pulse quicken. "The night's still young."

I should have declined. Should have made an excuse about work tomorrow or needing rest. Instead, I found myself nodding,drawn into the quiet intimacy of the moment.

"I've been meaning to thank you," the words tumbled out before I could stop them. "For everything - the opportunity to care for Lucy,the position at the company..."

"Annie." Howard's interruption was gentle but firm. "You earned those positions on your own merit. No one else could have connected with Lucy the way you have, or helped her make such progress. And your artwork?"His smile carried a warmth that made my chest tight. "That talent is entirely your own." The sincerity in his voice threatened to undo me completely. Panic fluttered in my chest as I realized how dangerously close we were to crossing lines that shouldn't be crossed. "I heard you and Catherine Morgan have been spending time together lately?" The words escaped before I could stop them,immediately followed by a wave of mortification. Howard's expression shifted, but before he could respond, I rushed to cover my obvious jealousy. "Not that it's any of my business, of course. Lucy needs to be our priority right now, and I'm still finding my footing at work..." I was babbling now, desperate to escapethe vulnerability I'd accidentally exposed. "I should probably get some rest. Early meeting tomorrow."

I fled before he could respond, my cheeks burning with embarrassment.The rational part of my brain listed all the reasons this was for the best:

1\. Lucy needed stability, not complications

2\. I had to prove myself at work

3\. Margaret Thompson would never approve

But none of those perfectly logical reasons could quite silence the part of me that wondered what Howard had been about to say. The part that remembered the warmth in his eyes when he praised my work,or the way his presence made me feel simultaneously safe and thrillingly alive.

As I got ready for bed, I told myself firmly that tomorrow I would focus on work and Lucy. Everything else was just a distraction I couldn't afford.

But as sleep finally claimed me, I couldn't quite forget the way Howard had looked at me, or the words left unspoken between us.
###Chapter 34: A Gentle Breakthrough

Annie's POV

Sitting at my desk in Howard Technologies, I found myself reviewing Lucy's therapy plan while working on some sketches. The upcoming meeting with her maternal grandparents was an important step, but something about it kept nagging at me. Lucy had made such progress in our small family circle - the way she'd chat happily with me during our drawing sessions, how she'd share stories with Howard about her day. But around strangers or even casual acquaintances, she'd retreat into complete silence,her bright personality hidden behind an invisible wall.

What if we could build on her comfort with us to help her connect with others? As I absently doodled in my notebook, a new idea began taking shape. Lucy loved the stuffed animals in her room, often acting out conversations with them that she couldn't have with people she didn't fully trust yet. She'd even started teaching them about her drawings...

The solution crystallized with sudden clarity. I quickly gathered my tablet and notes, my steps purposeful as I headed toward Howvard's office.This wasn't about changing the plan to meet her grandparents - it was about creating a gentle bridge to make that meeting more successful. Susan looked up from her desk with a knowing smile as I approached.

"He's between meetings," she said before I could ask. "Go right in." Howard was standing by his desk, reviewing something on his tablet. He looked up as I entered, his expression softening almost imperceptibly."Annie. Is everything alright?" "I've been thinking about Lucy's therapy approach," I began, settling into one of the chairs across from his desk. "With the upcoming meeting withyour parents, I think we could add something to make the transition easier for her."

Howard set down his tablet, giving me his full attention. The intensity of his focus might have been intimidating if I wasn't so caught up in explaining my idea.

"Lucy needs a bridge," I continued, pulling up some quick sketches I'd made. "Something that feels safe and familiar before she meets them in person. What if we created custom dolls? Detailed ones, designed to look like her maternal grandparents?"

I watched understanding dawn in his eyes as I explained further. "We could place them in her environment, let her get used to their presence.She could practice talking to them, play out scenarios she finds challenging.Her grandparents could even be present sometimes, responding through the dolls until Lucy feelscomfortable enough for direct interaction."

Howard leaned forward, his interest evident. "A transitional object."

"Exactly. It gives her control over the situation, lets her set the pace." My hands moved animatedly as I spoke. "We could start with simple dolls,then gradually introduce more detailed ones with voice recordings or interactive elements. The key is making the transition to meeting her mother's parents gentle and natural."

"You've really thought this through," Howard said softy. The warmth in his voice made my cheeks heat slightly. "Lucy's shown us she can connect with things that feel safe to her-her drawings, her notebook. This builds on that foundation." I pulled up more reference sketches on my tablet. "We could have the dolls made to exact specifications. Quality materials, careful attention to detail. Everything designed to make Lucy feel secure and in control."

Howard stood, walking around his desk to look at the sketches over my shoulder. His presence behind me was distracting, but I forced myself to focus on the tablet screen. "These are remarkable, Annie. The level of detail you've considered..."

"It's just preliminary," I said quickly. "We'd need to consult with child psychologists,get the design exactly right-"

"I'll have the team start working on it immediately." Howard's hand came to rest briefly on my shoulder, the touch sending warmth spreading through my chest. "Thank you, Annie. For always seeing what Lucy needs."


I turned to face him, suddenly aware of how close we were standing. His expression held something I couldn't quite read - gratitude, certainly, but also something deeper, more complex. Before I could analyze it further, he stepped back, clearing his throat.

"Would you join me for lunch? We can discuss the details further."

The invitation shouldn't have made my pulse jump the way it did. "Of course.For Lucy's project."

"For Lucy," he echoed, though something in his tone made me wonder if we were both trying to convince ourselves of the same thing. We settled at a quiet corner table in the restaurant near the office. Howard's usual commanding presence softened as we reviewed the menu together,the conversation flowing easily between us. It felt dangerous,how natural this all seemed -sharing lunch, discussing preferences, these small moments that blurred the lines between professional and personal.

"Annie?"

I realized I'd been staring at my water glass, lost in thought. "Sorry,I was just thinking about the doll project. We should probably start with-"

I was explaining the details of the doll therapy project when Howard's shoulders tensed slightly. It was such a subtle change that I might have missed it if I hadn't been sitting across from him.

A moment later, Catherine Morgan appeared at our table. Her presence seemed to fill the space with practiced elegance, though I couldn't help noticing how her arrival felt somehow...prepared.

"Howard," she greeted with carefully measured warmth. "What a pleasant surprise." The way she said it made it sound anything but surprising.

The slight tightening at the corners of Howard's mouth suggested this wasn't the coincidence Catherine was presenting it as. But before I could analyze his reaction further, Catherine turned to me with a smile that didn t reach her eyes.

She turned to me and her eyes bored into mine.

"And You are?" 
###Chapter 35: Change of Plan
The tension in his tone made me glance up sharply. This wasn't the polite deflection I'd expected from someone supposedly courting Catherine Morgan. In fact, he seemed almost... annoyed? I pushed the thought away.Reading too much into Howard's reactions was a dangerous game I couldn' Annie's POV

"And You are?" She turned to me and her eyes bored into mine.

"I'm Annie Baker. You must be Ms. Morgan." I forced a professional smile,though my stomach twisted at howperfectly she embodied everything I wasn't- old money grace, Harvard polish, the kind of woman MIargaret Thompson would approve of. Just my luck - every time Howard and I seemed to find our footing, the universe decided to remind me exactly why that was a terrible idea.

"Howard," Catherine turned back to him, effectively dismissing me with the practiced ease of someone who'd spent a lifetime perfecting the art of social warfare. "I must say, I'm surprised. When you kept declining our dinner invitations, I assumed you were simply too busy for social engagements.Yet here you are, enjoying a cozy lunch."

WNait - he'd been declining her invitations? The little flutter of hope in my chest was ridiculous and completely inappropriate, but there it was anyway.I focused on maintaining my professional expression, though I couldn't help noticing how Howard's jaw tightened almost imperceptibly at her words.


"This is a business lunch, Catherine." Howard's voice carried a warning edge I'd never heard before. "Annie and I were discussing Lucy's therapy program." t afford to play.

"Ah yes, Lucy." Catherine's smile turned sympathetic in a way that made my teeth clench. "Such a difficult situation. The Morgan family has extensive connections with child development specialists. We'd be more than happy to help arrange-"

"That won't be necessary." Howard's interruption was firm,almost harsh."I am Lucy's guardian and I say Annie has my complete confidence in handling her care."

Catherine's perfectly shaped eyebrows rose. "My, my. Things are more...complicated than I realized." She gave me another appraising look."Though I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. You do seem to have a talent for making yourself indispensable."

"Catherine." Howard's voice had turned to ice. "Whatever point you're trying to make, I suggest you reconsider."

"No point at all, darling." She placed a manicured hand on Howard's shoulder, though he subtly shifted away from her touch. "I just hate to see the Morgan family's sincere interest beingoverlooked in favor of more...convenient arrangements."

I kept my expression neutral, though my hands had clenched under the table. "Ms. Morgan, I appreciate your concern for Lucy's welfare.However,her therapy program is progressing well under the current arrangement." "How diplomatic." Catherine's laugh was like breaking glass. "Howard,really. When your mother hears about this..." "My mother is well aware of Annie's role in Lucy's life." Howard stood, his height and presence suddenly commanding. "Now, if you'll excuse us, we have business to discuss."

Catherine's smile faltered for just a moment before she recovered. "Of course. Business." She adjusted her designer bag on her shoulder."Though Howard, dear, do remember that the Morgan family's patience isn't infinite. We expect certain... considerations in return for our support."

"The only consideration I owe anyone is to Lucy's wellbeing." Howard's tone was final. "Good day, Catherine."


We watched Catherine leave, her heels clicking against the hardwood floor with military precision. Only when she was gone did Howard sit back down, running a hand through his hair in a rare display of frustration.

"I apologize for that," he said quietly. "You shouldn't have been subjected to such... tactics." He paused, studying my expression carefully. "I should probably mention - Catherine has been... monitoring my movements lately.Nothing to be concerned about, but I wanted you to be aware."

"It's alright." I took a sip of water, trying to process what had just happened. "Though I have to admit, I'm a bit confused. I thought..." I hesitated, then pushed forward. "I'd heard you and Catherine were seeing each other."

Howard's surprise was evident. "Who told you that?"

"Oh, just... office gossip, I suppose." I tried to keep my tone light,though my heart was racing. "About the Morgan family's interest in a merger through marriage..." "Annie." Howard leaned forward, his eyes intent on mine. "Catherine Morgan's 'interest' is purely financial. The Morgan family has been trying to arrange a merger through marriage for months, despite my clear lack of interest." His mouth quirked in a slight smile. "Though I'm curious why you've been paying attention to such gossip."

A warm flutter of relief spread through my chest at his words, though I tried to keep my expression neutral. The knowledge that he wasn't pursuing Catherine made me far hapopier than it should have,considering our professional relationship.

"I wasn't- I mean, I just happened to overhear..."

"Annie." His voice had softened, and something in his tone mnade me look up. The intensity in his eyes caught my breath."I-"

The waiter chose that moment to arrive with our meals, breaking whatever had been building between us. We turned our attention to our food.though the air remained charged with unspoken words.

As we walked back to the office, Howard stopped suddenly. "Actually,there's been a slight change of plans for today." His expression grew more serious. "I called Lucy's grandfather earlier and informed him of you. But Lucy's grandmother had some minor health issues lately."

My heart clenched with concern. "Is she alright?"

"Nothing serious, just routine tests. But..." He hesitated for a moment. "I thought perhaps we could take Lucy to visit them there this afternoon? It might be easier for her, actually - hospitals tend to put everyone on equal footing." Before I could gently probe this change, the teacher's voice cut through the afternoon bustle. "Children," she called, gathering the remaining students.Her next words hit me like a physical blow: "Has someone been saying
###Chapter 36: A Mother's Defense

Annie's POV

Howard and I arrived at the preschool right on time. We had important matters to resolve today, and Howard's expression made it clear he wouldn't leave until we did.

Lucy's teacher came out to meet us, clearly anticipating our arrival.Howard stepped forward, and the teacher quickly spoke before he could begin.

"The situation has been handled as we discussed," she assured us. "There's no need to worry too much."

Howard's stern expression softened slightly. After most parents had left,Lucy finally came out. Her face brightened when she saw us, and she rushed over excitedly.

"Mom, can we go home? Dad promised mac and cheese tonight!" Her enthusiasm was infectious,but I knew our plans had changed.

"Actually, sweetheart," I said gently, "we're going to visit your grandparents after this."

Lucy's smile vanished as quickly as morning frost under sunlight.Her small fingers tightened around her notebook until the edges crumpled,eyes darting to Howard before fixing firmly on the ground. The sudden shift in her demeanor made my heart clench. Lucy steals other children's mothers?"

A little girl with braided pigtails nodded, seemingly oblivious to the weight of her words."Yes."

"Who said this?" The teacher's voice remained steady,professíonál,though I noticed her eyes flickering briefly to Lucy.

"Max did," the girl answered without hesitation, adjusting her backpack straps.

The pieces clicked into place with sickening clarity. Max. Sarah's son. Of course. The realization sent a wave of cold anger through my chest-this wasn't just playground cruelty, this was calculated. Sarah's fingerprints were all over it, using her own child as a weapon. How long had this been going on? How many other subtle ways had she found to hurt Lucy, to try to drive wedges between us? Life had given me a second chance with Lucy and Howard - this time, I wouldn't let anyone take it away.

"They should be," Brian answered for him, earning a glare from Max.

Brian looked confused as he watched Max, then headed toward his waiting driver. It was clear he didn't understand why Sarah would pick up Max but never him, despite them being classmates.

"Could you wait until his parent arrives?" the teacher asked Howard. "We should address this together." Howard nodded curtly. Though his expression remained neutral, I could tell from the slight tension in his jaw that he was troubled by the situation. When Sarah finally appeared, her confident stride faltered as she spotted us. Her steps grew increasingly hesitant as she approached, finally stopping beside the teacher. "Come on, Max. Time to go home." "Mama..." Max ducked behind her, seeking protection.


Sarah's defensive posture was immediate as she tried to guide Max away,but Howard stepped forward, effectively blocking their path. His voice was eerily calm, yet carried an undercurrent of steel that made even Sarah flinch.


"Your son has been spreading malicious rumors that have resulted in my daughnter being ostracized by her classmates." His gaze was unwavering."How do you intend to address this?"


Sarah's hand tightened protectively on Max's shoulder as she felt him trembling. Her laugh was sharp and dismissive. "And how exactly are you sure it was my son?"


I stared at her in disbelief. Was she really going to deny it?

"The other children have confirmed it," the teacher saidquietly."They all say Max told them."


Sarah glanced down at Max, who nodded miserably. The confirmation seemed to steel her resolve rather than humble her. "Fine. What exactly did he say?"

"That my daughter stole Brian's mother." Howard's words were precise,measured.

Sarah's smile turned cruel. "Well, didn't she?" I felt Howard tense beside me, but this was my battle to fight. "Sarah,"I kept my voice steady, "you know better than anyone that Brian rejected me as his mother first. I didn't leave the Baker family-I was pushed out.Lucy simply welcomed someone who had nowhere else to go." I met her gaze evenly. "You know the truth, yet you're lying to protect your son from taking responsibility. Should I remind everyone exactly what you did back then?"

Though my tone remained gentle, Sarah's face drained of color. Her eyes darted between Howard and me,clearly weighing her options.

"My son made a mistake," she finally said, lifting her chin defiantly. "He's just a child - he couldn't have known the consequences of his words. Are you really going to hold a grudge against a child? Surely as adults, you can be more understanding."


I opened my mouth to respond, but Howard's hand on my shoulder stopped me.

"So you have no intention of helping us resolve this situation?" His tone was dangerously quiet.

Sarah shrugged, her confidence returning. "It's not like it caused any real harm to your daughter."

"I see." Howard nodded once, then took my hand in his while reaching for Lucy with the other. Without another word, he led us toward the car.

"But she hasn't even apologized to Lucy!" I protested as he opened the car door. "How is this fair to her?"


Howard's smile was sharp as he helped me into the car. "Do you really think a halfhearted apology would be enough? After everything they've done?"I studied his expression with growing curiosity. "What are you planning?" The corner of Howard's mouth lifted slightly, his eyesglinting with something that made my breath catch. But he didn't answer.
###Chapter 37: It Was Not Your Fault

Annie's POV

Lucy's small hand clutched mine tightly as we walked through the hospital corridors. I could feel the slight tremor in her fingers and see the anxiety in her expression as her eyes darted around nervously.

Howard walked slightly ahead of us, unusually quiet since we left the preschool. The confrontation with Sarah clearly weighed on his mind,though he maintained his protective presence.

When Lucy's grip tightened to the point of discomfort, I knew we needed a moment. Catching Howard's eye, I gestured toward a quiet alcove near the window. He nodded, understanding immediately.

I knelt down to Lucy's level, noting how her other hand clutched her ever-present notebook like a shield. "Hey, sweetheart," I kept my voice gentle,private. "Would you like to take a little break?"

"Are you nervous about seeing them?" I asked gently, smoothing her hair.

"I want to tell you something later," Lucy whispered, her voice soft but clear. "When we're back home."

"Of course, sweetheart," I said, giving her hand a reassuring squeeze."Take all the time you need. Your grandparents  will understand."Howard stepped closer, his presence providing an additional layer of security. "The doctors say your grandmother is doing well," he added softly. "This is just a routine check-up." Lucy nodded,though her grip on my hand didn't loosen. After a few deep breaths, she straightened her shoulders in a gesture so reminiscent of Howard that it almost made me smile. With a determined little nod, she indicated she was ready to continue.




Howard opened the door quietly. Lucy immediately hid behind his legs,peeking around him at the room.

Mrs. Parker lay sleeping in the hospital bed while Edward Parker sat beside her, holding her hand. The simple gesture spoke of years of deep love and devotion.


Edward looked up at our entrance, his kind eyes crinkling with immediate warmth. "Lucy," he breathed, voice barely above a whisper. He made no sudden moves, no dramatic gestures, just opened his posture slightly in welcome. "I've been hoping to see you,little one."

Lucy remained half-hidden, but I felt the slight shift in her stance -curiosity warring with apprehension. Edward seemed to understand perfectly, content to simply watch her with gentle patience.

"She's been sleeping peacefully," he explained softly, his gaze returning to his wife with such tenderness it made my throat tight. "The doctors say everything looks good - just being cautious with some new medication."

Howard moved closer to the bed, Lucy shuffling along with him like his shadow. "We came as soon as we could," he said quietly. "Is there anything you need?" Edward shook his head, then gestured towardI the hallway. "Perhaps we could step outside for a moment? Let her rest?" We filed out silently, Howard's hand automatically finding the small of my back as he guided us through the door. The gesture was so natural,so protective, that I almost missed Lucy's thoughtful observation of it. Almost.

In the relative privacy of the hallway, Edward's composure wavered slightly. His eyes filled as he looked at Lucy properly for the first tíme,years of unspoken love and grief evident in his expression. "You've grown so much," he managed, voice rough with emotion.

Lucy pressed closer to my side, her free hand seeking mine while maintaining her grip on Howard. The position might have looked awkward to outsiders, but to us, it felt like the most natural thing in the world-this little triangle of trust we'd built.

"I want you to know," Howard's voicecarried quiet authority, "that Lucy is cherished and protected. She wants for nothing, least of all love."

Edward nodded, wiping discreetly at his eyes. "I can see that." His gaze shifted to include me. "Annie, I understand Lucy has begun speaking again, at least sometimes. Even if it's limited... that's more progress than we'd dared hope for."

"Lucy is incredibly brave," I replied, feeling her small fingers tighten around mine. "She works hard every day to overcome her challenges. Any progress is entirely due to her own courage."

Lucy's grip relaxed slightly at my words, though she remained pressed close to my side. I could feel the slight tremor running through her small frame-emotion or exhaustion, I couldn't quite tell. "Perhaps we should let you both rest," Howard suggested, ever attentive to Lucy's needs. "We can come back tomorrow when everyone's had some sleep." Edward agreed readily, though his eyes lingered on Lucy with such longing that my heart ached for him. This man had lost his daughter and then, in many ways, his granddaughter too. Yet here he stood, offering nothing but patience and love.




Once we were in the car, Lucy climbed into my lap and cuddled close,finally ready to talk. These quiet moments had become our special time for her to share things she couldn't say elsewhere.

"I wanted..." her voice was barely audible, even in the quiet car. "Iwanted to tell Grandpa that I'm okay now."

"That's very thoughtful of you, sweetheart." I stroked her hair gently,feeling the tension in her small shoulders. "What stopped you?"

Lucy's fingers twisted in the fabric of my blouse, a sure sign that we were approaching something difficult."The day of the... the accident," she began haltingly,"Grandma and Grandpa both collapsed. They had to go to the emergency room too."

My heart clenched as I began to understand. Howard had gone very still in the seat beside us, listening intently.

"Margaret Grandmother said..." Lucy's voice caught. "She said if I hadn't insisted on going on the boat that day... if I hadn't wanted to see the dolphins..." A small sob escaped her. "She said it was all my fault." The surge of protective fury that rose in my chest was matched only by the icy stillness thatseemed to emanate from Howard. I forced myself to focus on Lucy, to keep my voice steady and warm. "Oh, sweetheart," I gathered her closer, feeling her tears dampen my shoulder, "The accident wasn't something anyone could have controlled- not you, not your parents,not anyone. Sometimes terrible things happen that we can't prevent or predict."


"But Mama..." Lucy's voice broke completely. "Mama died saving me. If I hadn't fallen in..."


"Listen to me," I pulled back just enough to meet her tear-filled eyes."Your mother loved you more than anything in this world. Saving you wasn't a choice for her - it was as natural as breathing. Ifshe were here right now, she would tell you that she would make the same choice every single time, without hesitation."

Lucy's sobs grew harder, years of pent-up grief and guilt finally finding release. "Grandma and Grandpa were so sick afterward... Margaret Grandmother said they might die too, and it would be my fault..."

I felt Howard's sharp intake of breath, saw his hands clench into fists in my peripheral vision. But his voice, when he spoke, was surprisingly gentle.

"Lucy," he waited until she looked at him, her face still pressed against my shoulder. "Your grandparents were sick because they lost their daughter -your mother. They were overwhelmed with grief, just like everyone who loved your parents. But none of that was your fault. And I promise you,they never blamed you. They were grateful you survived." "That's right," I added softly, wiping tears from her flushed cheeks. "When we lose someone we love, sometimes our bodies show our sadness in physical ways. Your grandparents collapsed because losing your mother was the hardest thing they'd ever experienced. But having you - knowing that a piece of their daughter lived on in you - that gave them hope." Lucy hiccupped slightly, her crying beginning to ease. "But I still can't...I don't know how to talk to them yet."

"That's okay," I assured her. "You take all the time you need. There's no rush, no pressure. They love you, and they'll wait until you're ready."

She nodded against my shoulder, exhaustion finally overtaking her. As her breathing evened out into sleep, I looked up to find Howard watching us with an expression I couldn't quite read.

"I had no idea," he said quietly, his voice tight with controlled anger."All this time, she's been carrying this burden... and Margaret..." He broke off,jaw clenching.

"We know now," I reminded him softly, still stroking Lucy's hair. "And we can help her heal."

I caught Howard's gaze in the dim light of the car.

"Yes," he said quietly, his voice carrying a gentle warmth that made my heart flutter."We will."
###Chapter 38: Annie...Could You Hold Me?

Howard's POV

I reviewed the documents on my tablet, waiting for my mother's arrival.Annie was upstairs with Lucy, their gentle voices occasionally drifting down through the quiet house. The familiar warmth of their presence did little to ease the tension coiling in my chest. After today's revelations about Lucy's burden of guilt, certain conversations could no longer be postponed.

Mother's arrival was announced by the precise click of her heels against the floor. She entered with her usual regal bearing, every movement calculated to project authority. The slight arch of her eyebrow told me she already had an agenda of her own.

"Howard." She settled onto the sofa, smoothing her skirt with practiced elegance. "You wanted to discuss Lucy?"

I set my tablet aside, studying her carefully. Something in her tone made me wary. "Yes, there are some matters we need to address."

"Interesting timing," she mused, a familiar glint in her eye that usually preceded her more calculated moves. "I was just speaking with Catherine earlier today."

I waited, knowing where this was heading but choosing not to make it easier for her. "She happened to see you at lunch." Mother's pause was deliberate,her smile taking on a sharp edge. "With Annie Baker, of all people." "According to her, it looked rather... intimate for an employer-employee relationship." The tension in my jaw tightened imperceptibly. "Is that why you're here,Mother? To discuss office gossip?"


"Darling, you know I only want what's best for you and Lucy." Her voice dripped with manufactured concern. "The Morgan family has been very patient,but-"


"Did you tell Lucy it was her fault?" The words cut through her carefully constructed facade.

Mother's composure wavered for just a moment. "I beg your pardon?"

"The yacht accident." My voice remained deadly calm. "Did you tell a five-year-old child that her parents' death was her fault because she wanted to see dolphins?"

"Howard-"

"Answer the question."

Mother's chin lifted slightly. "Sometimes children need to understand the consequences of their actions."

The surge of cold fury that swept through me was almost overwhelming."Consequences?" I stood. "A freak storm that no one could have predicted was somehow a *consequence* of a child's innocent request?"

"You're being dramatic," Mother waved a dismissive hand. "I merely pointed out-" "That her grandparents' collapse was her fault too?" The ice in my tone made her flinch. "That they might die because of her?" "They were in critical condition," she defended. "The shock of losing their daughter-"

"Was not Lucy's fault." Each word fell like a hammer. "And you knew exactly what you were doing when you put that burden on an already traumatized child."

Mother's facade finally cracked. "Everything I've done has been to protect this family's interests! The Morgan merger-"

"Is irrelevant." I cut her off. "Would you like to see Lucy's psychological evaluations? I wonder what a family court judge would make of a guardian who deliberately traumatizes a child in her care."

"Are you threatening me?" Mother's voice held a note of disbelief.

"No." I met her gaze steadily. "I'm informing you that things are going to change. Your interference in Lucy's life, and in my personal choices, ends now."

"Howard-"

"This isn't a negotiation, Mother. It's a notification." I moved to open the door. "I appreciate your past support of the company. But regarding Lucy,and my personal life - your input is neither required nor welcome."

Mother rose, her composure brittle. "You're making a mistake."

"The only mistake was letting you influence Lucy's care for this long." I held the door. "Goodnight, Mother."Only when she left did I allow my shoulders to slump, moving to stand before the windows. The city lights blurred as I pressed my forehead against the cool glass, trying to process the magnitude of what Lucy had been carrying all these years. I heard Annie's soft footsteps but didn't turn around.

"What happened?" Her gentle voice carried across the room.

The vulnerability in my next words surprised even me. "Annie... could you hold me?"

She crossed the room without hesitation, wrapping her arms around me from behind. "It's okay," she murmured, one hand rubbing soothing circles on my back.

I turned in her embrace, burying my face in her shoulder. Her familiar scent helped anchor me as the evening's emotions threatened to overwhelm. After a long moment, I pulled her closer, holding her with perhaps too much force, but she didn't protest.

We stood like that in comfortable silence until my breathing evened out.When I finally lifted my head, Annie's eyes held nothing but warmth and understanding.

As Annie's arms loosened around me, I found myself reluctant to let the moment end. Her presence had a way of settling the chaos in my mind,bringing clarity where there had been only fury and confusion.

"Annie." Her name escaped before I could second-guess myself. She pulled back slightly, but stayed close enough that I could still feel the warmth of her presence."Hmm?" "I'd like you to consider..." I paused, choosing my words carefully. "Being more than just colleagues. More than friends." Surprise flickered across her features, followed by something softer, more complex. She took a shaky breath. "Howard... what about your mother?Margaret has made it very clear what she thinks of me."

The mention of my mother stirred something fierce in my chest. After today - afterlearning what Margaret had done to Lucy, the guilt she'd placed on an innocent child's shoulders - my voice came out with quiet intensity.

"My mother will no longer dictate the happiness of this family." The steel in my tone surprised even me. "I've allowed her influence to hurt Lucy once. I won't make that mistake again."

Annie's eyes widened slightly at my declaration. She twisted her hands together, a gesture I'd come to recognize as a sign of internal conflict. "It's not just your mother, Howard. I just started at Howard Technologies,and with everything that's happening with Lucy's therapy..." She glanced away,her voice growing softer, less certain. "The timing isn't... I mean,I should focus on..."


Her words trailed off into silence, and something in her expression made me suspect there were deeper reasons she wasn't voicing. The slight tension in her shoulders, the way she seemed to be struggling to find the right words-it felt like she was holding something back.

"Annie, if there's something else-" But before I could finish, she was already backing away. "I should check on Lucy," she said quickly, already turning toward the stairs."Goodnight,Howard." I watched her hurried retreat, the words I'd wanted to say dying in my throat. The speed of her departure only confirmed my suspicion that there was more to her hesitation than just work and timing. But whatever those reasons were, she clearly wasn't ready to share them.

For a long while, I stood in the darkening room, letting the silence settle around me. The house felt emptier somehow, despite knowing both Annie and Lucy were just upstairs. Finally, I moved to my study, needing the familiar comfort of work to distract me from the hollow feeling in my chest.

My jaw clenched as I pulled out my phone. If I couldn't address the hollow feeling in my chest or the questions left unasked, I could at least handle other matters. The call connected after one ring.

"Tomorrow, before school starts." My voice carried an edge of suppressed emotion. "I want everyone at that school to know exactly what Sarah Johnson has done."
###Chapter 39: Rage

Sarah's POV

The vase shattered against the wall with a satisfying crash, fragments scattering across the floor. That sanctimonious bastard. My hands trembled as I grabbed the crystal paperweight next, feeling its weight in my palm before sending it flying. The destruction did nothing to ease my fury,my nails digging into my palms as rage coursed through me.

"Mommy?" Max's uncertain voice cutthrough my rage. I spun around to find him hovering in the doorway, eyes wide as he took in the destruction.

I forced my features into a reassuring smile. "Everything's fine,sweetheart.Mommy just had a little accident. Why don't you go play in your room while I clean this up?"

Once Max's footsteps had faded down the hall, I collapsed onto the sofa.pulling out my phone with shaking fingers. Caroline answered on the second ring.

"I just sent you the first set of illustrations," I said without preamble, my voice tight with barely controlled fury. "What do you think?"

"The quality is excellent," Caroline replied, professional interest evident in her tone. "Though we'll need a faster update schedule if we want this to gain traction quickly." "Oh, don't worry about that." I pulled up the next panel on my tablet,where I'd sketched a woman who bore a striking resemblance to Annie,abandoning her crying child to climb into a car with a wealthy-looking man. "I have plenty of material to work with. By the time I'm done,everyone will see Annie Baker for exactly what she is - a gold-digging 
homewrecker who abandoned her own child to climb the social ladder."

"And Howard?" Caroline's tone held a note of caution.

My laugh held no humor. "Oh, I have special plans for Mr. Thompson.Everyone's going to learn how the mighty CEO of Howard Technologies uses his position to seduce vulnerable employees. After all, what kind of man lets his ward's therapist move into his house?"

"Sarah..." Caroline hesitated. "Are you sure about this? Howard's reach in Upper East Side circles is significant. After this morning..."

"After this morning, what choice do I have?" I snapped, the memory of those sidelong glances and whispered conversations at school still burning.
"You should have seen how they all treated me at pickup. Howard actually told everyone about what happened with Philip and Brian-how I supposedly plotted to replace Annie from the start." My fingers clenched around the phone. "He made it sound so calculated, so cold. Asif everything I did for Brian, all the love I showed him, was just part of some scheme."

"Sarah..." Caroline's tone was careful. "You did encourage Brian to reject Annie, and you did pursue Philip quite... deliberately."

"You don't understand," I cut her off, my voice passionate. "I was Philip's first love-his true love." I gripped the phone tighter. "I'm the one who truly understands Philip, who knows what he needs. Brian deserves to grow up in a home with his father's real soulmate. Everything that happened was meant to be - I was just helping fate along." The half-truths came easily after so much practice. But now Howard had twisted everything, making me sound like some kind of calculating predator. "The way those women pulled their children away when I walked past..." My fingers clenched around the phone. "Now none of the mothers will let their children have playdates with Max. Even the ones who used to praise my parenting skills suddenly have 'other commitments'when I call."


"The timing is unfortunate," Caroline agreed diplomatically.

"Don't even get me started on that." I pulled up another sketch, this one showing a businessman who resembled Howard in a compromising position with his secretary. "If Howard Thompson thinks he can just destroy my reputation and get away with it, he's about to learn exactly how wrong he is."

"The illustrations are compelling," Caroline admitted. "But we'll need to be careful about the release strategy. Maybe start with something less...explosive?"

I considered this as I added shading to the panel where Not-Annie was literally stepping over her crying child to reach for a dliamond necklace."Fine. We'll begin with subtle character establishment. But I want readers invested before we really twist the knife."

"And what about Philip?" Caroline's question made me pause. "Won't this risk exposing your...arrangement?"

My hand stilled over the tablet. She had a point-Philip's reaction was the one variable I couldn't entirely predict. Which meant I needed to see him.Now. Philip looked up froma stack of documents as I entered his office, his expression shifting from annoyance to resignation as he recognized me. "Sarah." He set down his pen with deliberate care. "This isn't a good time."

"It never is." I sank into one of his visitor chairs, letting my shoulders slump slightly. Years of experience had taught me exactly how to play this - not too desperate, but just vulnerable enough to appeal to his protective instincts. "But I didn't know where else to go."

Philip's jaw tightened, but he gestured for his assistant to close the door."What's wrong?"

"Everything." I let my voice crack slightly. "Howard Thompson has been spreading rumors about me at Lucy's school. Horrible things. Now none of the other mothers will let their children near Max. Do you know what that s doing to him? To be suddenly isolated, treated like he's toxic?"

"What kind of rumors?" Philip's tone sharpened with interest.

I dabbed carefully at my eyes, smudging my makeup just enough to look authentic. "He revealed everything about how I came into Philip's life-making it sound like I deliberately used Brian's vulnerability, like I calculatedly positioned myself in your life. You know how cruel the Upper East Side circle can be - they're treating me like I'm some kind of manipulator."

"And aren't you?" Philip's question was mild, but his eyes were sharp.I straightened,letting real hurt flash across my face. "How can you say that? After everything we've been through?" My voice dropped to a whisper."I know I made mistakes, but I never meant to hurt anyone." It was the closest to honesty I'd come with him in months. "This is pure character assassination, and you know why Howard's doing it."
 
 "Because of Annie!" I couldn't quite keep the bitterness from my voice.′′H3s trying to clear the field for her, make sure there's no competition for his affections. And he's using my son as collateral damage!"

Philip's expression grew more reserved. "Sarah..."

"Don't you dare defend him," I cut in. "You of all people should understand what's at stake. If Howard Thompson thinks he can just destroy people's reputations without consequences-"

"Sarah, listen to me." Philip's voice took on that maddeningly reasonable tone I hated. "Howard Technologies is a critical business partner. We have several important collaborations in progress."

I felt my carefully constructed expression falter for just a moment. "So you're saying business matters more than what he's doing to your son?"

"What I'm saying," Philip leaned back, studying me with an oddly detached look that made my skin prickle, "is that this is a personal matter between you and Howard. I can't risk our professional relationships over private grievances."

"Private grievances?" I let my voice crack slightly. "He's systematically destroying my reputation!"

"Perhaps," Philip's tone grew cooler, "you should consider why he felt the need to do so."Something in his voice made me pause. This wasn't the usual Philip who would rush to smooth things over, to keep everyone happy. This was...different. More distant. Like he was finally seeing through some of my carefully constructed facade. I swallowed hard, recalculating. "I understand," I said softly,letting my shoulders slump in defeat. "You're right, of course. The business relationship needs to come first. I'll... handle this myself."

Philip nodded once, already turning back to his laptop. But I caught the slight tension in his jaw, the way his fingers hesitated over the keys. He might be choosing business over me now, but I could work with that.After all, I'd built my entire life on making people see what they wanted to see.


"Thank you for listening, at least," I added quietly as I stood to leave.painting on a brave smile. Let him think I was gracefully accepting defeat.It would only make my next move more effective.
###Chapter 40: Mother Would Be Horrified

Catherine Morgan's POV

I lay in bed early that morning, staring at the ceiling of my apartment.Being a good daughter had always been second nature to me-from learning piano at age five to choosing Harvard Business School just last year,every major decision in my life had been carefully guided by my mother's wishes. But now, fresh out of college and still uncertain of my path, last night's conversation with Margaret Thompson pressed heavily on my mind.


"Catherine, there's something I need to tell you," Margaret's voice had carried an unfamiliar note of defeat. "Regarding Howard... I'm afraid I won't be able to help you anymnore."

I'd frozen for a moment, though the words didn't really surprise me. Not after the scene at the restaurant. The image of Howard and Annie dining together flashed through my mind again-his relaxed posture, the way his eyes had softened when she spoke.

"It's alright, Margaret," I'd replied, managing a bitter smile at my ceiling."I think it's time I gave up anyway."

"So suddenly?" The surprise in her voice had been evident. "There's nothing sudden about it." I closed my eyes, remembering that carefully orchestrated dinner. I'd chosen Howard's favorite private restaurant, armed myself with every detail Margaret had shared about his preferences. I'd spent hours preparing, choosing the perfect outfit and rehearsing conversation topics. When the waiter presented our menus, I'd jumped at the chance to demonstrate my insight. "The seared foie gras for Mr. Thompson. It's his usual choice here."


But Howard had simply stated, "The sea bass with seasonal vegetables,"his tone brooking no discussion.

Throughout dinner, I'd deployed Margaret's intelligence like precision strikes. "The Giants really dominated last weekend's game. What did you think of their defensive strategy?"

Howard's distracted "Very good" had been followed by a direct hit to my carefully constructed facade: "I haven't followed football since college. That was just a phase, Catherine. And for future reference? Don't rely on my mother's outdated briefing about my interests. I'm not the son she thinks she knows anymore."

The mortification of that moment still burned. All my meticulous preparation had crumbled into awkward silence. Worse still, Howard hadn't seemed to notice or care about my discomfort. His gaze had kept drifting away, as if I were merely part o the restaurant's décor.

Days ago, following Margaret's suggestion, I'd positioned myself at a restaurant near Howard Technologies, hoping to observe his daily routine.Instead,I'd watched him enter with Annie, choosing a window table that left them perfectly visible to my hidden vantage point. The Howard I saw there was a stranger to me. His usually rigid posture had softened, his perpetual mask of polite distance replaced by genuine engagement. When Annie said something amusing, he actually laughed -a real, unguarded sound that made my chest ache. During our dinner,my carefully crafted jokes had earned nothing more than courteous smiles. The way Howard looked at Annie finally made his rejection crystal clear. That gentle attentiveness couldn't be earned through any amount of strategic planning.

"But Catherine, you're so perfectly matched..." Margaret had tried to continue.

"Mrs. Thompson," I'd cut her off, my voice soft but firm, "some things require more than just matching pedigrees."

However, I couldn't shake the restaurant scene from my mind. When I'd graduated a few months ago, feeling lost about my future, Mother had been so certain about what came next. "A good marriage is the foundation of a successful life," she'd said, steering me toward societal events and arranged meetings. In my uncertainty, it had been easier to follow her lead than to question why I, with my fresh Harvard MBA, wasn't pursuing a career of my own. What did that simply dressed woman possess that I lacked?

Perhaps... I needed to understand. At least then I'd know why I'd failed.

I sat up abruptly, decision made. I would go to Howard Technologies and see Annie for myself. The coffee shop was busy with the morning rush when I arrived. I'd positioned myself strategically, prepared toconfront Annie with the same dismissive grace I'd perfected like last time. But when she walked in,something in my carefully constructed plan faltered. "Ms. Baker." The words came out colder than I'd intended,matching the icy determination I'd felt walking into the café. But Annie looked up with a smile that seemed to warm the very air between us. Her eyes held none of the calculation or wariness I'd expected-just a genuine, open kindness that made my carefully prepared barbs feel suddenly petty.

"Ms. Morgan." Her voice carried the same warmth as her smile.′′It2sa pleasure to meet you here. Would you like to join me?"

The invitation seemed genuine, which somehow made it worse.I sat down,my rehearsed accusations dying on my lips.

"I... I owe you an apology," I heard myself say. "For my behavior at the restaurant that day.It was unnecessarily cruel."

Annie's expression softened further. "Thank you. That's very kind of you to say."

"Why?" The question burst out before I could stop it. "Why does he prefer your company to mine? What do you have that I don't?"

To my surprise, Annie's response held no triumph, no smugness."Honestly? I'm not entirely sure myself."

Her candor caught me off guard. "But you must have some idea."

Annie studied me for a moment, then asked gently, "Catherine, may I ask you something? You graduated from Harvard Business School, correct?Why aren't you pursuing a career? Why focus all your energy on securing a marriage?" The questions struck deeper than I expected. I opened my mouth to respond, then closed it again. The truth was, I'd never really considered any other path. It had always been assumed..."I.., that's what's expected," I finally  managed. "Mother said so." "And what do you want?" Annie's voice remained kind, but her questions were relentless. "What do you actually enjoy doing, Catherine? What makes you feel alive?"


I stared into my untouched coffee, memories surfacing unbidden. "I... I used to love video games, actually." A small laugh escaped me. "Mother was horrified when she found my Nintendo hidden under the bed in high school. She replaced it with intensive piano lessons. Just like she replaced my computer science electives with extra etiquette classes in college."

"And did you enjoy the piano?"

"I became quite proficient." The answer came automatically,then I paused,really considering the question. "But no. I never loved it the way I loved gaming. The strategies, the world-building, the sense of accomplishment when you master a difficult level..."

Annie smiled. "You light up when you talk about it. Your whole energy changes."

"It doesn't matter," I said quickly. "It's not a suitable interest for someone of my background."

"Says who?" Annie's question was gentle but pointed. "The same people who decided your only value lies in making an advantageous marriage?"

I felt tears prick at the corners of my eyes. "You don't understand. Our world has certain expectations..." "The world is changing, Catherine. Women can be more than decorative accessories to powerful men." Annie leaned forward slightly. "You're clearly intelligent and capable. Why not use that Harvard degree to pursue something you're passionate about?" "Like what?" I meant it to sound dismissive, but it came out more like a genuine question.

"Well, the gaming industry is booming, Companies are always looking for people who understad both business and gaming culture." Annie's eyes sparkled. "And imagine the impact you could have. You're young,you have a fresh perspective, and with your business degree..."

"Mother would be horrified," I said, but for the first time, the thought didn't fill me with dread. Insead. I felt a flutter of excitement I hadn't experienced since receiving my college acceptance letters. "She always said gaming was a waste of time, that I should focus on more... appropriate pursuits."

"And how has following all those 'appropriate' pursuits worked out so far?”Annie asked gently.

"Maybe that's the problem," Annie said softly. "You've been so focused on being what others want, you've forgotten to ask yourself what you want."

I studied her then, really seeing her for the first time. The warmth in her eyes, the gentle strength in her manner - suddenly I understood what Howard saw in her. She had a way of making you feel both seen and accepted,of helping you see yourself more clearly.

"Thank you," I said quietly, meaning it more than I'd meant anything in a long time.

Annie's smile widened."For what?" "For helping me understand." I stood, gathering my things. "Both why Howard chose you, and why I've been so lost."
###Chapter 41:Why Not

Howard's POV

In the morning, Annie and I walked Lucy to preschool, following our usual path along the maple-lined street. At the entrance, Lucy turned to wave goodbye to us - she's really doing better. I couldn't help but smile at this small yet meaningful change, silently thanking Annie for all she had done to help Lucy come this far.

Just as we were about to turn and leave, a little girl with pigtails approached Lucy, and I held my breath, remembering all the times Lucy had dissolved into panic at such moments. Lucy tensed - I could see it in the slight stiffening of her shoulders - but instead of running away like she used to, she managed a hesitant nod followed by a gentle shake of her head. My heart raced as I watched the interaction unfold, fighting the urge to step in and protect her. Though the exchange was awkward,it was worlds away from the completely withdrawn child of a few months ago who would have been hiding behind my legs by now.

"Do you think she's finally starting to open up?" Annie asked softly beside me.

"We'll see how it goes," I replied, watching Lucy disappear into the building.

"She's been practicing, you know," Annie shared with a gentle smile. "Both last night and this morning. I heard her whispering 'good morning'and thank you' over and over in front of the mirror." "One small step at a time," I nodded, thinking about how far Lucy had come from those early days of silent tears and blank stares. Every tiny gesture forward felt like a victory. The car was already waiting when we walked back. As Annie slid into the backseat beside me, her perfume filled the enclosed space, bringing back memories of that night on the terrace. The night after my heated argument with mother, when Annie had found me there. The warmth of her embrace as she quietly stood with me, understanding without words needed.


The drive to the office was unusually quiet. Usually, we'd discuss Lucy's progress or upcoming projects, but today the silence felt charged with unspoken words. I caught Annie's reflection in the window-she was gazing out at the passing city, a slight blush coloring her cheeks when our eyes briefly met in the glass.

These precious moments alone with Annie had become increasingly rare since hiring a full-time driver. It had seemed like the right decision at the time - making things more convenient for Annie and Lucy. But now,every second we spenat together in this confined space felt electric, charged with unspoken words and stolen glances.

Since that night after my fight with mother, I'd caught Annie looking at me when she thought I wasn't watching, her eyes dark with an intensity that made my breath catch. The way she'd quickly look away, a slight flush coloring her cheeks, only made the attraction more maddening.These moments of connection, however brief, sent my heart racing every time. As we approached the office building, I found myself drowning in possibilities and what-ifs. Perhaps I could suggest lunch today,somewhere private where we could finally address this magnetic pull between us. The tension was becoming unbearable - surely she felt it too? After a morning of back-to-back meetings and endless document reviews,I allowed myself a brief respite. Standing by the floor-to-ceiling windows of my office, I stretched my stiff shoulders, attempting the exercises Thomas had demonstrated. The morning sun warmed my face as I rotated my neck,trying to release the tension that seemed permanently lodged there these days.


A knock at the door interrupted my impromptu exercise session.

"Come in," I called out automatically, still focused on working out a particularly stubborn knot in my shoulder.

"Documents requiring your signature, Mr. Thomnpson," Susan's voice made me pause mid-stretch. My longtime secretary stood in the doorway,barely concealing her amusement at catching her usually composed boss doing what must have looked like awkward yoga moves.

"Thank you, Susan," I straightened my tie, suddenly struck by a thought."May I ask you something?"

She paused by my desk, documents still in hand. "Yes, Mr. Thompson?"

I hesitated for a moment, then decided to press on. "What's your impression of me? Personally.Be honest."

Susan hesitated, clutching the documents to her chest. Though she'd been my secretary for years, I rarely asked her personal questions.

"It's alright," I assured her, gesturing for her to take a seat. "I value your candid opinion." She placed the documents on my desk and sat down, still looking uncertain. "Well.,. at first glance, you're quite... attractive, sir. The type who could sweep any woman off her feet, if you wanted to." She blushed slightly."Some even assumed you'd be the type to have a different date every night."

I kept my expression neutral, though inwardly I was somewhat surprised by this perception. "I see. Please continue."

"But you're rather... mysterious," she chose her words carefully."We've never seen you with anyone at the office. There are even rumors..." She trailed off, clearly uncomfortable.

My fingers stilled on the pen I'd been holding."Go on."

"Some wonder if you might not be interested in women at all, though," she glanced at me quickly, "they say you look a bit too... rough for that."

I met her gaze steadily, my face betraying nothing of my thoughts."An interesting theory."

"And in the office, you've always been quite serious, almost aloof. Though lately," she added with a slight smile, "you've become more approachable.Like laughing at Jenkins' terrible joke during last week's board meeting -that really surprised everyone."

I set down my pen and leaned back slightly, considering her words. The office gossip was more detailed than I'd anticipated. "Thank you for your honesty,Susan." The rumors weren't entirely unfounded - I had withdrawn significantly from social life. My mind drifted to the past, when I used to date frequently, maintaining a steady stream of social engagements that kept the gossip columns interested. But everything changed after Lucy's parents'accident. The last time I'd been intimate with anyone was that night with Annie... Since meeting her. I'd changed in ways I hadn't even realized. If Susan thought I was charismatic, why had Annie pushed me away? The question nagged at me, refusing to be dismissed.

As the lunch hour approached, I found myself heading toward Annie's studio,rehearsing what I might say to finally break this tension between us. But through the glass walls, I saw Catherine Morgan already there,perched casually on the edge of Annie's desk. The mere sight of her made my jaw clench.


Susan had mentioned Catherine's increasingly frequent visits to Annie's studio lately. Though Annie had dismissed my concerns, insisting there was nothing to worry about, something about Catherine's presence here set my teeth on edge. Perhaps it was the way she carried herself with that calculated grace, or how her eyes always seemed to hold a hint of mockery.

Annie looked up as I entered, her smile warm but slightly nervous.She started to say something, but Catherine smoothly cut in.

"Join me for lunch?" she asked Annie, standing up with that perfect poise that only irritated me further.

"No." The word left my mouth before I could stop it, sharp and decisive.

Annie turned to me, surprise evident in her widened eyes. "Why not?"
###Chapter 42: Lunch Battle

Howard's POV

The word hung in the air like static before a storm. I watched Catherine's perfectly shaped eyebrow arch upward, her lips curving into that knowing smile I'd grown to detest. Catching myself, I softened my tone. "What I mean is - Annie hasn't tried Morton's new lunch menu yet. I was just about to suggest it."

Catherine's fingers drummed once against Annie's desk. "What a coincidence. That's exactly where I was planning to take her."

"Perfect timing then," she continued before I could object, turning to Annie with practiced warmth. "We can all go together. The more the merrier,right?"

Annie's fingers went to her pendant - that telltale sign of uncertainty I'd grown familiar with. Her eyes darted between us before settling somewhere in the middle distance. "I suppose that would be nice?"

"Let's take my car," Catherine announced, already gathering her things.

I opened my mouth to suggest separate vehicles, but Catherine had smoothly maneuvered Annie toward the door, their arms linked as if they were old friends. I followed them to the parking lot, watching Catherine guide Annie into the front passenger seat while I was relegated to the back like an afterthought. "The limestone facade is original to the building," she was saying,her arm still linked with Annie's as they walked toward the entrance. I followed behind, my hands flexing unconsciously at my sides as I watched them disappear through the revolving door. The leather seat felt unusually stiff as I settled in. Through the rearview mirror, I caught glimpses of Annie's profile as Catherine launched into what seemed like an endless stream of conversation. I followed them in, my hands flexing at my sides as I watched Catherine's arm still linked with Annie's. "Speaking of design work," Catherine's laugh carried through the car."Annie, you must tell me more about that portfolio you showed me yesterday. The color choices were absolutely inspired."

"Oh, thank you," Annie's response came with a small chuckle that made something in my chest tighten. "I was actually a bit nervous about that particular combination."

"You shouldn't be. I've seen a lot of portfolios in my time, but yours has such a fresh perspective," Catherine's voice was warm with calculated charm. "We really must discuss how we could apply that aesthetic to some of my upcoming projects."


I checked my phone again, the screen a blur of unread messages.The conversation flowed around me, Catherine's voice rising and falling in practiced cadence as she drew Annie into one topic after another. Each traffic light seemed to stretch longer than the last, and I found myself increasingly aware of my position in the backseat, watching this carefully orchestrated performance play out before me.

By the time we reached Morton's, I had counted seventeen stoplights and checked my email folder three times. I quickly moved to open Annie's door,but Catherine was already there, helping her out while pointing out the restaurant's architectural details with exaggerated interest. "Mr. Thompson," the maitre d' greeted me. "Your usual table?"

"Actually," I stepped forward, "we'd like one of the corner booths."The intimate four-person booths would give me a chance to sit beside Annie.

But Catherine was already moving,guiding Annie toward a round table by the window. "The lighting's much better here, don't you think? Perfect for discussing those new designs you were showing me."

I watched Annie slide into her seat, Catherine claiming the chair beside her before I could move. The waiter appeared with menus, and I took the seat across from Annie, trying to catch her eye.

"The duck here is exceptional," I said, leaning forward slightly. "It's prepared with a honey glaze that-"

"Annie, you have to try their seafood," Catherine cut in. "They do this amazing Chilean sea bass. It would pair perfectly with that project we were discussing."

At lunch, I tried bringing up the upcoming company retreat. "I was thinking about the team building activities..."

"Oh Annie," Catherine chimed in with an exaggerated gasp,"speaking of activities, you absolutely have to hear about my weekend in the Hamptons.Picture this - champagne, yacht parties..." Annie laughed, drawn into Catherine's animated storytelling while my own conversation starter died mid-sentence. I pushed the salmon around my plate, waiting for another opening. "Annie, how's the new project coming along?" I tried again, reaching for the salt shaker near her hand. "Oh! Allow me," Catherine swooped in, plucking it up with theatrical flair.She held it just out of my reach while pretending to season her own food first. "Perfect timing - Annie, you simply must tell me more about your vision for the Henderson account..."


My fork clinked against the plate as I set it down perhaps a bit toofirmly.Catherine caught my eye over her wine glass, her lips curving into a playful smirk. She was clearly enjoying this little game of keep-away

As we finished lunch, I watched Annie stirring her iced tea, my mind racing with both desire and frustration. Catherine's presence was suffocating - a constant, immovable obstacle between Annie and me. But more than that, her smug atttude was driving me crazy. Two birds with one stone,perhaps?

"I should head back to the office," I said casually, though my heart was pounding with anticipation of what I planned to do next.

"Oh, I'm off today," Catherine's sickeningly sweet voice cut in. "I can keep Annie company." Her eyes met mine in silent challenge, and something in me snapped.Perfect.

Annie shifted uncomfortably, her fingers nervously playing with her necklace."Well..."

My hand moved toward my glass, adrenaline coursing through my veins.One "accidental" spill would serve Catherine right for her interference, and give me a moment alone with Annie. The perfect crime. But Catherine wasn't as oblivious as I'd hoped. Justas my hand "slipped,"she smoothly sidestepped, a knowing glint in her eye. To my horror, the lemonade splashed across Annie's pristine white blouse instead. "Oh my!" Annie jumped up, her face flushing. "I need to clean this up.Excuse me." She hurried away from the table.

I watched Annie's retreating figure, mortified at how my plan had completely backfired.

"Well played," I growled, glaring at Catherine's satisfied expression.

Catherine took a delicate sip of her drink, her smile holding a hint of amusement that made my stomach turn. "You really thought you could outmaneuver me, didn't you?"

"Come now, Howard," shetook a delicate sip of her drink. "We both know what you were trying to do - get me out of the way to be alone with Annie.
Perhaps with a dash of revenge thrown in?"

I remained silent, my jaw tightening.

"Would you like to know why your little schemes always fail?" Catherine leaned forward,her voice taking on an almost intimate tone.

"Do tell," I replied dryly, trying to mask my discomfort.

"Love," she stated simply, her eyes locked on mine. "Your feelings for Annie are painfully obvious. Every look, every gesture... they give you away. And that,Howard,has become your weakness."

"Speaking of which," she continued, "how are things progressing between you two?" "That's none of your concern," I snapped. "Oh?" Catherine raised an eyebrow. "What if I told you I could help?" My pride screamed at me to tell her to get lost, but Annie's face flashed through my mind - that pained look when she'd rejected me, the way she d avoided my eyes. The memory still stung. And here was Catherine,dangling answers in front of me like bait...

After a moment's hesitation, I sighed. "I... I suggested taking our relationship beyond friendship. She turned me down. I still don't understand why."

"Fascinating," Catherine's eyes gleamed. "I could help you understand why.I'm quite good at reading people, especially women."

"Help?" I scoffed, though part of me was intrigued. "What's the catch?"

Her smile turned triumphant. "Simple enough. I want in on your game development department. I've heard some interesting things about your latest project."
###Chapter 43: New Friends

Lucy's POV

I remember the first time I met Penny. It was last week, when she came to our class as a new student. Her mommy had pretty red hair just like Ariel,and Penny was wearing a sparkly blue hairband that made her look like a princess.

Ms. Mitchell told her to sit at the empty desk next to mine. Most new kids look at me funny when they find out I don't talk, but Penny was different.She just smiled and whispered, "I like your butterfly necklace! It looks like it's about to fly away!"

That made me feel allwarm inside, like when Annie gives me goodnight hugs.During snack time that day, Penny shared her animal crackers with everyone, making funny voices for each cookie before eating them. Her lion cookies went "RAWR!" and her elephant cookies made trumpet sounds.She even left a giraffe cookie on my desk with a note that had a smiley face drawn on it.

Now, a whole week later, Ms. Mitchell was writing words on the big whiteboard. I like watching the letters appear - they look like tiny dancing friends holding hands to make words. Some kids were whispering and giggling, but I stayed super quiet, like always.

"Who can spell 'butterfly'?" Ms. Mitchell asked in her happy voice.

"Who can spell 'butterfly'?" Ms. Mitchell asked in her happy voice. Lots of hands shot up like rockets, with lots of "Me! Me!" but Penny's hand was the highest. Her pigtails were bouncing up and down like they were doing a happy dance too. They remind me of the ribbons Annie uses to tie my braids. Penny's been really good at spelling since her first day-she told everyone it's because she reads lots of storybooks with her mommy every night.

"B-U-T-T-E-R-F-L-Y!" Penny got it right! She's really good at spelling.When she gets something right, she doesn't act all show-offy like some kids do. She just smiles like sunshine.


After class, Penny came to my desk. Usually when kids come close, I get that icky scared feeling in my tummy. But Penny was different. She had a special kind of smile, like Annie's.


"Hi Lucy!" she whispered, like she knew loud noises sometimes make me jump. Then she did something super sneaky - she pulled a candy from her pocket! It was wrapped in pretty red paper that sparkled in the sun.

"It's strawberry flavored!" she said. "It makes your whole mouth happy!"

Dr. Marshall says it's okay to accept nice things from nice people. But candy still feels a bit scary, so I shook my head just a teeny bit. Instead of getting mad like other kids do, Penny just kept smiling!

"That's okay!" She put the candy back in her pocket like it was no big deal.Then her eyes got all sparkly. "Oh! Do you like Disney?"

Before I could even think about nodding, she started twirling around like a princess! "I know ALL the songs from 'The Little Mermaid'!" She tried to stand like Ariel on her rock, but she looked more like a baby duck learning to walk. It was so silly I couldn't help smiling!"Wanna play princess at recess?" She was bouncing like a happy bunny now. "The jungle gym can be our castle! I'm usually Ariel, but sometimes I'm Mulan 'cause she knows kung fu!" Then she started doing these funny kicks that made her almost fall over.It was the silliest thing ever! My smile got even bigger.
"We can pretend we're under a magic spell, just like Ariel when she couldn't talk!" Penny said.


That made my heart feel warm and fuzzy. Penny didn't think I was weird for not talking - she made it into a fun game instead!




When exercise time came, the sun was playing peek-a-boo with the clouds.
We all lined up on the playground like ducks in a row. Our gym teacher
was at te front, showing us how to stretch like tall trees.

Then the principal came rushing over like she was in a big hurry. She whispered something in our teacher's ear, and his face got all serious.She bent down to whisper something in our teacher's ear that made his happy face turn all serious and worried - the same way Uncle Howard's does when he gets important phone calls.

"Keep following the music, children! I'll be right back!" our teacher said in that fake-cheerful grown-up voice they use when something's wrong. Then he hurried away with the principal, their shadows dancing on the wall as they disappeared down the hallway.
The peppy exercise music kept playing through the big speakers,but everything felt different now. Tommy, with his wild orange curls that always reminded me of the carrots in Uncle Howard's garden,started doing robot moves instead of stretches, his arms moving all jerky like a broken toy. Emma and Jenny, the twins who always wore matching butterfly clips in their dark pigtails, huddled together in their special corner, giggling behind their hands and pointing at how silly everyone looked. David, whose glasses were too big for his face and kept sliding down his nose like a tiny sled on a snowy hill, spun in wobbly circles until he got so dizzy he almost crashed into the wall. His untied shoelaces flew around like jump ropes as he twirled.

Penny was right next to me, turning our normal exercises into a beautiful ballet dance. Her ponytail swished back and forth as she twirled,reminding me of the way Annie's hair moves when she's painting. Every few seconds, Penny would spin around to make silly faces at me - puffing out her cheeks like a chipmunk storing acorns, or scrunching up her nose like she'd smelled something stinky. A tiny bubble of laughter wanted to escape from my throat, but it got stuck like always.

"Lucy, watch out!" Penny shouted suddenly.

I turned around just as Max came running toward us, his face all scrunched up mean. But before he could reach me, Penny jumped between us, her arms spread wide like a shield.

"Leave Lucy alone!" Penny's voice was loud and brave, even though she was smaller than Max.


Brian, who was exercising nearby,saw what was happening and ran over too."Stop being mean, Max!" he said, standing next to Penny.

Max looked at Penny and Brian, then at all the other kids watching.His face got all red like a tomato, and he stomped away making angry elephant noises.

"Are you okay?" Penny asked me, her eyes big with worry.I nodded,touching my butterfly necklace from Annie. "Max is just a grumpy gus," Penny declared,going back to her silly exercises. "Let's pretend we're dancing butterflies instead!" She started twirling around, making her arms flutter like wings. Some other kids joined in, including Brian, though he said he wanted to be a dragon butterfly because that was cooler.

When we did our exercises again, I had Penny on one side doing her butterfly dance, making everyone giggle with her silly moves. She kept making up new animals to be - a jumping kangaroo, a wobbly penguin, a stretching giraffe. Each one was funnier than the last!

Later,when we lined up to go back to class, I touched my butterfly necklace from Annie. Penny was still making silly penguin waddles next to me, and I could feel giggles wanting to bubble up in my throat. Not just giggles - words too! Big words and little words, happy wwords that wanted to jump out and play with Penny's penguin sounds.

My throat felt tickly, like when you want to sneeze but can't. I opened my mouth a tiny bit, just to see what would happen. Nothing came out yet,but that was okay! Maybe tomorrow I could try making penguin sounds with Penny. Or maybe the next day I could tell her that her monkey faces are the funniest ever!
###Chapter 44: The Doll Therapy Plan

Annie's POV

I was reviewing children's psychological counseling materials on my tablet,trying to focus despite the lingering awkwardness from Catherine's visit.She'd been dropping by almost daily since our coffee chat last week, fuIl of questions about gaming industry insights. Today she'd spent nearly two hours discussing potential game concepts, brushing aside my suggestion that she try an entry-level position first to learn the basics. Her sudden interest in my work was flattering, but something about it felt..off.

Howard appeared at my studio door, carrying two wrapped boxes.My heart did that annoying little skip it had started doinglately,despite my firm resolution to keep things professional between us. His confession from the other night still echoed in my mind, making our every interaction feel charged with unspoken words.

"Still here?" he asked, his voice carefully neutral as he set the boxes on my desk. The forced casualness in his tone told me he was just as aware of our new awkwardness as I was.


"Catherine just left," I said, looking up from my research. "Another discussion about gaming projects. She's... very enthusiastic."

Howard's jaw tightened at the mention of Catherine, a muscle working in his cheek. "I've noticed she's been spendinga lot of time here latelY There was something in his tone that made me want to explain. "She seems genuinely interested in gaming, though I've suggested she start with actual industry experience first. It's not exactly a field you can just jump into..." "Especially with no background," Howard agreed, his expression unreadable. He gestured to the boxes, clearly wanting to change the subject."The dolls arrived. Want to see them?"

My heart quickened as I carefully opened the first package. Inside was an exquisitely crafted doll bearing Edward Parker's likeness - the gentle eyes,the warm smile, every detail captured perfectly. The second doll was equally remarkable, Mrs. Parker's elegant features rendered with the same care.


"What made you think of using dolls?" Howard asked,studying my reaction.


"Children often express themselves better through play," I explained,arranging the dolls carefully. "Especially after trauma. I thought if we started small..."


"With the dolls as a safe first step?"

I nodded. "And later,maybe we could add small two-way radios inside.Make them interactive, but in a way that feels naturaI to Lucy."

"For her to practice speaking?" Howard leaned against my desk,intrigued.

"Exactly. Building confidence gradually until she feels secure enough to talk to people she trusts." I bit my lip. "What do you  think?" "I think it's brilliant." His voice carried quiet conviction. "Whatever equipment you need, just let me know." He glanced at his watch."We should head to the school - it's almost pickup time." I carefully wrapped the dolls back up, already imagining Lucy's reaction to them. The drive to the preschool was quiet, filled with that same charged awareness that seemed to crackle between us lately. As we pulled up to the school, the playground was bathed in afternoon sunlight. Lucy was in the small garden with the same golden-haired little girl we'd noticed this morning. The girl was putting on quite a show, her pigtails bouncing as she twirled around the playground.

"Look, I'm Ariel without her voice!" she mouthed dramatically, before attempting an elaborate swimming motion that nearly sent her sprawling.She caught herself just in time, turning her stumble into an exaggerated bow that had Lucy's shoulders shaking with silent laughter.

Lucy tugged gently at my sleeve as we approached. "That's Penny," she whispered, so softly I had to lean down to hear. "She knows al the Disney songs..."

We watched as Penny transformed the playground into her personal stage,moving seamlessly from one Disney princess to another. Lucy remained her captivated audience, eyes bright with delight at each new performance.The other parents gradually collected their children, but there was no sign of anyone coming for Penny.

After nearly forty-five minutes, the playground had almost emptied. Penny kept performing, though I noticed her occasional glances toward the school gate. The teacher on duty was checking her watch with increasing frequency.

Finally, a harried-looking man in a rumpled suit rushed through the gate."Penny! I'm so sorry, sweetheart. The meeting ran late..."Watching him, I felt a familiar ache in my chest. How many times had Philip made similar excuses? The memory of Brian waiting alone at school flashed through my mind, but I pushed it away. This wasn't about my past-this was about Lucy finding her first real friend. Penny was mid-twirl as Belle when she spotted him. "Daddy!" She ran to him, still maintaining her princess persona even as she hugged him.

"Same time tomorrow, Lucy!" Penny called out with a theatrical wave. "TIl bring my tiara!"


Lucy gave a tiny wave back, her eyes following Penny until she disappeared into her father's car. I watched Lucy's face carefully,recognizing the mix of joy and anxiety there - the happiness of finding a friend warring with the fear of letting someone new into her carefully guarded world. It reminded me of those first tentative days when she'd started to trust me.


Even after Penny had gone, Lucy lingered by the garden gate. The afternoon sun caught her hair, and for a moment, she looked so much like the photos I'd seen of her mother that my breath caught. How far we'd come from those first silent days, and yet how far we still had to go.

Howard's presence beside me was a steady warmth, and I found myself grateful for his quiet support. Despite the awkwardness between us lately,we were united in this - in wanting to help Lucy heal.

"Ready to go home, sweetheart?" I asked gently.

Lucy nodded, but her expression remained wistful as we walked to our car.I could almost see the thoughts turning in her mind, weighing the desire to spend more time with her new friend against her lingering fears. Once settled in the backseat, she spoke up in her soft voice: "Can we stay a little longer tomorrow?" "To watch more of Penny's shows?" Howard asked, catching her eye in the rearview mirror. Lucy nodded, fingers playing with her butterfly necklace.

"What if we invited Penny to visit sometime?" Howard suggested.

Lucy's eyes lit up before uncertainty crept in. I reached back to squeeze her hand. "We can take it slow, sweetie. Whatever makes you comfortable."




After Lucy's evening therapy session, Howard brought out the dolls.Her reaction was immediate - recognition and longing flashing across her face before she shyly looked away.

Taking my hand, she led me upstairs to her room. I sat in the corner while she settled on her bed with the dolls, arranging them carefuly in front of her.

For a long moment, she just looked at them. Then, in a tiny voice: "I'm scared." Her fingers brushed Mrs. Parker's cheek. "Like at the hospital today..."

I remembered how she'd hidden behind Howard when we'd visited her grandparents at the hospital that morning, unable to face them despite clearly wanting to.

"Why are you scared, sweetheart?" I asked softly.

"That they won't like me anymore," she whispered to the dolls. "Because I hide." "Your grandparents love you very much," I reminded her gently. Lucy hugged the dolls close. "I love them too," she murmured. "Miss them. She curled up with the dolls until her breathing evened out in sleep.I covered her with a blanket, careful not to disturb the dolls still held protectively in her arms.


Howard was waiting in the hallway. The tenderness in his expression as he looked at Lucy made my heart flutter. One step at a time. I reminded myself.For now, this peaceful moment was enough - the first small victory in helping Lucy find her voice again.
###Chapter 45: You're So Nice to Me

Annie's POV

My heart raced as I approached EdwardI Parker's townhouse, the package of dolls heavy in my arms. Each step felt weighted with responsibility-these weren't just toys, but potential keys to unlocking Lucy's voice.Howard's hand brushed my elbow briefly as I hesitated at the door,the slight contact steadying my nerves.

Edward's face lit up with genuine warmth when he opened the door."Annie, Howard! What a wonderful surprise." His eyes crinkled with authentic pleasure as he ushered us in. "I've been hoping to hear more about Lucy's progress -Howard mentioned in his last email that she's been responding well to therapy."

As we settled in the sitting room, I noticed how he seemed more energetic than duringour previous visits, eagerly leaning forward in his chair. My hands moved as I explained the plan, demonstrating how we'd incorporate the two-way radios, showing how Lucy could use the dolls as a safe bridge between her silent world and the voices she longed to share.With each detail, I watched hope slowly kindle in Edward's eyes. Edward's eyes widened with delight as he reached for the miniature version of himself, examining every detail with growing amazement."
These are incredible!" he exclaimed, a broad smile spreading across his face."The craftsmanship is extraordinary. Lucy must love these."

His enthusiasm was contagious, and I found myself smiling as I explained,"We believe these dolls could help Lucy feel even more connected to you and Mrs. Parker. Children often express themselves more freely through play, and given how well she's been responding to creative therapy..." "You think this might help her feel more comfortable around us?" Edward's eyes sparkled with hope and enthusiasm. "I know she can't speak to us yet, but just seeing her respond to you both, watching her slowly open up..it gives me such hope."

"It's all about building on her progress," I explained, encouraged by his positive response. "The dolls can create a comfortable space for her to express herself. We've noticed that she's starting to communicate more with her new friend Penny, and we believe these dolls might help extend that progress to family interactions."


"That makes perfect sense," Edward nodded eagerly. "And the way you've captured our likenesses... it's like we could be right there with her,waiting patiently until she's ready." He chuckled warmly, though his eyes grew thoughtful. "I just want her to know we're here for her, however long it takes."

"She knows," Howard added gently. "We're helping her understand that she's loved and supported, that the accident and everything that followed wasn't her fault."

"Of course it wasn't," Edward said firmly, his voice full of grandfatherly love. "She was just our precious girl, excited about dolphins..." He smiled at the memory, though his eyes glistened slightly. "What matters is that she's healing now, thanks to you both. Even if she can't tell us directly, we can see the difference in her eyes."

"Which is why these sessions are so important," I pressed on, giving him a moment to collect himself. "The dolls can help her work through those feelings in a safe environment, surrounded by people who love her."

"Whatever you need," Edward straightened, that familiar Parker strength reasserting itself. "Just tell me how I can help." Catherine breezed into my studio in her usual afternoon visit, settling herself on the edge of my desk with practiced grace. Today, though, there was something different in her expression - a hint of calculated curiosity.

"Annie," she began, her tone deliberately casual, "I couldn't help but notice...things seem a bit tense between you and Howard lately. Is everything alright?"

I studied her for a moment, considering how to respond. The memory of Howard's confession still lingered, making every interaction with him feel charged with unspoken words. But Catherine's sudden interest in my personal life made me wary.

"Actually," I countered, meeting her gaze steadily, "I've been wondering something myself. How exactly did you convince Howard to let you join the gaming division? He's usually quite particular about experience requirements."

Catherine's fingers drummed once against my desk - a nervous tell I'd begun to notice. She reached for my water glass, buying time with a long sip. "Oh, you know how these things work..." she said vaguely,her usual confidence wavering slightly.

"No, I don't know," I pressed gently. "Why don't you tell me?" Her hand moved to her earring - another tell I'd spotted during our coffee shop chat. After a moment of uncomfortable silence, she suddenly brightened. "Oh! Speaking of office politics, you won't believe what happened in the dev team last week!" "Remember Jake from UI/UX?" she continued hurriedly, clearly relieved to change the subject. "Well, he and his girlfriend just broke up, and he actually demanded she repay him for everything he ever spent on her."

Despite my awareness of her deflection, I found myself drawn in by her animated storytelling."Everything?"

"Everything," she confirmed, leaning forward conspiratorially. "Down to a two-dollar bottle of water and a one-dollar piece of paper. Five years together, and his total expenses came to barely over a thousand dollars,while she'd spent over twenty thousand on him."

"That's..." I searched for a diplomatic response while processing this glimpse into office politics.

"Pathetic, right?" Catherine laughed, but there was an edge to it. "But wait,it gets better. He tried to win her back with flowers, and when she refused,he tried giving them to me instead!"

"And?"

"I turned him down flat. Knowing him, he'd probably try to bill me for them later." She rolled her eyes, but I caught the slight hurt beneath her bravado. "Then this new guy Joey took them and had the nerve to say I was just jealous. Me! Jealous of dollar-store flowers!"

Something in her tone made me reach for my tablet. "Sounds like you need better flowers," I suggested, pulling up a local florist's website. Catherine's carefully maintained sophistication cracked as I selected their most expensive rose arrangement. "Annie,you don't have to..." "Consider it a welcome gift to the gaming division," I smiled, completing the order and watching emotions play across her face. Without warning, Catherine's head dropped to my shoulder, her voice suddenly small.

"You're so nice to me," she whispered.

The moment stretched, raw and uncertain, until her phone buzzed. She jumped up, mask sliding back into place as she checked the time. "Oh! I'm late for a meeting. Thanks for the flowers, Annie.Really."

I watched her hurry away, thinking about how beneath her polished exterior was someone still trying to figure out who she wanted to be. The afternoon light was starting to fade - time to pick up Lucy.




The playground was bathed in golden late-afternoon light when we arrived. Penny was in full performance mode,spinning and swooping through an elaborate rendition of "Under the Sea." Her pigtails flew as she twirled, narrowly avoiding disaster with each enthusiastic movement.

"Look, I'm Sebastian!" she announced, scuttling sideways like a crab before launching into the song's chorus. Lucy watched from nearby, her usual tension melting away as she followed Penny's joyful chaos. I noticed how she'd begun to mirror some of Penny's movements.

Howard checked his phone with a sight frown. "Still no sign of her father?
I shook my head, watching the playground slowly empty as other parents collected their children. "School office says another late meeting."His protective instincts kicked in immediately. "Ill have my assistant coordinate with him. We can take them both home for now." The girs settled into the backseat, Penny's theatrical storytelling filling the car with warmth. Each tale earned a tiny smile or nod from Lucy - more response than I'd seen her give anyone her age.

"And then the princess had to be really brave," Penny was saying,gesturing grandly, "because sometimes being brave is scary but you do it anyway!"


I watched their interaction through the rearview mirror,noting how naturally they'd fallen into this friendship. But something about Penny's constant performance, her need to always be "on," made me wonder.

"Penny,sweetheart," I kept my voice gentle, "who usually picks you1 up from school? Besides your dad?"

The question seemed innocent enough, but Penny's endless stream of chatter suddenly stopped. Her hands, which had been painting stories in the air, dropped to her lap and began fidgeting with the hem of her dress.

Beside her, Lucy studied her friend's face with the kind of quiet understanding that came from knowing what it meant to carry hurt inside.Then, with unexpected courage, she reached over and took Penny's hand.
###Chapter 46:Sue Peterson

Annie's POV

I watched Lucy's shoulders tense as Thomas demonstrated the next exercise. But before her usual anxiety could take hold, Penny swooped in with her boundless energy.

"And now, we're all brave explorers climbing Mount Everest!" Thomas quickly adapted, transforming the mountain climber exercise into an adventure. His eyes darted between the girls,gauging their reactions.

Penny dropped to her hands and knees, crawling across the mat with exaggerated stealth. "Lucy, quick! I think I see a snow leopard!" She pointed at a yoga block, her voice dropping to a theatrical whisper that made Lucy's lips twitch upward.

The change in Lucy was subtle but unmistakable. Her movements,usually stiff with self-consciousness, began to mirror Penny's playful approach.Each time Penny added a silly flourish to the basic exercises, Lucy's shoulders relaxed a fraction more.


"Now we're swimming through the clouds," Thomas continued, leading them into arm circles. "Like the flying fish ín 'The Little Mermaid'!" Penny's face lit up. She launched ínto "Under the Sea," managing to stay surprisingly on beat despite her dramatic gestures. Her pigtails whipped through the air as she pretended to conduct an imaginary orchestra while maintaining the e xercise rhythm. Lucy's silent smile shook her small frame. I caught Thomas's eye,sharing his amazement at how naturally Penny had breached Lucy's carefully constructed walls. Even more remarkable was how Penny would pause between movements, waiting for Lucy to catch up, adjusting her pace without drawing attention to it.

Howard appeared in the doorway, the usual tension in his shoulders softening as he took in the scene. I forced myself to look away from how his rolled-up sleeves revealed strong forearms, focusing instead on Penny's voice.

"Did you see that. Mr. Thompson?" She called out between breaths."I'm teaching Lucy how to be a mermaid-tree-explorer!"

"I see that," Howard's voice carried unusual warmth. "You're quite the instructor."


Penny beamed with pride. "That's 'cause my mom says you gotta make everything fun," she explained, wobbling through a balance pose. "Even the hard stuff!"




Later, while Lucy changed clothes, I sat with Penny as her endless energy finally began to quiet. Her feet swung rhythmically against the bench,a steady drumbeat of contained motion.

"You really love performing, don't you?" I offered gently. "Mom and Dad took me to see 'The Little Mermaid' when I was four,"Penny's usual animation softened into something more wistful. "It was magical- all the lights and music and dancing. That was the last time we all went out together before..." Her feet stilled. "Now Dad's always busy with Clara and the new baby. He says theater tickets are too expensive anyway." She twisted the hem of her shirt. "Clara says I'm too loud when I practice my singing at their house."

My chest tightened atthe familiar pain in her voice. "That must be hard."

"Mom works really hard at her computer job so I can take dance classes,"Penny straightened slightly. "But when I stay at Dad's, I always miss the Saturday morning ones because Clara says they have other plans." Her shoulders hunched. "Dad just nods when she says that."

The echo of Brian's hurt during the early days of Philip's new relationship made my hands clench. I deliberately relaxed them before speaking. "Sometimes grown-ups don't handle changes very well."

"Mom says it's not my fault," Penny's voice grew very small. "But sometimes I think if I was quieter like Clara wants, maybe Dad would..."She shook her head, plastering on a bright smile that didn't reach her eyes."But it's okay! Lucy likes my performances. She never tells me to be quiet."

"You know what I think?" I matched her serious tone, watching her spine straighten. "I think you and Lucy understand each other perfectly.Sometimes the best friends are the ones who let us be exactly wvho we are."

Her answering smile was genuine this time. "That's what Mom says too!She says we shouldn't change who we are just because other people don't understand us." Howard offered to drive Penny home, his thoughtfulness catching me off guard once again. As we pulled up to their apartment building, I noticed a tall woman waiting outside. Her auburn hair was pulled back in a neat ponytail, and despite the late hour, her crisp blazer and pencil skirt spoke of the kind of polished professionalism I recognized from my da navigating corporate life. Though exhaustion showed in the slight tension around her eyes, she carried herself with quiet confidence.

Before any of us could speak. Penny tumbled out of the car, her energy somehow still boundless. "Mom! We did yoga but it was really exploring and Lucy smiled at my Ariel impression!"


"Tm Annie Baker," I stepped forward, extending my hand."And this is Howard Thompson. Penny and Lucy have become quite close."

"Sue Peterson," she shook my hand firmly, then Howard's. "I can't thank you enough for looking after Penny today. When the school called about my meeting running late..."

"It's no imposition," I kept my voice casual, remembering my own challenges as a single mother. "Lucy's really blossomed with Penny around.I could pick them both up after Penny's morning dance class tomorrow?They could spend the afternoon together."

"Tomorrow's Saturday!" Penny tugged at her mother's sleeve. "Please can I go play with Lucy again? Please?"

Sue's professional mask wavered, practicality warring with pride. "We really shouldn't impose..."

"Mom!" Penny persisted. "Lucy needs me. She's teaching me to be quiet sometimes, and I'm teaching her to be loud sometimes. It's a fair trade."

Sue's startled laugh caught in her throat. "Is that so?". "Plus," Penny added with pure child-logic, "Annie makes the best hot chocolate. With tiny marshmallows and whipped cream." "The secret ingredient is cinnamon," I stage-whispered, watching Sue's shoulders relax incrementally.

"Well." Sue's smile softened with genuine warmth, "who am I to argue with tiny marshmallows?" She checked her phone quickly. "The dance class ends at eleven tomorrow..."


"Perfect," I said. "TIl pick her up then."

As we drove away, Howard's fingers drummed thoughtfully against the steering wheel. "Sue Peterson," he broke our comfortable silence. "Top of her class at MIT, brilliant system architect. Making twice what her ex-husband does, but her current company's losing her because they won't offer flexible hours for school pickup."

I studied his profile, recognizing the particular set of his jaw that meant he was solving a puzzle. "Howard..."

"We've been looking to strengthen our development team," his fingers stilled on the wheel. "Someone with her expertise in secure systems...especially with the new government contracts coming up..."

"And the flexible hours?" I already knew his answer, but wanted to hear him say it.


"We have that parent-friendly initiative rolling out next quarter anyway."his casual shrug couldn't hide the satisfaction in his voice. "Might as well start with someone who'd make it worth the investment." Warmth spread through my chest at this glimpse of the man behind the CEO facade. "You're a good man." His quick glance carried more weight than his light tone. "I have my moments."
###Chapter 47: I Would Start Practicing My Witing
 Brian's POV

My hands gripped the cold iron bars of the Thompson estate gates,knuckles turning white as I watched Annie and Lucy in the garden. Lucy's arms moved in graceful arcs, perfectly mimicking Annie's butterfly pose from their exercise routine. A familiar ache spread through my chest -Annie used to read me stories just like she was doing with Lucy now.

"That's perfect, sweetheart!" Annie's voice carried through the evening air as she guided Lucy through what looked like a therapy session. The lttle girl responded by throwing her arms around Annie's neck, nearly toppling them both. My throat tightened as Annie caught Lucy, their shared laughter echoing across the lawn. I used to hug Annie like that too,before Sarah taught me it was wrong to love my "boring" mom.

A tall man emerged from the house-Howard Thompson. I'd seen him in Dad's business magazines. His usual stern CEO expression melted as he watched them.Something in the way he looked at Annie made my stomach twist - it wasn't the calculating way Dad looked at her when he wanted to manipulate her feelings.Lucy grabbed Howard's hand while reaching back for Annie, forming a perfect chain as they disappeared inside. A real family. A complete family.

My mind flashed back to the night everything changed. I'd asked Annie if she and Dad could get divorced, complaining about her making me eat special food while Sarah let me have McDonald's. I didn't understand then why she looked so hurt when she found my iPad with the "My Perfect Family" group chat. I was too excited about having Sarah as my "fun mom" who didn't care about my food allergies or health issues. I remember the morning after,how I'd thrown my special breakfast across the kitchen, screaming that Annie had ruined everything by disbanding my family group chat. How I'd hidden behind Sarah at school, pretending not to know my own mother when the teachers almost called the police.The memory of Annie's devastated face as I declared Sarah was my real mom now made me feel sick.


How many times after that had I rejected Annie's carefully packed lunches,demanding pizza like Max got to eat? How many times had I seen her trying to explain my allergies to Sarah, only to be dismissed as overprotective? How many times had I complained about Annie's "stupid rules" while she fought alone to keep me healthy?

My fingers unclenched from the bars, leaving half-moon imprintsin my palms. Now Annie had a new daughter who adored her, who didn't pull away from her hugs or throw tantrums when she tried to help with homework. She had a man who looked at her like she was precious,not an obligation. She didn't need the son who'd thrown her love back in her face.


"Mama," the word escaped in a broken whisper before I could stop it.

Behind me, the family driver shifted uncomfortably. "Shall we head back?"

I squared my shoulders,swallowing against the burning in my throat."Take me to Grandma Betty's instead."

Betty was father's mother. She wwas very fond of me. Grandma's fingers fumbled with her keys when she saw me on her doorstep. "Brian? What are you doing here,sweetheart?" I forced my lips into what I hoped was a normal smile. "I missed you,Grandma."

Her eyes narrowed, catching the tremor in my voice. "Have you eaten dinner yet?"

I shook my head, and she practically flew into action. "I'Il make your favorite noodles. Extra dumplings, just how you like them."

Following her into the kitchen, I watched her gather ingredients with practiced efficiency. Her movements were so like Annie's - the way she hummed while chopping vegetables, how she checked the water temperature with her wrist. The familiar gestures made something crack inside my chest.

"I miss Mama," The words burst out between sobs I couldn't contain anymore. "I miss her so much!"

Grandma's knife clattered against the cutting board as she rushed to wrap her arms around me. "Oh, sweetheart. We can call her right now, ask her to come see you-"

"She doesn't want me anymore!" My hands clutched at Grandma's sweater."She has Lucy now, and Howard, and they're happy without me!"

"That ungrateful woman!" Grandma's voice turned sharp. "After everything our family did for her, how dare she abandon her own son-"

"No!" I jerked away, surprising us both. "It's not her fault, Grandma. It's not..." My voice broke as I remembered Annie's face the day I'd told her I was going to live with Dad and Sarah. She'd knelt down to my level,hands trembling as she helped pack my favorite toys. *"Whatever makes you happy, sweetheart,"* she'd whispered, but now I understood the pain behind her brave smile.


"Grandma?" I tugged at her sleeve, desperate to change the subject before the memories overwhelmed me. "Could you maybe... get me a tutor?"

"A tutor?" She blinked at the sudden shift. "Whatever for?"

My fingers tracedl invisible words on the counter. "I want to study harder.Especially writing. I need to practice my writing."

Like the birthday cards Annie sent every year, carefully addressed in her beautiful handwriting. The ones I'd crumpled up without reading, too angry to see the love in every perfectly formed letter.




Dad's voice crackled through my phone later that night, distracted as always. "Are you coming home?"

"No." The word came out harder than I'd intended.

"Well, I have good news," he continued, not noticing my tone. "I bought Sarah and Max a new place. They've already mnoved out, so you don't have to worry about-"

My hand tightened arounad the phone. "You bought them a house? As a gift?"

"That's right." Pride colored his voice. "A nice penthouse on Pak Avenue." Something cold settled in my stomach as I remembered Annie's tin studio,crammed into the corner of our old living room. She'd complained, just made the most of the small space, hanging my draw alongside her work.

"Dad?" I kept my voice carefully steady. "Can I have a house too?"

"Of course, son!" His laugh was warm and generous - the laugh he used when he was in a giving mood. "Which one would you like? That new development in Tribeca is quite nice-"

"I want our old house." The words fell like stones between us. "The one where Annie and I used to live."


The silence stretched until I could hear Dad's breathing change. "Brian..."

"You never bought Annie anything," My voice cracked on the truth I'd been too young to see. "Not a car, not jewelry, not even that art studio she wanted. But you bought Sarah a penthouse."

"That's different-"

"Why?" The question burned in my throat. "Because you love Sarah more than you ever loved Annie?"

I hung up before he could answer, my hands shaking as I stared at Annie's number in my contacts. There were so many things I needed to tell her.That I was sorry. That I understood now. That I missed her sugar cookies and bedtime stories and the way she always knew exactly when I was pretending not to be scared of thunderstorms. But the words wouldn't come. Instead, I curled up in Grandma's guest bed,pressing my face ínto a pillow that still held traces of Annie's jasmine perfume from her last visit. Tomorrow, I decided as tears slid silently into the fabric, I would start practicing my writing. Maybe when I could make the letters as beautiful as Annie's drawings, I'd be brave enough to write down all the words stuck in my throat. Maybe then she'd understand that her first butterfly was finally learning to spread his wings.
###Chapter 48: It's a Big Day for All of Us

Howard's POV

I woke up early on Saturday morning. Since weekends were Lucy's break from physical therapy, I let hersleep in while I handled company emails.

At eight, I went to wake her. She'd curled up with her Parker dolls, and after washing up, emerged in her carefully chosen pink outfit.

"You have to stay home today," she told her dolls, adjusting their positions.
"We're going out, but I won't forget about you."

Once Annie joined us, I explained that I'd given the staff the day off. "It'll just be me driving today."

Lucy threw her arms around me. "So Howard, it'sgoing to be just us as a family taking Penny out?"

"That's right."

"Yay!" Lucy exclaimed. "It's been forever since it was just our family!"

Her words struck me - not just Howard and Annie as separate caretakers,but a family unit. Annie's eyes met mine, reflecting the same warm surprise I felt.

We drove to Brooklyn to pick up Penny. Sue Peterson looked startled when she answered the door, dressed professionally but clearly stressed. 
Howard's POV

I woke up early on Saturday morning. Since weekends were Lucy's break from physical therapy, I let hersleep in while I handled company emails.

At eight, I went to wake her. She'd curled up with her Parker dolls, and after washing up, emerged in her carefully chosen pink outfit.

"You have to stay home today," she told her dolls, adjusting their positions.
"We're going out, but I won't forget about you."

Once Annie joined us, I explained that I'd given the staff the day off. "It'll just be me driving today."

Lucy threw her arms around me. "So Howard, it'sgoing to be just us as a family taking Penny out?"

"That's right."

"Yay!" Lucy exclaimed. "It's been forever since it was just our family!"

Her words struck me - not just Howard and Annie as separate caretakers,but a family unit. Annie's eyes met mine, reflecting the same warm surprise I felt.

We drove to Brooklyn to pick up Penny. Sue Peterson looked startled when she answered the door, dressed professionally but clearly stressed. "I'm so sorry," she said, checking her watch. "There's an emergency at work-a system crash. I need to go in." "We'd be happy to take Penny for the whole day," I reassured her, exchanging a meaningful look with Annie.

Once Penny joined us, we headed to an indoor playground in Midtown at the girls' request. While they played, I noticed something immediately different about Lucy's behavior. Rather than staying close to Annie as usual, she followed Penny to the climbing structures. Several times,Lucy opened her mouth as if to speak, only to close it again, communicating through gestures instead.

Annie noticed too. "She wants to talk to Penny so badly," she murmured."You can see it in her face."

I nodded. "She's capable of speech - we know that - but something's still holding her back with peers."


After observing them, Annie turned to me. "I have an idea. What if we made a doll for Penny too? If Lucy can practice talking through a 'Penny doll' first, it might make the transition to speaking with the real Penny easier."


The idea immediately resonated. "That could work," I agreed. "Could you design something?"

Annie quickly sketched a design on her tablet - a doll with Penny's distinctive pigtails and bright eyes, captured in a mid-twirl pose that embodied her energy.

"Something like this," she explained. "We'd want to capture that spark Lucy responds to."

"I'll arrange for the doll to be made," I promised, "and take care of the communication system at the same time."

While Annie supervised the girls' lunch, I stepped away to call Susan Moore.

"Mr. Thompson?" she answered promptly.

"Susan, I need to order another doll," I said directly. "This one needs to resemble Lucy's friend Penny - Annie will send over the design. It should have the same two-way communication functionality as the Parker dolls."

"I'll make it a priority," Susan replied. "When would you need it delivered?"


"As soon as possible," I stated. "We're making significant progress with Lucy's therapy, and this could be an important next step."

"Understood. By the way, we've been in contact with Sue Peterson, as requested."

"Oh?"

"She was fired this morning after the system crash. Her company decided to 'restructure."


I wasn't surprised. "That company's leadership can't recognize talent when it's right in front of them."

"Several companies have approached her. After comparing offers, she's leaning toward accepting our position."

"Double her previous salary," I decided. "Make sure the flexible hours arrangement is explicitly stated in the contract."

After the call, I purchased three high-quality two-way radio sets,then drove to Edward Parker's townhouse. I explained about upgrading from voice recordings to two-way communication, demonstrating the radio system I'd brought.

"This will allow you and Mrs. Parker to speak directly with Lucy through the dolls," I explained.


Edward's hands trembled slightly as he held the device. "This means so much. To be able to hear her voice, to respond in real time..."

"It's just the next step," I said. "Eventually, once Lucy is comfortable with this communication, we'd like to arrange for you to visit her in person."

"Whatever she needs, at whatever pace works for her," Edward agreed eagerly.




When we returned to the estate, Lucy immediately headed for the stairs,eager to reconnect with her Parker dolls.

"Wait, sweetheart," I called1. "There's something special about your dolls I want to tell you about."

Lucy turned, curious. "What is it, Howard?"

I knelt to her level. "We've made some changes to your dolls. They have a speciaI device inside now that will let them talk back to you - really talk,not just play recordings."

"So if I say something to them... they'll actually answer what I ask?"

I nodded. "That's right. But remember, they're still dolls. The voices you'll hear are your grandparents speaking through them."

Her eyes widened. "My real grandparents? Not just recordings?" "Your real grandparents," I confirmed. "And we're making a special doll that looks like Penny, too. That way, you can practice talking to her even when she's not here."

Lucy's face lit up. "I want to try it right now!"

As Lucy bounded upstairs, Annie moved beside me. "You've been busy today,"she observed.

"Just keeping all the pieces moving forward," I replied. "Sue will be joining Howard Technologies with double her previous salary,Edward was receptive to the communication system, and the new Penny doll has been ordered."

Annie squeezed my hand. "You always handle everything so efficiently."

"I'm motivated by important outcomes," I said simply.

Together,we paused outside Lucy's bedroom door. Through the opening,we saw Lucy sitting cross-legged with the Parkerdolls before her.

"Grandpa?" she asked tentatively.

After a brief pause, Edward's voice emerged. "Yes, sweetheart, it's me."

Lucy gasped. "Grandma?" she tried next.

"I'm here too, darling," came the gentle response.

"This is amazing!" Lucy exclaimed. "Can you really hear everything I say?"

"We can hear you perfectly," Edward assured her. "And we've missed hearing your voice so much."


What followed was a flood of words from Lucy. She told her grandparents about her exercise routines, reading lessons, and friendship with Penny.With each sentence, her voice grew stronger.

"Annie helps me practice my letters every day," she was saying. "She never gets mad when I make mistakes, and she draws beautiful pictures for our stories." After a pause, she added, "She's really special to me. Sometimes...sometimes I pretend she's my real mom. Is that okay?"

Annie stiffened beside me, tears streaming down her face. I gently guided her away from the door.

In the hallway, I wiped her tears. "This is all because of you, Annie," I said softly. "Your therapy approach, your patience with her-you made this breakthrough possible."

Annie shook her head modestly. "We all did this together. The way you immediately supported the doll idea and made it happen so quickly...I couldn't have done it alone."

I watched her brush away the last of her tears. Something about this moment - seeing the results of our combined efforts -felt profoundly satisfying.While part of me had hoped for more after my confession,I realized that what we had built together was already extraordinary:a partnershíp centered around Lucy's healing that had created its own kind of intimacy.

"We make a good team," I said simply, and was rewarded with Annie's genuine smile. "Yes, we do," she agreed. Later, Annie glanced toward Lucy's room. "She wore herself out with all that conversation. I've never heard her speak so much at once." I nodded, feeling content with what we'd accomplished. "It's a big day for all of us."

Annie looked thoughtful for a moment. "Howard, you seem... different tonight. More at peace."


I considered her observation. "I think I am. Seeing Lucy find her voice,watching how far we've all come together - it puts things in perspective."

"How so?" Annie asked, her voice gentle.

"I'm grateful for where we are right now - all of us. There's no rush to change anything. This... what we have, it's working."

Annie's expression softened with what looked like relief. "I feel the same way.Goodnight.Howard."
###Chapter 49: Dave's Confrontation

Annie's POV

Monday mornings at Howard Technologies always carried a certain energy.
I'd just settled into my studio space when Catherine Morgan swept in without knocking, her designer heels clicking purposefully across the floor.

"Annie!" she exclaimed, dropping into the chair across from me. "You won't believe what happened over the weekend!"

I set down my tablet with a bemused smile. These impromptu visits had become routine. "Good morning to you too,Catherine."

She leaned forward conspiratorially. "Remember Joey that I told you about last time?"


I recalled our previous conversation. "The one who accepted those roses from the cheap guy?"

"Yes!" Catherine's eyes lit up. "Well, you won't believe what happened next.That cheap jerk asked Joey to help him pay back his ex-girlfriend!"

I blinked in surprise. "Wait, what?"

"I know!" Catherine threw her hands up. "Can you believe the audacity?Joey makes good money-she's saved over $200,000 through hard work.Did he really think she'd just hand it over because he asked?"

"That's.,. quite presumptuous," I agreed, finding myself drawn into her drama.

Catherine made a face of theatrical disgust. "And when she refused, he immediately threatened to break up with her." "Seriously?" I couldn't help my incredulity. "That's ridiculous."

"Right?" Catherine nodded vigorously. "But it gets worse! Joey actually paid him, and then-get this-he came to *me* asking for money!"

The story grew increasingly bizarre as Catherine detailed how the man had come to her after Joey paid, only to be soundly rejected. When she finished,she dramatically flung herself sideways, resting her head on my lap. The unexpected intimacy caught me off guard.

"Catherine?" I asked gently, noticing how her usual animation had suddenly dimmed.

"Mmm?" She looked up at me, her expressíon suddenly serious.

"Did something happen? You seem... different today."

Catherine sighed. "A friend confessed his feelings to me this weekend," she admitted quietly. "I turned him down."

I waited,sensing there was more.

"And now I'm wondering if I made a mistake," she continued, her voice smaller than I'd ever heard it. "Annie, what would you do if you were me?
11

The question caught me off guard. I considered my answer carefully "If it were me," I began slowly, thinking of my own complicated feelings toward Howard, "I'd probably turn him down too. After all, I just got divorced, my life is in pieces, and I'm trying to rebuild. I probably wouldn't deserve him right now." Catherine studied my face for a long moment before a mischievous smile tugged at her lips. "That's what I thought you'd say," she murmured,seemingly satisfied with my response.

She sat up abruptly, smoothing her suit and instantly transforming back into the polished socialite. "Well, I should let you work. Thanks for the chat,Annie!"




After work,Howard and I spotted Sue Peterson pacing anxiously near the entrance.


"Annie, Howard," she called, walking quickly toward us. "Could you take Penny to your place for a while? Something's come up that I need to handle."

Howard's gaze sharpened. "Is it about your ex-husband?"

Sue's surprised expression confirmed his suspicion before she nodded. "Yes,how did you-"


"Just an educated guess," Howard replied evenly. "What's happening?"

Sue ran a hand through her hair. "Dave's demanding to see Penny tonight.He claims I'm keeping her from him, which is ridiculous considering he rarely bothers to pick her up when he's supposed to."

Lucy emerged from the school building just then, spotting us and running toward me with a smile. She slipped her small hand into mine with the easy trust we'd built over these past months.

"I could join you," Howard offered, his tone matter-of-fact. "If anything happens, I can provide support." Sue hesitated, her gaze moving from Howard to me, clearly wondering if I'd be uncomfortable.

"Would that be a problem?" I asked gently, understanding her hesitation.

Sue bit her lip. "I wouldn't want to impose-"

"You wouldn't be," I assured her. "We'd be happy to help."

Relief washed over her face. "I would appreciate the backup," she admitted."Dave can be... difficult."

"Then it's settled," Howard stated with finality. "We'll accompany you."




An hour later, we were settled at a corner table in the restaurant.Howard had arranged for us to sit several tables away from where Sue would meet her ex-husband. Lucy and Penny sat beside me, studying the children's menu with serious expressions.

"I think this looks good," Penny pointed at a colorful pasta dish, her pigtails bouncing with enthusiasm.

Lucy nodded, her eyes brightening at the illustration.

While Howard helped the girls with their selections, I kept a discreet eye on Sue and Dave. Her ex-husband was conventionally handsome, but his aggressive posture and cold eyes reminded me uncomfortably of Philip during our worst arguments.


"What right do you have to keep Penny from me?" Dave's voice carried despite his attempt to keep it low.

"Maybe because you never show up for her," Sue replied firmly. "I've been busy with work," he snapped defensively.

"Aren't you unemployed now?"

Dave's face reddened. "That's temporary. I have prospects."

"The same prospects you've had for six months? Meanwhile, I'm working full-time while raising our daughter."


"I'm her father," Dave hissed. "I have rights."

"Rights you've barely exercised," Sue countered. "When was the last time you attended a parent-teacher conference? Or remembered what foods she's allergic to?"

"If you're going to be difficult, I'll take you to court."

Sue remained surprisingly calm. "Go ahead. The court will ask Penny who she wants to live with. They'll investigate which home environment better supports her development."

Dave's aggression faltered. He softened his voice, changing tactics. "Sue, be reasonable. I just want time with my daughter."

"Now you do," Sue replied coolly. "After months of broken promises.Do you know how many times Penny's waited for you? How many times I've had to explain that Daddy's not coming-again?"

Sue stood, clearly finished with the conversation. "I won't let you disrupt her life because you suddenly feel like playing father."

As she turned to leave, Dave grabbed her wrist. "We're not finished-"

Howard was on his feet immediately, his movement smooth and purposeful. I quickly engaged the girls in conversation to distract them.
 "Mr. Peterson," Howard's voice carried quiet authority. "I believe Ms.Peterson was leaving. You might want to release her wrist."

Dave looked up, startled. "This is a private conversation."

"It was," Howard agreed pleasantly, though his eyes remained cold. "Until you physically restrained someone. That crosses from 'private conversation'into 'potential assault."

Dave's grip loosened, and Sue pulled her arm away.

"Who are you?" Dave demanded, embarrassment mixing with anger.


"Howard Thompson." The name registered immediately with Dave,whose expression shifted from anger to calculation.

"This isn't your business, Thompson."

"I disagree," Howard replied evenly. "Ms. Peterson works for me now, and her well-being is certainly my business. As is ensuring Penny has a stable environment."


Howard turned to Sue. "Ready to leave?"

Sue nodded with evident relief. As they walked back to our table, Dave watched with barely contained fury.

Outside,Howard pulled Sue aside for a brief conversation while I helped the girls into the car. Through the window, I could see Sue nodding in response to Howard's words. When they joined us, Howard's expression was serious. "Dave will likely continue his harassment. He's clearly using Penny as leverage, particularly since Sue provides financial support to his new family." "What can she do?" I asked, concerned for both mother and daughter.

Howard outlined the security measures already in place at Sue's residence and at Howard Technologies. "The office has strict access controls,and your apartment has decent security. But remain cautious elsewhere."

"I could assign company security personnel," he added. "Given your role on our secure projects, it would be justified."

"Thank you," Sue said softly. "I don't know how to repay you both."

Howard shook his head. "There's no need. You're a valuable employee,and Penny's friendship has been significant for Lucy's progress."

As we drove away, I glanced at Howard's profile, struck by the quiet strength he'd displayed. Behind his matter-of-fact tone,I recognized what he tried to disguise - genuine care and protection for those he considered part of his circle.

*I'd probably turn him down too. I just got divorced, my life is in pieces...*My own words to Catherine floated back.

Howard had stepped in tonight without hesitation. And despite all my careful boundaries, I couldn't ignore the flutter in my stomach when Howard's gaze met mine. Maybe that was the most frightening part - not that I was drawn to him, but that I'd begun to imagine what it might be like to let someone in again.
###Chapter 50: Family.

Howard's POV

I tapped my pen against the quarterly reports, pleased that the gaming division-where Annie worked-had grown faster than I'd anticipated.The numbers confirmed what I already knew: bringing Annie on board had been the right decision, professionally and personally.


A knock interrupted my thoughts.

"Come in," I answered, automatically shifting into the controlled tone I used for business matters.


Susan Moore entered, closing the door with a soft click. "Mr. Thompson, I wanted to inform you that the therapeutic dolls you ordered for Lucy have arrived." Her expression shifted slightly. "The manufacturer mentioned something I thought you should know."

"Go on."

"They're inquiring if you'll need additional dolls in the future. Apparently,the workshop is facing some financial difficulties." Susan's voice remained professional, but I detected genuine concern. Her attachment to Lucy's progress had grown alongside everyone else's. "I'm not certaín at this point," I responded thoughtfully. "I should discuss that with Annie first. She's better positioned to assess Lucy's therapeutic needs." Susan nodded, then elaborated, "According to their representative,the small workshop might close down within months. They specifically wanted to check with you because once they shut down, these custom dolls won't be available anymore."

I leaned back in my chair, the beginnings of an idea taking shape. "Let's acquire their workshop."


"Sir?"

"Buy the workshop. Retain their craftspeople as well." The decision crystallized as I spoke. It was the most efficient solution.

Susan looked surprised. "Just for a few therapy dolls?"

I studied her for a moment. Susan was competent, but sometimes missed the broader strategic implications. "You need to think more strategically,Susan."


"In what way?" Her brow furrowed slightly.

"The natural progression is to develop merchandise-specifically dolls and educational toys based on Annie's characters." I laid out my reasoning methodically. "Rather than outsourcing manufacturing later, it's more efficient to own production capabilities now. Additionally, our publishing division will undoubtedly produce other successful children's books in the future."


The acquisition made perfect sense from both a business and personal perspective. The workshop could continue Lucy's therapeutic dolls while positioning us for future merchandise development.

 Susan nodded, her expression shifting from confusion to appreciation."T'll begin the acquisition process immediately." After Susan departed, I returned to the quarterly reports, but my thoughts had alreadyshifted to Annie's studio. It was time to discuss next steps. I found myself pausing at Annie's studio doorway, watching her work intently over her tablet. The sight stirred a complex mix of emotions -pride in how she'd grown from someone rebuilding their life into a confident professional, yet unease at what that growth might mean.

"Howard!" Annie looked up with a smile. "Perfect timing. I just finished the educational designs."

"The team is impressed," I said, keeping my tone measured. "The children respond well to your work."

"That's wonderful to hear."

"Actually, I'm here about something else - we'd like to develop merchandise based on your book characters." I watched her reaction carefully.

Her eyes lit up. "Really? That would be amazing. I've always imagined them as more than just illustrations."

After outlining the basics, Annie turned to her computer. "Look at this,"she said, pulling up her professional accounts. Her following had grown substantially, with parents sharing her work and industry figures reaching out about collaborations.

"Your audience is growing impressively," I observed.

"It still feels surrea1," Annie admitted, "For years, Philip dismissed my illustrations as a hobby. Now I'm getting messages from established publishers."


As she described her expanding opportunities, I studied her profile, struck by an uncomfortable realization. With her growing success and independence, what would keep her connected to Lucy and me? The thought created an unexpected hollow sensation in my chest.

"Thank you for believing in my work," Annie said softly. "I finally feel like I'm rebuilding something meaningful."

I nodded, concealing my internal conflict. "Your talent was always there-it just needed the right opportunity."

What I didn't say: And now that you're finding your wings, I wonder if you'll fly away.




I instructed my driver to take Annie to pick up Lucy from school while I headed to Edward Parker's Upper East Side townhouse. The evening traffic crawled through Manhattan as I mentally rehearsed what I'd say.Annie and I had agreed this morning: Lucy's progress warranted reintroducing her grandparentsinto her daily routine-a calculated risk that could accelerate her recovery or potentially disrupt it.

The door swung open. Edward's eyebrows shot up when he saw me, his hand tightening slightly on the doorframe.

"Howard,"Edward greeted me. "Is everything alright with Lucy?"

"Everything's fine. I have something to discuss regarding Lucy's therapy. Inside, I explained our plan directly. "Based on your daily communications through the doIls, we believe it's time to reintegrate you into Lucy's daily life. We'd like you to stay at the estate."

 Edward's hand moved to steady himself. "You mean... live there? With Lucy?"

"She can communicate through dolls when needed or interact directly when comfortable."


I'd barely finished speaking before Edward called up the stairs."Eleanor!Eleanor,come down,please!"


Mrs. Parker appeared at the top of the staircase, elegant even in her casual home attire. "What is it,dear?"


"Howard has suggested we stay at his estate, to be near Lucy,"Edward explained, his voice catching slightly. "As part of her therapy."


Understanding dawned immediately on Mrs. Parker's face. Without hesitation, she turned toward their bedroom. "I'll start packing immediately. Just essentials, of course."

"Should we pack right now?" Edward asked, looking back at me.

"If you're available, yes. Lucy will be finishing her evening routine soon.and Annie thought it might be easier if you were there when she wakes tomorrow."


The elderly couple moved with surprising efficiency,returning shortly with modest luggage containing just their personal necessities. I helped carry their bags to my car, stowing them carefully in the trunk.

Navigating through evening traffic, I caught glimpses of the Parkers in my rearview mirror. Their clasped hands and synchronized movements spoke of a connection forged through decades-exactly what I found myself wanting with Annie My grip tightened on the steering wheel as I made a decision. "A personal question," I said during the drive. "What's the most effective approach when pursuing someoe you've developed feelings for?"

"You mean Annie, don't you?" Mrs. Parker responded.

I smiled slightly. "Yes."

"Demonstrate reliability and consistency," she advised. "Show her that life with you provides security."

"Show vulnerability occasionally," Edward added. "Annie has remarkable empathy-she'll naturally want to comfort you."

"When selecting gifts, include something for Lucy," Mrs. Parker suggested."If questioned, simply say you thought of her."

"The most important thing." Mrs. Parker concluded as we approached the estate gates, "is patience. Annie's been through significant trauma with her divorce. She'll need time to trust again."

Approaching the estate, my breath caught when I glimpsed Annie and Lucy through the windows. They bent together over Lucy's art supplies,Annie's hand guiding Lucy's smaller one. Something primitive and protective surged through me-a visceral need to safeguard what we'd created here.


"Your advice is appreciated," I said, parking with more force than necessary. "And your participation in Lucy's therapy."

Edward touched my shoulder briefly. "Family supports each other,Howard. And it seems to me we're all becoming family,aren't we?"

*Family.* The word echoed in my mind as I carried their luggage inside.After years of coldly efficient business relationships, Lucy and Annie had reintroduced me to a concept I'd dismissed as irrelevant to my life.
###Chapter 51: A Bridge Built with Dolls

Annie's POV

Through the living room's windows. I watched Lucy and Penny on the lawn while explaining our latest therapy approach to Sue. Lucy moved through her exercise routine with careful precision, while Penny demonstrated her newest dance steps nearby.

"We're developing à specialized approach," I said, spreading the sketches across the coffee table. "The idea is to create a doll that resembles Penny.with the same two-way communication system we've been using with the Parker dolls."

Sue leaned forward, her eyes bright with interest. "That's brilliant.Penny would be thrilled to be part of Lucy's therapy." She glanced out at the girls.
"She's already become quite the interpreter at school. The teachers tell me she instinctively knows when Lucy needs help expressing herself."

I nodded,watching as Penny attempted to teach Lucy a twirl. "Their friendship has been instrumental in Lucy's progress. The way Penny naturally adapts to Lucy's communication style is remarkable."


"It goes both ways," Sue smiled. "Penny's never had such a close friend before.She-" She paused as the sound of tires on gravel caught our attention. Howard's car pulled up to the circular driveway, and I felt my chest tighten as I recognized Edward and Eleanor Parker in the back seat. The moment we'd been preparing for had arrived. "Lucy, Penny," Howard called as he helped the elderly couple from the car.His voice carried that particular gentleness he reserved for important moments. "Come meet Mr. and Mrs. Parker." I watched Lucy's transformation with the careful eye of both therapist and caregiver. Her breathing shifted from the steady rhythm of exercise to something shorter and more controlled. Each step toward her grandparents was measured, her hands clasped tightly in front of her.
Edward's entire body seemed to gravitate toward Lucy, though he maintained the careful distance we'd discussed. I recognized that barely-contained longing; it was the same ache I felt whenever I caught sight of a little boy who reminded me of Brian.
Penny, bless her heart, broke the tension with her natural exuberance."
Want to see my new dance routine?" She was already spinning,her pigtails flying. "I've been practicing!"

Eleanor's careful composure melted into genuine delight. "We'd love to see it.dear."
As Penny launched into an impromptu performance, I noticed Lucy's fingers twitching slightly, unconsciously mimicking the dance moves. But when Edward took a step closer, she suddenly bolted toward the house.Her footsteps echoed on the stairs as she retreated to her room.

Eleanor's face feIl as Lucy disappeared upstairs. "Did we push too hard?Perhaps we should give her more time-"

"Wait," I touched her arm gently, recognizing the pattern from our therapy sessions. "Lucy's not running away. She's probably heading to her room to use the intercom system - it's become her safe space for difficult conversations." Sure enough, the intercom light blinked on moments later. Lucy's voice came through with that particular strain I'd learned to associate with her pushing past her comfort zone. "I'm sorry. I just...I couldn't..." "There's nothing to be sorry for," Edward assured her,though his hands gripped his knees hard enough to wrinkle his perfectly pressed slacks."But I want to talk to you!" Lucy's words burst forth with unexpected intensity. "I try so hard, but sometimes the words get stuck, and I feel like I'm disappointing everyone."

"Lucy," Eleanor's voice wavered slightly, "you could never disappoint us.Not being able to speak sometimes doesn't make you any less precious to us."


"But what if I never get better?" The fear in Lucy's voice was raw,familiar.
"What if I'm always broken?"

"You're not broken, sweetheart," Edward's words carried the weight of absolute conviction. "You're just finding your own way to communicate.And that's perfectly okay."

The sound of small feet on stairs drew our attention. Lucy descended step by careful step, her Parker dolls clutched protectively against her chest. Her face held the same expression I'd seen in the mirror countless times-the look of someone gathering every ounce of courage they possessed.

With deliberate care, she placed one doll beside Edward and the other next to Eleanor. Then, in a voice that barely disturbed the air but shook our world nonetheless, she said, "Grandfather?"

Edward's hand flew to his mouth, his shoulders shaking with suppressed emotion. Eleanor's fingers found his other hand, their shared grip white-knuckled with the effort of holding themselves together.

"I wanted to find you earlier," Lucy continued, each word precise and carefully formed. "But I was scared... scared that not being able to talk would make you sad. Make you not want me."

Eleanor opened her arms, and Lucy hesitated for just a heartbeat before stepping forward.

"We love you exactly as you are, sweetheart," Eleanor said, her voice gentle. "Whether you speak a thousand words or none at all, you're our precious granddaughter."

Edward joined them, his voice rough with emotion. "We're so proud of you,Lucy.So very proud."

Lucy's small fingers clutched at her grandmother's sweater, and I caught a glimpse of her profile-the subtle relaxation in her shoulders that I'd learned to recognize as trust. This was another breakthrough, another step forward in her healing journey.

My phone vibrated in my pocket, breaking the moment. Philip's name on the screen sent an immediate surge of tension through my body.I remembered our last conversation at the café-how I'd finally spoken my truth, how I'd walked away feeling lighter than I had in years.

My first instinct was to decline the call. I'd made my position clear during our last meeting. But something about witnessing Lucy's courage today-watching her face her fears and overcome them-resonated within me.

After everything we'd accomplished today, I felt more centered,more certain of who I'd become. The woman who had once bent herself into impossible shapes to please Philip was gone. In her place stood someone stronger, someone who could face this final ghost from her past without being haunted by it.

I stepped into the hallway, away from the tender family scene unfolding in the living room, and answered the call, "Philip."

"Annie, I need to see you again." His voice carried that familiar note of urgency that used to send me rushing to solve whatever crisis he'd created.

I took a breath and considered what the therapist in me recognized-that clean breaks were better than ragged edges, especially when a child was involved. "Fine," I said, keeping my voice steady. "Text me where we're gonna meet."
I ended the call before he could respond.
###Chapter 52: Cold Coffee

Philip's POV

My finger hovered over the "approve" button for another acquisition deal when Sarah's ringtone interrupted-that pretentious classical piece she'd insisted on setting herself. I caught myself hoping it would go to voicemail.a new reaction that made me pause. When had I started dreading her calls?


"Philip?" Her voice trembled with carefully crafted vulnerability."Something terrible happened this morning."
I pinched the bridge of my nose, exhaustion seeping into my bones."What is it now,Sarah?"
"Your mother-Betty-she came to my apartment this morning." Sarah's voice cracked perfectly on cue. "She just started attacking me, saying the most horrible things about how I'm poisoning Brian against his family."
My fingers drummed against the mahogany desk, a habit I'd developed during particularly trying board meetings. "What exactly did she say?"
"She threatened me, Philip! Said I needed to stay away from Brian,that I was a bad influence." Sarah's sob caught in her throat. "I'm in such a fragile state right now... what if this affects my relationship with the children?"

The word 'fragile' grated against my nerves. Before, Annie had managed our entire household while supporting my startup dreams, never once claiming fragility despite the genuine struggleswe faced.

"I'll talk to my mother," I replied mechanically, already drafting a mental script for that conversation.

"You don't understand how hard this is for me," Sarah pressed, her voice taking on that particular wheedling tone that had once seemed charming."With Robert's continued harassment, and now your mother..."

"I said I'll handle it." The words came out sharper than intended.

After ending the call, I sank into the leather couch by the window,letting my head fall back against the cool material. When had Sarah's voice become so... grating? The realization struck me: it wasn't her voice that had changed, but my perception of it.

Every conversation now followed the same pattern-Sarah encountering some crisis, requiring my intervention, leading to family tension that I needed to smooth over. The cycle was exhausting, yet somehow familiar.Then it hit me: this was exactly what Annie had accused me of during our divorce-creating constant drama that required her emotional labor to resolve.




I found myself absently straightening the family photo on my desk-the one from six years ago, with Annie and Brian at his kindergarten graduation. A habit I thought I'd broken. The sight of Annie's genuine smile in that photo twisted something in my chest. She'd never needed an audience for her devotion to our family, never turned every minor incident into a three-act drama requiring my intervention.

Even during our worst arguments, she'd maintained her dignity. She'd never weaponized tears or manipulation, never played the victim. The contrast with Sarah's behavior this morning was stark and uncomfortable.

The intercom buzzed, my secret's voice cutting through my reverie."Mr.Baker, your mother is on line one."

I reached for the phone, bracing myself. "Mother."

"Philip." Betty's voice carried that particular tone of disappointment she'd perfected over the years. "I assume Sarah's already given you her version of events?"

"She said you confronted her at her apartment-"

"Confronted?" Betty's laugh was sharp. "I simply expressed concern about Brian's recent behavior. That woman has him parroting the most awful things about Annie."

I shifted in my chair. "Sarah's going through a difficult time-"

"Oh, spare me." Betty's patience clearly had its limits. "Sarah's 'difficult time' seems to consist mainly of shopping sprees and manipulating my grandson. Meanwhile, Brian is the one truly suffering."

"Mother-"

"No, you listen to me, Philip. Brian is your *son*. Your actual, flesh-and-blood child." Betty's voice softened slightly. "You know, I never truly appreciated Annie until she was gone. She never complained, never tried to come between you and Brian. Do you remember how she used to make those special healthy snacks he loved, even when you were barely breaking even with the company?"

The memory hit hard-Annie in our tiny kitchen, carefully preparing Brian's allergy-safe treats while I worked late into the night. She'd never once mentioned how tight our budget was, never complained about the sacrifices she made.

"I'll talk to Sarah," I promised weakly.

"That's not enough anymore, Philip." Betty's sigh carried years of maternal concern. "You need to really think about what's best for Brian. And for yourself." The credit card statements landed on my desk with the weight of an accusation. Each page I turned revealed another of Sarah's extravagant purchases-designer bags,jewelry, furniture. The total made my throat tight:nearly two million dollars in three months. The same amount Annie had once suggested we invest in Brian's education fund.
My hands shook as I reviewed the charges. Designer boutiques,jewelry stores,high-end furniture-a steady stream of extravagant purchases that dwarfed our household expenses during my entire marriage to Annie.
Annie, who had furnished our first apartment with carefully chosen second-hand pieces. Who had insisted on saving for Brian's education before buying herself new clothes. Who hadsupported every one of my business ventures without ever demanding compensation for her sacrifices.
The contrast was nauseating. While Annie had helped build our life from nothing, Sarah was systematically draining resources without contributing anything of value. The realization hit me with the force of a physical blow:I had traded substance for shadow, reality for illusion.
My fingers were already dialing Annie's number before I fully processed the decision.
Twenty minutes later, I sat at an upscale café downtown. I'd chosen it for its exclusivity, the kind of place I thought would impress Annie. But watching her walk in-steps measured, head high, that familiar hint of jasmine in her wake-I realized how little I truly understood her. She'd never cared for pretense, had she?

I pushed a menu toward her. "They have excellent coffee-"

"I don't drink coffee anymore." Annie's voice was neutral. "The caffeine interferes with my creative work."

The simple statement hit like a sledgehammer. After six years of marriage, I couldn't even remember such a basic preference. Had I ever really known her at all?

"I made a mistake," I bluarted out. "Divorcing you. I see that now."

Annie's laugh held no humor. "Really? You're only realizing this after Sarah's shown her true colors?"

"It's not about Sarah-"

"No, it's about you." Annie's eyes met mine directly. "You're an abuser,Philip. A sophisticated one, but an abuser nonetheless. You didn't hit me or scream at me. You just slowly, systematically destroyed every part of me that didn't fit your ideal image."

"That's not-"

"You undermined my confidence, dismissed my art as a hobby, isolated me from friends who might have helped me see the truth." Annie's voice remained steady. "And now that your new relationship isn't providing the comfort and validation you crave, you think you can just come back?"

I stared at her, truly seeing her for perhaps the first time."Annie-"

"I have a good life now," she continued. "I have work that fulfills me,people who value me, and most importantly, I finally understand my own worth. I wouldn't trade that for anything, least of all your belated regrets."

"I have a good life now," she said firmly. "I agreed to meet today because I want to be clear: stop reaching out to me. I'm not interested in your regrets or explanations."

She stood, gathering her bag. "You know what's ironic? You're not actually missing me - you're missing having someone who would sacrifice everything to make your life easier. But I'm not that person anymore."I have a good life now," she said firmly. "I agreed to meet today because I want to be clear: stop reaching out to me. I'm not interested in your regrets or explanations."
She stood,reaching for her wallet. "You know what's ironic? You're not actually missing me - you're missing having someone who would sacrifice everything to make your life easier. But I'm not that person anymore."She placed several bills on the table, more than enough to cover both drinks."Consider this the last transaction between us."
I watched her walk away, somehing ugly and desperate clawing at my chest. The truth of her words burned like acid: I hadn't been thinking about Annie's happiness or growth, only about reclaiming what I'd carelessly thrown away.
The bills she'd left seemed to mock me - a final, stinging reminder that she no longer needed anything from me, not even the hollow gesture of paying for her coffee.
###Chapter 53: Slow Progress

Howard's POV

The private dining room's soft lighting couldn't mask Lucy and Penny's excitement as they entered. I straightened my already perfect cuffs,a habit from business meetings when I needed to maintain control. Seven place settings, one elegant cake, and a carefully curated menu-all arranged with the precision I applied to acquisition deals.

"Wow!" Both girls exclaimed simultaneously as they spotted the cake.

"You two should make a wish," I said, my voice softening in that particular way it did only around Lucy-and increasingly, around Annie.

The girls exchanged conspiratorial looks beforeleaning toward the candles.Lucy's expression shifted to one of intense concentration.

After extinguishing the candles, Penny threw her arms around Lucy. Their spontaneous celebration sent a strange pang through my chest-a recognition of childhood joy I'd never experienced myself.

"Time to eat, girls," Annie called, her tone warm yet authoritative. The dimple that appeared on her left cheek signaled genuine happiness.

Lucy settled beside Annie, her eyes repeatedly drifting toward the caramelized apple pie à la mode. I watched her internal debate play across her face before she turned toward me instead.

"I'd like some of the apple pie. Could you get some for me?" Her voice carried no trace of the hesitation that had marked her speech just weeks ago.

"Of course," I replied, feeling an unexpected surge of satisfaction as I served her. Only when she winked at Annie, silently mouthing "Mom,please eat!" did I understand-she'd deliberately avoided interrupting Annie's meal. Her thoughtfulness matched Annie's own-another quality they shared despite no biological connection.
I limited my contributions to the conversation, analyzing the group dynamics instead.
"Lucy," Edward addressed his granddaughter, "I understand you've been practicing a new exercise routine. How are you finding it?"
As Lucy enthusiastically described her progress, I noticed Eleanor's assessing glances between Annie and me, while Annie unconsciously mirrored Lucy's animated gestures. My fingers tapped a silent rhythm against my knee as I observed the group,feeling unexpectedly part of something that resembled a family.



Later, as we walked to our vehicles, I felt Edward's hand rest briefly on my shoulder-a gesture that would have triggered immediate discomfort from most people. Yet from him, I found myself accepting it without the usual tension.

"We'll see you back at the house," he said, his eyes conveying both trust and subtle assessment.

In the car, I caught Annie watching Sue's vehicle ahead of us,her expression contemplative.
"Does it bother you that I'm driving Sue home?" The question escaped before I could properly evaluate its strategic value.
Annie turned toward me, her brows drawing together in genuine confusion.
"Why would it bother me?"

Her response confirmed what I'd suspected but hoped wasn't true-no hint of possessiveness or interest beyond friendship. My fingers tightened imperceptibly on the steering wheel as I concealed my disappointment.

"You're right," I conceded simply, adjusting my expectations. Unlike business matters where progress could be accelerated through strategic pressure, emotions followed their own unpredictable timeline-a reality I found increasingly difficult to accept.
The silence that followed wasn't uncomfortable, though.

At Sue's apartment building, I scanned the surroundings with practiced efficiency, mentally noting security concerns that needed addressing.
"Thank you both for everything," Sue said, her professional demeanor softening slightly. "The dinner was lovely, and Lucy seems to be making remarkable progress."

"The progress is mutual," I replied, watching Penny help Lucy adjust her coat. "Lucy benefits greatly from your daughter's friendship."
After they entered the building, I conducted one final security assessment before returning to the car. Annie had settled deeper into her seat, her gaze fixed on the passing cityscape, lips slightly pursed in the expression she wore when mentally sketching new illustrations.



As we pulled through the estate gates, my phone vibrated with Catherine Morgan's name on the screen. The timing was unusual enough to warrant immediate attention.

"Would you mind keeping Lucy company while I take this?" I asked Annie. "It shouldn't take long."

Annie nodded, already shifting toward where Lucy waited in her nightgown, small fingers clutching her favorite book. "Take your time.We have storytime anyway." 
In my study, I accepted the call. "Catherine. This is unexpected."

"Howard!" Her voice carried its characteristic animation. "I hope I'm not interrupting anything important. I had the most fascinating conversation with Annie today at work and I thought you should know about it."
I moved to the window, positioning myself to observe the driveway while maintaining privacy. "Go on."
"We were discussing relationships-hypothetically,of course-and Annie said something quite revealing. When I asked what she would do if someone confessed feelings for her, she said she'd probably turn them down."
My jaw tightened, the muscles contracting in the same way they did during hostile takeover discussions. "Did she give a reason?"
"That's the interesting part," Catherine continued. "She said,'I just got divorced, my life is in pieces, and I'm trying to rebuild. I probably wouldn't deserve him right now."
So Annie's hesitation wasn't rejection based on lack of interest, but rather her assessment of timing and self-worth. This aligned with what I'd observed-her focus on establishing independence after her divorce.
"I see," I said finally. "Thank you for sharing this, Catherine."

"Aren't you going to ask about the 'him' she mentioned?" Catherine prompted.

"No," I replied simply. "If Annie wishes to discuss that with me directly,she will."

After ending the call, I remained at my desk, fingers steepled beneath my chin. The financial reports before me blurred as I considered what Catherine had shared. By eleven, I'd relocated to the living room,occupying the leather armchair where Annie typically joined me for evening conversation.I found myself checking my watch with unchaacteristic frequency, conscious of a growing restlessness I rarely experienced in business contexts.
Footsteps in the hallway prompted an immediate straightening of my posture, but instead of Annie, Edward Parker appeared carrying tea. The subtle disappointment I felt was instantly concealed.
"Chamomile," he explained, extending a cup. "Eleanor insists it helps with sleep,though I find the conversation that accompanies it more effective than the tea itself."

I accepted with a nod, recognizing the diplomatic approach. Edward's positioning-centered in his chair, hands relaxed but attentive-signaled preparation for significant conversation.

"She's helping Lucy fall asleep," Edward said, addressing my unspoken question. "They're reading that new book about the butterfly adventures.You have work tomorrow-perhaps you should rest early."
I remained silent, thinking about how much Lucy had improved since the Parkers' arrival. Her speech had become noticeably clearer, especially when interacting with multiple people. The benefits to her development made any small disruptions to our routines worthwhile.

Eleanor Parker appeared in the doorway.

"Annie promised Lucy the evening," Eleanor stated with precision. "She certainly won't sneak away after Lucy falls asleep to meet with you. Unless.


The calculated pause activated my full attention. "Unless?"' Eleanor's eyes held mine with the directness I'd seen in seasoned negotiators. "She's already fallen in love with you."
The blunt assessment hung between us like a proposed merger term.I didn't waste energy denying the implication about my own interests-inefficient when dealing with astute observers.
"That's not yet the case," I acknowledged, my tone matching the factual nature of quarterly earnings reports.
Edward nodded, his expression carrying the patience of someone who'd navigated complex family situations for decades. "There's an old saying:haste makes waste."

Eleanor settled beside her husband, her posture shifting slightly to signal a transition to more sensitive subject matter. "By the way..." she began, her tone recalibrating. "Annie has been married before. If you truly decide to be with her, you'll inevitably face strong opposition from certain people."
She leaned forward incrementally-just enough to signal importance without creating confrontation. "I must ask you... are you prepared to face all of that?"

I'd already thought through the potential complications. My mother would certainly disapprove and try to intervene again. The board might raise concerns about an employee relationship. The financial media would question Annie's motivations and my judgment.

None of these obstacles seemed insurmountable.

"Absolutely," I responded with the certainty I typically reserved for acquisition announcements.

"Then take it slowly," Edward advised, his tone warming. "Eventually,you'Il win Annie's heart." "I will." I promised.
###Chapter 54: Brian's Letter

Annie's POV

I found a letter from Brian in my mailbox. My heart instantly tightened at the sight of that familiar childish handwriting. I stood frozen in the hallway, memories flooding back to that day of betrayal-the "Perfect Family" group chat on the iPad, Brian declaring Sarah was his "real mom,"his small angry face as he screamed that I had ruined everything.

Part of me wanted to tear it open immediately. But another part-the part that had painstakingly rebuilt my life-hesitated. What could he possibly say that would heal those wounds? What apology could erase him telling me he hated me, that I wasn't fun like Sarah?

"Annie?" Lucy called from inside. "Are we going to school soon?"

Her voice anchored me to the present. This life with Lucy and Howard was my reality now, not the past that Brian's letter represented.With sudden resolve, I tossed the unopened letter into the corner of my bedroom. It belonged to the past, and I was building a future.

"Coming, sweetheart," I called back, composing myself.




In the car, Lucy sat on my lap, chattering about her plans with Penny "We're going to be butterfly explorers," she explained excitedly. "We'll make maps of the playground and find all the hiding spots." "Grandpa Edward will heIp us make explorer hats," she continued, "and Grandma Eleanor promised butterfly patches for our backpacks." The easy way she mentioned her grandparents warmed my heart.The Parkers had transformed Lucy from a selectively mute child to this expressive little girI who formed connections easily.

Lucy suddenly paused, her expression turning serious. "Of course, I love Mommy too."


The title no longer stung. Unlike Brian's conditional love, Lucy's affection was pure and freely given. I kissed her forehead gently.

"Mommy loves you too," I whispered. This unexpected bond had become precious beyond measure.

From the driver's seat, Howard turned with curious eyes. "What about Daddy? Don't you love Daddy too?"

"Love, love, love," Lucy replied with obvious reluctance. "Of course I love Daddy very much."


I suppressed a smile at Howard's satisfied expression. For someone with limited emotional experience, his love for Lucy was remarkably transparent.The intimidating CEO completely melted around this little girl.




At the preschool, Lucy scanned the entrance for Penny. When she spotted her friend, her face lit up completely. She leapt from my lap,running to embrace Penny with uninhibited joy.

As I turned to leave, a man and woman suddenly blocked my path.I stepped back instinctively, moving closer to Howard. "Who are you?" I askeddirectly. "We're Brian's tutor and driver," they answered, not bothering with names.Typical Philip,treating employees as faceless tools. Despite our fractured relationship, concern flickered through me. "How can I help you?" "This isn't a conversation for the sidewalk," the driver said tersely. "Let's find a café to talk."


I glanced at Howard, whose face remained impassive though I could read his silent support.

"Let's go," I decided, curious about their message and grateful for Howard's presence.




We sat at a nearby patisserie. They ordered cakes while I requested only tea, my appetite gone at the mention of Brian.

"Don't you think you're being cruel to Brian?" the driver asked bluntly.

His words pierced my heart. I stared into my teacup, struggling to maintain composure.

"He's only five, just a child who doesn't understand anything," he continued accusingly. "Every day at school when he sees you with Lucy,he cries silently. He loves you so much..."


Each word hammered at my guilt. Brian had once called me "the best mommy in the world." Where had that child gone? Transformed by Sarah's poisonous influence and Philip's indifference.

"How can you neglect him just because you divorced his father?" "Before you ask these questions," I replied quietly but firmly,"have you tried to understand what he did to me?" He shook his head. "What terrible thing could a child possibly do?" Memories flooded back-Brian pretending not to know me at school,calling Sarah "mommy" in that secret chat group, the stress causing my miscarriage. A five-year-old might not understand consequences, but the pain was real.

Looking at this stranger who could never comprehend my experience,I suddenly lost all desire to explain myself.

"Is that so?" I murmuared, more to myself than him.

When he tried to speak again, I reached for my bag, ready to leave. He immediately blocked my path and turned to Howard.

"If she's this heartless to her own biological son,how dare you employ her?"


Howard's voice turned icier than I'd ever heard it. "Because I personally witnessed how her husband, his mistress, and her son worked together to hurt her."


"So I never thought her actions were excessive," he continued with cold precision. "I only thought, if what happened to her had happened to me...my retaliation would have been far more merciless."

"She has been far too kind," he concluded.

Then Howard extended his hand to me-a rare public gesture of intimacy.When everyone else criticized my motherhood, only he fully understood and supported me. Warmth spread through my chest as I took his hand,drawing strength from his steadiness as he led me away. At Howard Technologies,Catherine Morgan was leaning against the wall,looking bored. Her expression brightened when she spotted us. "You're late," she complained, sounding like a stood-up date,"What happened?" "We ran into some trouble," I explained simply. Catherine immediately linked arms with me. "What's there to be sorry about?" Her rapid mood shifts always made me smile.

After checking that no one was watching, she pulled me into my office and shut the door. "I've successfully infiltrated the gaming department! I know all the company secrets!"

"You're something else, Catherine." I welcomed this distraction from the morning's heaviness.

She shared office gossip efficiently: a secret office romance, an upcoming project delay, embarrassing party incidents. Then she switched topics abruptly.

"Remember that guy who found a new girlfriend right after I rejected him?It's ridiculous! These rich kids have nothing better to do but flaunttheir relationship in front of me. They deliberately stand where I can see them being affectionate at gatherings. When I stopped attending events they'd be at, they spread rumors I was jealous!"

She took a deep breath. "So starting today, I'm focusing on work to prove my worth!"


"Then why are you chatting with Annie during work hours?" Howard's voice came unexpectedly from the doorway. "Is this your idea of working hard?"

 I turned to see him leaning against the doorframe, his eyes containing a hint of amusement despite his cool tone. Catherine straightened immediately. "Mr. Thompson! We were discussing the new children's book concept." "And how does office gossip factor into children's literature?" Howard raised an eyebrow. "Actually," I interjected, "we were discussing character dynamics. Office relationships make good models for children's stories... if you simplify the emotions."

Howard's eyes met mine with subtle acknowledgment. "Perhaps Ms.Morgan should observe more and talk less. Wouldn't you agree?"

After Catherine's hasty exit, Howard remained in the doorway."The concept looks promising," he said, nodding toward my sketches. "The board has high expectations."

He hesitated uncharacteristically. "About this morning..."

"Thank you," I said simply. "For understanding."

He nodded, accepting my desire to end the topic. "The publishing division needs your input on the cover design."

As he turned to leave, I found myself speaking again. "Howard?"

He paused.

"The way you described what happened... it helped. Sometimes I wonder if I'm remembering things correctly, if I'm the villain."
"You're not," he said with characteristic directness. "You're simply human-reacting to extraordinary pain reasonably."
 His words felt like permission to exist without constant self-doubt. As Howard left, I noticed my grip on the pencil had relaxed. Like my illustrations taking shape, I too was finding my form in this new life.The unopened letter in my bedroom would have to wait. Today belonged to the present, not the past.
###Chapter 55: New Target

Sarah's POV

I sprawled across the sofa, mindlessly clicking through television channels.Nothing held my interest for more than a few seconds. I sighed and tossed the remote aside, calculating how much the gesture of boredom resembled something from the soap operas I occasionally watched.

Life had become almost too comfortable since Philip had set me up in this Upper East Side apartment. His excuse for our "temporary separation" had been that Brian and I needed to "cool down," as if we had actual problems that required solving. The very thought made me smirk.

Not that I complained about the arrangement. Philip's absence meant freedom to enjoy the lifestyle I'd schemed for without his constant neediness. I mentally cataloged my victories: prime real estate, unlimited credit cards,and-perhaps most valuable-entry into New York's elite social circles where wealthier prospects awaited.

I checked my watch, calculating whether I had time for a facial before meeting anyone worth impressing tonight. My phone interrupted the thought-Philip's ringtone, that pretentious classical piece he'd programmed himself.

"Missing me already?" I purred, instantly switching to te honeyed voice that had always made him malleable.

"I'm sorry," Philip replied, his tone unexpectedly heavy. I sat up sharply, instinctively scanning for threats.Philip never apologized unless something threatened his comfort. Had he discovered one of my secret accounts? Was he cutting off my access to funds? "Did you cheat on me?" I asked tentatively, already calculating how I could leverage such an indiscretion. "No," Philip answered quickly. Then, to my shock, he continued, "But I've suddenly realized that the person I care about isn't you-it's Annie. I want to win her back and make things right with her."


My grip tightened on the phone as he continued, his voice growing almost cheerful. "The Upper East Side apartment you're living in now? It's yours to keep. I'll continue paying Max's child support on schedule too."

His tone became almost jubilant: "In the future, when we see each other,we can just pretend we don't know each other."

"Philip!" I exclaimed, genuinely alarmed. If I accepted this arrangement, I'd lose my personal ATM! There was absolutely no way I could let him go before securing my next financial provider.

"You can't possibly have feelings for Annie!" I stated calmly, shifting to a more reasonable tone. "Don't forget, you actively chose me over Annie. If you truly loved her, how could you have let her go so easily?"

When Philip didn't interrupt, I pressed my advantage. "This idea you've developed is nothing but an illusion created by our time apart. You're confused,that's all."


I made a mental note that living separately from Philip was clearly a mistake. It had taken him only a few days to "realize his true feelings."The thought of having to reprogram him yet again was exhausting.

"Sarah," Philip's voice cut through my planning, "have I ever told you that every minute I spend with you feels unbearable?" His words left me speechless. Before I could formulate a response, the call ended with a decisive clic, leaving me listening to the dial tone. By evening, I paced my kitchen, mentally reshuffling priorities while swirling winein a glass. The situation demanded immediate action. First:identify and secure a wealthier replacement for Philip. Second: manipulate Philip into continuing financial support until the transition was complete.I couldn't afford even a temporary interruption to my cash flow.

I drummed my fingers against the countertop, strategizing how to make Philip feel obligated to me again. The victim card always worked best with him. Robert's harassment offered the perfect opportunity-I'd weave a story of constant fear and maternal sacrifice that would trigger Philip's protective instincts.

Robert's recent unhinged behavior was irritating,yet perfectly timed. His appearance at Max's school yesterday-while genuinely annoying-provided exactly the kind of dramatic material I needed. Philip's guilt complex would make him feel responsible for our "safety." Men were so predictable in their need to play savior.

I pulled out my phone and scrolled through my contacts until I found Caroline's number. She'd been working at Howard Technologies for several months now-surely she'd have valuable intelligence about potential prospects there.

"Sarah!" Caroline answered on the second ring. "I was just about to call you.You won't believe what's happening at work."

"Tell me everything," I prompted, settling back against the cushions. "Annie's illustrations have gained a huge following, and she's made significant contributions to Howard Technologies' gaming division. I can't find any way to undermine her position. What are you planning to do?" I massaged my temples, feeling a headache forming. "I'll have to handle it myself. Philip's personality is actually quite predictable-even if he initiated this separation, I can easily drag things out if I choose to." I continued, thinking ahead: "By the way,since you work at Howard Technologies, you must encounter men with substantial status and wealth.If you notice anyone single, unmarried, and with assets exceeding Philip's,keep me informed. Send me their information and I'll screen for suitable candidates. Once I learn their preferences, I can pursue them directly."

I had no intention of pathetically clinging to Philip, begging him to love me again. Philip loved Annie... and the harder I tried to change that, the more he'd resent me. Eventually, he'd abandon me completely,leaving me financially strapped. Better to invest my energy in securing a new benefactor while I still had resources and position.

"What about Howard?" Caroline suggested after hearing my criteria.

"Howard?" I repeated, realizing I knew very little about the man beyond his reputation.

Caroline eagerly elaborated: "He likes Annie, which means he doesn't mind someone who's been married before. More importantly, his assets would take you a lifetime to spend. He's incredibly generous when it comes to Annie. He's built business initiatives around her talents and spares no expense promoting her work."

Her voice grew more animated as she continued, "Even if the relationship eventually ended, his company's annual profits alone would cover all your expenses."

The prospect was undeniably appealing. "I'll consider it," I replied thoughtfully. I hunched over my laptop after the call, methodically researching Howard Thompson like a hunter studying prey. The results made my pulse quicken.Caroline hadn't exaggerated-his business achievements were extraordinary,his personal reputation spotless. No scandals, no weaknesses exposed to public view. The articles documented Howard Technologies' exponential growth but revealed frustratingly little about the man himself.

I closed several tabs showing profit margins and market expansion,focusing instead on photos of Howard at events. The subtle indicators of wealth-the custom watches, the perfectly tailored suits that only the truly rich could afford-told me everything. This wasn't just money; this was*empire*.

A calculating smile spread across my face as I imagined the possibilities.Howard had feelings for Annie? Pathetic. I'd already proven my superiority by taking Philip from her-Howard would be no different. Men like him might build corporate empires, but ultimately they all responded to the same basic programming.

I began mentally cataloging approaches, discarding ineffective strategies.Philip had been susceptible to obvious sexuality and emotionalneediness.Howard would require subtler manipulation-intelligence,cultural refinement,strategic vulnerability. I'd need to project the perfect complementary presence to his power.

My fingers tapped rapidly, creating a document listing potential "accidental" meeting locations, conversation topics that would intrigue him,and ways to position myself as everything Annie wasn't. I'd need to study his schedule, preferences,weaknesses-information Caroline could provide. I closed my laptop with a decisive snap, feeling the familiar rush of plotting a complex acquisition. Howard Thompson represented everything I'd worked toward-permanent financial security that wouldn't evaporate with a man's changing moods. The challenge energized me in ways Philip never could. By morning, I'd have the foundation of my strategy mapped out.Philip's rejection would soon seem like the luckiest break of my life. Annie Baker would once again watch helplessly as I claimed my prize. And Howard-brilliant,wealthy Howard-would never recognize the trap until he was thoroughly ensnared.
###Chapter 56: Respect

Howard's POV

I tapped lightly on Annie's office door. She was absorbed in her work,stylus moving across the tablet screen.

"Annie," I said, using the gentler tone reserved only for her and Lucy. "It's time for lunch."

"Is it that time already?" She checked the clock,quickly saved her work and stood. "Let's go. I am hungry, actually."

As we exited the building, I immediately detected something amiss. Philip Baker stood at the entrance with an elaborate display: a heart-shaped frame filled with their old marriage photos, surrounded by lilac roses. A banner beside it read "Please Forgive Me, For Our Memories."

I maintained my neutral expression despite my displeasure. My immediate concern was Annie. I quickly assessed her reaction: slightly accelerated breathing and tension in her shoulders, though her expression remained composed.

Philip wore an expensive suit, clearly having come from his Wall Street office. Upon seeing Annie, he strode forward confidently.
"Annie, I decided to express my feelings in a more meaningful way.These are our most precious memories..." Annie remained still as she looked over the photographs. Her expression showed none of the emotional turmoil I had anticipated-her eyes held a detached quality instead. "Philip," she began, her voice remarkably steady,"these photos certainly document our past. But that's all they represent now-the past." Philip cut in eagerly: "But those memories still exist, Annie. Our six years of marriage, our son Brian-all of it proves that what we had was real."

Annie shook her head slightly. "The Annie from before might have been moved by this gesture, but people change,Philip. The woman who would have been touched by romantic gestures like this doesn't exist anymore."

This statement captured my full attention. Annie's perspective on conventional romantic demonstrations had evidently shifted-information that would necessarily impact my pursuit strategy. I'd been formulating next steps in our relationship, but this new data point suggested a recalibration might be required.

"Annie, please give me another chance..." Philip's voice interrupted my analysis.

"We're finished," Annie stated with finality. "The best thing is for both of us to move forward. If you truly respect me, you'll stop these gestures."

Philip's expression registered injury. "Do you really feel nothing at all for our past?"
Annie drew a measured breath. "I value the good memories, but that doesn't mean I want to return to the past."
I stepped forward to stand beside her. "How would you like to handle this situation?" I asked quietly, ensuring my tone con veyed that I would respect whatever decision she made. Annie glanced at me gratefully. "These things should be removed, but I'd prefer to avoid creating a scene." I nodded once, extracting my phone to send a brief message to my head of security.Within fifty-eight seconds, my security team materialized with professional efficiency. "Mr. Baker," I addressed him with deliberate neutrality, "please allow our staff to assist you with these items. This is company property, and such displays require prior authorization."

Philip appeared ready to protest but, after evaluating my expression,chose compliance instead. The security teamn began systematically dismantling the display, removing the frame and banner with practiced efficiency.

"This changes nothing," Philip said to Annie as a parting statement. "I'Il prove to you that I'm sincere."




Night had fallen. Annie sat in her customary position on the terrace,holding a cup of chamomile tea. I'd chosen water-caffeine would disrupt my sleep.

My thoughts remained fixed on the afternoon's incident. Annie's response to Philip's romantic gesture necessitated reconsideration of my approach.

"Regarding Philip's display today," I began,selecting my phrasing with precision, "I'm curious about your perspective on that type of... public declaration."

Annie sipped her tea thoughtfully before responding. "The person I used to be might have found it moving. But now, this kind of gesture seems performative-designed to satisfy his need for validation rather than considering what I actually want." "So you dislike romantic gestures?" I probed further. A slight smile curved her lips. "I don't dislike romance. I've just come to appreciate romance based on understanding and respect, rather than orchestrated scenarios." Her answer provided critical insight. Annie hadn't rejected romance entirely but had redefined what constituted meaningful romantic expression. I mentally recorded this distinction for future reference.

My peripheral vision caught movement in the parking area. A familiar vehicle had stopped there, lights off but with someone still inside. I confirmed my suspicion-Philip Baker.

Anger flared in my chest before I suppressed it. Philip had tacked Annie to my private residence? This behavior crossed all acceptable boundaries.My initial impulse was to move closer to Annie, perhaps take her hand to demonstrate intimacy.

I immediately rejected this impulse. Such an action would reduce Annie to a possession, no different from Philip's approach. Annie wasn't a prize but a person deserving respect. Initiating contact without consent would violate my principles.

Instead, I extracted my phone and rapidly composed a message to Philip:"Jealous? I'm the one sitting with her watching the moonlight now."
After sending it, I returned to my seat, experiencing a small but distinct satisfaction.

"What is it?" Annie asked, noticing my attention shift. "What are you looking at?"
"Nothing important," I replied evenly. "Thought I saw wildlife movement.Likely a false alarm." My phone screen illuminated with Philip's response: "Annie and I shared six years and have a child together. That's a connection you can never replace." I permitted myself a slight smirk, responding: "Mr. Baker, that belongs to the past. I represent her present and future." "Really?" Annie asked, clearly noting the subtle changes in my expression.

I pocketed my phone, offering a measured smile. "Indeed. It's getting late.
We should retire. You have an editorial meeting tomorrow morning."

Annie nodded, rising from her chair. "You're right. Goodnight,Howard."

"Goodnight, Annie." I watched her departure from the terrace.

Once certain Annie had moved beyond hearing range, I returned to the terrace edge, observing as Philip's headlights finally activated and his vehicle departed. I extracted my phone once more,sending a final message:"If I chose to, I could ensure you never approach her again. Mr. Baker."
Ten minutes later, seated in my study's leather chair, I organized materials for tomorrow's executive meeting when my phone vibrated with Philip's reply:
"Sarah's been injured. I need to check on her. If Annie knew how much I care about others, she'd understand what a loving person I am!"
I emitted a cold laugh, instantly comprehending the situation. Philip proclaimed love for Annie while immediately abandoning his pursuit at Sarah's call. This behavioral pattern had likely existed throughout their marriage, explaining Annie's absolute certainty in terminating that relationship.

I responded: "Did you ever show such concern when Annie was hurt? No.Your differential treatment reveals everything-your affection lies with Sarah,not Annie: I suggest you return to Sarah and abandon this self-deception."

Setting down my phone, I contemplated the insight Philip's behavior provided. If I truly intended to win Annie's heart, I needed to avoid Philip's fundamental error-I must genuinely respect her, understand her needs ratherthan imposing my expectations upon her.
###Chapter 57: Assistance

Howard's POV

I sat alone in Howard Technologies' executive conference room, fingers drumming a precise rhythm against the mahogany table.

I extracted my phone,scrolled to Catherine Morgan's contact, and placed the call. The line connected after two rings.

"Could you come by?" I asked without preamble. "I need to discuss something with you."

"Work-related?" Catherine's voice immediately tensed, the casual lilt she typically employed with colleagues vanishing instantly.

"More or less." I offered no elaboration, seeing no strategic value in prolonging her anxiety unnecessarily.

After a telling silence, Catherine managed a reluctant "Okay." The walk from her department to the executive floor typically required no more than three minutes, yet nearly ten passed before she appeared at the conference room doorway.She hesitated visibly before entering, offering an awkward smile that poorly masked her apprehension.

"Mr. Thompson..." Catherine began, her posture suggesting she was bracing for disciplinary action. "I know I've been chatting too much in the office lately, but I promise I've completed all my assignments,and-"
"I'm not firing you, Catherine." I interrupted her nervous justification,finding it both inefficient and unnecessary.
"Really?" She dramatically clutched her chest, exhaling with exaggerated relief. "That's good. I was thinking it would be pretty tragic to get fired just for discussing which designer bag looks better with mynew shoes." I maintained my neutral expression, bypassing her attempt at levity."I have a question for you. What type of men do women generally find appealing?"

Catherine blinked rapidly, clearly recalibrating her expectations for this meeting. "Wait, how is this related to work?"

"It isn't," I acknowledged simply.

The admission transformed Catherine's demeanor instantly.She leaned forward,eyes widening with sudden interest. "Oh! This is about Annie, isn t it? I already helped you discover why she's refusing relationships! Now you want to know how to pursue her?"

I nodded. My silence served as tacit acknowledgment.

"Consider Philip," I said, my analytical approach activating automatically."
For all his flaws, he successfully married Annie. Comparatively, my experience in this domain is inadequate."
Catherine failed to suppress her amusement, a brief laugh escaping her. "Howard Thompson has something he's not good at? That's breaking news!"
I regarded her momentary lapse in professional decorum without comment,opting instead for candor. "Since Lucy's arrival, I haven't had female companionship. I may be... somewhat out of practice."
"You must have dated before, right?" Catherine probed, curiosity evident in her expression.
After brief consideration, I acknowledged: "Indeed. However, those were transient relationships. My feelings for Annie are different."
"Hasn't your mother arranged introductions?" Catherine continued,evidently finding my romantic inexperience fascinating. "Many," I confirmed, "but throughout my life, I've maintained an instinctive resistance to my strict mother's influence. Her recommended candidates invariably failed to capture my interest."

Catherine nodded thoughtfully, then her expression shifted subtly. A calculating look flickered across her features as though she'd formulated a theory she wasn't immediately prepared to share. Instead,she offered a sly smile that triggered my strategic alertness.

"Before I share my brilliant idea," Catherine suddenly stated, "could you do me a favor?"


I raised an eyebrow, mentally assessing potential implications. "What kind of favor?"


"Say yes first," Catherine countered with unexpected shrewdness. "It's a fair exchange. I help solve your Annie situation, you help solve my situation."

I hesitated briefly,calculating risk factors against potential benefits. While my natural inclination resisted committing to undefined terms,I recognized that my pursuit of Annie might benefit from alternative perspectives. "Acceptable, provided the request remains reasonable."

"Excellent!" Catherine's hands came together in a quick clap of satisfaction."So my plan is..."
She leaned toward me, lowering her voice conspiratorially as she outlined her proposal directly into my ear. I listened with growing skepticism,raising an eyebrow when she finished.
"You believe this approach will be effective?" I questioned,analyzing the probability of success.
"Trust me," Catherine responded with unwarranted confidence."This plan is foolproof." She paused deliberately before adding, "As for that favor... wait for my call."




The afternoon sun had begun its descent when my phone displayed "Margaret Thompson" on the screen. I raised an eyebrow fractionally-my mother's timing was predictable. Following our contentious exchange regarding Annie two weeks prior, I had strategically reduced her usual financial allowance. The calculated pressure appeared to have produced its intended effect.

"What is it?" I answered dispassionately, maintaining neutral intonation.

The line remained silent for several seconds. I could detect my mother's measured breathing, suggesting internal conflict.

"I'm busy," I reminded her, my tone deliberately cooler than usual."If there's nothing urgent-"
"I've been thinking lately..." Margaret finally spoke, her characteristic assertiveness noticeably diminished. "Howard, we can't continue like this."
Her voice carried an unfamiliar vulnerability. "You know, since you reduced my living expenses, everything has becomne quite difficult."
"You brought this upon yourself.," I responded without emotional inflection.
"You attempted to interfere with my personal affairs. These are the consequences."

"I visited Sophia, your sister," she mentioned my sister, "hoping she might help..."
The situation immediately crystallized in my mind. While my sister's company performed adequately, its scale was incomparable to Howard Technologies. If my mother's historically lavish lifestyle required merely a fraction of my company's profits, it would represent a substantial burden on Sophia's more modest enterprise.

"What was her response?" I inquired, though I had already calculated the most probable answer.


Margaret released an audible sigh. "She said her company simply couldn't sustain my expenses unless..."

"Unless she liquidated the business," I completed her statement. "Clearly an imprudent option."

"I've realized something these past few days," she continued, her tone softening perceptibly. "Howard, you're an adult with your own perspective.As your mother, I shouldn't interfere excessively."

This uncharacteristic concession immediately suggested external influence."Sophia convinced you of this, didn't she?"

"How did you know?" Margaret's surprise carried through the connection.

I observed objectively. "Within our family, she appears to be the only individual capable of persuading you."

A slightly embarrassed laugh emanated from the receiver,but my mother offered no contradiction to my assessment.
"If you seek my forgiveness, the requirements are straightforward," I stated without prevarication. "Apologize to Lucy in my presence.Should she forgive you, I'll discontinue harboring resentment, and naturally,your monthly financial support will resume."
"Impossible!" Margaret refused instantly, her voice regaining its familiar rigidity.
In the background, I distinctly heard my sister's casual yet deliberately audible remark: "Mom, I might actually need to consider selling the company then..."

The statement evidently affected my mother's resolve. She deflated immediately, communicating with clear frustration: "Fine, I agree."

"Excellent," I responded, my tone remaining level despite the internal satisfaction I experienced. This minor family power negotiation had concluded with a victory for the alliance between my sister and myself.




Early evening found me driving toward Lucy's school, with Annie occupying the passenger seat. Her phone suddenly emitted its distinctive chime.


"It's Catherine," Annie observed, glancing at the display before accepting the call.

"Hello, Catherine," Annie greeted.

I observed her expression transform from neutral to confused before she extended the device toward me. "She wants to speak with you."

"What is it?" I accepted the phone, maintaining my customary composure.

"Howard, remember that favor you owe me?" Catherine's voice conveyed both urgency and anxiety. "I need you to fulfill that promise now. Several projects at my father's company have encountered critical issues, and I'm uncertain how to inform him. Could you meet with us in an advisory capacity?"

I glanced briefly at Annie, noting her curious observation.

"What time?" I inquired concisely.

"Seven o'clock," Catherine replied. "Thank you, Howard. I realize this is unexpected, but it's genuinely important." "I'll be there," I confirmed, my tone remaining measured.

After terminating the call, Annie immediately questioned: "What's happening? Catherine sounded distressed."

"Some commercial matters involving the Morgan family," I explained with deliberate neutrality. "She's requested my consultation."

"Is this what she discussed with you in your office this morning?" Annie deduced perceptively.

I turned toward her, permitting a marginal expression of surprise."How did you know about that?"

Annie's lips curved upward. "There are no secrets in an office environment,Howard. Particularly when Catherine Morgan is involved."

"Indeed," I acknowledged, allowing a slight elevation at the corner of my mouth. "However, in this instance, her request for assistance issincere."

"Then tonight, Lucy and I can-"

"You should both accompany me," I interjected. "The meeting won't extend excessively. Additionally, Lucy appreciates the dessert selection at that establishment."
###Chapter 58: Invitation

Annie's POV

As we entered the private dining room of one of Manhattan's prestigious hotels, Lucy's small hand tightened in mine, her shyness returning in this unfamiliar environment. I gave her fingers a reassuring squeeze,understanding her discomfort. These high-end settings still made me feel out of place sometimes-like I was playing dress-up in someone else's life.

Mr. Morgan rose to greet us, his warm smile directed particularly at Howard. His eyes flickered between Howard and Catherine with unmistakable expectation, and I felt awkward as I recognized his misinterpretation of our gathering. *Great, another person who thinks Howard and Catherine would make a perfect match*, I thought,then immediately questioned why that bothered me.

"Howard! It's wonderful to finally meet you in person," Mr. Morgan extended his hand with unmistakable enthusiasm, his eyes flickering between Howard and Catherine with thinly veiled expectation. "Catherine has spoken so highly of you."

"Dad!" Catherine interjected, her cheeks flushing with embarrassment.Her eyes telegraphed a silent plea as she continued, "Mr. Thompson rarely accepts meeting requests from anyone."

Howard remained unruffled and began the introductions. "This is my daughter," he stated,gesturing toward Lucy.
*His daughter*. The words sent an unexpected warmth through me.Though Lucy wasn't biologically his, Howard had stepped into the role of father with such natural grace that sometimes I forgot their relationship hadn't always existed.
"Hello!" Mr. Morgan responded enthusiastically, bending slightly to meet Lucy at eye level.

Lucy offered only the slightest nod in acknowledgment,retreating partially behind me. I placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder, feeling the tension in her small frame.

"And this is Lucy's mother," Howard continued,his hand making a subtle gesture in my direction.

*Lucy's mother*. Not Annie Baker, not the illustrator from his company.The introduction simultaneously warmed me.

Mr. Morgan's confusion was evident as his eyes darted between Howard and me, trying to determnine our relationship.

Catherine caught her father's questioning glance and mouthed silently,"T'll explain later!"

Once we were seated, Mr. Morgan transitioned to business matters,outlining the challenges facing his family enterprises.

Howard listened attentively, asking pointed questions that cut to the heart of each issue. His analysis was methodical and precise. I found myself admiring the way his mind worked-how he could distill complex problems into solvable components. It was the same precision he brought to everything, whether business deals or ensuring Lucy had her favorite breakfast.
"Can they be saved?" Mr. Morgan finally asked. "Yes," Howard responded with quiet confidence before outlining his solution. Mr. Morgan's expression transformed from worry to admiration as Howard spoke. I realized that Howard's appeal extended beyond his appearance or wealth. It made me feel simultaneously safe in his presence and acutely aware of how different our worlds were.

Despite Catherine's earlier warnings and obvious discomfort, Mr.Morgan eventually steered the conversation in the direction she had clearly been dreading.

"So,Howard," he began with barely disguised intention, "what do you think of my daughter? She graduated top of her class at Harvard Business School,you know."

"Dad!" Catherine interjected desperately before Howard could respond. "In Mr. Thompson's eyes, I'm definitely a qualified employee!" Her voice carried forced brightness as she attempted damage control. "I'm still learning so much from him."

I found myself holding my breath, irrationally interested in Howard's response. The thought made me uncomfortable in ways I wasn't prepared to examine.
Raising her glass of fruit juice in Howard's direction, she added hastily,"Mr. Thompson, rest assured that I'll work hard at the company in the future!"

Howard acknowledged her statement with a slight nod. "Good,"he replied simply.
I felt a ridiculous surge of relief. Catherine's practiced smile didn't falter.Catherine had moved on, I realized. The way she spoke about working hard at the company sounded genuine.


Back at the Long Island estate, Thomas, Lucy's exercise coach, was waiting."We're going to increase intensity today," he announced.
Lucy adapted readily to the more challenging routine. I attempted to match her energy despite the fatigue I'd been feeling.

As we reached the running portion, dizziness washed over me. Cold sweat beaded on my forehead as I fought to maintain composure. The monthly cramps intensified.

Howard caught the momentary falter in my stride and signaled Thomas to pause.

"I think that's enough for today," Howard stated firmly.

After arranging for Thomas to be driven home, Howard approached me with concern.

"Annie, are you feeling unwell?" he asked quietly. "You've been pale since the middle of the run."
I considered deflecting, pretending everything was fine-a habit developed during years with Philip, who'd had little patience for "female problems."But there was something in HowardI's expression that made prevarication seem unnecessary.
"It's...um...that time of the month," I explained awkwardly, unused to discussing such personal matters with him. "Makes me more fatigued than usual."
I braced myself for discomfort or dismissal, but Howard's expression remained attentive and concerned. No judgment, no disgust.
Lucy, who had been gathering her water bottle and towel, approached us with concern evident in her expressive eyes. "Should you rest?"
Lucy suddenly turned to Howard, her expressionearnest."Dad,I read that a heating pad and chamomile tea help with cramps. Could we get some for Mom?" Howard nodded immediately. "Of course. I'Il arrange it right away."

I watched him stride away, efficient and purposeful even in this unexpected scenario. How many CEOs would personally arrange for tea and a heating pad? The thought made me smile despite my discomfort.

While Howard stepped away to make arrangements, Lucy disappeared briefly before returning with a children's book. She settled quietly beside me on the sofa, opening the book without commentary but clearly intending to provide company.
Howard returned several minutes later carrying a steaming cup of tea and what appeared to be a high-end heating pad.

"The housekeeper said this blend might help," Howard explained, carefully placing the tea on the side table within my reach.

Lucy approached with the heating pad, handling it with deliberate care."I heard this helps with the pain," she offered softly.
"Thank you both. This is very thoughtful," I said sincerely,genuinely moved by their considerate gestures. Philip had never once, in six years of marriage, acknowledged my discomfort during these times. Yet Howard and Lucy, who had known me for mere months, showed such natural consideration. Later that evening, after Edward and Eleanor had tactfully suggested taking Lucy for a walk through the gardens-providing me space to rest-Howard remained in the living room,reviewing several documents. I noticed Howard's gaze occasionally drifting toward me, carrying an uncharacteristic hesitancy. The uncertainty in his expresson made me curious. "You probably need to work. I should head upstairs," I suggested,preparing to give him privacy.

"I have time now," Howard replied, setting his tablet aside. "Annie, would you like to talk for a while?"

"Sure," I agreed, resettling on the sofa.

An unusual silence fell between us-not our typical comfortable quiet, but something charged with unspoken thoughts. Howard seemed to be weighing his words carefully.

"Is there something you want to tell me?" I finally asked, breaking the unusual silence.

After a moment's consideration, Howard met my gaze directly. "I need to attend a charity gala."
The statement seemed anticlimactic after such buildup, and I waited for him to continue, sensing there was more.
"As you might have noticed, I don't have many female acquaintances,"Howard continued with careful precision. "Wouald you accompany me?" The invitation caught me off guard. A charity gala meant New York's elite-wealthy investors, society figures, possibly even Philip's social circle.The thought made my stomach tighten with anxiety. I wasn't ready for that level of scrutiny, for the whispers that would inevitably follow the divorced illustrator accompanying Howard Thompson. And yet...something in Howard's expression made refusal difficult. *What exactly would this mean?* I wondered. Was this just a business arrangement? "Alright," I nodded, accepting the invitation despite my reservations.Howard had done so much for Lucy and me-how could I refuse this simple request?

"Tll have Susan select appropriate attire and have it delivered to the ofice for you to try," Howard added, already shifting into hisefficient planning mode.


The practical consideration was both reassuring and slightly intimidating.Of course I would need special clothes-my modest wardrobe hardly contained anything suitable for the kind of event Howard would attend.

"And arrange for a stylist if you'd like," he continued thoughtfully.

"Is this gala very important?" I asked, curiosity winning over hesitation.

"Yes," Howard acknowledged carefully. "Many business partners will be there."
"But don't worry," HHoward assured me, correctly reading my concerns."I'lI be right beside you."
"Just stay by my side," he added with quiet certainty. "You don't need to do anything else."
###Chapter 59: Unexpected Apologies

Annie's POV

I stepped out of my bedroom, my body still aching slightly though the worst of yesterday's discomfort had subsided. Lucy was tiptoeing down the stairs with exaggerated caution.

When she spotted me, her face immediately transformed into an expression of concern that seemed almost comically adult.

"Mom, shouldn't you be resting?" she asked, her brow furrowed with worry. "Yesterday you didn't feel well."

"I'm feeling much better today, sweetheart," I assured her, descending the remaining steps. "Well enough for my work."
Lucy remained unconvinced, studying my face with surprising intensity."But if you start to feel bad again, you have to stop. Promise?" She extended her pinky finger solemnly.
I linked my pinky with hers, suppressing a smile at her seriousness. "Promise."

In the car, Lucy settled between us, content to remain close rather than pressing her face against the window as she usually did.
"Excited about your butterfly explorer project?" I asked.

She nodded enthusiastically, "Penny and I are going to make the best map ever. We'll find all the secret places where butterfles hide."
"That sounds wonderful," I encouraged. "Will you show me when it's finished?"
"Of course!" Lucy replied as if the question were absurd. "I show you everything important." *Everything important*. The simple phrase carried such weight. I remembered when I'd first come to live with them-silent,withdrawn,communicating only through nods and shakes of her head, if at all. Now she spoke freely, sharing her thoughts and feelings with increasing confidence.

As we approached the school, Lucy finally spotted Penny waiting by the entrance. Her entire face lit up, but instead of immediately clamoring to exit the vehicle as she usually did, she turned to me frst.

"Will you be here when school finishes?" she asked, her voice carrying a hint of vulnerability.

"Of course," I promised, gently tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. "T Il be waiting right here."

Only then did she nod, apparently satisfied,and prepare to leave. She hugged me quickly, then turned to Howard. "Bye, Dad!"

My smile faltered when I spotted Margaret Thompson waiting near the entrance. What was she doing here?

"Mother," Howard greeted her.

"I came to speak with Lucy," she stated,her gaze sliding toward the child who now half-hid behind my legs, regarding Margaret with undisguised wariness."And what would you like to say to her?" Howard inquired, his voice carrying a protective edge. Margaret drew a measured breath, looking distinctly uncomfortable. "I wish to apologize for my previous behavior." The statement hung in the air, as surprising as if she'd announced she was joining the circus. Lucy peeked out from behind me, her expression cautious but curious.

Margaret knelt down, a movement that seemed to cost her considerable pride, bringing herself to eye level with Lucy. "I wasn't very nice to you before," she began stiffly. "The things I said about your condition were unkind and incorrect. I'm... sorry."

Lucy studied Margaret's face. After a long moment, she nodded once."Okay."

The simple acceptance seemed to both relieve and perplex Margaret. Then,she rose to her feet, smoothing her skirt with practiced precision.

"Is that all?" Howard asked, his tone suggesting he found the apology insufficient.

Margaret's lips thinned slightly. "What more would you have me say?"

"Perhaps you should also apologize to Annie," Howard suggested,though his tone made it clear this wasn't merely a suggestion.

Margaret turned toward me, looking as if she'd swallowed something unpleasant. "Ms. Baker, I may have... misjudged you initially. My comments regarding your background andI suitability for employment were...premature." Standing there, I found myself considering everything that had happened wíth Philip-his betrayal, Sarah's manipulation, Brian's rejection.Compared to those wounds, Margaret's disapproval seemed almost trivial. "I accept your apology," I said simply. Margaret blinked, clearly surprised by my ready acceptance. "Just like that?" "Life's too short to hold grudges over misunderstandings," I replied with a slight shrug.

Margaret's gaze flicked between me and her granddaughter. "Thank you."

"Good," Howard interjected coolly. "Now, if you'll excuse us, we have work to attend to."




Later, in my office, I reviewed the final animations for my illustrated children's story. My characters now moved across the screen, their adventures unfolding just as I'd imagined.

"The board is impressed," Howard commented. "Your concept has exceeded initial projections."

I smiled,still somewhat amazed that my simple drawings had evolved into this. "I never imagined my illustrations would become animations."

"This is merely the beginning," Howard replied with characteristic certainty."The gaming division has expressed interest in developing interactive educational content based on your character designs."

His casual confidence in my success both exhilarated and intimidated me.In just months, I'd transformed from a divorced,unemployed mother with fractured confidence intoa respected creative professional.

"Do you think-" I began, but a sharp knock interrupted my question. Before either of us could respond, the door swung open to reveal Sarah Johnson. She wore a designer outfit that somehow managed to be both professional and provocative-a skill she'd always possessed. "I hope I'm not interrupting," she said with practiced contrition, though her calculating gaze swept the office. Howard's expression immediately hardened. "How did you gain access to this floor?"

Sarah ignored his question. "Annie, I needed to see you."

"What do you want, Sarah?" I asked,proud of how steady my voice remained.


"I came to apologize," she declared, her voice thick with what anyone who didn't know her might mistake for genuine emotion. "I was young and foolish, and I never considered how my actions would hurt you."

The absurdity of her statement almost made me laugh. "Young? Sarah, you're thirty-three. You knew exactly what you were doing."

"I made a terrible mistake," she insisted. "Can't you find it in your heart to forgive me?"

I studied her face-the calculated vulnerability, the coldly assessing eyes."Some things can't be fixed with a simple 'I'm sorry,' Sarah. You didn't just have an affair with my husband. You deliberately poisoned my son against me."


"What can I do to make amends?" she asked, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Please, tell me what you want."

"I want you and Philip to stay out of my life," I sated clearly. "That's all." As I spoke, I noticed Sarah's gaze shifting occasionally toward Howard,who remained silent but watchful beside my desk. A suspicion began forming in my mind about her true purpose here. "You're still in love with Philip, aren't you?" Sarah suddenly asked,her tone sharpening. "That's why you can't forgive me-because you're still holding onto him." The accusation was so absurd that I simply stared at herfor a moment before responding. "Really? That after everything he did. I'm pining for him?"


"It's understandable," Sarah continued, her voice taking on a sympathetic tone that made my skin crawl. "He was your first love, the father of your child. Of course you'd have trouble letting go."

"What I find interesting," I replied calmly, "is how predictable you are,Sarah. You always use the same tactics-gaslighting, false sympathy,playing the victim. Don't you ever get tired of being so... repetitive?"

Sarah's composure slipped momentarily before she launched into her next performance-collapsing into the visitor's chair with a dramatic sob."I'm just trying to make things right! Why are you being so cruel?"

"Cruel?" I repeated, feeling an odd detachment as I watched her theatrics."Sarah, if I were truly cruel, I would have already shared with all our mutual acquaintances exactly what you did-how you coached my five-year-old son to reject me, how you created a secret chat group called'Perfect Family' while I was still married to Philip, how you deliberately caused me stress that contributed to my miscarriage."

Sarah's sobbing abruptly ceased, her eyes widening slightly at the mention of details I'd never publicly disclosed. "But I haven't done that," I continued evenly. "Not because I care about your reputation, but because it would hurt Brian to have everyone know how he was manipulated. So no, Sarah, I'm not being cruel. I'm being remarkably restrained." Sarah's expression hardened. "You've changed. You used to be so... soft." "Yes," I agreed simply. "I have." The office phone suddenly rang. Howard, who had remained a silent observer throughout our exchange, answered it, his voice carrying its usual measured authority. "Thompson speaking."

After listening briefly, he addressed the person on the other end with quiet intensity. "I want to know how an unauthorized individual gained access to the executive floor. Implement security protocol seven immediately.Effective immediately, only employees and confirmed business partners are permitted entry."


Sarah's expression shifted as she realized the implications. "You can't throw me out!" she protested, her voice rising indignantly. "I came here in good faith!"


Howard regarded her with the same detached assessment I'd seen him direct at business competitors. "You may leave voluntarily, or security will escort you out. The choice is yours."

Sarah gathered her purse, movements sharp with anger. "This isn't over,"she declared, though the threat sounded hollow.
###Chapter 60: Charity Gala

Howard's POV

I maintained my customary brisk pace through the Howard Technologies corridors, the small team of stylists following several steps behind.Susan had assembled them with remarkable efficiency.

Approaching Annie's office, I observed through the glass partition that she appeared to be preparing to leave her desk. Perhaps for her customary afternoon break-a habit I'd noted but never commented on, recognizing its value in her creative process. My watch indicated 2:17 PM. Perfect timing.


I entered without knocking, the styling team following behind me in a practiced formation. Annie looked up, her expression shifting from concentration to confusion as she registered the unexpected entourage.

The lead stylist-Vanessa, if I recalled correctly-stepped forward,her gaze shifting between Annie and myself with professional assessment.

"Mr. Thompson," she inquired with practiced deference, "is she the one we'Il be styling today?"

I nodded once. "Yes."

Annie's brow furrowed slightly-the particular expression she displayed when encountering unexpected variables. "What are they doing here?"
I explained matter-of-factly. "They're here to prepare you for tonight's charity gala."

Understanding dawned in her eyes,followed immediately by what appeared to be mild alarm. Before she could formulate an objection, the youngest stylist-an efficient brunette whose name escaped me-approached Annie with practiced confidence. "Please close your eyes," she instructed gently, already reaching for her cosmetics case.

Annie hesitated briefly before complying, her shoulders tensing slightly as the styling team converged around her. I observed the process from a strategic position near the door, noting Annie's discomfort with the attention. Despite her obvious unease, she remained still, permitting the professionals to work without interruption.


The makeup artist applied foundation with precise movements while another began arranging Annie's hair.

Annie maintained her composed exterior, but subtle indicators-the slight tension in her jaw, the controlled rhythm of her breathing-suggested internal resistance to the process. I found myself wondering about her thoughts. Based on previous patterns, she was likely calculating the productivity cost of this interruption to her work schedule, perhaps mentally rearranging her upcoming deadlines.




"You can open your eyes now," the makeup artist announced, stepping back to assess her work.
Another team member approached with a garment bag, unzipping it to reveal an elegant evening gown in deep navy blue. The stylist held it forward expectantly. "The restroom is just there if you'd like to change." Annie blinked several times, as though emerging from deep concentration.She accepted the dress with a slight nod before disappearing into the adjacent restroom. The styling team exchanged satisfied glances, making minor adjustments to their equipment while waiting. I maintained my position by the window,reviewing acquisition projections on my tablet while monitoring the situation peripherally.

When the bathroom door reopened, I instinctively glanced up, then found myself unable to return to the financial data before me.

The transformation was...remarkable.

Annie emerged in the navy blue gown, its design simultaneously sophisticated and understated. The styling team had selected perfectly-the dress complemented rather than overwhelmed her natural presence.Her hair, usually secured in a practical arrangement for work, now fell in soft waves that framed her face. The makeup enhanced rather than masked her features, drawing particular attention to her eyes.

I discovered myself unable to redirect my attention with my usual efficiency. Something about the contrast between this polished version of Annie and the focused professional I'd come to know created an unexpected cognitive disruption.

"Mr. Thompson, what do you think?" Vanessa prompted, interrupting my uncharacteristic mental wandering.

I registered the momentary lapse in my typical cognitive discipline and immediately reestablished control over my expression. "Very good,"I responded,maintaining my usual measured tone despite an unusual internal response I chose not to examine further. The styling team exchanged pleased glances before efficiently gathering their equipment. Within minutes, they had vacated the office, leaving Annie and me alone. She approached with measured steps, clearly unaccustomed to the formal footwear. Drawing a deep breath, she met my gaze directly. "Shall we go?" I extended my arm in a practiced gesture, noting the slight tremor in her hand as she placed it on my forearm. The involuntary physical response revealed her nervousness about the evening ahead-an understandable reaction given her limited exposure to high-society functions.

"Don't worry," I stated quietly, activating the reassurance protocol I typically reserved for Lucy's moments of anxiety. "Whatever happens,I'll protect you."

The tension in her shoulders eased fractionally. "All right then. I'm counting on you."




The Bentley glided to a stop at the entrance of the Huntington Estate,where the annual Children's Medical Research gala was being held.I exited first, circling the vehicle to open Annie's door personally-a deviation from standard protocol that felt appropriate for the evening's objectives.


Annie emerged carefully, instinctively aligning herself beside me as we approached the entrance. The evening air carried the fragrance of the estate's famous rose garden-hundreds of blooms climbing the wrought iron fencing that surrounded the property. The expansive grounds had been transformed for the occasion, with elegantly appointed tables arranged throughout the garden. A red carpet extended from the main gates to the grand ballroom, currently populated by a steady stream of New York's elite-business leaders, politicians, old-money families, and celebrities whose presence guaranteed media coverage for the charitable cause. We had barely stepped onto the carpet when I detected Annie's slight change in posture. Following her line of sight, I immediately identified the source of her discomfort-Philip Baker, positioned near the entrance, his attention fixed unmistakably in our direction.
Annie immediately redirected her gaze, a small but revealing gesture.

"He stalks you at the office when you're not attending events,." I observed quietly. "Then appears at events you do attend."

I modulated my voice to ensure privacy within our conversation. "Does it bother you?"

"Yes," Annie admitted simply.

"It reminds me of when Catherine Morgan used to follow me around,"I began, the comparison forming naturally.

"Are you talking about me?" Catherine's voice suddenly materialized from my peripheral vision, cutting my observation short.

I turned slightly to observe Catherine approaching. Her father, visible several yards behind her, appeared to be engaged with other guests.

"I was using you as an example," I stated neutrally despite being caught in an awkward conversational moment.

Catherine's eyes narrowed slightly in suspicion before she glanced between Annie and myself. With a final look that communicated mild indignation,she turned and departed toward her father's location.

Once Catherine had moved beyond hearing range, I returned to our previous topic, conscious that the interruption had created a natural opening for my planned proposition. "I understood your current feelings," I continued, referencing her confirmation about Philip's unwanted attention. "But I recognized then, as is relevant now, that without implementing a strategic solution..." I deliberately paused, allowing Annie to anticipate my conclusion. "Philip Baker will continue his pursuit indefinitely," I completed my analysis.

Annie's expression reflected genuine concern. "Do you have a suggestion?"

I paused deliberately. "We could pretend to be in a relationship."

Annie's eyes met mine directly, her gaze analytical rather than immediately dismissive. "Is that really appropriate?"

I applied the same methodical approach I would to any strategic challenge."There are multiple individuals in my professional and personal circles applying pressure regarding my marital status. By establishing a perceived relationship with you, that pressure would be significantly reduced."

I didn't verbalize the secondary benefit-that such an arrangement would simultaneously discourage Philip's continued pursuit-trusting Annie to recognize this obvious conclusion independently.

Annie appeared to conduct her own internal analysis.

Say yes. Please say yes. My heart shouldn't be racing like this over a business arrangement... but it is.

"All right," she agreed.
###Chapter 61: Charity Gala Part Two

Annie's POV

A delicious tingle of excitement ran through me as Howard and I entered the gala. His agreement to my becoming his "girlfriend" for the evening still felt surreal.

It's just pretend. I reminded myself firmly, tryingto temper the unexpected joy bubbling inside me.

This is about strategy, not feelings. Still, I couldn't help the small smile that played at my lips as Howard's hand rested lightly at the small of my back.guiding me through the glittering crowd.

My momentary happiness faltered when I noticed Philip watching us from across the room, his predatory gaze tracking our every movement.

"He's watching," I murmured.

"He's been tracking our movements since we arrived," Howard confirmed coolly.


Philip approached us directly. "I need to speak with you," he said,focusing solely on me.


Howard shifted slightly. "I believe anything concerning my girlfriend would naturally include me in the conversation," he replied smoothly.

Philip's head snapped toward Howard. "*Girlfriend?*" His gaze darted between us with sudden, desperate attention.


I reached for Howard's hand and interlaced our fingers. "Yes, we're seeing each other," I confirmed, my voice steady.

Philip stared at our joined hands. "That's not possible," he stated flatly. "I'm not entirely sure what you wanted to discuss," I redirected, "but I assume it has something to do with Sarah Johnson?"

"Sarah's actions were always in my best interest," Philip insisted defensively. "I hope you both aren't targeting her."

"I don't believe I have any reason to 'target' her," I replied, genuinely amused. "Philip, I let all that go when our divorce was finalized. What matters now is that I've moved forward with my life. And now I have a new relationship..."

"I believe I can state with reasonable certainty that I surpass you in most measurable criteria," Howard observed matter-of-factly. "Therefore, I can confidently assert that I possess the capability to maintain Annie's interest long-term."


"Impossible!" Philip sputtered.

"There's nothing impossible about it," I stated calmly."It wasn't until I began spending time with Howard that I understood what being truly cared for feels like."


Philip's face drained of color as Howard and I moved away.

As we navigated the ballroom, a distinguished gentleman approached us."Howard! Excellent timing."


"Charles," Howard acknowledged with a nod. "Allow me to introduce Annie Baker,my partner."

The word *partner* sent unexpected warmth cascading through me.My eyes darted to Howard's profile, studying the confident set of his jaw, the perfect posture that seemed as natural to him as breathing. Had anyone told me months ago that I'd be standing beside Howard Thompson as his date, I would have laughed at the absurdity. Yet here I was. In the months since joining Howard Technologies, I'd created a successful children's book series, helped develop educational content that children loved, and built a new life for myself. Perhaps I wasn't just the divorced, broken woman anymore. Perhaps I was becoming someone who could stand beside a man like Howard and not feel completely out of place.

*What if this wasn't pretend?* The thought slipped through my defenses before I could stop it. *What if we could be more than this arrangement?*I quickly pushed the dangerous idea away, but not before a flush of warmth colored my cheeks.

"Howard's partner! What a pleasure," Charles exclaimed. "This is quite unexpected."

A small cluster of guests quickly gathered around us. "So you're Howard's lady!" a woman exclaimed. "Let's toast to that!"

I accepted a champagne flute, but Howard smoothly intercepted it. "She doesn't drink," he stateddefinitively. "Anyone encouraging her to do so would be directly contravening my wishes."

The pressure instantly evaporated as guests murmured apologies.

"Baker is quite fortunate," someone commented. "Not many can claim to have won Howard Thompson's affections."


When we were alone, I asked, "Was refusing the champagne really necessary?"


"Absolutely,"Howard confirmed, with a hint of amusement. "What would be the purpose of achieving my current position if I couldn't protect my girlfriend from unwanted social pressure?"

"I didn't expect you to see it that way," I admitted. "You should eat something," he suggested. "I have several business matters to address. I'll rejoin you shortly." At a quiet table. I had barely started eating when Sarah Johnson sat beside me,her pregnancy prominently displayed in her designer gown.


"You're more ambitious than I gave you credit for," she observed silkily."Landing Howard Thompson so quickly... impressive strategy.Though we both know you're barely in his league."


I immediately stood, creating distance between us, but this time not from fear. For once, Sarah's attempts at intimidation felt hollow. I was no longer the vulnerable woman she had once targeted.

"Why the retreat?" Sarah asked with false concern. "Afraid to hear the truth? That a man like Howard Thompson is simply using you until someone more suitable comes along? Someone with the right background,connections,education..."


"I'm concerned about your baby," I replied evenly, unmoved by her attempt to undermine me. "I'd hate for you to deliberately harm your child and then attempt to blame me for it."

Sarah's expression froze momentarily.

"You haven't answered my question," she pressed, regaining her composure.


I met her gaze directly, feeling a newfound confidence surge through me.Six months ago, Sarah's words would have devastated me, confirming every insecurity. Now, they barely touched me.

"If your implication is that I pursued Howard strategically, what difference would it make? At least both of us were single when our relationship began," I pointed out, my voce steady and assured.

"Unlike some people who deliberately pursue married individuals. And as for not being in his league?" I smiled, surprising myself with how genuinely untroubled I felt. "Perhaps I'm exactly what Howard needs-someone who values honesty, loyalty, and genuine connection over social climbing. I've built a career on my own merits, Sarah. My illustrations are being published internationally now. I don't need to cling to a man for my identity or security anymore."

Sarah shifted tactics, her expression softening. "You keep bringing up the past, Annie. Could it be you're still not over Philip?"

"You've used that line before," I observed with a cold smile. "I have zero interest in Philip Baker. As for why I keep referencing your actions-if you're entitled to *do* those things, why shouldn't I be entitled to *speak*about them?"


I stood. "If you continue attempting to upset me. I'll simply request a microphone and share with everyone exactly what you did. In detail."

Sarah paled and hurried away.

Catherine dropped into the chair Sarah had vacated, complaining about her father's matchmaking attempts.


Before I could respond, Philip appeared, noticeably intoxicated."Ladies!"he announced too loudly. "Annie,we need to talk."

"Philip, you've had too much to drink," I observed quietly.

"No, I'm perfectly coherent," he insisted, slurring. "Those things you said earlier-about you and Howard-they can't be true. You're lying to me,aren't you?"


"I have no reason to lie to you," I replied, stepping back. "You simply aren t important enough in my life to warrant fabricating stories."

"Impossible!" he erupted. "Six years of marriage! You can't possibly have forgotten everything we shared so qulickly. Even if you don't love me anymore, you couldn't possibly have developed genuine feelings for someone else this soon!"

"For me, moving beyond our relationship hasn't been quick at all," I replied softly. "You seem to have forgotten the circumstances under which I met Howard-when you had thrown me out of ourhome,left me with nothing, nowhere to go..."

Philip flinched visibly.

"In six years of marriage, you never truly cared for me," I continued deliberately."Howard is different. He took me in, supported me through the darkest period of my life-when both my husband and son had betrayed me."


"When I think about the past now. I'm only grateful-grateful that I escaped that marriage, grateful that Howard and Lucy welcomed me into their lives."


Howard appeared beside me. "It's time for us to depart," he stated simply.

As we turned to leave, I noticed Catherine remained, facing Philip with newfound intensity.


"You should maintain distance from Annie going forward," she advised him coldly.

"This is between Annie and me. It doesn't concern you," Philip laughed bitterly.

"As Annie's friend, it absolutely concerns me," Catherine,responded,her voice hardening. "Don't mistake her kindness for weakness. She's chosen not to publicly expose your behavior, but I have no such reservations."

She moved closer to him. "Think carefully,Philip Baker. How would Wall Street react to learning about a man who betrayed his wife,conducted an affair with another man's spouse, and encouraged his five-year-old son to mistreat his mother? What would your investors think?"


Catherine smiled dangerously. "For your own sake, stay away from Annie."
###Chapter 62: Investigation

Philip's POV

I stood in the corner of the grand ballroom,watching Annie and Howard preparing to leave. They were positioned just far enough that I could overhear their conversation without being noticed. The crystal chandeliers cast a soft glow over the remaining guests, many still engaged in animated discussions about donations and networking opportunities.


"Tired?" Howard asked Annie, his voice carrying a gentleness I'd never heard in our business meetings. The transformation was jarring-this was the same man whose ruthless negotiation tactics had become legendary on Wall Street.


"A little," Annie replied with natural ease, "but it's been a lovely evening."

Howard nodded slightly. "I've had the driver prepare the car."

His hand rested lightly on the small of her back as he guided her toward the exit. That casual intimacy sent a sharp pain through my chest. That had once been my privilege. The simple gesture spoke volumes about their relationship-there was a comfort between them that felt alarmingly established.


"Lucy's probably asleep by now," Annie remarked, a soft smile illuminating her features. "She drew a picture at school today that she can't wait to show us."

"About the butterfly expedition?" Howard inquired, genuine interest evident in his tone.


Annie nodded, her expression brightening. "Who would have thought a child whe barely spoke could have so many stories to tell now."

"That's your doing," Howard responded with unmistakable admiration." You gave her security."

I clenched my fist involuntarily. Months ago, Annie had been my wife,with Brian as her only child. Now she spoke of another child as if that were her real family. The easy way they discussed Lucy felt like a deliberate erasure of our history together.

They reached the doorway, where Howard attentivelyadjusted Annie's shawl around her shoulders. "Warm enough?" he asked.

"Perfectly, thank you," Annie answered, looking up at him with warmth radiating from her eyes.

In that moment, I witnessed something I never thought possible-Howard Thompson's perpetually stern business expression softening into tenderness. I'd encountered him at several executive functions over the years,where he was consistently cold and calculating. But the smile he now directed at Annie left me thoroughly shaken.

"If anyone gives you trouble, remember my promise," Howard said softly. "I'll be right beside you."

"I know," Annie responded with complete certainty. "That means everything to me."

Hearing those words, I couldn't help but recall the final months of our marriage. Annie's face had always carried traces of exhaustion and tension then. Now she appeared thoroughly reassured by a simple promise from Howard. The realization stung like a physical wound.

They walked toward the exit, Howard's hand maintaining that protective position against her back. The possessiveness of the gesture was unmistakable yet somehow not overbearing-it communicated both care and respect.

I found myself remembering our early marriage. Annie's expectations had been remarkably simple: respect, affection, and fidelity. I had failed her on all counts.

As they disappeared through the doorway, I drew a deep breath. Annie had never been one to enter relationships carelessly. She'd taken nearly six months to fully open up to me when we first dated. Yet somehow she had accepted Howard this quickly...

A sudden thought struck me: Howard must be manipulating her. That cold-blooded businessman must have given her false promises. I'd heard rumors about his business practices-the dark transactions kept from public view. If Annie knew about those...

I needed to expose Howard's true nature. For Annie's sake, even if she currently despised me.



"Your ex-wife seems to have completely forgotten you," Sarah's voice suddenly came from behind me. interrupting my thoughts.

I turned to face her but didn't respond to her thinly veiled mockery. My mood was already foul, and I had no desire for conversation with anyone,especially her.

"Don't you think you're being presumptuous?" I confronted Sarah directly,my voice laden with barely contained irritation. She appeared entirely unsurprised by my hostility, maintaining perfect composure. This only fueled my annoyance further. "What gives you the right to interfere in matters between Annie and me?"I pressed, feeling deeply violated by her actions. Sarah's eyes darted quickly around us, ensuring no one was eavesdropping,before she leaned closer and lowered her voice. "I'm only thinking about our future."

"What's that supposed to mean?" I stared into her eyes,trying to decipher her true intentions.


After a moment of silence, Sarah suddenly straightened her posture,her expression becoming unusually serious. "Philip, we both know you're still in love with Annie, not me."


Her directness momentarily stunned me. Though I had previously confessed my feelings for Annie to her, hearing her acknowledge it so bluntly still made me uncomfortable.

"I've always known." Sarah continued, her eyes flickering with an emotion I couldn't quite identify. "Yet I chose to stay with you because..." her voice caught slightly.

I felt a wave of guilt wash over me. While I harbored no romantic feelings for Sarah,seeing her apparent vulnerability made me waver.

"Actually. I have a plan," she said after composing herself."I could approach Howard."

"What?" I furrowed my brow in confusion.

"Think about it," Sarah whispered conspiratorially. "If I could attract Howard's attention, make him leave Annie, wouldn't that give you another chance with her?" I studied Sarah's eyes carefully, searching for any sign of deception,but her gaze remained surprisingly sincere. "You would... do that for me?" I asked cautiously. Sarah managed a strained smile. "It benefits us both. You could reclaim Annie's love, while I... I could secure better financial stability." Hearing her explanation, I had to admit it presented a potentially winning strategy for both of us. Though I still questioned her motives, it seemed like our most viable option.

"It seems I misjudged your intentions," I admitted. "I apologize."

"No need," Sarah responded, relief crossing her features. "As long as you understand what I'm trying to do, I'mn satisfied."

Looking at her forced smile, I felt a new respect forming for her. Perhaps she genuinely was trying to help in her own way.

"After your child is born," I said seriously, "I'll provide not only child support but also cover some of your personal expenses."

Sarah's eyes widened slightly, seemingly surprised by my generosity.Her reaction appeared genuine, which made me feel better about our arrangement. I noticed a flash of something cross her eyes before they returned to their usual composed state.




I pulled out my phone and dialed Allen Stark, one of my most reliable connections on Wall Street. I walked to the terrace to ensure privacy for our conversation, the cool evening air providing welcome relief from the stuffy ballroom. "Allen, I need you to investigate Howard Thompson," I said in a hushed tone. "I want everything you can find. The more detailed, the better." Sarah had somehow followed me and now stood by my side. She suddenly leaned in and added, "Also find out what kind of women Howard prefers." I gave her a puzzled look, not understanding why she would focus on such a specific detail. Noticing my confusion, Sarah moved closer to whisper in my ear."Understanding his preferences will help me approach him more effectively.It increases my chances of distracting him, giving you more opportunities to reconnect with Annie."

Her explanation made logical sense. Indeed, if Sarah could capture Howard's attention, Annie would see his true colors.


"Allen, please also include the information Sarah mentioned," I added. "It's important."

"No problem," Allen replied efficiently. "I'll have preliminary results for you tomorrow. I'll put people on investigating his business background.personal life,and preferences."

"Thank you," I responded. "This means a great deal to me."


As I ended the call,I noticed a fleeting smile cross Sarah's lips before her expression returned to one of concern. Perhaps I had imagined it. After all,her willingness to help had already demonstrated her sincerity.I should trust her.

Whatever the cost. I was determined to uncover that man's true nature and bring Annie back to where she belonged.

I believed time would reveal everything. When the investigation concluded,when Annie saw the truth about Howard, she would understand that I was the one she should choose.
###Chapter 63: We Should Interact Like a Nrd Couple Would
Annie's POV

Back in my office at Howard Technologies, I carefully removed the last traces of makeup from the charity gala, feeling both relieved and slightly wistful as I changed back into my regular work clothes. The navy blue evening gown hung pristinely on a nearby rack, its elegant silhouette a reminder of last night's unexpected developments.


"The dress suits you," Howard commented from the doorway. "You should keep it."


I turned to face him, trying to ignore how his presence still made my heart skip slightly. "It's far too expensive for a single evening." I protested softly."I checked the label this morning -it's a custom piece worth nearly half a million dollars."


"Consider it a memento," he replied matter-of-factly. "My girlfriend's first gala dress deserves preservation,don't you think?"

The word 'girlfriend' sent an unexpected warmth through me, even as I reminded myself this was just pretense. "But we're not really..." I began.

"To make others believe we're dating." Howard stated matter-of-factly, "we should interact like a normal couple would."

My heart fluttered at his words. Even though I knew this was just pretense,the mere thought of acting like Howard's girlfriend sent a wave of warmth through me. The memory of lastnight-his steady presence beside me,his hand protectively at my back, the gentle way he'd adjusted my shawl-was still vivid in my mind. "Otherwise, they'll eventually notice something's off," he added when I remained silent, too caught up in my own thoughts to respond.

"How exactly should we do that?" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady despite the surge of anticipation coursing through me. Just playing at being Howard's girlfriend seemed dangerous - how long before these growing feelings became impossible to hide?

Howard's voice took on an almost hypnotic quality. "It's simple. Just treat me as your boyfriend in daily life."

*Just treat him as my boyfriend*. The suggestion made my pulse quicken.How many times had I caught myself already slipping into that mindset?Noticing the way his eyes softened when he looked at Lucy, admiring how his commanding presence filled a room, finding comfort in the quiet moments we shared on the terrace? This "pretense" felt like permission to acknowledge what I'd been trying so hard to ignore.

Even if I were to treat this relationship as real. I couldn't carelessly spend his money. After all... My entire month's salary,while generous,wouldn't cover even one ddress like this.


After careful consideration, I finally said, "Then in the future,please don't give me such expensive gifts."

"Otherwise,Philip will immediately know our relationship isn't real."

Howard looked puzzled."Why?” I explained patiently. "It's about reciprocity. Given my personality, when you give me something. I'll naturally want to give you something in return.And he knows about me." "If the gifts are too expensive. I won't be abe to reciprocate,so I won't accept them." Howard listened to my explanation, then smiled softly. "Alright then."




Later that afternoon, I waited outside the Upper East Side Private Preschoo1, watching as Lucy said goodbye to her friend Penny. The transformation in my daughter over these past months still amazed me -from a silent, withdrawn child to one who now had genuine friendships.

"Mom!" Lucy called out excitedly as she approached. "I have news!"

"What is it,sweetheart?"


"I was chosen for the school speaking competition," she announced proudly. Then her expression turned slightly uncertain. "But... Brian Baker will also be performing."

My heart clenched at the mention of my son's name, but I focused on keeping my expression encouraging. "Are you worried about that?"

Lucy shook her head slowly. "Not for me. I thought... it might make you sad."


The simple consideration in her words touched me deeply."Oh,Lucy," I knelt to her level, "don't worry about me. This is your moment to shine."
 
"Really?" She searched my face carefully. "Really," I confirmed. "I'mn so proud of you for being chosen. When is the competition?" "Next week," she replied, her excitement returning. "Can we practice at home?” "Of course we can." The Long Island estate glowed warmly in the evening light as we pulled up to the entrance. Lucy practically bounced out of the car, her earlier concerns forgotten in her enthusiasm to begin preparing for her speech.

We settled in the living room, surrounding ourselves with paper and pencils. Lucy's dedication to her studies contnued to amaze me-she attacked each new challenge with determination that belied her young age.


"Can we look up some words in the dictionary?" she asked, carefully writing out her speech ideas.


"Of course," I replied, reaching for the children's dictionary we kept nearby."Which words?"


"'Perseverance' and 'determination," she replied without hesitation. "I want to use big words in my speech."

As we worked through the definitions together. Lucy suddenly looked up."Mom,could we maybe get some elementary school books? For extra practice?"


Before I could respond, Howard spoke from where he'd been quietly observing. "I have something to show you both first."

He led us up to the third floor, stopping before a door I hadn't noticed before. When he opened it. Lucy gasped in delight. The room had been transformed into a magical playroom, filled with educational toys, art supplies, and what appeared to be every imaginable tool for creative learning. "Dad!" Lucy exclaimed, her eyes wide. "This is amazing!" Then,showing that remarkable matuity that still caught me off guard,she turned to Howard."Could Penny come play sometimes? She'd love these toys too." Howard's lips curved in that slight smile that I'd learned to recognize as genuine pleasure. "I thought you might ask that. That's why f ordered two
of everything."

Lucy's face lit up even brighter."Can I call her now?"

After getting our approval. Lucy carefully dialed Penny's number on the house phone. I listened as she excitedly described the playroom to her friend, then handed the phone to me so I could discuss arrangements with Sue Peterson.


"We'd be happy to have Penny visit," I assured Sue. "Edward and Eleanor have offered to handle the transportation."

As I finished coordinating details with Sue, I caught Howard watching me with an expression I couldn't quite read. When I raised an eyebrow in question, he simply shook his head slightly, that ghost of a smile still playing at his lips.

Later, watching Lucy carefully organize her new educational games, I felt an overwhelming surge of gratitude. Months ago, I'd been a broken woman, betrayed by my husband and son. Now, somehow, I'd found myself part of something that felt increasingly like a real family.

"Stop overthinking," Howard's quiet voice interrupted my reverie. As always, he'd read my expression perfectly.

"How do you always know?" I asked,genuinely curious. "You have a particular expression when you're analyzing things too deeply."he replied matter-of-factly. "Your brow furrows slightly,and you bite your lower lip." The fact that he'd noticed such small details about me sent an unexpected warmth through my chest. *This is just pretend*, I reminded myself firmly.But watching him help Lucy arrange her new toys, seeing the gentle patience in his interactions with her, I couldn't help but wish it wasn't.
###Chapter 64: Breaking Free

Brian's POV

I stood at my usual spot near the Upper East Side Private Preschool,watching Mom and Lucy from a distance. Lucy was showing Mom something she'd drawn - a butterfly, I think. Mom crouched down to Lucy's level, listening intently as the little girl gestured excitedly. The way Mom looked at Lucy, with such gentle warmth in her eyes, made my chest hurt.
"Your mother received the letter?" I asked Mitchell, our driver, without taking my eyes off them.

"Yes. young master. I delivered it personally and saw her take it inside."

I frowned, studying Mom's expression as she smiled at something Lucy said. "But she looks... normal. Like she never got it." My fingernails dug into my palms. "Maybe she threw it away without reading it."

"Perhaps she needs time," Mitchell suggested carefully.

I barely heard him. Watching Mom with Lucy brought back memories I'd been trying to forget: Mom reading me bedtime stories, her voice different for each character. Mom kissing my scraped knees better. Mom staying up late to help me with projects, even when she was tired from work. Mom always being there, until suddenly she wasn't. The familiar anger rose in my throat. They'd misled me about her. All those times they said Mom was boring and uninteresting, that she didn't know how to have fun, that our family would be happier without her-I'd believed them. I remembered now how Mom used to take extra illustration jobs, working late into the night. I'd thought she was just being boring and serious all the time, but now I understood-she'd been saving money for my future all along. Something caught in my chest as I watched Mom adjusting Lucy's backpack straps with gentle hands. Those same hands used to straighten my collar, brush my hair back from my face...

"Young master?" Wilson's voice pulled me from my thoughts. "Should we follow them today?"

I shook my head sharply. "No. Take me back to the car."

Once inside the vehicle, Mitchell studied me in the rearview mirror. "This is unusual for you. Normally at this time, you'd want to watch your mother for a while longer."

"I hate Dad!" The words burst out of me with surprising force. "He and Sarah made Mom seem so boring and unimportant. But they were wrong!Sarah's horrible. They workedtogether to make me think badly of Mom."My voice cracked. "I hate them both!"

Mitchell remained silent, but I could see concern in his eyes as he watched me through the mirror.

"She was saving money for me," I continued, quieter now. "All those times she worked so seriously-she wasn't being boring. She was trying to make sure I'd be okay." I swallowed hard. "We still have our old apartment, don't we? The one Mom and I lived in before?"

"Yes,young master."

"Take me there," I decided. "There's something I need to check." As we drove, I remembered more details about the apartment-how Mom had carefully explained that it would always be mine, no matter what happened. At the time, I hadn't understood why she'd seemed so serious about it. Now I did. My phone buzzed - Dad calling. I stared at the screen for a moment before answering.
 
"Brian? Where are you? You should be at your usual spot watching your mother by now."

I forced my voice to sound weak. "I'm at the hospital. My stomach really hurts."


"Hospital? Which one? I'll come right away-"

"No!" I interrupted quickly. "I mean... Ms. Taylor is with me. The doctor says it's just a small problem. I'll be fine after some rest."

There was a pause. "Are you sure? I can reschedule my meetings-"

"Please don't." I insisted. "I don't want to bother you. Ms. Taylor will take care of me."


After I hung up, guilt gnawed at my stomach for lying. But I couldn't let Dad interfere-not now, when I finally knew what I needed to do.

The apartment still smelled the same - like Mom's lavender candles and the old books she loved to read to me. Ms. Taylor, my tutor, helped me search through the study while Mitchell checked the master bedroom.

"Young master," Mitchell called after about an hour. "I foundsomething."

In Mom's old closet, behind a panel I never knew existed, we discovered a safe. The combination was my birthday - of course it was. Inside were exactly what I'd hoped to find; property documents, investment account details, and bank statements showing regular deposits Mom had made for years. My hands trembled as I read through the papers. Even after Dad asked her to leave, even when I was cold to her, Mom had kept adding to these accounts, There was enough here for me to live comfortably, to pay for my education, to be independent. "She never stopped thinking about my future," I whispered, more to myself than to Mitchell and Ms. Taylor. "Even when I.., when I was so cold to her..."

Ms. Taylor placed a gentle hand on my shoulder. "What would you like to do now?"

I straightened my spine, trying to look as grown-up as I felt in that moment. "I want to live here. Away from Dad and Sarah." I turned to face them both. "Will you help me? I'll double your salaries - I can afford it now. You've both been so kind to me, even when I was... difficult."

They exchanged glances before Mitchell spoke. "Young master, are you certain about this? Your father will be very angry."

"I don't care!" But my voice shook slightly. "I can't stay there anymore,watching them talk badly about Mom. Dad doesn't really want me - he just wants to use me to make Mom feel bad." I took a deep breath. "Please.You're the only ones who've always been honest with me."

Ms. Taylor nodded slowly. "We'll help you. But we'll need to plan this carefully."

As they discussed logistics -what to move first, how to arrange schedules,which stories to tell Dad - I walked through the apartment, remembering.Here was where Mom and I used to have breakfast together. There was where we'd build blanket forts on rainy days. The wall still had marks showing how I'd grown taller over the years.

I stopped in front of my old bedroom. The last time I'd been here,I'd acted cold toward Mom, told her I didn't want to be around her. I'd believed what they said about her being boring and uninteresting. I'd been so stupid.

Tears burned in my eyes as I thought about how Mom must have felt, seeing me act that way. How much it must have hurt when I was cold to her, when I told everyone at school that she wasn't fun to be around.And still, she'd kept adding money to these accounts, kept making sure I'd be taken care of.

"I'm sorry, Mom," I whispered to the empty room. "I'm so sorry."
 ###Chapter 65: Between Real and Pretense

Annie's POV

Penny's dramatic gasp echoed through the third-floor playroom as Lucy showed off their new domain. "This is better than a real theater!" she exclaimed, immediately striking a pose worthy of Broadway. I leaned against the doorframe, watching as the aspiring young actress surveyed her new stage with professional scrutiny.

"Let's pretend we're in a magical palace," Penny suggested,arranging the dolls in a circle. "These can be the royal family."


"The princess needs a best friend," Lucy added softly, carefully placing anotherdoll next to Penny's princess. Her eyes lit up as she spoke,a far cry from her usual reserved demeanor.


I watched as their story unfolded. The princess and her friend discovered a magical garden,rescued a fairy from an evil spell, and hosted a grand celebration - all through the voices of their dolls. Lucy followed Penny's lead naturally, adding her own ideas in a way that still surprised me.

"The princess is lonely in her big palace," Penny declared dramatically.making her doll pace back and forth.

Lucy picked up her doll and made it hug the princess. "Don't worry.I'll always be your friend," she said, her voice carrying such sincerity that my heart melted.

They played until both were tired out. Penny flopped onto the carpet first her limbs sprawled like a starfish. Lucy hesitated for just a moment before lying down next to her, mirroring her position. They didn't speak, didn't move -just existed together in comfortable silence. Looking at them, I realized Lucy had found something precious: a friend who understood her without words. "Annie." Howard's quiet voice drew my attention to where he stood in the hallway. With a subtle gesture, he directed my gaze toward Edward and Eleanor Parker, Lucy's grandparents,who were watching the girls from the opposite doorway.

The change in them was remarkable. When I'd first met them, both had carried the heavy weight of grief, their daughter's loss evident in every tired line of their faces. Now, observing their granddaughter's animated play and natural happiness, their expressions had softened. Eleanor's hand rested on her husband's arm, and though neither smiled openly,the rigid tension that had characterized their posture had eased considerably.

I stepped back quietly, unwilling to intrude on this moment of healing.This too was Howard's doing - his careful orchestration creating an environment where Lucy could help mend her grandparents' broken hearts while finding her own voice again.


This was what healing looked like, I realized. A little girI playing freely,grandparents rediscovering joy, a family slowly knitting itself back together.
The warmth of it filled me completely - not just because Lucy was happy,but because I was part of this. Part of a real family, messy and complicated and wonderful.

Watching them, I finally understood what had been missing in my previous marriage. This wasn't about perfect appearances or social status.It was about belonging, about hearts connecting. About finding home in each other's presence




As evening approached, Howard led me to the second-floor terrace. The setting sun cast long shadows across the manicured grounds, painting everything in soft golden light. I was acutely aware of his presence beside me-the subtle cologne he wore, the warmth radiating from his tall frame. "Your hand," he stated simply, extending his own toward me.

Before I could question his intent, he added in a lower voice, "Philip has been following you. He's watching from the south gardens right now."

My eyes instinctively started to turn in that direction, but Howard's hand gently caught my chin. "Don't look," he murmured. "Act natural."

I found myself studying his fingers - long, elegant, yet unmistakably strong. When our palms met, an electric curent seemed to race up my arm.His hand completely enveloped mine, the size difference sending an unexpected thrill through me.

Without warning, he drew me onto his lap. The sudden intimacy made my breath catch- I could feel the solid muscle of his thighs beneath me,the breadth of his chest against my back. His breath ghosted across my ear as he spoke: "Don't mnove,Annie."

My heart thundered against my ribs. This was supposed to be pretense, I reminded myself desperately. Just a show for Philip, who I knew was watching from somewhere in the distance. But my body's response felt anything but artificial.

"Tell me," Howard's voice dropped lower, "did Philip ever make you feel like this?"

The question should have angered me, but instead sent heat flooding through my veins. "No," I admitted, surprising myself with my honesty. In six years of marriage, Philip had never sparked this kind of raw awareness in me.

Howard's lips brushed my neck - the barest touch, yet it sent shockwaves through my system. Before I could process the sensation, he turned me in his arms and claimed my mouth with his. The kiss was controlled yet passionate, his expertise evident in every movement. My hands found their way to his chest of their own accord, feeling the strong, steady beat of his heart beneath my palms.

"Annie," Howard's voice was gentle as he stepped back slightly, though his hand remained protectively at my waist. "Are you all right?"

The genuine concern in his tone made my heart flutter. Even in this "pretend" relationship, his consideration felt real. I could still feel Philip's gaze burning into us from across the room, but somehow it mattered less and less.


"I'm fine," I assured Howard, surprised to find it was true. For the first time since my divorce, I feltgenuinely secure. Protected. Not because Howard was acting as a shield against my past, but because his steady presence gave me the strength to face it myself.

"Philip is still watching," Howard observed quietly, his thumb tracing a soothing pattern against my waist.

"Let him," I replied with newfound confidence. "I don't care anymore."

Howard's eyes searched mine, and something in his expression softened."Your courage continues to impress me," he said simply.

The quiet sincerity in his voice warmed me more than any passionate display could have. In that moment, I realized how dangerously close I was to forgetting this was all pretense. The way Howard looked at me,the gentle strength of his touch, the careful attention he paid to my comfort-it felt too real to be an act.

"We should join the others," I suggested, though I made no move to step away from him.

Howard nodded but didn't immediately release me. "Remember," he said softly,"I meant what I said. I'll protect you."
She's Mine

Philip's POV

The privet hedge provided perfect cover as I watched Annie through the second-floor windows of Howard Thompson's Long Island estate. My expensive Italian leather shoes were ruined by the damp earth, but I barely noticed. All my attention was focused on tracking her movements through the house.


My phone vibrated.Sarah.

"What kind of flowers does Annie like?"she asked without preamble.

The question caught me off guard. "What?"

"Annie. Your ex-wife. What kind of flowers does she prefer?" Sarah's tone carried an edge of impatience.

I frowned, trying to recall. Had Annie ever mentioned favorite flowers? She must have, during our sixyears of marriage, but I drew a blank.

"Does she like classical music?" Sarah pressed when I remained silent."What about art? Fashion preferences?"

"Why do yo care about Annie's tastes?" I demanded, irritation rising.

"Research," Sarah replied smoothly. "When I see her again, I want to have conversation topics ready. You know how these things work -the more you can relate to someone's interests, the easier it is to build rapport."

Her words triggered a sudden memory; Annie excitedly showing me her new illustration portfolio, her eyes bright with passion as she explained each piece. I'd barely glanced at it, muttering something about being too busy with work.

"Besides," Sarah continued, her voice taking on a calculatng tone, "don't you think Howard Thompson would be more likely to notice me if I shared some of Annie's... qualities?"

The implication made my stomach turn. "You want to copy Annie?"

"Not copy exactly," Sarah corrected. "Just... incorporate certain elements.The things that clearly appeal to Howard. Her style, her mannerisms..."She paused deliberately. "The way she carries herself."


I remembered how Annie used to approach everything with quiet determination. Even when I'd been cruel- and I could admit now that I had been cruel-she'd maintained her dignity. Howard clearly valued that quality in her.

"She was always reading," I found myself saying. "Children's books mostly,studying illustration styles. And she loved the scent of lilacs..." My voice trailed off as I realized how little attention I'd paid to her interests during our marriage.

"Perfect," Sarah purred. "What else?"

"She pursued me first," I admitted, the words spilling out unexpectedly."She was so genuine in her affection. After we married, she was unfaiingly kind, always putting my needs first..."

"And you took it for granted," Sarah finished when I fell silent.

"Yes." The admission felt like swallowing glass. "Whenever she wanted to celebrate holidays or create special moments, I'd dismiss her. Claim I was too busy with work, or that I just didn't understand romantic gestures. She always forgave me."

"How convenient for you," Sarah observed dryly. "And now Howard Thompson is reaping the benefits of your negligence."

As if summoned by her words, movement on the second-floor terrace caught my eye. Howard appeared, leading Annie by the hand. My throat constricted as I watched him draw her onto his lap.

"I have to go," I choked out, ending the call.

The scene before me was torture, yet I couldn't look away. Howard's hand rested possessively on Annie's waist -*my* Annie's waist. When he kissed her neck, bile rose in my throat. My hands trembled violently as I gripped the hedge branches, barely registering the thorns cutting into my palms.

Then Howard turned her in his arms and claimed her mouth. The kiss was clearly passionate-I could see Annie's hands pressed against his chest, not pushing him away but drawing him closer. My vision blurred,tears of rage burning my eyes.

*This isn't happening. This can't be happening.*

But it was. I watched, my chest constricting painfully, as Annie melted into Howard's embrace. The intimacy of their interaction was undeniable.This wasn't some business arrangement or casual flirtation - the way they moved together spoke of genuine connection.

She was truly slipping away from me. Annie would never forgive me now..



She had a new life, a new love.

With trembling fingers, I dialed my friend's number. "Do you have any results from the investigation I requested?"

"Brother, it hasn't even been a day!" The exasperation in his voice was clear. "How could I possibly have anything yet?"

"Just wait a bit longer."

Though I could hear the frustration in his tone, I pressed on desperately." But I need it as soon as possible."

I couldn't bear watching Howard and Annie interact as a couple any longer. Howard's excellence was undeniable - if I allowed Annie to keep spending time with him...her love for him would eventually surpass what she once felt for me.

By then, I'd have no chance at all.

But I had to try! I couldn't just watch helplessly as Annie belonged to someone else.


"Fine," my friend sighed. "I'll work overtime on this for you these next few days."

"Thank you." I continued staring at them masochistically.

The day I got the evidence, I would take it straight to Annie.Once she became disillusioned with Howard, I wouldn't have to watch them being intimate anymore... I wouldn't have to feel this agonizing pain.

Most importantly, that would be my chance to appear by Annie's side,to comfort her properly. She would surely be moved by my devotion and fall in love with me again.

The thought finally lifted my spirits slightly.

Then I watched as Howard lifted Annie into his arms. She buried her face in his chest as they disappeared from the terrace.

What were they going to do?

I lurched forward, my feet carrying me toward the front entrance before my brain could process the action. The security guard's hand on my chest brought me up short.

"Sir, this is private property," he stated firmly. "I need to see Annie," I gasped, my breathing ragged, "Annie Baker. She's inside with Howard Thompson."

"Ms. Baker is not available," the guard replied, his expression hardening."Please leave the premises immediately."

Humiliation burned through me as I stumbled backward. My trembling fingers found my phone, desperately dialing Howard's number.

It rang once. Twice. Three times.

"Thompson speaking." His voice was calm, controlled - asif he hadn't just been kissing my wife. *Ex-wife*, a traitorous voice in my mind corrected.

"Stay away from her," I snarled, my voice barely recognizable to my own ears. "She's mine. She'lI always be mine."

There was a brief pause before Howard replied, his tone carrying a dangerous edge. "Mr. Baker, you appear to be experiencing some confusion about boundaries. Allow me to clarify: Annie is not your property. She never was. Furthermore, any attempt to harass or intimidate her will be met with immediate legal consequences. Do we understand each other?"


The line went dead before I could respond. I doubled over, violent tremors wracking my body as I pictured Howard returning to Annie, touching her,loving her in ways I never had.


*She's mine*, I thought desperately. *Mine. And I'll make her remember that. Whatever it takes,*
###Chapter 67: Unexpected Interruption

Howard's POV

I ended the call with Philip Baker, his desperate threats still echoing in my mind: "She's mine. She'll always be mine." The possessiveness in his voice triggered an unfamiliar surge of anger that I carefully controlled.

Annie stood watching me, her expression a mix of concern and something else that made my usual analytical detachment waver.

"Your ex-husband seems unable to accept your happiness," I observed,keeping my tone measured despite my lingering irritation.

Annie laughed softly. "He probably can't stand seeing me better off than before."


I studied her face. The defensive tension that had characterized her early days at Howard Technologies was gone. She'd grown stronger,more confident. The transformation was... satisfying to witness.

"He indeed lacks the capacity to provide you with an improved quality of life," I stated. The words came out more intensely than intended.

"Perhaps he just wanted me to witness his 'perfect love story' with Sarah."Her voice carried amusement rather than pain now.


I moved closer, drawn by an impulse I didn't bother analyzing. "Perhaps we should consider making this arrangement more permanent."


A blush colored her cheeks. Her eyes met mine, carrying equal measures of anticipation and hesitation. My pulse quickened - an unusual physiological response that I chose not to examine too closely.

*Say yes*,I thought. *Just nod. I know you feel it too, Annie. This stopped being pretense long ago.* "Dad! Mom!" Lucy's voice interrupted the moment. She appeared with Penny close behind. "Penny's tired. Can we take her home now?"

Annie stepped back quickly, her hand rising to her flushed cheek. I suppressed a flash of frustration at the timing.

"Of course, sweetheart," Annie replied, her voice slightly unsteady.




In the car, Penny and Lucy's excited chatter filled the back seat despite their obvious fatigue.

"And when the fairy queen granted us three wishes," Penny was saying,"we used the first one to make all the flowers sing!"

"The second wish was for butterfly wings," Lucy added softly.

"Mom can play these games with me now," Penny said. "Ever since she started working at Thompson uncle's company, she smiles a lot more."

"Just like my mom," Lucy agreed, reaching for Annie's hand.

Penny turned to me. "Thank you, Thompson uncle, for helping my mom."

The simple sincerity in her voice caught me off guard. Through the mirror,
I saw Annie's expression soften in a way that made my chest tighten unexpectedly.

The girls drifted to sleep, Lucy's head resting on Penny's shoulder. I found myself imagining more evenings like this - Annie beside me, Lucy happy and secure. The domesticity of the thought should have alarmed me.Instead,it felt right.




The evening's tranquility shattered as we approached Sue Peterson's apartment building. The security door stood conspicuously ajar, its lock visibly damaged. Something was wrong.

"Annie." I kept my voice deliberately calm. "Stay here with the children.Lock the doors."

She caught my eye in the rearview mirror, understanding immediately. "Five minutes before I call the police?"

I nodded once. "Exactly."

Lucy's small hand caught my sleeve. "Dad..."

"Everything will be fine," I assured her, noting how she pressed closer to Penny, both girls drawing comfort from each other's presence.

The stairwell would be quieter than the elevator. Fourth floor,west corridor. Dave's raised voice carried clearly through the damaged door.

"You think you can just cut me off?" His words dripped with drunken rage. "After everything I've done for you?"

Sue's response was too quiet to discern, but the underlying fear was evident.Something crashed against a wall.

"The money stops when I say it stops!" Dave's voice rose to a roar."You think you're better than me now? With your fancy new job and your rich friends?"


A cold fury settled over me at the sound of another crash. Without hesitation, I kicked the door open.

The scene froze: Sue bound to a kitchen chair with what appeared to be a necktie, Dave looming over her with his fist raised.

His head snapped toward me, face contorting through a fapid succession of emotions - surprise, fear, then misplaced bravado."Who the hell do you think you are?" he snarled, taking an unsteady step forward. "This is a private matter between me and my wife!"

"Ex-wite," I corrected coldly, "whom you're currently assaulting."

Dave's face flushed an ugly red. "You don't know anything!" he shouted,gesturing wildly, "She owes mel After everything I've done, all the sacrifices T've made "


I didn't let him finish. One precise kick sent him stumbling backward.His eyes widened in shocked outrage as he clutched his stomach.


"You,,. you can't..," he wheezed, face alternating between pale and flushed."Do you know who I am?"

"A coward who threatens women," I stated flatly, advancing toward him."Who breaks into homes and demands money he hasn't earned."


Dave's expression twisted into something ugly. "She's nothing without me!I made her what she is!" He lunged forward unsteadily. "You think you can just-"


Another kick dropped him to his knees. His bravado crumbled into sniveling panic. "Wait, please... I didn't mean... I was just..."

I looked at Sue, still bound to the chair, trembling but unharmed."Annie and the others are waiting outside," I told her calmly. "Let them help you get those ropes off."


Sue nodded frantically,relief flooding her features as she managed to stand,still tied to the chair, and made her way carefully toward the door.

"Thank you," Sue whispered, hurrying toward the door.

I turned back to Dave, who had pressed himself against the wall, all his earlier bravado replaced by naked fear. His eyes darted between me and the exit like a cornered animal.

"Wait..." he stammered. "We can talk about this... I was just upset... I didn't really mean to..."


I advanced slowly, my expression making it clear that the time for talk had passed.

I'd make sure he would learn his lesson this time.
###Chapter 68: So Is It That You Don't Love Da
Annie's POV

My heart thundered against my ribsas I watched Howard disappear into Sue's apartment building. The damaged security door swung lazily on íts hinges, a stark reminder of Dave's violent intrusion. Lucy and Penny huddled together in the back seat, their small hands clasped tightly.

"Should we call the police now?" Lucy whispered, her voice carrying that remarkable maturity that still caught me off guard.

Before I could answer, Sue burst through the security door, still partially bound to a kitchen chair with what appeared to be a necktie. Her usually immaculate appearance was disheveled, face pale with fear. Without hesitation, I jumped out to help her.

"Are you hurt?" I asked, quickly working to loosen the makeshift restraints.

Sue shook her head, though her hands trembled violently. "He... he was waiting when I got home. Said he needed money." Her voice cracked. "I've been trying so hard to build a new life, to show Penny that we don't need...



"Mommy?" Penny's worried voice carried from the car. "Is it the bad man again?"


Sue's expression crumpled at her daughter's words. "Everything's fine,sweetheart," she called back, though her voice wavered. "Just stay in the car with Lucy."


I finished freeing Sue from the chair just as heavy footsteps echoed from the stairwell. Dave emerged first, stumbling backward, with Howard following in measured steps. The contrast between them was stark -Dave's disheveled aggression against Howard's controlled power. "You can't do this!" Dave slurred, his earlier bravado reduced to desperate threats. "She's my wife!"

"Ex-wife," Howard corrected coldly. "A distinction you seem unable to grasp."

Something in Howard's tone made my pulse quicken. I'd seen him command boardrooms and navigate corporate takeovers,but this was different. This wasn't the calculated CEO- this was raw protective instinct barely contained by civilized restraint.

"You think you're better than me?" Dave sneered, though he kept retreating from Howard's advance. "Coming here in your fancy suit,playing hero? I know what you really want. Think you can buy her with that cushy job?"

Howard's expression didn't change, but something dangerous flickered in his eyes. "Ms. Peterson is a valued employee whose safety and wellbeing are my concern. Your implications say more about your character than mine."


Police sirens wailed in the distance, growing closer. Dave's face contorted with panic as he realized his situation. He lunged forward suddenly, but Howard intercepted him with practiced ease, pinning him against the wall until uniformed officers flooded the entrance.

As the police led Dave away in handcuffs, the building's security team finally appeared, looking distinctly uncomfortable under Sue's withering glare.


"I pay premium rates for security," she stated, her professional composure returning now that the immediate danger had passed. "Yet you let an unauthorized person enter without proper verification?"

The head of security shifted uneasily. "He said he was your husband,ma'am. Had some story about Penny leaving her backpack..."

"And you didn't think to call and confirm?" Sue's voice carried the sharp edge I recognized from corporate negotiations. "What exactly am I paying for if you can't perform basic identity verification?"

While Sue dealt with the security team, I found myself studying Howard.He stood slightly apart, his usual pristine appearance barely disturbed despite the physical confrontation. Something about seeing him like this-protective, powerful, yet perfectly controlled - made my heart race in a way that had nothing to do with the evening's drama.

I remembered our conversation about pretending to be a couple, how clinical and strategic it had seemed at the time. But watching him now,I couldn't ignore how real it felt when he held me at the charity gala. The way my body responded to his touch hadn't been pretense at all.




The next morning, I paused outside Lucy's bedroom,caught off guard by the sound of her practicing her speech. Her voice carried clearly through the partially open door, confident in a way that still amazed me after her months of silence.


"The butterfly starts as a tiny egg," she read carefully, "but through determination and patience, it transforms into something beautiful."

My throat tightened with emotion. How far she'd comne from the silent,withdrawn child I'd first met. Now here she was, preparing for a public speaking competition.


"Mom?" Lucy caught my eye in the mirror as she adjusted her dress."How was that?"

"Beautiful, sweetheart," I said honestly, moving to help her with a stubborn button. "Your delivery gets stronger every day." She beamed at the praise, then fell quiet as she watched me in the mirror.After a moment, she spoke again, her voice thoughtful. "Mom, what happens after people get divorced?"

The question caught me off guard, but I tried to keep my voice steady."What do you mean,sweetheart?"


"Like... with money and stuff," she elaborated, fidgeting with her sleeve."Penny said her mom didn't have any money saved up when se left her dad. That's why the bad man could be mean to her last night."

My heart ached at her precocious understanding. "That's a very grown-up observation," I said carefully. "But you don't need to worry about Sue. She has a good job now, and people who will protect her."

Lucy nodded, but her expression remained serious. "But it got me thinking..."She turned to face me directly. "We're kind of like Penny's family,aren't we? Sort of... but not really?"

"What do you mean?"

"Well, I call you Mom, and I call him Dad," she explained with child-like logic. "We live together in the same house... we're a family, right? But you're not married like other parents."

I felt my chest tighten. "Lucy..."

"If you're not married," she continued, her voice taking on a slight edge of worry, "what happens if something goes wrong? Like with Penny's parents?"

"That's... that's different," I tried to explain, though my own heart was racing now.

Lucy's eyes narrowed with determination. "Then why aren't you married?I'm going to ask Dad why he hasn't married you yet." "Lucy, wait," I caught her arm gently. "Marriage... marriage isn't just about living together or being a family. It needs love."


"But don't you love each other?" she asked, her eyes wide with genuine confusion. "Is that the problem? You don't love Dad? Or..." her voice dropped to a whisper, "Dad doesn't love you?"


The innocent question forced me to confront feelings I'd been carefully avoiding. Our arrangement with Howard had started as a simple solution-a shield against Philip's increasingly desperate attempts to insert himself back into my life. Astrategic move, nothing more.


But somewhere along the way, the lines had blurred. I found myself watching him when he wasn't looking, memorizing the way his expression softened when Lucy showed him her drawings, how his hand felt protective and warm against my back when we walked together. The way my heart raced when he kissed me at the charity gala hadn't been pretense at all.


Last night, seeing him protect Sue with such controlled power, I'd felt something shift inside me. The truth was, I wanted this pretense to be real.I wanted lazy Sunday mornings and shared coffee and quiet evening conversations that didn't end. I wanted...

But could I risk the peaceful life we'd built? Lucy was finally thriving,my career was blossoming, and for the first time since my divorce, I felt truly secure. Opening my heart again meant risking everything - not just for me,but for Lucy too. The memory of my failed marriage with Philip still cast long shadows over any thoughts of romance.


Before I could untangle these conflicting emotions, a shadow fell across the doorway.Howard stood there, his expression unreadable as his eyes met mine in the mirror. My heart stuttered in my chest as Lucy's question seemed to echo in the suddenly thick air between us: "So is it that you don't love Dad, or Dad d oesn't love you?" The answer caught in my throat, too dangerous to voice, too powerful to deny.
###Chapter 69: Six Years of Marriage

Philip's POV

My hands clenched the phone until the case creaked. Howard's cold dismissal burning in my ears. Annie was with him now.M∗Annie.In his bed. The thought sent waves of nausea through me as rage and grief clawed at my chest. She was supposed to be mine forever-the divorce papers shouldn't have changed that.

"How dare she?" I snarled into the darkness of my car, my voice raw and unfamiliar. Divorced or not, this was betrayal. Six years of marriage, and now she was spreading her legs for that cold bastard? The steering wheel groaned under my grip as violent images flooded my mind- Howard touching her, kissing her, taking what belonged to mne. Red tinged the edges of my vision as an animal sound of pain escaped my throat.

They were probably doing it right now, her body welcoming him like she used to welcome me. The thought sent me spiraling into a pit of rage and despair so deep I could barely breathe. It didn't matter that we'd been divorced for months. In my heart, in the only truth that mattered, she was still my wife.


Ten minutes later, I burst into the private room of our usual club,where Allen waited with several other friends. The expensive whiskey was already laid out-they knew me well enough to anticipate my needs.

"She's really left me," I choked out, my voice rough with emotion as I collapsed into a chair. The words hung heavy in the air of the private room,joining the haze of cigarette smoke from Allen's expensive cigars. "Annie's actually gone."

Allen shifted uncomfortably in his seat, clearly unsure how to handle my uncharacteristic display of vulnerability. I couldn't blame him -I barely recognized myself. The successful CEO of Philip Investment Group reduced to a drunken mess in a private club room at midnight.

"How could she just,,, stop loving me?" The words spilled out, bitter and raw, "Six years of marringe. Six years where she gave me everything. Her devotion, her kindness.." My hand trembled as I reached for the bottle again."And now she's with "him*,"

The memory of Howard's hands on Annle's waist, his lips against her neck,sent a fresh wave of nausea through me that had nothing to do with the alcohol. "They're probably together right now," I said, my voice cracking. "In his bed..."


"Annie was always too simple for someone like you," Allen began cautiously."A small-town girl who couldn't understand our world. Maybe this is for the best-"


"Don't." I cut him off sharply, an unexpected surge of protectiveness rising through my drunken haze. "You don't get to talk about her like that. None of you do." The same friends who'd encouraged my affair with Sarah,who'd laughed about Annie's 'provincial' background at dinner parties - they had no right to judge her. "She was worth ten of Sarah,and I was too blind to see it."

The irony wasn't lost on me - defending the woman I'd betrayed to the friends who'd encouraged that betrayal. But the thought of anyone speaking ill of Annie made my blood boil. She'd been perfect. The problem had been me, though I couldn't bring myself to fully admit it even now.

"The investigation is still ongoing," Allen offered carefully. "These things take time if we want thorough results..."

I barely heard him, lost in memories of Annie's smile, the way she used to look at me with such pure affection. When had I stopped noticing? When had I started taking her devotion for granted? My phone buzzed - my mother's name lighting up the screen. I almost ignored it. but years of ingrained filial obligation had me answering automatically.


"Philip," my mother's volce carried that familiar note of barely concealed disapproval. "I've been thinking about your situation with Sarah."

I pressed my fingers against my temples, trying to ward off the approaching headache. "Mother,please..."

"You two should reconcile," she continued as if I hadn't spoken. "It's the sensible solution. Sarah knows how to behave appropriately in our social circle, unlike..." She left Annie's name unspoken but clearly implied.

"I can't," I replied, the words scraping my throat.

"Philip, you need to stop this obsession with Annie. It's beneath you."Mother's voice turned sharp. "After eveything she's done? Cutting off contact with her own son? Sarah at least knows how to properly care for Brian."


"She was my first love," I said slowly, each word deliberate despite my drunken state: "My white moonlight. I thought having her would make me happy..." A bitter laugh escaped me. "But I ruined everything."

"Philip-"

"Stop pushing, Mother," I interrupted, surprising us both with mny firmness."I won't doit."


The line went dead. I stared at the phone, momentarily shocked by my own defiance. The room spun slightly as I stood, waving off Allen's concerned gesture.


Mother's words echoed in my head as I ended the call:"Philip,you need to stop this obsession with Annie. It's beneath you." Beneath me? I laughed bitterly, the sound harsh in the emptiness of my penthouse. The same penthouse that had once been filled with Annie's presence - her books scattered on coffee tables, her illustration supplies neatly organized in the corner desk, the gentle scent of her lavender candles lingering in every room.

The contrast between Annie and Sarah struck me with sudden clarity.Annie, who had worked tirelessly, saving money for Brian's future while managing our home. Sarah, whno seemed to view my credit cards as her personal shopping account, who treated my son as a mere prop in her calculated performance of devoted stepmother.

My phone buzzed with another text from Sarah - something about needing funds for new furniture. I ignored it, my thoughts fixed on the memory of Annie at the gala. The quiet confidence she'd carried herself with,so different from Sarah's practiced seduction. Had Annie always possessed that strength, and I'd been too blind to see it?

"One more drink," I muttered, reaching for the crystal decanter. The whiskey burned going down, but it couldn't erase the image of Howard's hands on Annie's waist, the way she'd melted into his kiss.

Annie never looked at me that way, a traitorous voice whispered in my mind. Even when things were good between us, she never seemed so...complete.


The room spun slightly as I stood. Allen - or was it Marcus?-had insisted on driving me home after finding me at the bar. "You're in no state to drive," he'd said, his voice carrying equal parts concern and judgment. "What's happened to you, Philip?"

What had happened? I'd lost everything that mattered while chasing things that didn't. The morning light stabbed at my eyes as consciousness crept back unwelcome. My head throbbed in time with my heartbeat,mouth dry as sand. For a moment, in that hazy space between sleep and waking, I could almost hear Annie's voice: "You've been drinking again...look how much pain you're in..."

The phantom comfort was worse than the hangover.How many times had she nursed me through mornings like this? Her gentle hands pressing aspirin into my palm, her quiet movements as she drew the curtains against the cruel sunlight. I'd never properly thanked her for any of it.

The drive to Howard Technologies felt endless. Every red light was another opportunity for my mind to torture me with images of Annie and Howard together. Her smile - the one that used to be mine- now directed at him. Her trust, her affection, everything I'd carelessly discarded,now given to a man who clearly knew their worth.

"Six years," I whispered to my reflection in the rearview mirror. "Six years of marriage and I'm only now understanding what I had."

The sight of her with Howard made breathing difficult. The casual intimacy between them at the gala had been bad enough, but knowing they were probably sharing a bed now... The steering wheel creaked under my white-knuckled grip.

Howard Technologies' underground parking garage was quiet at this early hour. I recognized his reserved space, positioned my car to block the entrance. My heart pounded as I waited, rehearsing what I'd say when I saw Annie. I had to make her understand - I'd been a fool, but I could change.I would change.


For the first time, a terrifying thought crossed my mind: What if it was already too late?
###Chapter 70:A Child's Questions

Howard's POV

I watched Lucy standing in the hallway, her hands clasped tightly behind her back - a nervous habit she'd picked up recently. Her question about Annie and me still lingered: "So is it that you don't love Dad, or Dad doesn't love you?"

I'd witnessed Annie's momentary paralysis at those words, seen the complicated emotions flickering across her face before she'd managed to redirect Lucy's attention to breakfast. But Lucy,showing that remarkable persistence that sometimes made me forget her age, hadn't let the subject drop.


"Dad?" Lucy's voice drew me from my thoughts as she approached, her school uniform already perfectly arranged - another habit she'd picked up from Annie. "Can we talk?"


I nodded, recognizing the determined set of her jaw. "Of course.Would you like to use the study?"

She nodded firmly. Once inside, she climbed into her usual leather chair -the one that made her look even smaller. When had I started thinking of it as hers?


"Mom wouldn't answer my question," Lucy said bluntly. "About whether you love each other."

I kept my face neutral, though her directness caught me off guård."What made you think about this?"


"Because of Penny's dad," she frowned. "He was mean to Penny's mom because they weren't married anymore. But you and Mom aren't married at all." The child's logic made me pause. "Lucy, adult relationships are complicated."

"But you *are* dating Mom, right? Her fingers twisted in her skirt. "That s what everyone says."

I studied her worried face. "Yes, we are."

"Then why don't you kiss her more? Or hold hands?" Lucy's frown deepened. "Other parents do that."

Her words hit something inside me. How many times had I wanted to reach for Annie? To hold her hand, pull her close? But our arrangement had rules - rules that felt increasingly difficult to follow.

"Your mother," I chose my words carefully, "was hurt before. By Philip Baker."


"Brian's dad," Lucy nodded seriously. "He made Mom sad."

"Yes. When someone's been hurt like that, they need time to trust again."

Lucy played with her uniform hem. "But you won't hurt her like that,right?"

"No," I said firmly. "I won't."

"Promise?" She fixed me with an intense stare.

"I promise." The certainty in my voice surprised even me.

Lucy seemed satisfied, then asked, "When will we be a real family?"


The question hit harder than expected. When had this fake relationship started feeling real?

"We already are a family," I said. "Just different from others." "But not a *married* family," she persisted.

I leaned closer. "Lucy, marriage isn't what makes a family real. What matters is feeling safe and cared for. Do you feel safe with Annie and me?"

"Yes." She bit her lip - just like Annie does. "But what if something goes wrong? Like with Penny's parents?"

"That won't happen." I said, my voice rougher than usual. "I won't let it."

Lucy studied my face. "Can I help? To make sure Mom stays?"

Something tightened in my chest. "You already help more than you know.You make your mother smile every day."

Her face brightened."Really?"

"Really. You're essential to this family,Lucy."




The drive to school proved more complicated than usual, with Lucy's morning questions apparently inspiring new ones.

"So you and Mom are dating?" she asked from the backseat,her tone carrying a hint of challenge.


"Yes," Annie confirmed, maintaining our cover story. Though she spoke to Lucy, I caught her quick glance in my direction through the rearview mirror.


"But you don't act like it at home," Lucy observed shrewdly. "You barely even look at each other sometimes."


I kept my expression neutral, though Annie's slight intake of breath was audible in the sudden silence. "We're... being considerate," I explained carefully. "We didn't want to make you uncomfortable." "But I want you to be more like real dlating people," Lucy declared. "Like how Thomas's parents always hold hands."

The request created an immediate tension in the car. I could sense Annie's discomfort without looking at her, could feel the weight of our pretense pressing down more heavily than usual.

As we pulled into the school parking lot, I made a decision. Taking Lucy's words as permission, I reached for Annie's hand as we walked toward the building. Her fingers tensed momentarily before relaxing into my grip, the simple contact sending an unexpected surge of satisfaction through me.

Lucy,however,had an immediate and surprising reaction to seeing this display of affection. Her earlier enthusiasm vanished, replaced by a sudden anxious energy that had her pressing closer to Annie's other side.

Lucy's reaction surprised us both. She pressed against Annie's other side,suddenly anxious.

"Actually," her voice went small, "maybe you don't have to hold hands∗al1∗the time."


Annie immediately dropped my hand and knelt beside her. "What's wrong,sweetheart?"

Lucy shrugged, then spotted her friend. "I see Penny!" She ran off, already chattering about their speaking competition.

"She's afraid," Annie said quietly. "Of losing what we have."

"The mind of a child who's experienced loss is complex," I replied,remembering Lucy's early days of silence. "She wants us to be closer,but that same closeness threatens the security she's found in her current relationship with you."

Lucy had already lost one family. Her fear made sense,even if she'd pushed for this.

"Okay,let's head to work."




The sound of tires on concrete interrupted my thoughts. Philip Baker's Mercedes was parked haphazardly across my reserved space, the man himself emerging with an unsteady gait. His usual polished appearance was notably disheveled - wrinkled suit, loosened tie, dark circles under his eyes.

Annie tensed beside me as she recognized him. Without conscious thought,I shifted slightly, positioning myself between them. But as I studied her expression, I saw no fear there - only calm determination. In the months since I'd known her, Annie had proven herself more than capable of handling difficult situations with remarkable composure.

"Annie," Philip called out, his voice rough. "We needto talk."

I stepped forward, muscles coiled with controlled tension. "Whatever you have to say can wait."

Annie's hand touched my arm, the gesture both restraining and reassuring.Her eyes met mine with quiet confidence - the same strength I'd seen when she faced down corporate board members or handled Lucy's most challenging moments.

"It's okay," she said softly. "Ten minutes, Philip. That's a1l. And after this,you stop whatever this is."

Philip's face twisted with some complex emotion, but he nodded.

"I'll be fine," Annie squeezed my arm gently. "Go to work. I'll call you after." Part of me still wanted to stay, to shield her from whatever desperate pleas or accusations Philip might make. But Annie wasn't some fragile creature needing protection. She was the woman who'd rebuilt her life from scratch.who'd earned the respect of our entire executive team, who faced every challenge with unwavering dignity. She could handle this.

"If you need anything..."

"I know." A slight smile curved her lips- the confident one I'd come to admire."T'll call."
###Chapter 71: Howard's Past

Annie's POV

Philip sat across from me in the café near Howard Technologies. His tie hung loose, dark circles under his eyes suggesting a sleepless night.

A waiter approached with a delicate porcelain cup,steam rising in gentle wisps. "Your jasmine tea, ma'am."

I glanced at Philip, surprised. In six years of marriage, he'd never once remembered my preference for jasmine tea over coffee. The gesture felt calculated, like everything else about this meeting.

"I remember how you used to order this whenever we went out," Phiip said softly, his voice carrying an unfamiliar vulnerability. "The scent... it always reminded me of spring mornings with you."

The lie stung more than any of his previous manipulations. During our marriage, he'd repeatedly complained about the "odd flowery smell"whenever I brewed jasmine tea at home. Now he was rewriting our history,crafting a narrative of attentiveness that had never existed.

"No, you don't," I replied quietly, pushing the cup away. "You used to say the smell gave you a headache."

Phílip flinched as if I'd struck him. "Annie, I know I made mistakes-"

"Why did you want to meet, Philip?" I kept my voice level,professional.

He leaned forward, desperation bleeding into his expression. "How can you be with *him*?Howard Thompson? He's cold,calculating-"

"Unlike you?" The words slipped out before I could stop them, sharp with six years of suppressed hurt.

"I'm trying to understand," Philip pressed on. "What does he give you that I couldn't? A bigger house? More expensive gifts?"

A bitter laugh escaped me. "Is that really what you think this is about?Status and money?" I shook my head, suddenly tired. "You still don't see it.do you?"


"Then explain it to me!" His voice rose slightly, drawing curious glances from nearby tables. "Help me understand why you'd choose someone like him."


"Someone like him?" I echoed. "You mean someone who respects my career choices? Who provides a support system so I can pursue my professional goals? Who values my capabilities beyond just being a wife and mother?"


Philip's face darkened. "I supported your work-"

"No, you tolerated it," I corrected gently. "As long as it didn't interfere with managing your household or caring for Brian. But the moment I wanted mnore - when I talked about expanding my illustration work or taking on bigger projects - suddenly it was 'imnpractical' and 'unnecessary."

"That was different," Philip protested. "We had a comfortable life. You didn't need to-"


"It was never about need," I interrupted. "It was about wanting to grow,to challenge myself. Howard understood that from day one."

"Because he's such a perfect man?" Phlip's voice dripped sarcasm. "The prestigious CEO who suddenly develops feelings for his employee? Don't be naive, Annie. Men like Howard Thompson don't change their playboy ways without an agenda."

"Actually," Howard's voice cut through the tension like a blade of ice, "I changed long before meeting Annie." I turned to find him standing beside our table, his presence commanding yet carefully non-threatening. His eyes met mine briefly-a silent question that I answered with a slight nod.

"After my brother and sister-in-law's death," Howard continued calmly, "taking responsibility for Lucy and the company became my priority.Yes, I was once exactly the type of man you're describing. But life has a way of forcing growth when it matters most." His gaze shifted to Philip, cool but not unkind. "Sometimes, Mr. Baker, the best thing we can do is acknowledge when we've lost something precious through our own actions.11


Philip's face contorted with barely contained emotion. "You don't know anything about my marriage-"

"No," Howard agreed. "But I know Annie now. And that's what matters."He extended his hand to me. "Shall we?"

I took his hand, drawing strength from its steady warmth. As we left the café, I could feel Philip's eyes burning into my back, but his gaze held no power over me.




We stood in Howard's office, the morning bringing a different energy to the familiar space.

"Thank you," I said softly. "For what you said back there."

"I meant it." Howard's voice carried an unusual note of vulnerability."About changing after Lucy came into my life."

"Tell me?" I found myself asking, genuinely curious about the man behind the carefully controlled exterior.

He was quiet for a moment, his profile sharp against the morning light. "I was exactly what Philip accused -successful, privileged, used to getting what I wanted. Women, deals, status.. it all came easily." A faint smile touched his lips. "Then suddenly I had a traumatized five-year-old who wouldn't speak, a company in transition, and the weight of my brother's legacy to uphold."

"That must have been overwhelming," I said softly, understanding all too well the pressure of sudden, crushing responsibility.

"I had no idea what I was doing," Howard admitted. "Lucy wouldn't eat unless I sat with her for hours. She had nightmares every night. The company needed critical decisions I wasn't sure I was qualified to make."He turned to face me. "But somehow, we survived. We adapted. Now I can't imagine any other life."

The vulnerability in his confession touched something deep inside me.This was a side of Howard Thompson few people ever saw- the man who had learned to be both father and mother to a grieving child, who had shouldered immense responsibilities without complaint.

"Sometimes," I found myself saying, studying his profile,"seeing someone else's strength makes you find your own."


Howard turned to face me, his expression softening in that rare way that still caught me off guard. "Is that what you see when you look at me.Annie? Strength?"


The intensity in his gaze made my pulse quicken. "I see someone who chose to change," I replied softly. "Who rebuilt himself for the sake of others."


He stepped closer, close enough that I could feel the warmth radiating from him. "And now? What do you see now?"

The air between us felt charged with unspoken possibilities. My heart raced,but I forced myself to step back slightly."I... I think I need some air.Would you mind if I took a short walk before the next meeting?"

Something flickered in his eyes - disappointment? But his voice remained steady. "Of course. Take the time you need."

I nodded. grateful for his understanding. As I turned to leave, his voice stopped me at the door.

"Annie." When I looked back, his expression was unreadable. "Don't go too far."


The double meaning in his words followed me into the hallway,making my cheeks warm.


I'd retreated to the company's courtyard garden after a challenging meeting.seeking a quiet moment to myself.

"How dare you?"

The sharp voice shattered my solitude. Betty Baker stood at the garden entrance, her elegant appearance at odds with the fury distorting her features.


"Mrs. Baker," I acknowledged calmly, though my heart had started racing."This is a private property-"


"Don't pretend you don't know why I'm here," she cut me off,advancing with clicking heels. "First you destroy my son's marriage, and now you're throwing yourself at Howard Thompson? Have you no shame?"


The familiar accusations hit old wounds,but I forced myself to remain steady."I think you're confused about several things, Mrs. Baker."

"Oh? Am I confused about how you've manipulated your way into Howard' s life? Using that poor mute child as your ticket into his world?" Her lip curled in disgust. "Did you think no one would see through your act?"

The attack on my relationship with Lucy sent a surge of cold anger through me. "You're treading dangerous ground, Mrs. Baker."

"Truth hurts, doesn't it?" she pressed on, "A small-town nobody, trying to play in our league. It was bad enough when Philip married you, but at least Sarah knew how to restore proper order..."

"By helping your son betray his marriage vows?" I interrupted, my voice sharp with six years of suppressed hurt. "By manipulating my child against me? Is that your definition of 'proper order,' Mrs. Baker?"

She recoiled as if slapped, but recovered quickly. "How dare you-"

"No," I cut her off, rising to my full height. "How dare∗you∗?You stood by while your son destroyed our family. You encouraged his affair with Sarah, watched him poison Brian against me, and now you have the audacity to question *my* integrity?"

"I'll destroy you," she hissed, masks of proprety finally falling away completely. "You'll lose everything - your job, your reputation, your precious relationship with Howard-"

"You can't take what isn't built on lies," I replied calmly. "Unlike you, Mrs.Baker, I don't need to manipulate or deceive to be worthy of love."

She drew back as if I'd struck her, face contorting with rage and something else-fear,perhaps?

"This isn't over."

I watched her retreat, feeling oddly peaceful despite the confrontation.

Later, in my office, I recounted the encounter, trying to keep my voice light despitethe lingering tension in my shoulders.

"Are you all right?" Howard asked, his eyes searching my face with genuine concern.

"Yes." I replied, surprising myself with how true it felt.

"I have some news you might find interesting," he said, a slight smile playing at his lips.
###Chapter 72: First Paycheck

Annie's POV

"I have some news you might find interesting." Howard said, a slight smile playing at his lips. He gestured to my phone. "Check your bank account."

I pulled up my banking app, wondering what could prompt that subtle gleam of satisfaction in his eyes. The number that appeared on my screen made me blink twice, certain I was misreading the digits.

"This... this can't be right," I managed, looking up at him. "There must be some mistake."


"No mistake," Howard replied, his tone carrying that familiar mix of authority and gentleness. "Project bonus,quarterly profit share,standard benefits package. You've more than earned it."

I stared at the number again, my mind spinning with possibilities. This single deposit was more than I'd made in six months at my previous jobs.More than that - it represented something I hadn't had in years: true financial independence.


"I..." My voice caught unexpectedly. "Thank you. For giving me this opportunity."


Howard's expression softened slightly. "You did the work, Annie. I merely provided the platform."


"Still," I insisted, "I'd like to get you something. To show my appreciation."

"That's not necessary."

"Please," I pressed. "Just... something small. A pen, maybe?"

A hint of amusement crossed his features, "If you insist, a pen would suffice." He paused, then added with unexpected warmth, "As it happens, I could use a new one."




The high-end stationery store near Howard Technologies carried an impressive selection of luxury pens. I'd already picked out several books for Lucy -educational materials to support her speech development and some beautifully illustrated storybooks I knew would capture her imagination.

Now I stood before the pen display, slightly overwhelmed by the variety of options. The sales associate approached with professional courtesy.

"Are you looking for anything specific?"

I studied the elegant cases before me. "Something... understated but significant. For someone who appreciates quality without needing to display it."


She nodded in understanding, pulling out several options. Each one cost more than I'd ever imagined spending on a writing instrument, but the number in my bank account gave me new confidence.

"This one," I decided finally, selecting a sleek black fountain pen with subtle platinum accents. It reminded me of Howard - elegant without being showy, commanding attention through quality rather than flash.

"Excellent choice," the associate said, though her tone carried a gentle warning. "Though I should mention the price point..."

"It's perfect," I interrupted quietly, surprising us both with my certainty.

"Well, well." Sarah's voice made me freeze. "Spending the new boss's money already?"

I turned to find her standing there, perfect makeup and designer clothes as always. But this time, seeing her didn't make my heart race like it used to. Instead, I felt oddly calm.

"Sarah," I said. "Shopping for office supplies?"

Her smile didn't reach her eyes. "Just browsing." She glanced at the pen in my hands, her lip curling slightly. "That's quite an expensive gift. Though I suppose Howard Thompson can afford it."

The old me would have stumbled over an explanation, trying to justify my purchase. But I wasn't that person anymore. "Yes, he can. Though that's hardly the point."

"Oh?" She stepped closer, her designer perfume almost overwhelming."And what is the point, Annie? Are you and Howard...involved now?"

I met her gaze steadily. "You were at the charity gala. You heard how he introduced me."

"As his date." she said dismissively. "A convenient arrangement, surely."

"As his girlfriend," I said.

Sarah's smile dropped. She hadn't expected that. I watched her grip tighten on her designer handbag, her carefully maintained composure slipping for just a second.

"His... girlfriend?" She tried to laugh it off, but I could hear the strain in her voice. "How recent. And here I thought you were still crying over Philip."


"That ###Chapter of my life is closed," I said, turning back to the sales associate. "I'll take the pen, please."

Sarah stepped closer, her perfume too strong. "Oh, Annie. You really think you can keep Howard Thompson interested? Look how easily I took Philip from you." She smiled, alI teeth. "A man like Howard needs...sophistication. Something you clearly lack."

I signed the receipt with steady hands, accepting the elegantly wrapped package. "Is that a threat,Sarah?"

"A friendly warning." Her smile turned predatory. "You've seen how easily I took Philip from you. Howard would be even simpler. Men like that appreciate... sophistication. Something you've never quite mastered."

1 couldn't help but laugh. "You still don't get it, do you?"

"Get what?" She crossed her arms, defensive now.

"You didn't win Philip. I stopped fighting for a marriage that wasn't worth saving." I met her eyes. "But what I have now? My job, my life with Lucy,my relationship with Howard - I've earned all of it."

Sarah's confident smile faltered. She wasn't used to me standing up to her."We'll see about that," she said, but her voice wasn't as steady as before."Howard Thompson is quite a prize. And I always get what I want."

"Try your best," I said, gathering my purchases. "But remember - I'm not the same woman you manipulated before. I know exactly what I'm wworth now."


I left her standing there, my heart pounding but my steps steady. In the elevator, I had to lean against the wall for a moment. Not from fear -from the pure rush of finally standing up to her. The woman who used to make me doubt everything about myself now seemed... smaller somehow. Less threatening.

Let her try her games. This time,I was ready.

The package felt warm in my hands as I rode the elevator back to the executive floor. A simple pen - but it represented so much more.My financial independence, my professional success, my ability to give meaningful gifts rather than just accepting them.

The elevator opened at the executive floor. Howard looked up as I entered his office, a small smile appearing when he saw me. "Productive lunch break?"


I placed the wrapped package on his desk. "Very."

He opened it carefully. "Perfect choice," he said simply, and his quiet approval meant more than any elaborate praise.

"I ran into Sarah," I added.

His expression sharpened. "And?"

"She seems very interested in you." I tried to keep my voice light.

"Unsurprising," he said dryly. "Though ultimately irrelevant."

His dismissive tone made me smile. The Sarah who had once seemed so threatening now felt like a minor inconvenience.

"Thank you," I said quietly, "for helping me find my way back to myself."

Howard looked at me, his eyes intense. "You did that on your own, Annie.
I just had the privilege of watching."

Walking back to my office, I felt stronger than ever. Let Sarah play her games.

This time, I was protecting something real.
###Chapter 73: New Plan

Philip's POV

The quarterly financial report lay open on my desk, columns of numbers demanding my attention. I'd been staring at the same page for twenty minutes, my mind refusing to engage with profit margins and market projections. Instead, it kept replaying Annie's face as she'd walked away from our meeting, Howard Thompson's hand at the small of her back.

My phone rang, shattering the silence. Sarah's name flashed across the screen.


"Do you need something?" I kept my voice deliberately neutral.

"I went to see Annie today," Sarah's voice carried a carefully crafted tone of distress. "I thought I might... put in a good word for you."

My attention immediately shifted from work to her words. Annie and Sarah talking? The thought made my stomach clench.


"I even told her I was willing to step aside so you two could reconcile,"Sarah continued, her voice thick with what sounded like rehearsed disappointment. "But she wasn't interested at all."

I pinched the bridge of my nose, feeling a headache buiding behind my eyes.


"Philip, I really tried," she added, the manufactured dejection in her voice growing more pronounced.


"I know." I sighed, leaning back in my chair. Something had shifted in my understanding of the situation - a clarity I hadn't possessed when I'd first encountered Annie with Howard. "But thisis between Annie and me.I should handle it myself." The truth was beginning to crystallize, painful though it might be."Annie hates me because during our six years together, I never truly appreciated her. That has nothing to do with you."

Sarah made a soft sound of protest. "But I really want to help you two get back together."


A small, bitter laugh escaped me. "Just stay home and take care of yourself and the baby. That's the best help you can offer mne."

"Sarah," I continued, my voice firmer now, "this whole situation is entirely my fault. Not yours."

This conclusion had come after hours of painful reflection in my office as I forced myself to confront uncomfortable truths.


"But I still feel like it's my fault," Sarah persisted, her voice taking on that plaintive quality she used when she wanted something. "I wish there was something I could do for you."


"I know you love me." That much was easy to feel-Sarah's affection for me, or at least for what I represented, was obvious and uncomplicated.

"But with Annie..." I felt a sharp pain in my chest as the words formed."I only realized how much she loved me after I'd lost her."

The admission tasted bitter. "A few days ago, I was desperate to reconcile with Annie. So when you offered to help, I impulsively agreed."

"Today, I suddenly realized something wasn't right..."I continued,the revelation forming even as I spoke it. "If a man needs another woman's help to win back his ex-wife, doesn't that make me rather pathetic?"

"I won't allow you to talk about yourself that way!" Sarah's immediate protest carried genuine indignation. I smiled despite myself. "Alright. I'll listen to you." Sometimes it was easier to agree than argue.

Sarah's voice softened with satisfaction. "That's better. Since you've made up your mind. I'll stay home and take care of myself and the baby."

After ending the call, I sank back into my chair, fingers drumming lightly against the polished desk. Though Sarah's tone had been acquiescent, I couldn't shake the feeling that her words carried hidden meanings. After all our time together. I'd learned to read the subtle variations in her voice.Despite her current agreement to follow my wishes, instinct told me she wouldn't abandon whatever plan she was formulating. What that plan might be, I couldn't say, but I felt an instinctive unease.

My office door swung open without warning, revealing my mother's imposing figure silhouetted against the hallway light. Betty Baker entered with the imperious confidence she'd perfected over decades, her eyes sharp with disapproval.

"What's wrong with you?" she demanded without preamble, settling herself in the chair opposite my desk. "Annie has clearly moved on, she even has a new boyfriend. Why are you still chasing her?"


I felt irritation rise in my chest but tamped it down with practiced restraint.

Mother continued her litany of complaints. "Don't you understand? The more you pursue her, the less chance you have of getting her back!"

I set aside the financial document I'd been pretending to read and met her gaze directly. "Then, Mother, what should I do to make her forgive me and reconcile?"


She adjusted her position, her tone softening marginally as she prepared to dispense her wisdom. "It's simple. Just be happy with Sarah..."

"I've tried that," I interrupted, weariness bleeding into my voice. "It doesn't work." The memory of that failure was still fresh and painful.

I explained my reasoning, the words heavy with resignation. "When Annie saw me with a girlfriend, being affectionate with Sarah, she was actually pleased because it meant I wouldn't be disrupting her lifeanymore."

The bitter truth formed on my lips before I could stop it. "No matter how good or bad I become now, she simply doesn't care anymore."

Mother scoffed, her designer scarf fluttering with the sharp movement of her head. "Then you shouldn't care about her either."

The suggestion sent a sharp pain through my chest. "I can't, Mother."

Seeing that she had no useful advice to offer, I gestured toward the door."You should go. I need to clear my head."

"How can a grown man be so heartbroken over a woman?" she chided,disapproval etched in every line of her perfectly maintained face.

"I love her." The three simple words carried a weight I hadn't fully appreciated until they left my mouth.

I confessed what I'd only recently acknowledged to myself. "I don't know when I fell in love with her. But from the day I realized it, I couldn't live without her."


Mother remained unmoved. "If you try hard enough, you'll eventually forget her."

"I need to work, Mother..." I hoped my tone would end this fruitless conversation.

She rose, clearly displeased at being dismissed. "I'm only saying these things for your own good."

"Don't," I replied firmly. "I want to think for myself." No more compromising.

Mother berated me further for what she perceived as weakness, but when she saw I was no longer engaging, she finally left, displeasure radiating from her rigid posture.

The office settled back into blessed silence. I leaned against my chair,staring at the ceiling, lost in thought.

A strange realization suddenly struck me: my friends had never pointed out my feelings for Annie, yet they'd all implied I loved Sarah when I clearly didn't. The inconsistency seemed odd now that I noticed it.


I decided this wasn't the time to investigate that question, but filed the thought away for future consideration.


Turning back to my work, I attempted to focus on the financial reports spread across my desk. As I flipped through the pages of market projections, a sudden insight flashed through my mind.

Annie's chidren's book illustrations were just beginning to gain traction in the market. My company had an entire department dedicated to copyright development. This could be an opportunity.

I quickly formulated a plan: have my copyright department purchase the rights to Annie's illustrations, then specifically request Annie to work directly with me, creating a legitimate reason to meet regularly.

I carefully considered the logistics: Annie's work wasn't well-known yet,so acquisition costs would be reasonable-probably less than what I'd spent on Sarah's last piece of jewelry.

The plan brought a smile to my face-finally, a respectable and logical way to approach Annie.

I pressed the intercom button, summoning my secretary. When he appeared in my doorway, I said. "Contact the copyright department. I need them to purchase the rights to Annie Baker's children's book illustrations."

A flash of understanding crossed his eyes, but he maintained his professional demeanor. "I'll notify the copyright department immediately."

Watching him leave, I felt a wave of relief wash over me. "If only I'd thought of this approach sooner." Perhaps I could have avoided so much pain.

I settled back in my chair, hope blooming in my chest for the first time in weeks. This time, I wouldn't make the same mistakes. I would cherish every opportunity to meet with Annie, slowly rebuilding her trust in me.And maybe, just maybe, she would remember what we once had.

*She's with him now,* a traitorous voice whispered in my mind. *In his bed, in his life.*

I pushed the thought away, focusing instead on thestrategy ahead.Business was something I understood. Negotiations, contracts, terms favorable toboth parties-this was familiar territory. And unlike my clumsy attempts to win her back through emotional appeals, this approach played to my strengths.

The intercom buzzed. "Sir, the copyright department is on line two."

I picked up the phone, my voice steadier than it had been in days. "This is Philip Baker. I have a project I'd like to discuIss..."
###Chapter 74:Opportunity

Annie's POV

My hands shook as I read the numbers on my tablet. Social medía followers doubled in days. Plush toy sales through the roof. Merchandise orders piling up. Just months ago I was Philip Baker's shadow-a divorced housewife who'd lost her son. Now I had my own office at Howard Technologies, watching my small business grow by the minute.

I couldn't breathe right. These numbers meant something I hadn't had in years-freedom. Real,financial freedom. No more bending to Philip's will.No more compromises just to survive.

"I did it," I whispered, surprised when a tear rolled down my cheek.

I thought about my mother in Brooklyn. She never approved of my divorce, thought I was crazy to leave my "perfect" marriage. She didn't know what happened behind closed doors, or why I'd been willing to lose Brian rather than stay with Philip.

Now I could finally show her I'd made the right choice. I could help with her bills, get her better healthcare. Before I could overthink it, I grabbed my phone and called her.

"Mom, it's me." My voice was still shaky. "Could I visit you this weekend?"She sounded surprised but didn't say no. It was something.

My phone rang while I was reviewing designs. Unknown number.

"Hello?"

"Ms, Baker," a professional male voice said. "I'm calling from Philip Investment Group's copyright department. We're interested in acquiring the rights to your illustrations."Philip. It had to be him. My stomach tightened into a knot.

"My copyrights are managed by Howard Technologies," I said,gripping the phone so hard my knuckles turned white. "Contact their legal department."

"Ms. Baker, we're prepared to be very generous." The man sounded taken aback by my response. "Our CEO, Mr. Philip Baker, has specifically requested to oversee this project personally. He admires your work and wants to arrange a private meeting to discuss details."

My face burned with anger. The nerve of that man! Using business as an excuse to force his way back into my life after cheating and taking my son?

"Tell Mr. Baker that I have zero interest in any 'privae meeting' with my ex-husband," I said, my voice ice-cold. "If he keeps harassing me, I'll get a lawyer involved."

I hung up, my hand trembling with rage. *Don't let him get to you,Annie.*
I got up from my desk. I needed to talk to Howard right away. This wasn't just business - this was Philip invading my life again.

I pushed into Howard's office without knocking. He was at the windows and turned when he heard me come in.


"Annie?"

"Philip Investment Group wants to buy my copyrights," I blurted out."Philip wants to be 'personally involved' and is asking for a 'private meeting."

Howard's face hardened instantly. He walked toward me with quick,deliberate steps that made my heart beat faster.

"Tell me exactly what they said," he said quietly. I repeated the call word for word, watching Howard's jaw tighten as I spoke.

"This has nothing to do with copyrights," he said, anger clear in his voice."He's trying to interfere with your life. With us."

Us. The word made my pulse jump. Howard never talked about our relationship so directly, even though it was supposed to be pretend.

"What should I do?" I asked, realizing I'd moved closer to him without thinking.

Howard's eyes locked with mine. "Let me handle it." He stepped forward and touched my cheek. His hand was warm against my skin,gentle despite the hardness in his voice. "No one threatens what's mine."

What's mine. My heart hammered in my chest. I knew he was just keeping up our act, but it sounded so real. Why did his touch affect me like this?

"You have better options," he said more softly. "Let Howard Technologies develop your copyrights. We'll give you a good percentage, and I'll make sure everything works out."

For a second, I forgot this was just business between us. "What if it doesn't sell well?" I asked.

"Do you trust me, Annie?" he asked simply.

"Yes," I said without thinking. It was probably the most honest thing I'd said in weeks.


Howard's mouth curved slightly, "Then I'll protect your interests.Philip Baker needs to learn he can't manipulate you anymore."

Something shifted inside me - safety, belonging, and something else I was afraid to name.

Someone knocked on the door.

Howard pulled back immediately, his face cooling to a professional mask."Come in."

Margaret Thompson walked in carrying a container. She ignored Howard and came straight to me with a smile that didn't reach her eyes.

"I hear you're dating my son, is that right?" she asked.

Howard moved behind me, his hand resting on my waist. His fingers pressed slightly, a silent message I couldn't quite read.

"Yes," I said simply.

"Then you'll be my daughter-in-law soon." Margaret's smile widened as she put the container in front of me. "You're too thin. You need to take better care of yourself."

Her sudden interest caught me off guard. "Thank you."

"You're welcome." Margaret leaned closer and lowered her voice like she was sharing a secret. "Could you help me with Howard?"

I raised an eyebrow."Help how?"

She fidgeted with her purse strap. "I did some things I shouldn't have..."She glanced nervously at Howard, "He cut off my living expenses. I'm too old to work now..." She sighed dramatically. "I have no money.".


She looked at me with pleading eyes. "Could you ask him to give me my allowance back?"


I shifted uncomfortably. This wasn't my business. I wasn't really Howard's girlfriend - I had no right to get involved in their financial matters. "I'msorry."

"You should talk to me directly about these things," Howard said coldly from behind me. "Don't involve Annie."

Margaret hung her head and shuffled over to Howard. "I was afraid you'd say no..."

"I'll agree," Howard said, surprising me. His voice turned stern. "But promise you won't make the same mistake again. Next time I cut you off,it will be permanent."

Margaret's eyes widened. She obviously hadn't expected him to give in."I promise! I'll change!"

When she didn't leave, Howard frowned."Is there something else?"

"Your sister's company has problems..." Margaret mumbled, barely audible.

"Tell her to come see me herself," Howard said flatly.

"Good!" Margaret replied, practically running for the door.
###Chapter 75: From Pretension to Reality Par

Annie's POV

I watched Margaret Thompson hurry out of Howard's office, her expensive perfume lingering in the air.

Howard stood beside me, jaw tight as the door clicked shut.

"Does my decision surprise you?" he asked, turning to face me.

I shook my head. "Not really. Blood ties are hard to break, no matter what she's done." I thought of my own mother in Brooklyn who still sent me articles about "making marriages work" despite everything Philip had done.

"Even if she's manipulative and self-serving?" Howard'svoice was flat,but his fingers tapped restlessly against his leg.

"Especially then," I said. "Everyone deserves second chances." I crossed my arms, remembering how firmly he'd spoken to her. "Besides, you made it clear what happens if she messes up again."

Howard studied my face. "Does it bother you? My decision?"

I laughed, the sound sharper than I intended. "Why would it? I'm only*pretending* to be your girlfriend, remember?" The words stung my own lips as they escaped.

Howard's eyes darkened for a split second before his face went blank. He turned away without a word and walked back to his desk.

My heart raced as I watched him go. I pressed my palm against my chest,trying to quiet the hollow ache that formed there. What was happening to me? We were just putting on a show, but there was no audience here to perform for. That afternoon, I sat cross-legged on my office sofa, staring at my tablet. I'd finished the illustrations for Lucy's daily schedule-simple drawings of a little girl with golden hair brushing teeth, getting dressed, reading books.What should I work on next?

My monthly income had jumped ten times since joining Howard Technologies. I could create anything now-expand my portfolio,design new merchandise, or start that children's book I'd always dreamed about.

Howard appeared in my doorway without warning. He leaned against the frame, his suit jacket open, revealing the crisp white shirt stretched across his broad chest. The afternoon light caught his profile, and something clicked in my brain. Inspiration hit me like a lightning bolt.

I immediately dropped mny head and started sketching, trying to ignore how my pulse quickened at his presence. My fingers couldn't move fast enough as the idea took shape-a story about a cold, powerful businessman who agrees to a fake relationship with an ordinary woman.Two people findingreal feelings where they only expected convenience.

"What has you so focused?" Howard's voice made me jump. He was right behind me now, his breath warm against my neck as he looked over my shoulder.


"A new concept," I said, still drawing, hoping he couldn't hear how my voice had gone slightly breathless. "Something readers might like."

His eyebrows pulled together. "Does this concept involve me?" The low timbre of his voice so close to my ear sent a shiver down my spine.

I nodded, knowing I couldn't lie to him. "Yes, but not about our..." I waved my hand between us, "pretend relationship. I'm not stupid! Philip would see right through us if I put that online. Then what would I do when he started harassing me again?" Howard's shoulders relaxed. He moved around to sit beside me,the sofa cushion dipping under his weight, sliding me slightly toward him until our thighs nearly touched. "Then what story are you drawing?"

"You'll see when it's done," I said, enjoying the rare feeling of Howard not knowing something. I shifted slightly, but found myself unable to create more distance between us without being obvious.

"I look forward to it," he said, his voice deeper than usual. His cologne wrapped around me-clean and masculine-making it hard to focus on my screen instead of the man beside me.

My skin tingled from his nearness, heatspreading from where our bodies almost touched. As I stared at my tablet, a thought hit me-I'd never really been pursued by a man.

With Philip, I'd done all the work. I approached him first at that charity event. I suggested our first date. I moved the relationship forward each time. I even hinted about marriage until he finally proposed. Philip never chased me; he just accepted what I offered.

My hand froze above the screen as I became acutely aware of Howard's presence-the steady rhythm of his breathing, the subtle warmth radiating from his body, the intensity of his gaze on my profile.


"Having trouble?" Howard asked, leaning closer to see my screen, his chest brushing against my shoulder.


I turned to him, our faces suddenly inches apart. I swallowed hard before speaking. "Yes, I have the general idea, but when I try to start, my mind just goes blank."

Howard's eyes dropped briefly to my lips before meeting mny gaze again."If you drew our relationship on your current account,Philip would notice something was off." He tapped his fingers against his knee, the back of his hand grazing my thigh as he did so. "What if you created a new account?"

My eyes widened. "Why didn't I think of that?" So simple, yet perfect.A secret identity where I could explore these new feelings without Philip connecting the dots.

My fingers flew across the screen, the excitement of creation rushing through me again, though I was disturbingly aware of every inch where Howard's body nearly touched mine.

"What's the theme?" Howard asked, his voice rumbling through me as he leaned closer to watch me draw.

"A contract marriage story," I said before I could stop myself. "Two people agree to a relationship for convenience, but then develop real feelings." My cheeks warmed as I realized how transparent I was being.

Something like hunger flashed in Howard's eyes, though his voice stayed casual. "You were with Philip for years, and he wasn't good to you. You probably never experienced what love should actually feel like." His eyes lingered on my face, studying my reaction.

I nodded, surprised he understood so well. "That's true." I wet my lips nervously, noticing how his gaze tracked the movement.

"If you want to know what dating feels like,"Howard said, his voice dropping to a tone that made my stomach tighten pleasantly,"you could ask me."


I gave him a skeptical look, though my heart raced at the implication."But you've never had a girlfriend either, right? What experience do you have to share?"


Howard didn't answer with words. Instead, he reached out and tilted my chin up with his fingers, his thumb lightly brushing acro'ss my lower lip.The casual touch sent electricity racing across my skin, making me shiver involuntarily.

My breath caught as he leaned closer, the heat of his body intensifying.I could feel his breath on my face as he stopped just before our lips touched,the anticipation making me dizzy.

"Do you feel nervous?" he asked, his voice so deep I felt it in my chest,in my stomach, lower still. "A little excited?"

My pulse pounded, my skin burning everywhere he was close to touching
but wasn't. "Yes," I whispered, embarrassed by how breathy I sounded.

Howard's eyes darkened to stormy gray. "That's why just hearing about romance isn't enough. You need to feel it yourself." The roughness in his voice made heat pool in my belly, my body responding to him in ways I couldn't control.

I tried to think professionally, like this was still about my art. "So would readers prefer the kiss to happen or not?" My voice betrayed me by trembling, my question transparent even to my own ears.

"I don't know," Howard admitted, not looking away from my mouth. "I don't read romance comics." One of his hands had found its way to my waist, his fingers pressing lightly into my side.

"Would you mind if I find out?" The words slipped out as I stared at his lips,already knowing what they would feel like against mine.


Surprise crossed Howard's face, but he shook his head, his pupils dilating visibly.

Before I could think twice, I wrapped my arms around his neck, feeling the soft hair at his nape as I leaned in to kiss him. The moment our lips met, a jolt of desire shot through me. Howard responded immediately,a low sound coming from deep in his throat. His arms pulled me against him, one hand sliding up my back to tangle in my hair while the other pressed firmly at my waist until I could feel every hard plane of his body against mine.

I closed my eyes and gave in to the moment as Howard took control of the kiss, his mouth moving expertly against mine. All pretense between us suddenly gone, replaced by something far more dangerous and thrilling.
###Chapter 76: From Pretense to Reality Part

Annie's POV

My lips still tingled from Howard's kiss, his arms wrapped tightly around me in an intoxicating embrace. The solid wall of his chest pressed against me. sending shivers down my spine. The pretense of our relationship had completely dissolved, replaced by something real and undeniable. When Howard finally pulled back, we were both a little breathless, his normally composed eyes now dark wwith wanting.

"If we keep this up," he said with a slight smile, "we might go from pretending to be a couple to actually being one."

I turned to lean against the sofa, considering the implications of what had just happened. "You know, Howard, if you keep being this intimate with me,you'll never find a real girlfriend."

Though the thought of keeping my distance for his future's sake suddenly seemed necessary, it left a hollow feeling in my chest.

Howard's tone was light, but his expression showed an unfamiliar nervousness. "How do you plan to compensate me for that,then?"

"What kind of compensation do you want?" I asked, watching his reaction carefully.

Howard's dark eyes filled with emotions I couldn't fully comprehend. "If I'm still single in a few years, you should marry me.Become my wife."

I stared at him in surprise. "But I thought you didn't have plans to find a girlfriend anytime soon?"


Howard had never looked this anxious, not even during negotiationsfor major company mergers. "That's correct." "So you want me to marry you?" I asked hesitantly, trying to understand what he really meant.

Howard didn't deny it. I could almost see his heart beating rapidly beneath his expensive suit.

I took time to consider his proposition. Howard was always confident at work-whether planning long-term corporate strategies or finalizing specific project details. But today, as he waited for my answer, all that signature confidence seemed to have vanished.

This version of Howard, waiting for my decision, filled me with warmth.Unlike my relationship with Philip, where I had always tiptoed carefully,afraid that one decision would cost me his approval. Now, after months working at Howard Technologies, my illustration career was finally taking off, my designs recognized in the market, with my own studio and income.I was no longer the Annie who depended on others.

Perhaps now I was finally worthy of standing beside Howard. Not as a weak person needing his protection, but as a partner who could stand shoulder to shoulder with him. The thought filled my chest with determination.


After careful consideration, I finally responded: "If you're serious about marrying me, then for the next few years, no matter how exceptional other women might be, you can't develop feelings for them." I looked directly into his eyes. "You must choose me without wavering. Can you accept that?
"

Howard's answer was unusually solemn: "Of course."

When I didn't immediately respond, he looked at me steadily, his tone carrying a rare sincerity: "Since taking over the company and caring for Lucy, I haven't considered personal relationships. Not for lack of opportunity, but for lack of necessity." His gaze deepened,his voice low and firm: "Until now."

I couldn't help but admire the strong line of his jaw, the way his shirt stretched across his broad shoulders. For a moment, I allowed myself to imagine what those shoulders might look like without the crisp white shirt,what it might feel like to run my fingers across his skin. The thought sent heat rushing through me, and I quickly pushed it away, though not before a flush crept up my neck.

The meaning contained in this brief answer was unmistakable. For the typically concise Howard, this was a rare emotional disclosure.

"What if we date first?" I suggested tentatively. "We could confirm whether we're right for each other before getting married."

My heart raced. A few months ago, I wouldn't have dared imagine myself standing on equal ground with someone like Howard. Back then, freshly divorced, having lost my son, my future was a blur. But now, my work had gained recognition, my designs printed on products,and I had financial independence. I was no longer the woman who would cower at her husband's words.

I wanted to know how a relationship with Howard might develop-one built on equality, where I wouldn't have to sacrifice my self-worth.Perhaps this was the opportunity I'd been waiting for, to experience what a truly healthy relationship feels like.

An unspoken question lingered in my mind: What if we weren't right for each other? Would we part ways? I'd always thought Howard would make an excellent partner, and I wanted to experience what a normal,healthy romantic relationship felt like. But more importantly, I now had the confidence to puirsue such a relationship, rather than viewing it as a luxury I didn't deserve, as I had in the past.

Howard couldn't hide his smile. "Agreed." The intensity in his eyes made  my breath catch. There was something primal about the way he looked at me-possessive yet tender, as if I were both precious and desired.

Inwardly, he regretted not specifying an exact timeframe, saying "a few years" instead. That way, he would have known exactly when I would become his wife.

I noticed his delighted expression and turned my face away. I'd recently realized that our "pretend relationship" was barely distinguishable from a real one. We held hands, embraced, kissed-all things real couples do. At this pooint, arguing whether it was real or fake seemed pointless, which was why I agreed to make it official.

"So we're really a couple now?" Howard asked,his tone still tinged with disbelief.

"Yes," I confirmed simply.

"Then may I exercise boyfriend privileges?" he asked, his eyes seeking mine.

I laughed. "Of course."

Howard cupped my face in both hands, his eyes reflecting only my image. "Your face is so small," he said tenderly.

"Is it?" I smiled in response.

Before I could say more, Howard leaned down and gently kissed me-our lips meeting briefly. Then he kissed my cheek, my forehead, and finally pulled me into an embrace that he seemed reluctant to end. His cologne wrapped around me, woodsy and masculine, making my head swim.I was acutely aware of every place our bodies touched, the firmness of his chest against mine, his strong arms encircling my waist.

"I never imagined you'd be like this when in love," I commented. "Oh?" Howard responded, curious about my meaning.

I gently touched his cheek. "Not calm and composed, but rather overly passionate,"

Howard buried his face in the crook of my neck. "Don't you like it?"

"Not at all," I answered, feeling unusually happy. His eagerness made me feel cherished. "But aren't we at the company?"

"Just want to spend more time with you," Howard whispered,still holding me.

I laughed. "I'm not going anywhere."

"Howard, you still have a company to run, and Lucy needs looking after,"I gently reminded him. "What would everyone at Howard Technologies think if their CEO suddenly turned into a lovesick teenager focused only on romance?"

Hearing this, Howard reluctantly straightened up, but still wouldn't let go of my hand. His gaze fell on my tablet, where my sketch from earlier was still visible.

"Continue with your work," he said. "I have a few emails to handle myself.



I returned to the sofa, picked up my tablet, and suddenly found inspiration for how to continue with my illustration concept. I quickly sketched,becoming completely absorbed in my work.

Though focused on creating, I could feel Howard's occasional glances.He sat at his desk handling documents, but couldn't help looking up at me from time to time.

After completing a set of sketches, I noticed him watching me again,this time not even pretending to work. I couldn't help but smile as I walked over to him: "With you staring at me like this, are you really planning to get any work done?"

"All urgent matters have been handled," he said, reaching for my fingers."It's a rare opportunity, and I'd like to take you out for dinner.To formally celebrate our relationship. What do you think?"

I hadn't expected him to place such importance on the occasion. Though it seemed a bit amusing, I decided to indulge him. "Alright."

Howard happily leaned forward to kiss me again, this time with more intensity. His hand slid from my waist to my hip, pulling me against him.I gasped softly against his mouth as I felt the evidence of his desire pressing against me. My own body responded instantly, a rush of heat flooding through me as his kiss deepened. His other hand tangled in my hair, tilting my head back to give him better access. All rational thought began to slip away as I melted into him, my fingers gripping his shoulders.

"Creeak." The office door suddenly pushed open without warning. Howard's expression darkened dangerously, but he instinctively shifted his body to partially shield me from view, one hand still possessively at my waist."Knock before entering next time," he said, his voice icy with barely controlled frustration.
###Chapter 77: Knock Before Entering Next tim


Howard's POV

"Knock before entering next time," I said, my voice icy with barely controlled frustration.

*Damn it, who dares interrupt at this moment? I swear whoever this is will be clearing their desk tomorrow.

Catherine Morgan?! I could throw her outthe window right now. Annie and I finally define our relationship, finally have an intimate moment,and she chooses NOW to appear? If looks could kill, she'd have dropped dead a hundred times over. Deep breath, Howard. Don't lose composure in front of Annie. But this woman seriously needs to learn what knocking means...*

I kept my arm firmly around Annie's waist, my body partially shielding her from the intrusion. The warmth of her pressed against me was both comforting and frustrating given the interruption.

Catherine Morgan stood in the doorway, her designer outfit impeccable as always,her perfectly manicured hand still on the doorknob. Her eyes widened dramatically at finding us in such a compromising position.

"Oh my!" she exclaimed, her voice carrying an exaggerated note of surprise."I'm so sorry to interrupt!" The smirk playing at her lips suggested she wasn't sorry at all.

Annie shifted slightly in my arms, her cheeks flushed with embarrassment,but she maintained her composure admirably. I reluctantly released her,though every instinct in my body protested the loss of contact.

"Do the two of you always spend your workday hugging and kissing instead of actually working?" Catherine asked, her tone playful but with an undercurrent that set my teeth on edge. "I mean, I knew you were dating,but wow!" I straightened to my fulI height, adjusting my tie in a practiced motion that helped mask my annoyance. "Ms. Morgan, is there something specific you needed?"

Catherine breezed past me as if I hadn't spoken, making herself comfortable on Annie's sofa without invitation. "So, Annie," she said,crossing her legs elegantly, "how long has this been going on? The real thing, I mean, not the public show."

Annie glanced at me, a silent question in her eyes. I gave her a subtle nod,letting her decide how much to share.

"Catherine," Annie said with a patient smile, settling into the chair opposite her uninvited guest, "what brings you here?"

Catherine waved her hand dismissively. "Oh, just checking in on some investments. But that's boring business talk." She leaned forward conspiratorially. "This is much more interesting. Howard Thompson, New York's most eligible bachelor, finally caught. And by such a talented illustrator,no less."

I remained standing, arms crossed, watching this exchange with growing impatience. Every moment Catherine spent here was time stolen from what should have been a private celebration of my new relationship with Annie.

"Annie, darling," Catherine continued, "a woman has to treasure herself.you know? Don't let a man have his way just because he says some sweet things. Even if that man is Howard Thompson!"

My expression grew increasingly cold as she dispensed her unsolicited relationship advice. Annie, however, handled it with surprising grace.

"Thank you for your concern, Catherine," she replied diplomatically. "Howard and I understand each other quite well." Catherine's attention briefly flickered toward me,then back to Annie.Clearly recognizing I wasn't going to engage in her gossip, she focused entirely on Annie.

"Remember that guy I told you about? The one who wanted to date me?"Catherine sighed dramatically, settling deeper into the sofa as if preparing for a long conversation.

"Vaguely." Annie replied, though I couldn't recall her ever mentioning such a conversation with Catherine.

"Well, while I was still considering it, he already found himself a new girlfriend!" Catherine examined her manicure with exaggerated nonchalance. "And now he's trying to get close to my father through business deals. Can you believe the nerve?"

My interest marginally increased at the mention of business,though I maintained my distant position, leaning against Annie's desk with calculated casualness.

"My father discovered problems with his proposals and rejected all his offers," Catherine continued. "Dad warned me to stay away from him too."She looked up at Annie with wide eyes. "He was only interested in our family's money, not me."

"That's terrible," Annie said with genuine sympathy. "I'm sorry you had to go through that."

I remained silent, though my mind was already analyzing the fragments of business information Catherine had inadvertently dropped.


"The worst part," Catherine said dramatically, "is that he's trying to sabotage some of our investments now. My father is worried about the North City project especially. If that fails, our company could face serious problems." At the mention of North City, my attention fully engaged. That project had significant potential despite its current troubles.

"The North City development?" I asked, speaking for the first time since Catherine had begun her story.

Catherine seemed startled that I'd finally joined the conversation.'"Yes,"she replied, eyeing me suspiciously. "Why? Don't tell me you're interested in it too."

"What that man is doing," I said evenly, "trying to pressure your family into financial trouble to force you into marriage, is despicable." I moved away from the desk, my posture shifting subtly from annoyed observer to engaged businessman. "However, the North City project itself has considerable merit."

Catherine's eyes narrowed. "Are you just saying that to get back at me for interrupting your romantic moment?"

"I don't mix business with personal matters," I replied coolly,though internally I acknowledged she'd actually given me a valuable opportunity. "I can meet with your father to discuss potential collaboration on that project. If your... admirer... tries to withdraw funding to sabotage it, I can step in to ensure its completion."

Annie watched me with clear admiration in her eyes, understanding immediately what I was doing. We exchanged a look of silent communication that felt more intimate than our interrupted embrace had been.


Catherine seemed to consider my offer carefully. "That would actually help Father enormously," she admitted. "The project is critical for our company's growth strategy." She pulled out her phone. "I'll call him right now."

As Catherine spoke quietly into her phone, I moved to stand beside Annie. "I'm sorry about the interruption," I murmured, just loud enough for her to hear.

Annie smiled up at me. "Business never sleeps for CEOs, does it?"

"Some things are worth prioritizing," I replied, allowing my fingers to brush against hers briefly.

Catherine ended her call with obvious excitement. "Father says he can be here in twenty minutes! He's very interested in discussing this with you,Howard."

I nodded. "I'll have my assistant prepare the conference room."

"This is wonderful!" Catherine exclaimed. "I hope he hurries. The sooner we get this sorted out, the better for everyone."

As she continued chattering about the potential partnership, I exchanged another glance with Annie. HIer eyes held understanding and something deeper that made my chest tighten pleasantly. We'd have to postpone our celebratory dinner, but there would be oter evenings. Many other evenings, if I had any say in the matter.

The thought caught me by surprise. When had I started thinking about a future with Annie as an inevitability rather than a possibility? Watching her now - composed, intelligent, adaptable - I realized there was no going back. What had begun as a convenient arrangement had transformed into something I wasn't prepared to lose.


*If that means sitting through a meeting with Morgan instead of spending the evening alone with Annie, so be it,* I thought. *There will be time for us. I'll make sure of it.*


"Howard?" Annie's voice brought me back to the present. "Should I join the meeting or would you prefer to handle it alone?" The question carried multiple layers, as her questions often did. Was she offering professional support, or seeking reassurance that our personal relationship wouldn't interfere with business?

"Your insight would be valuable," I replied carefully. "If you're available."

Her smile told me she understood my real meaning. We were partners now,in more ways than one.

Catherine looked between us with renewed interest. "You two really are serious, aren't you?" For once, her tone lacked its usual teasing quality."T ve never seen Howard include anyone in his high-level negotiations before."

"Annie isn't just anyone," I said simply, allowing the weight of that truth to settle in the room.
###Chapter 78:Fantasy

Annie's POV

I watched as Mr. Morgan appeared in Howard's office less than twenty minutes after Catherine hung up the phone. When he walked in and saw me sitting in the meeting area, wariness flashed in his eyes.

My heart was still soaring from the joy of having just made my relationship with Howard official. We were no longer "pretending" to be a couple! The thought made my heart flutter, making it almost impossible to focus on the upcoming meeting.

"You really want them to be part of this conversation?" Mr. Morgan asked Howard,his tone carrying obvious concern as he glanced toward Catherine and me.

Howard's face remained characteristically calm. "One is your daughter, the other is my girlfriend. They're both trustworthy."

My heart skipped a beat hearing those words. The way he said "my girlfriend" carried a gentle possessiveness I'd never heard before, making me want to reách for his hand-though I certainly restrained that impulse in such a formal setting.

The brief explanation seemed to satisfy Mr. Morgan. He nodded, while Catherine watched her father nervously, an emotion I'd never seen her display before.

Then, Mr.Morgan began explaining the North City project to Howard in detail.Though their conversation was filled with technical terms that made it difficult for me to fully understand, I could read Howard's reactions-his eyes focused and sharp, occasionally nodding or furrowing his brow, his fingers precisely pointing out key data in the documents.

I found myself unable to concentrate on the meeting content, my gaze involuntarily drawn to Howard.

Watching his long fingers handling the documents, I couldn't help but imagine them unbuttoning my blouse, sliding across my bare skin and the shivers they would senid through my body. My breathing became slightly rapid as my mind flashed back to our interrupted kiss. If no one had walked in, would he have pressed me against his desk? I secretly glanced at the strong outline visible beneath his suit pants, my cheeks burning hot,unconsciously pressing my thighs together.

I tried to focus, but failed miserably. Every time Howard leaned closer,his cologne wrapped around me like an intimate embrace. When his fingers briefly touched my hand on the table, electricity shot through me, making me bite my lip to stay composed.

Get it together, Annie. This is a business meeting, not a fantasy.

His brilliance captivated me as much as his body. The way he dissected complex business problems reminded me of a chess master-always three moves ahead. Mr. Morgan's expressions shifted from skepticism to admiration as Howard spoke, and I felt an unexpected flutter of pride.This man is mine now. The thought made me dizzy with a strange possessive pleasure I'd never experienced with Philip.

"Now I am Howard's girlfriend," I silently repeated this fact to myself,feeling as though I was living in a dream I hardly dared believe. This new identity brought a warm joy to my heart, and though I knew challenges might lie ahead, in this moment I just wanted to savor this hard-won happiness.

Finally, Mr. Morgan admitted, "I know what to do now."

Howard simply responded, "Good, contact me when the time is right."

Before leaving, Mr. Morgan looked at me, then said to Catherine, "Howard likes your friend, which means she must be quite extraordinary."

I could sense the meaning behind these words-he had hoped his daughter might catch Howard's attention, but now he realized that a man like Howard might be more than his daughter could handle.

Catherine proudlly lifted her chin. "Of course! Why do you think I became friends with her?"

Mr. Morgan shook his head with a smile. "This is the first time you've chosen the right friend,Catherine."

After Mr. Morgan left, Catherine briefly explained their plan-wait for the other party to withdraw funding, then Howard would step in. My understanding of business strategies was limited, but I could appreciate the brilliance of Howard's thinking.

"You're so clever," Catherine said to Howard. "I was just complaining about that jerk trying to force me into marriage, and you came up with the perfect solution."

Howard calmly responded, "In business, thinking several moves ahead is a basic skill."

After a brief conversation, Catherine decided she needed to take learning about her family business more seriously. "I guess I'll just have to work harder while I'm young," she finally said, leaving the office with disappointment.

After Catherine left, Howard immediately walked to the door,locked it,then turned to face me.


"Finally, just the two of us," he said, his voice low enough to make my heart race. "Today's discussion went on too long."

He walked toward me, his gaze carrying a burning focus that reminded me of a predator eyeing its prey. But the feeling wasn't frightening-instead,it made my skin tingle with anticipation.

"You were impressive," I said softly, looking up at hím. "Mr. Morgan's admiration for you was obvious."

Howard smiled noncommittally and pulled me into his arms. "I care more about what you think."

When his lips met mine, all thoughts of business negotiations vanished.His kiss started gently but quickly grew eager, his arms holding me tightly against him, allowing me to feel the heat and strength of every inch of his body. I instinctively leaned into him, my arms encircling his neck, feeling his heartbeat.

As the kiss deepened, I could feel Howard's body responding,his desire evident against my abdomen. I wondered what his skin would fee1 like without clothes as a barrier. How would those hands that normally signed contracts and handled documents move across my body? What would those eyes, usually calmly analyzing problems, look like when he lost control?


Howard's hand slid from my back to my waist, then moved lower to my hips,pulling me tighter against him. I could feel my breathing becoming rapid, a warm sensation spreading through me. His other hand gently caressed my cheek, his thumb tracing my lower lip before he kissed me deeply again.

I immersed myself in this moment of intimacy, feeling his breáth surrounding me, my heart filled with indescribable longing and anticipation. Just as we were both about to lose control, the office door was suddenly pushed open...
###Chapter 79:Selena!!!

Howard's POV

I closed the office door and turned to face Annie. The soft "click" of the lock felt like it sealed our private moment together.

"Finally, just the two of us," I said, my voice involuntarily dropping to a deeper register.

Annie stood there, cheeks flushed with a delicate pink, her eyes holding a look of anticipation and trust I'd never seen in any other woman's eyres.That gaze made my chest tighten and my breathing deepen.

"You were really impressive," shesaid, looking up at me, her voice softer than usual. "Mr. Morgan was so skeptical at first, but by the end, he was completely convinced by you."

I didn't care what Morgan thought. In this moment, my world consisted only of Annie. I stepped forward and pulled her intomy arms."I only care what you think."

The moment my lips touched hers, all rational thought was thrown to the winds. Her lips were soft and warm, even sweeter than I had imagined.My kiss started tentatively but quickly grew urgent. Annie's response was equally fervent, her arms encircling my neck, her fingers gently threading through my hair, a sensation that nearly drove me wild.

My hands moved instinctively over her body, from her slender waist downward, feeling the curves of her body. I backed her against the edge of the table, hearing her slight gasp as our bodies pressed together. That sound ignited the flame within me.

"Howard..," she whispered my name betweenkisses,her voice trembling with unsteady breath. My rational mind had nearly evaporated completely, leaving only the primal desire to make her mine, right here, right now.

Suddenly,the office door was pushed open without warning.


"Click."

"Brother..."

I almost growled out loud. Damn it! Who dared to disturb us at this moment? Every muscle in my body tensed, blood racing through my veins,anger almost exploding from my chest. I maintained my position, still holding Annie in my arms, but my body had gone rigid as stone.

Annie quickly pushed away from me. "Someone's here," her voice carried a note of panic as she hastily adjusted her clothing.

I turned to see Selena, my beloved sister, standing in the doorway, herface a picture of shock.

Mom had said she would be here.

I suppressed the urge to curse, making my voice sound as calm as possible:"Come in."


Though I maintained my usual composure on the surface, my mind was in chaos. Damn it, we were so close! If she had arrived just ten minutes later... no, five minutes... Annie would have been mine. My body still burned with desire, the abrupt interruption feeling like torture.

Selena awkwardly approached my desk. "Brother."

I sat down with an expressionless face, firmly locking away the burning desire and anger deep within: "Next time you come in, remember to knock." My voice was cold enough to freeze water, but I knew this was the only way to control myself from lashing out at my sister. Selena nodded silently: "Okay."

I gestured for her to sit down, forcing myself into business mode:′′you have any questions, feel free to ask."

Selena had originally intended to ask about work matters, but was clearly shocked by what she'd just witnessed: "Is that my future sister-in-law?"

"Yes, that's her." At the mention of Annie, my eyes involuntarily softened.I couldn't help glancing at Annie sitting nearby, her head lowered, a strand of hair falling along the side of her face, her lips still flushed from our kisses. I couldn't help but imagine what those red lips would have been doing to me if we hadn't been interrupted... Damn, I needed to focus.

Selena lowered her voice: "She's beautiful... and seems very gentle. She's more than good enough for you."

I responded absently to Selena's comments, but my eyes kept drifting toward Annie. She sat on the sofa, her legs elegantly crossed, her skirt revealing a glimpse of smooth calf. My thoughts wandered again... What would it feel like to have those legs wrapped around my waist? What if I could kiss every inch of her skin? The image of Annie gasping beneath me forced me to adjust my sitting position to hide my still-present desire.

"So you came to see me just to gossip?" Iforced myself back to reality.

Selena quickly shook her head: "Of course not!"

She began talking at length about various company issues. My body sat at the table, my mouth mechanically responding to my sister's questions, but my mind was entirely focused on Annie. Every small movement she made pulled at my nerves-how she ran her fingers through her hair,how she gently bit her lower lip in thought, even the rhythm of her chest rising and falling with each breath...

"Your focus is misplaced to begin with," I heard myself saying,my voice professionally cold, in stark contrast to the heat raging inside me.

I began analyzing the problem for Selena while stealing glances at Annie.Sunlight streamed through the window, highlighting the curves of her body. My mind conjured images of her clothes being removed, her skin trembling under my touch... Damn, I needed to concentrate.

"What you need to focus on is what's causing these minor problems, not how to solve each small issue after it appears," I heard myself giving textbook business advice, but my eyes kept falling on Annie's neck,imagining what sounds she might make if I kissed her there...

"I understand now!" Selena's excited voice pulled me back to reality."Thank you, brother! If I have any other questions, can I come to you again?"

"Of course," I answered, absently tapping the desk. "I am your brother."

Selena looked relieved, said her goodbyes with a smile, and finally left the office.

The moment the door closed,I practically launched myself from my chair,striding purposefully toward Annie. The desire that had been suppressed for so long surged within me like a beast about to break free from its chains.


"Now,we can continue," I said in a low voice, hoarse with desire.

I pulled Annie into my arms, not giving her a chance to respond before claiming her lips. This kiss was more intense than before, more-desperate.My hands eagerly explored her body, one hand holding the back of her neck to deepen the kiss, the other finding its way under the hem of her blouse,touching her warm skin.

"Howard..." Annie gasped between kisses. "We can't..." "Why not?" I whispered against her lips, barely able to control myself.I could feel her responding to me, her body trembling slightly at my touch.her breathing becoming rapid. "Weboth want this, don't we?"

My hand continued upward, feeling the smoothness of her skin.I was completely dominated by desire, rationality long since abandoned.

"Howard, stop," Annie suddenly pushed me away forcefully,determination in her voice. "Not now..."

I froze in place, blood still boiling, looking at her in disbelief. "Why?"

Annie pointed to the clock on the wall: "It's already this late, we need to pick up Lucy. Did you forget? School's almost out."

Lucy. My rationality slowly returned to my brain like being doused with cold water. I glanced at the clock and realized it was indeed time to pick Lucy up from preschool. I took a deep breath, trying to calm my erratic breathing and heartbeat.

"Damn," I cursed under my breath, but it was no longer from anger at being interrupted, but frustration at myself for forgetting my responsibilities: "You're right."

I stepped back,straightening my suit and tie, trying to restore my usual appearance. Annie was also adjusting her clothing, her face still flushed,but her eyes had regained their clarity.


"Lucy is always punctual," Annie gently reminded me. "We can't keep her waiting too long."

I nodded, feeling a pang of guilt. No matter how much I desired Annie,Lucy would always come first in my life. This realization helped me regain my composure.

"I'll get the car," I said, my voice returning to its usual steadiness. Annie nodded with a smile, following me to the door. Before I opened it.she gently held my hand: "Howard..."

I turned to look at her, seeing the gentleness and understanding in her eyes.

"We'll have time," she said softly. "Just not now."

I felt the tightness in my chest gradually release, replaced by a warm sense of fulfillment. Annie understood my responsibilities, which made her even more precious to me.

"Of course," I answered, placing a gentle kiss on her forehead."Lucy always comes first."
###Chapter 80: So We Have the House to Ourselves?
Annie's POV

"Ready to go?" I asked, shelving the thought of our intimate moments.

Howard reached for my hand."Yes."

His fingers intertwined with mnine easily. Such a simple thing,but it hit me with unexpected force.

*Philip never held my hand like this.*

Philip had always kept his distance in public. No touching, no holding hands, not even putting his arm around me at company events.

"It looks unprofessional," he'd always say. "A CEO can't appear frivolous in public."

I'd believed him. I'd told myself it was normal, that all important men behaved this way. That Philip's coldness was simply the cost of being with someone successful. "Aren't you worried about people seeing us like this?" I asked at the elevator. "Won't it hurt your image?" Howard looked confused, then understanding crossed his face."Of course not. They'll just envy me for having such an accomplished girlfriend."

 He wasn't ashamed of me; he was proud.

"You're right," I said, feeling lighter somehow.

I needed to stop comparing Howard to Philip. They were nothing alike. Philip was insecure; Howard was confident.Philip hid our relationship; Howard embraced it.

In the car, Howard took my hand again, his thumb making small circles on my skin. I couldn't help smiling at how right it felt.


"What are you thinking about?" Howard asked quietly.

"Just how different things are now," I said. "Good different."

Howard squeezed my hand and actually smiled. I leaned against his shoulder, enjoying the moment before we reached the preschool.

We barely waited at the preschool before children began pouring out. Lucy appeared holding hands with another little girl, the two of them chatting together.

The other girl-Penny-spotted her mother and raced toward her with typical five-year-old energy. Lucy walked toward us more calmly, but when she saw me with Howard, her eyes lit up and she hurried the last few steps. "Mom, can Penny and her mom come to our house to play?Please?" Lucy asked quickly. *Mom*. That word still hit me every time. Not Annie, but *Mom*. It made my heart squeeze in the best way.

"Of course they can," I smiled. "No problem."

Lucy beamed and ran back to tell Penny, waving her arms excitedly. Just months ago, she wouldn't speak at all.

Sue Peterson approached with both girls. She was professionally dressed but clearly stressed,tension visible in how she held herself.

"I hope we're not imposing," Sue said quietly while the girls talked. "It's just that Dave-my ex-husband-has been harassing me. It's unbearable. I don't know what to do."

Howard stepped forward. "Have you thought about moving to a different neighborhood? Or selling your place and buying somewhere new?"

Sue shook her head. "He'd still find me. I can't move every time he causes trouble." Howard nodded. "You're right. I promised to arrange a bodyguard for you but forgot. Since you're coming over today,I can ask our physical trainer if he'd take on part-time work as your protection." I looked at Howard with new respect. This was nothing like Philip. Howard actually fixed problems instead of just talking about them. "Thomas Anderson-Lucy's gymnastics coach," Howard explained. "You need someone trustworthy. You'd just need escort to and from work, right?"

Sue nodded,hope flickering across her face. "That would be perfect."

"If you need anything else, or if Thomas's schedule doesn't work, we'll find someone else," Howard said.

"Thomas would be great," Sue said, her shoulders already relaxing. "I've met him at Lucy's training. He seems professional."

"Then it's settled," Howard said in that final way of his.




Thomas was already waiting when we reached Howard's home.Lucy and Penny immediately started giggling as they tried to follow his exercise instructions.

After workout, I took Sue and the girls to the living room while Howard talked privately with Thomas. I couldn't hear them, but Thomas's serious face changed to a smile as they spoke. Howard joined us minutes later. "It's all arranged," he told Sue. "Thomas will be your bodyguard and escort you both whenever needed." Sue's shoulders dropped in relief. "Now when Dave harasses me, I'll have protection."

"From now on," Howard said, "you and Penny can come here after school. After training, Penny can play with Lucy, then Thomas will take you home."

Sue smiled, the stress lines around her eyes fading."That would give Penny regular exercise too. I've felt much better since running with Lucy a few times."

"Perfect," Howard said. "Lucy will be happier with a friend around too."

"Thank you so much, Mr. Thompson," Sue said gratefully.

Howard was direct as always. "I promised this protection before and I'm only fulfilling it today. I should apologize for the delay."

"But you still kept your promise," Sue said quietly:′′NOone has ever been this considerate to me."


Howard shifted uncomfortably at the praise. "I treat all my employees this way."

Sue smiled. "Then it's a privilege to work for you." Watching them, I felt sure I'd found someone genuinely good.Howard wasn't helping for show-he was helping because it was right. After Sue and Penny left with Thomas, the house was unusually quiet. Lucy had gone for an evening walk with Margaret and Edward-her grandparents had insisted on taking her to see the garden lights in the neighborhood.

"They'll be gone at least an hour," Howard said, closing his laptop as I appeared in his study doorway. His tie was loosened, the top button of his shirt undone.

I leaned against the doorframe. "So we have the house to ourselves?"


Howard's eyes darkened as he stood up from his desk. "It seems we do."


"Remember what was interrupted this afternoon?" I asked, my pulse already quickening.

"Vividly." Howard crossed the room in a few strides. When he reached me, he didn't hesitate-his hands went straight to my waist,pulling me against him as his mouth found mine.

The kiss was different from our previous ones. No holding back,no worry about someone walking in. Just pure need that had been building for months. I fumbled with his tie, eager to see if the body beneath his perfect suits matched what I'd imagined during all those office meetings. Howard seemed just as impatient, his hands already under my blouse, warm against my skin. "Bedroom," he murmured against my neck, then simply lifted me. I wrapped my legs around his waist as he carried me down the hall. Once in his room, our clothes quickly formed a trail to his bed.The reality of Howard's body was even better than my fantasies-broad shoulders,firm chest, every part of him exactly as powerful as I'd imagined during those moments I'd caught myself staring at him across conference tables.

"I've thought about this," I admitted as his hands explored my body. "About you."

Howard's eyes locked with mine. "So have I. More than I should have during business hours."

The thought of controlled, composed Howard Thompson distracted by thoughts of me during meetings was unexpectedly thrilling.

His touch was confident but gentle, finding all the right places,drawing responses from me I hadn't known were possible.With Philip, intimacy had been mechanical, something to endure rather than enjoy. Howard made me feel treasured,desired-like an equal partner rather than a possession. When we finally came together, his movements were both confident and attentive. Howard watched my face carefully,adjusting his rhythm whenever my breath caught or my fingers dug into his shoulders. Unlike Philip, who had always treated intimacy as a race to finish, Howard seemed to savor every moment, every touch, every soft gasp he drew from me. "Annie," he whispered my name like a prayer, his control slipping as we moved together. When the tensionfinally broke, waves of pleasure washed over me more intensely than I'd ever experienced. Howard held me through it, his own release following mine. For those moments,I forgot everything-my past, my worries, even my name.
There was only sensation and connection.

After, wrapped in Howard's arms, I felt completely at peace for the first time in years. My body still hummed with satisfaction,little aftershocks of pleasure occasionally making me shiver against him.

"What are you thinking?" he asked, stroking my hair,his fingers tracing lazy patterns against my scalp.

"That reality is better than fantasy," I said honestly. "Much better."


Howard smiled against my temple, pressing a kiss there. "We have an hour before they return." His hand slid down my back,fingers drawing patterns on my skin.

"Already?" I asked, but my body was already responding to his touch, arching into him automatically. "I've waited months for this," Howard said,voice dropping to that low register that made my stomach flutter. He rolled me beneath him, his weight a delicious pressure as he kissed down my neck. I ran my hands over the strong muscles of his back,marveling at how different this felt-how right. Howard's fingers found sensitive places I didn't even know I had, drawing sounds from me I'd never made before.

As we moved together again, slower this time but no less intense, I realized I'd never known it could be like this-a conversation without words, a give and take of pleasure that left me breathless and wanting more even as satisfaction washed over me.
###Chapter 81:Hello?

Philip's POV

I parked my car along the roadside near the Thompson estate, not expecting to see Brian here. He was sitting alone in a car, his gaze fixated on Howard's residence.

I approached the vehicle and gently tapped on the window. "Knock, knock.
"

"Mom is so nice..." I heard Brian muttering to himself. "She gets along with everyone. Mom is so gentle too... she's good to everyone." He sighed deeply. "Too bad... I'll never get to experience that firsthand again..."

Hearing the knocking, Brian turned his head and lowered the window. His chubby face remained expressionless. "Dad, what do you want?"

"I didn't expect to see you here," I said, gesturing toward the mansion."Are you here to see her too?"

I truly didn't understand what had happened. Not long ago, Annie and Howard's relationship was strictly professional, but now they were reportedly quite intimate. This news pierced my chest like a sharp blade.My Annie, my ex-wife, the woman who once obeyed my every wish,had now fallen into another man's arms? During the quiet hours of night,when I closed my eyes, images would appear in my mind-Annie nestled in Howard's embrace as they talked intimately, smiled at each other,and even more intimate contact... These thoughts burned like a raging fire from my chest to my throat,nearly suffocating me. I couldn't sleep, couldn't focus on work, could barely think clearly. I already had Sarah, so why did Annie's situation cause me such agony? This feeling of losing control terrified me and made me furious-how couald I allow Howard Thompson to take everything that should rightfully be mine?

"I just..." Brian's voice grewsofter, "wanted to make sure Mom is doing well."


"I know you refused to help me last time," I continued, "probably because you didn't realize how close they've become."

"Isn't it better that they're close?" Brian calmly responded. "The person you love is Sarah, not her. Mom has finally found someone who loves her..."1


He looked directly at me. "Why are you so obsessed with ruining everything?"

I was speechless.

After a long silence, I finally said, "She was once my wife."

"You said it yourself-'once," Brian answered unhurriedly. "That's already in the past tense."

"I just want to watch from a distance as Mom starts her new life and feels happy," Brian said softly, as if telling himself, "That's enough for me."




Just as Brian and I reached an impasse, my phone suddenly rang. I took out my phone and saw Sarah's name on the screen. I answered with some hesitation: "What is it?" "Philip..." Sarah's voice was sweet and tearful, "I've sprained my ankle. Could you come check on me?" I hesitated. I glanced at Brian, then at Annie on the balcony.
  I didn't know Sarah's exact situation, but I could imagine her pacing around her apartment, repeatedly contemplating her circumstances.Although I claimed to thoughtfully keep her away from Howard, I hadn't actually made an effort to see her.

Brian must have overheard this conversation. I noticed a flash of contempt in his eyes, but he quickly concealed it.

"Dad, even if you go see Sarah, Mom won't be angry," Brian said with feigned understanding. "Mom is a kind woman; she'll understand."

I looked at Brian as he met my gaze. My resolve wavered.

On the other end of the line, Sarah didn't urge me. Instead, she said in a tearful voice, "Philip, it really hurts."

Hearing this, I suddenly made my decision and told Brian, "Wait for me a moment." Then I got into my car and stepped on the gas.

As I drove away, through the rearview mirror, I saw Brian's face break into a contemptuous smile.

"Even at this point, Dad still can't let go of Sarah, yet he dreams of reconciling with Mom..." I thought I heard Brian mutter to himself. "Is he planning to reconcile with Mom while continuing to entangle with Sarah?How disgusting."

Hlis voice grew gentler: "I'm glad Mom found a man who truly loves her and is completely loyal to her."

Through the rearview mirror, I caught a final glimpse of Brian turning back toward the balcony, continuing to watch Annie's figure.



I arrived at Sarah's Brooklyn apartment and rang the doorbell. Standing at the door, I watched as Sarah gently lifted her right foot.lmping painfully to answer. She gave me a fragile smile,"You came?"

My heart instantly softened. Seeing her struggle toward the living room.I lifted her into my arms.


Sarah wrapped her arms around my neck, shedding tears of self-pity."I thought you didn't want to take care of me anymore."

"How could that be?" I placed her on the sofa, knelt before her, and held her hand. "What happened to your foot?"

Sarah looked at her foot, biting her lip as she said, "Living alone, accidents happen.I thought it was just a minor injury and shouldn't bother you.But there's no one here. I'm pregnant, and I still have Max to take care of...



Her eyes filled with tears as she continued, "I can barely walk. I only called you because I had no other choice."

She threw herself into my embrace. Instinctively, I wanted to push her away,but I didn't.

"In the near future, you'll return to Annie," Sarah sobbed. "By then,I'll have to keep my distance from you... I won't be able to embrace you anymore. So now..."

She looked up at me, tears glistening in her eyes, "Please don't reject me.okay?"

Looking at her face, I suddenly wondered if Annie had ever felt this helpless when we were together. I wasn't sure if I was trying to atone, if I genuinely felt sorry for Sarah, or if there was another reason entirely.

In the end, I couldn't be cruel to her. I gently embraced her. Annie was once pregnant too." I said softly. "She would certainly understand your pain."

Sarah didn't respond.

"Even if I reconcile with her, she wouldn't stopy me from caring about you."I continued.


I failed to notice the flash of smugness that crossed Sarah's face. Had I seen it then, perhaps I would have realized how skillfully she manipulated me-a few tears, playing the victim, and I was completely hooked.

But at that moment. I only wanted to do the right thing. I placed my hands on Sarah's shoulders. "I'll call her right now."

Sarah looked at me in confusion.

"I need to clear things up with her in advance," I explained. "That way, if we do reconcile in the future, she won't be angry."


I knew Annie had blocked my number, so mycalls wouldn't go through.I picked up Sarah's phone and dialed Annie's number.

To my surprise, the call connected.

"Hello?" I said, my fingers unconsciously tightening around the phone.
###Chapter 82: I'll Get Jealous

Annie's POV

I rested against Howard's chtest, our bodies still warm from making love.The morning sunlight streamed through the blinds of his bedroom.I traced my finger along his chest, my thoughts drifting to practical matters despite our intimate moment.

"Lucy has an event at school." I said. "We should ask her tomorrow about the exact date."


"Good idea," Howard replied, his hand running lazily up and down my back. He paused before adding, "Having you by my side has made things so much easier for me."


"Oh?" I looked up at him, curious about the sudden admission.

"Before you came to live with us, I had to manage everything myself," he explained. "Especially things related to Lucy... I was constantly worried I'd miss something that might upset her. But now that you've become Lucy's mom. you've taken over these responsibilities."


I smiled and teased him. "With the salary you pay me every month, I'd feel guilty if I didn't handle these things. I'd just be wasting your money,wouldn't I?"


"I don't see it that way, Annie," he said, his fingers brushing my cheek."Even if all you did was keep Lucy company and help her improve, that money would be wel spent."

I paused, touched by his sincerity. "Really?"

Howard leaned forward and kissed me softly, "Yes," he whispered.

I reached for my phone on the nightstand.′′Bthe way, I need to visit my mother in Brooklyn tomorrow."

Howard's hand rested on my hip. "Would you like me to come with you?"

Since making our relationship official, the space between us had changed.His touch felt more honest now,more meaningful.

"Yes, that would be nice," I replied.


We lay together quietly until my phone buzzed. The screen showed a number I didn't recognize. As soon as I answered, I regretted it.

"Annie?" Philip's voice came through-that familiar tone of fake concern that always made my skin crawl.

I sat up straight, my good mood instantly ruined. Howard tensed beside me. "How didI you get this number?" I asked, keeping my voice flat. "I blocked you."

Philip ignored my question. "Sarah is pregnant with my child," he announced as if delivering great news.

I turned to Howard, mouthed "Philip," and put the call on speaker.

"When you forgive me and we remarry," Philip continued with stunning arrogance, "I hope you can be generous enough... to accept this child."

I laughed in disbelief. The nerve of this man! Howard's jaw tightened as he listened.

Philip clearly cared about this unborn baby, though not much for Sarah herself. That would make thetruth about Sarah's manipulation hit him even harder when he eventually learned it.

"When that happens," Philip continued, oblivious to how ridiculous he sounded, "I probably won't be able to love you as completely as before."

 My stomach turned. Six years of matriage to this man,and he still thought this was how to talk to me.

"Because a young child needs more attention and love than you do." he explained in that condescending tone hed used throughout our marriage-the same tone he'd used to explain why he missed Brian's school events or worked through our anniversaties. "Sarah, having also given birth.will need care as well..."

"Stop." I cut him off, my hands clenching into fists. The memories of being ignored and dismissed for years flooded back. "Have I given you any indication that I want to reconcile with you?

There was a pause-Philip clearly hadn't expected resistance to his grand plan.

"No," he finally admitted.

"Good," I said firmly. "I understandI you love Sarah and her child. If you want to build a life with her, that's between you and her. It has nothing to do with me. I won't interfere, and you don't need to inform me about it."

I had better things to do with my time than listen to Philip's self-serving fantasies. Every word from him pulled me back toward that suffocating marriage where nothing I felt or needed ever mattered.

After a long silence, Philip asked. "What would it take for you to forgive me?" His voice had that wounded tone that used to make me doubt myself. "Nothing." I answered immediately, feeling Howard's supportive presence beside me. "Because there's no possibility of us getting back together.Goodbye, Philip." I ended the call and blocked the number again. I tossed my phone aside and fell back against the pillows. "He's unbelievable." Howard pulled me close. "He doesn't deserve a moment of your attention."

I nodded against his chest. "I'd blocked his number, yet he still found a way to contact me. He's certainly persistent."

"Unfortunately, his persistence is completely misguided," Howard said,his voice hardening when discussing Philip.

I sat up and changed the subject. "Rather than thinking about him,I should focus on visiting my mother tomorrow-whether I should bring anything, and how to explain things to her without making her angry."

Howard touched my cheek. "Is she still opposed to your divorce?"

I sighed. "From my mother's perspective, I should never have gotten divorced under any circumstances. I defied her advice. She'll certainly scold me."


Howard's hand moved to my shoulder. "We'll handle it together," he promised, pulling me back into his arms and making me forget everything else.





The following morning, I woke up early in my own room. Howard and I had decided it would be better if I returned to my bedroom before Lucy woke up. After showering and getting dressed, I stepped into the hallway to find Howard waiting. He wore a dark blue silk pajama set that made him look even more handsome than usual. The memory of our night together flashed through my mind-his strong hands, his body against mine. He took my hand, his thumb brushing over my knuckles. The simple touch sent warmth through me. I looked at our linked fingers,still adjusting to this new reality between us. "What are you thinking about?" Howard asked quietly.

I answered honestly,"You."

Howard stopped at Lucy's bedroom door, his eyes fixed on me. "Oh?"

"I just realized that after making our relationship official, I finally understand what normal dating is supposed to be like," I explained.

Before Howard, I had only been with Philip. During our six years together,Philip rarely held my hand or kissed me unless he wanted something.I'd grown to think that was normal. But Howard was different-he touched me simply because he wanted to, not as a transaction or performance.

Howard smiled, a rare sight that transformed his usually serious face.Before he could speak, Lucy's bedroom door opened.

We automatically stepped apart as Lucy appeared in the doorway, eyeing our joined hands with suspicion.

"You two should tone it down a bitin front of me," she said, sounding much older than her five years.

"Okay," I said, letting go of Howard's hand.

Lucy immediately grabbed my hand and pulled me into her bedroom."Mom,when I'm around, you have to act like you love me more,otherwise I'll get jealous." I understood the fear behind her playful demand. "Lucy, it's not just an act-I really do love you," I assured her, kneeling to look her in the eyes.Lucy tried to keep a straight face but couldn't help smiling. "Well, alright then." "By the way, when is your school event happening?" I asked as I fixed her hair. "Probably next week," she said,not completely sure.

My schedule was flexible enough to make it work. "When the day comes,I'Il make sure to clear my schedule to be there with you..."

Lucy's face lit up. After finishing her morning routine, she came out and looked at Howard, who waited patiently in the hall. "Dad, do you have time next week?"


Howard never refused Lucy anything. Even with his demanding job,he would make time for her. "Yes," he answered without hesitation.

"Then can you come with Mom to my preschool event?" Lucy asked hopefully.

"Of course I can," Howard replied1, his expression softening in that special way reserved only for Lucy and me.
###Chapter 83: Mom's Worries

Annie's POV

I scrolled through my phone as Howard drove us to Brooklyn, trying to think of a gift for my mother. Nothing seemed right.

"I should have brought something," I muttered, tapping my screen harder than necessary.


"Still struggling with gift ideas?" Howard asked.

"Mom hates useless things. Clothes are 'too fancy,' decorations 'collect dust,'and flowers 'just die,"I said, mimicking her matter-of-fact tone.

After another minute of pointless scrolling. I opened my banking app instead. Since starting at Howard Technologies, my bank account had grown more than it ever did during six years with Philip. Between my salary, illustration work, and merchandise sales. I now had money that was actually mine.

I transferred $10,000 to my mother's account and texted her about it. Her immediate response was just a question mark.

I smiled. That was so like her -practical, blunt, and always suspicíous when things came too easily.

"Good news?" Howard asked,catching my smile.

"Just Mom being Mom." I put my phone away. "Money is the only gift she won't complain about." As we parked outside her building, Howard looked at me. "Want me to wait here?" "No,come up." I unbuckled my seatbelt. "I want her to see I'm doing fine."
The truth was, I wanted her to see Howard too. Wanted her to know I hadn't crashed and burned without Philip like she'd feared. I wasn't ready to admit how important Howard had become to me, but bringing him to meet my mother felt like a statement.

I knocked firmly on her door.

"Who is it!" Mom shouted from inside.

"It's me,Mom."

The door flew open, and there stood Ruth Miller, gray hair in a tight bun,wearing the same old sweater I'd seen dozens of times.

"You finally remembered your mother exists?" she said, though her eyes brightened seeing me. She noticed Howard and immediately sized him up."Come in,then."


We followed her inside. The apartment was exactly as I remembered-small,worn,but spotlessly clean, just like Mom herself.

We sat down, Howard and I on the couch, Mom in her old armchair.She kept glancing at Howard but grabbed my hand instead of asking about him.


"You mentioned divorcing Philip last time we talked," she said,squeezing my hand. "Been too busy to call and check. What happened?" My stomach tightened. Mom had always been against divorce - she'd survived as a single mother and didn't want that life for me. In her mind,a woman needed a husband for security.

"I already divorced him, Mom." I couldn't meet her eyes.

She smacked my arm hard enough to leave a mark. "Are you stupid?" Her voice rose to a near-shriek as her face contorted with disbelief. "Now that
###Chapter 83: Mom's Worries

other woman gets him for free! Everything you worked for, she just walks in and takes!"

I stayed quiet. Experience had taught me that defending myself would only make things worse.

"I don't care what you say," she continued, leaning forward with her finger jabbing the air between us. Her earrings swung wildly as she shook her head. "You need to get back with Philip immediately. Where's Brian? Is he with you?"

The question stung, but I kept my face blank.

"Listen to your mother," she pressed on, not waiting for my answer. Her hands gripped her knees so tightly her knuckles turned white. "Men can throw away wives, but never their children. That's their blood." She thumped the table for emphasis with each point. "Keep Brian with you,and Philip will come back eventually. Without the boy, he won't even look your way." Mom jumped to her feet so quickly her chair nearly toppled over. Her face turned scarlet, veins bulging at her temples. "Are you trying to kill me?"She pounded her fist against her chest repeatedly, her voice growing hoarse. "Who's going to support you without Philip?" Her arms flew wide,gesturing around the small apartment. "Do you know how hard this world is for a woman alone?" She pulled a crumpled tissue from her pocket and twisted it between her fingers as tears welled in her eyes. Her shoulders trembled slightly. I understood what caused those tears. Mom had worked three jobs sometimes, counted every penny at the grocery store, and worn the same clothes for years so I could have what she never did. Her entire life had taught her one lesson: women need men to survive.

"I support myself now, Mom." I kept my voice steady. "I have a good job and my illustration work. I make more now than I ever did with Philip.This month alone, I earned hundreds of thousands after taxes. Next month will be better."

The word "money" worked like magic. Mom's anger disappeared instantly,replaced by disbelief.

"You're not making this up?" She slowly sat back down.

"No. And I plan to earn enough to take care of both of us when we're older. The money I sent is just the start."

She waved her hand dismissively. "Keep your money. I can take care of myself. What I want to know is about Brian. You really left him completely with Philip?"

"He chose Sarah as his mother," I said simply. "I'm respecting that."

Mom took a deep breath, disappointment written across her face.She stared at me for a long moment.

"You should go now."

I stood up without arguing, Howard, who hadn't said a word the entire time,followed me silently out the door. Once we reached the car, Howard squeezed my shoulder. "Are you okay?" "Ill handle it," I said, blinking back unexpected tears. "She'll come around eventually." Back at the office, I sat at my desk with Mom's words still ringing in my ears. Relief washed over me that I hadn't listened to her about getting Philip back.

What if I had? Philip might have pretended to return, but he would have kept seeing Sarah behind my back.

Eventually, he might have expected me to accept them both in his life. The thought made me sick.

I looked around at my new reality - a job that paid well, a daughter who called me "Mom," and a relationship with Howard built on respect instead of control. For the first time, I felt like I was living my own life,not someone else's.

A knock interrupted my thoughts.

"Come in," I said from my desk.

Susan Moore entered and nodded to me.

She stopped at my desk. "We've finished translating your comnics.The international department will start promotion in a few days. The first animated episode translation is almost done too - it'll be ready in two weeks for simultaneous release."

She set a stack of papers in front of me. "We'll start with a smaller promotion since content is limited. As we translate more, marketing will increase.""Within a year, your comics will be known worldwide," she continued."Merchandise sales will explode. You'll be making more money than you can count." "So I'll actually be rich?" I asked, half-joking. "Definitely," she nodded. "I'm also talking to publishers about printing physical copies."
"But I haven't finished the story yet," I pointed out.

They'll release volumes," she explained. "You have enough for about two books already. And seeing how merchandise sales improve daily, I can't imagine how well the books will sell."
As she talked, a warm sense of pride spread through me. Everything I'd been working for was finally happening.
My fingers traced over the documents, my mind flashing back to Mom's worried face. If only she could see me now. I wasn't Philip's accessory anymore- I was building something real, something mine.
"This is amazing," I told the secretary, not hiding my excitement. "Thank you."

After she left, I leaned back in my chair,smiling. Mom was wrong. I hadn t crashed without Philip - I was soaring. A thriving career, Lucy's love,and Howard's respect. Everything I never thought I could have.
I took a deep breath, almost dizzy with happiness. It felt too perfect, too complete - like a fairy tale ending I'd never dared to hope for. And that's when the tiny voice in my head whspered a warning: Could anything really stay this perfect?
###Chapter 84:Grandma Ruth

Brian's POV

I stared at the ceiling, watching as morning sunlight crept across my bedroom. Another day. The light pattern on my comforter reminded me of how Mom used to point out shapes in the clouds when wwe'd sit in Central Park. My chest tightened at the memory.
Suddenly,I remembered-next week was the big event at preschool. Lucy and I would be reciting a poem together. The thought sat heavy in my stomach like a stone.

All the other kids would have parents there-cheering,taking pictures,beaming with pride. And me? I'd probably be the only one standing alone.Dad barely noticed me anymore. His world revolved around Sarah and her baby now. And Grandma Betty was just as bad, constantly fussing over Sarah like she was already family, like I didn't even exist anymore.
"Brian, time to get up." MMs. Taylor's voice came through the door, crisp and professional.

I dragged myself out of bed and shuffled into the hallway. The breakfast table was already set-a bowl of cereal, sliced fruit, and a glass of orange juice. I sat down and stared at the food. It wasn't anything like Mom's special breakfasts-her banana pancakes shaped like animals or her French toast with cinnamon smiley faces drawn in powdered sugar. But at least there was food. Everything had changed since Mom left. "Thank you," I said quietly, making sure to eat every bite. Mom always said wasting food was disrespectful to those who didn't have enough.Thinking about her advice made my heart ache all over again. After finishing breakfast, I took a deep breath and asked, "Ms. Taylor, my preschool has a parent-child event next week. Could you come?" Ms. Taylor exchanged a quick glance with Mitchell, who stood near the doorway. I could read their concerned expressions-they were worried about overstepping boundaries.

Mitchell cleared his throat. "Would your father be upset if we attended,Brian?"

At the mention of Dad, I felt my chest tighten and the small smile I'd managed disappeared instantly. "Dad only cares about Sarah now," I said,my voice getting smaller. "He won't even notice anything about preschool events."

I looked down at my empty bowl, whispering, "Dad hasn't really been home much lately... and Grandma Betty just wants to take care of Sarah's baby. So don't worry, nobody will care who I invite as my family."

I tried to keep my voice steady, not wanting them to see how much it hurt.But I think they knew anyway, because Mitchell's eyes suddenly got watery.

Mitchell knelt down to my level, meeting my eyes directly."Then I will definitely be there, Brian."
Ms. Taylor quickly added, "I'll come too! We'll both be there to support you!"
A warm feeling spread through my chest, and I couldn't help but smile genuinely. "You're both so nice.Thank you." Back in my room, I sat on the edge of my bed, imagining the day of the event. Would Mom be there? She lived with Lucy now, so she'd definitely attend to watch Lucy perform. That meant she would see me too...right? I went to my closet and carefully looked through every outfit. I needed to wear something really nice so Mom would spot me immediately in the crowd. And I would practice the poem perfectly so when Lucy and I recited it together,Mom would feel proud of me.

Maybe she'd take pictures or videos, and then I'd be on her phone. My eyes got misty thinking about it. I could pretend... just for a little while...that she came for me too.

Standing at the school entrance, I spotted Mom in the distance.She was holding Lucy's hand, with Uncle Howard standing beside them. Lucy hugged Mom's leg,seeming to plead for something. I froze in place,unable to approach them but couldn't look away either.
Mom smiled so gently, stroking Lucy's golden hair with such tenderness.She used to do the same for me-comfort me when I made mistakes,protect me when I was scared. Now all her warmth belonged to Lucy.
I bit my lip hard to keep from crying. Upper East Side Private Preschool boys don't cry in public-Dad always emphasized that.
Lucy skipped happily toward her friend Penny while Mom and Uncle Howard turned toward their car. I wanted so badly to run after them, to shout "Mom!" and make her turn around to see me. But my feet felt rooted to the ground, unable to take a single step.
"She must have seen me," I whispered to myself. "Because I was standing right next to Lucy. Mom must have noticed me."
I convinced myself that Mom had actually come to drop me off too.This thought gave me the strength to walk through the school doors, even though deep down I knew it was just my imagination. I felt my backpack lighten suddenly-Mitchell had taken it from my shoulders. "Brian, I'll pick you up after school," he said kindly. I nodded, "Okay, Mitchell. Thank you." Before entering the classroom, I couldn't help looking back one more time, hoping to catch another glimpse of Mom, but she was already gone.

Back home in the afternoon, I was sitting at my desk doing homework when my phone suddenly rang. Grandma Ruth's number flashed on the screen. I was surprised-she hadn't contacted me in ages.
"Hello?" I answered cautiously.

"Child," Grandma Ruth's warm voice came through the phone,"are you free tonight?"
I immediately relaxed a little. Grandma Ruth's voice was always so gentle,reminding me of Mom. After all, Mom's kindness must have come from her.

"Hmm?" I responded simply, unsure why she was calling out of the blue.

"Grandma misses you," she said in that warm way that sounded a bit like Mom, with her slight Brooklyn accent. "How about visiting Grandma after school?"

Her words sent a wave of warmth through me. Grandma Ruth actually cared about me, unlike Dad and Grandma Betty. I suddenly realized I hadn't visited her since Mom left.

"Yes!" I answered,feeling excited.

"What would you liketo eat? Grandma will cook for you," she asked, her voice full of affection. Mom always taught me not to be picky about food, to be grateful for what I received. "I like everything you make, Grandma," I replied honestly. My answer seemed to touch her, as her voice grew even softer:"Then Grandma will make all your favorite dishes!" "That's wonderful!" I exclaimed, feeling a rush of warmth. Grandma Ruth had always loved me, even after Mom and Dad's divorce, her love remained unchanged.

Hanging up, I leaned back in my chair, feeling a sense of comfort wash over me. I missed Mom terribly, but at least I still had Grandma. Maybe tonight I could ask her about Mom. Grandma Ruth would surely know how Mom was doing, whether she was truly happy. Perhaps I could even gather the courage to tell Grandma Ruth about next week's school event and invite her to attend.

Mitchell entered the room and, seeing my smile, smiled back. "Brian looks happy today?"
"Grandma invited me to her house for dinner," I answered. "Can we go to Brooklyn tonight?"
"Of course," Mitchell nodded. "I'll arrange the car right away."

Thinking about seeing Grandma Ruth, I felt both nervous and excited.I wasn't sure what we'd talk about, but at least at Grandma Ruth's house,I could feel that sense of being loved-the same feeling I had when Mom was around.
###Chapter 85: The Plan Was Brilliant

Caroline Gluck's POV

I stepped out of the elevator into Howard Technologies' pristine lobby,taking a moment to appreciate how my Louboutins clicked satisfyingly against the marble floor. The receptionist smiled at me with that practiced corporate warmth as I flashed my employee badge.
"Good morning, Ms. Gluck."

"Morning, Heather," I replied, making a point to remember her name.People are always more useful when they think you value them.
I'm Caroline Gluck, and I've been working at Howard Technologies for several months now. Most people here see me as a colleague. What they don't know is that I'm also Sarah Johnson's closest confidante-her secret weapon inside these glass walls.
Sarah and I clicked instantly when we met at a charity gala. Both of us understand what it means to be truly cultured, to have an eye for quality that goes beyond mere money. We became fast friends, kindred spirits navigating a world of pretenders.
I made my way to my office, observing my colleagues with the trained eye of someone who grew up in Manhattan's elite circles. Emma from Marketing walked by,Howard Technologies logo emblazoned on her travel mug like some garish billboard. So nouveau riche, I thought. Real class whispers, it doesn't shout. Kevin fromn Tech hurried past in what he probably thought was a decent suit. The shoulders were at least a quarter inch too wide,and the fabric clearly off-the-rack. I doubted he'd ever attended a truly sophisticated social gathering in his life. Poor thing. Miranda from HR nodded at me, her recently dyed hair catching the light in a way that screamed "salon chain" rather than "private stylist." No woman in a high social circle would ever be caught with such obvious coloring.

These people all graduated from prestigious universities, but education can't teach taste. That comes from generations of refinement-something Sarah and I understand implicitly.
I settled at my desk,checking my calendar for the day. Ever since Annie Baker's childish comic series exploded in popularity, Susan Moore had taken complete control of its promotion, shelving my carefully crafted marketing proposals for Sarah.
The thought still irritated me. Annie's simplistic drawings gaining such traction while Sarah's sophisticated storytelling remained underpromoted?Absurd. The masses truly have no discernment.
My phone buzzed with a text from Sarah: Can't wait much longer.Time to make my move on Howard.
I smiled to myself. Sarah was getting impatient, and when Sarah got impatient, things got interesting. Philip Baker had served his purpose as a stepping stone, but Howard Thompson was the real prize-wealthy,powerful, and infinitely more connected than Philip.
I texted back: Don't worry. I'll get you what you need. Speaking to Susan today about resources. Time to see what that glorified secretary was up to. I smoothed my dress and headed toward Susan's office. Susan's office was meticulous but utterly lacking in personality. The framed diplomas, perfectly aligned desk supplies, and that hideous motivational poster about "Determination" screamed middle-class functionality.No original artwork, no family heirlooms-nothing that spoke of history or heritage.

Susan herself was nowhere to beseen, but her computer screen remained on. I glanced around the hallway before stepping closer to peek at her monitor. Always good to know what's happening before asking for favors.
What I saw made my blood boil. A comprehensive plan for Annie's comic empire lay out in meticulous detail:
OPublishing contracts with major houses in twelve countries

OProduction capacity expansion for merchandise

OFactory acquisitions to increase manufacturing scale

OInternational marketing rollout scheduled for next quarter

Unbelievable. A simple secretary was controlling business decisions worth millions of dollars. For some amateur illustrator's childish doodles.Meanwhile,Sarah's sophisticated narrative art languished without proper support.

I heard footsteps and quickly stepped back, assuming a casual pose by the bookshelf. Susan entered carrying a stack of files, her sensible heels making substantially less noise than my designer ones.
"Caroline, I didn't see you scheduled," Susan said, not unkindly but with that slightly officious tone secretaries often adopt to feel important.  "Just thought I'd drop by," I replied with my warmest smile. "Hope I'm not interrupting anything crucial." "Not at all. What can I help you with?" Susan settled into her chair,straightening her serviceable but clearly off-the-rack blazer. I took the visitor's chair, crossing my legs elegantly, "I wanted to discuss a new comic series I've discovered. The content is quite extensive now, and I've drafted a promotion plan that I believe would resonate beautifully with upper-tier demographics."
"Oh? Which series are you referring to?" Susan's expression remained neutral, professional curiosity evident in her tone.
"It's a relatively unknown work," I replied smoothly. "But the artistic voice deserves cultivation. I was hoping we might allocate some resources toward building the creator's platform-similar to what we've done for Annie."

Susan's lips tightened almost imperceptibly. "All promotional resources are currently directed toward Annie's work, per Howard's explicit instructions.Her content has proven market viability."
I maintained my pleasant expression while internally rolling my eyes. This secretary actually thinks she has decision-making authority.
"I completely understand Howard's focus on proven performers,"I said,my voice honey-sweet. "But diversification benefits everyone. Sarah's sophisticated storytelling would attract an elite demographic that might find Annie's work a bit... simplistic."
Susan's professional mask slipped momentarily. "Caroline, with all due respect, company resources aren't allocated based on personal friendships.Annie's work generates substantial revenue and positive brand association.Her merchandising line alone outperforms most of our tech products in profit margin." How dare she speak to me like that? I thought, while maintaining my pleasant expression. One day, when Sarah succeeds with Howard,I'll make sure this overpromoted secretary understands her actual place in the hierarchy. I smiled to myself. This was classic Sarah-bold but clever. "What's your strategy?" "Of course," I said with practiced graciousness, "I completely understand the business perspective. I simply thought Sarah's unique vision might comnplement our existing portfolio."
Susan softened slightly. "All promotional decisions go through proper channels. If Sarah's work has commercial potential, it can be evaluated through standard procedures."

I nodded,accepting defeat for now. "Thank you for clarifying. I appreciate your time."
As I left Susan's office, my smile disappeared the moment her door closed behind me. That woman had no idea who she was dismissing so casually.
Back in my office, I immediately called Sarah, closing my door for privacy.

"You won't believe how dismissive Susan was," I said when Sarah answered. "The woman actually lectured me about 'proper channels' and'proven market viability.' As if she has the first idea about what sophisticated audiences appreciate."
Sarah's voice sounded tired. "Philip was here all night again, talking endlessly about reconciling with Annie while expecting me to comfort him.I'm done playing this waiting game,Caroline."
"I understand completely," I replied, genuinely sympathetic. Sarah deserved better than being Philip's emotional crutch. "Don't worry about your comic promotion. I'll leverage my publishing contacts directly.We don't need Howard Technologies' marketing department." "I need intelligence," Sarah replied. "Howard's schedule, his routines,where he goes when he leaves the building. Can you track that for me?"

"Absolutely," I said, already mentally cataloging what I knew about Howard's patterns. "The security system here logs all executive movements.As an employee, I can easily monitor the building exits without raising suspicion."

"Perfect," Sarah said, her voice gaining energy. "I need to orchestrate accidental meetings-nothing too obvious, just enough to establish a presence in his awareness."

"The coffee shop across from the south entrance," I suggested."He stops there most mornings around 8:30. And there's a restaurant on 53rd where he often takes business lunches on Thursdays."
"You're brilliant, Caroline," Sarah said warmly.

"I'll need photographs," Sarah continued. "Nothing explicit,just images of Howard and me together-angled to appear more intimate than they actually are. Something that could create doubt in Annie's mind if she happened to see them."

"And if she confronts Howard?" I asked, intrigued.

"Even better," Sarah said. "From what you've told me about their relationship, Annie already has insecurities from her marriage to Philip.One accusation leads to defensiveness, defensiveness leads to arguments,arguments create distance." I leaned back in my chair, impressed. "And you'll be there when the distance becomes unbearable.""Exactly," Sarah confirmed. "Small conflicts accumulate into major problems. When Howard finally becomes disillusioned with Annie's constant suspicion, I'll be the understanding, supportive presence he turns to."

The plan was brilliant.

If she succeeded-when she succeeded-my own position at Howard Technologies would be transformed. Perhaps a vice presidency? Director of Marketing? The possibilities were delicious to contemplate.
"I'll start monitoring his movements today," I promised. "And I'll coordinate with building security to ensure your entry won't raise questions."
"Thank you,Caroline," Sarah said warmly. "I knew I could count on you."

After hanging up, I immediately created several social media accounts to promote Sarah's work. A few well-placed posts in the right circles would create a ripple effect of curiosity.
I made notes about hiring a digital marketing team to boost visibility and engagement. If Howard Technologies wouldn't promote Sarah's work,I'd prove them wrong by creating demand independently. Susan Moore would regret dismissing me so casually.
###Chapter 86: Online Storm

Annie's POV

I had just finished my meeting with Susan about the latest analytics for my comic series and returned to my office.
The numbers were excellent, with international engagement exceeding all projections. After arranging to meet again on Friday to discuss merchandise expansion, I settled at my desk and opened my laptop.
Opening the comments section on my latest comic update was usually my favorite part of the day. I loved seeing how readers connected with my story and characters.

But today, my expression froze as I stared at the screen.

"What the hell is this?" I whispered, my heart beginning to race.

The comments section had erupted into chaos. Dozens of messages demanded explanations, accusations flying back and forth-all centered around my characters and their real-life counterparts.
I scrolled frantically to find the source of this sudden storm, and then I saw it-a comment from someone called ReaderForever357:
"I know the author's ex-husband and his first love, the ones portrayed in this comic. They truly love each other. Why does the author paint him as a cheater and her as a home-wrecker? It's unfair and dishonest." My stomach twvisted into knots. What is this? Someone's defending Philip and Sarah? Though no names were mentioned, anyone following my work could easily figure out who the comment referred to.Beneath it, dozens of replies had accumulated: ComicLover45: "Really? The author is lying in her own comic?" TruthSeeker: "So the author twisted the facts? I always thought she was the victim!"
NYCGirl: "Wait, we need to hear the author's explanation before jumping to conclusions."

I took a deep breath, trying to calm my racing heart. Don't panic, Annie. It's just a malicious comment. But my hands still trembled slightly,reminiscent of how I felt when I first discovered Philip's betrayal.

She thinks I'll just sit back and let this happen? I forced myself to calm down. I couldn't respond impulsively-that was exactly what Sarah would want.


After a moment's consideration, I decided on a direct but professional response:
AnnieBakerOfficial: "Are you suggesting that 'true love' justifies a man developing a relationship with another woman after marriage? Even if it violates wedding vows? Even if it hurts his wife and child?"

The comments section went quiet for a few seconds, then the account immediately responded:

ReaderForever357: "If he no longer loves you and you're clinging to the marriage, isn't that your fault? True love comes first. You should understand and let go." I almost laughed out loud. This logic is so twisted it could write fantasy novels. My heartbeat gradually returned to normal as a quiet anger replaced my initial panic. AnnieBakerOfficial: "According to your logic, are marriage vows meaningless? If we accept your premise-that they're true love-then why did he drag out the divorce for so long? Why maintain the appearance of a marriage while having a relationship with 'true love'? Shouldn't true love be brave and honest?"

The pause was longer this time. I could imagine Sarah sitting in her apartment, irritated as she thought about how to respond. Finally:
ReaderForever357: "He just didn't want to hurt you, out of kindness and consideration."

I shook my head, almost feeling sorry for this ridiculous defense.

AnnieBakerOfficial: "Truly kind people don't deceive and betray. Kindness isn't an excuse after betrayal; it's a guide foractions."

The tide in the comments section visibly shifted. Readers began countering the original comment:
ComicLover45: "Wait, so you're defending cheating? What kind of values are these?"

ArtisticSoul: "I get it, this comment is just trying to stir up controversy.The author's response is so professional!"
NYCGirl: "Well said. We support you!"

Seeing the supportive voices, I opened my direct messages and sent a message to the commenter:

"Sarah, did you think I wouldn't recognize you behind a different name?What do you gain by causing chaos in my comments section?"

The reply came almost instantly: "Yes, it's me. So what?" I needed her to understand I wasn't someone to be trifled with. I wasn't the same Annie who would silently swallow her pain anymore. "If you continue spreading lies under my work, I'll publicly expose everything you've done. My portrayal of you in the comic has been quite restrained. Don't test my limits, Sarah. If you truly anger me,things won't end well for you and Philip."
After sending this message, I felt exhausted but resolute. Sarah wouldn't give up easily, but I was no longer the Annie who could be easily defeated.

She wants my fear and uncertainty, but she won't get it.

I stood up and walked to the window, looking toward Howard's office.Should I tell him about this? He would certainly find a way to help me resolve it,perhaps one phone call would be enough to make Sarah back off.
But on second thought, I shook my head. This was my battle,my work.I was no longer the Annie who needed to rely on others. I had the ability to handle this challenge myself, and I was doing it well. The comic was my domain, and I didn't need to hide under Howard's protection.

"I can handle this," I said to myself, turning back to my desk.

Suddenly,my phone started buzzing non-stop. I checked it to find dozens of new notifications flooding in.

"What now?" I muttered.

I opened the first notification, which was a link sent by a reader. The link led to a video telling the story of a woman who went abroad without breaking up with her boyfriend, and another woman who took advantage to insert herself into their relationship. When the first woman returned,the couple rekindled their relationship, but the "interloper" turned around and accused the returning woman of destroying her relationship. The implication couldn't be clearer-Sarah was suggesting that I was the third party in her and Philip's original relationship. The comments section had descended into chaos: TruthSeeker: "So the author herself was the original homewrecker? How hypocritical! I'll never support someone with such double standards!"
MoralHighGround: "Condemning others for something you did yourself?Disgusting! UJnfollowing, I don't want to see the work of a hypocrite anymore!"

NYReader92: "I knew things couldn't be that simple! She's been portraying herself as the victim in her comics all along, but turns out she was the one who destroyed someone else's relationship!"

ArtCritic88: "This is the so-called 'truth'? First interfere with someone else's relationship, then pretend to be the victim? Portraying the ex-husband as the bad guy to gain sympathy? The work of such a person isn't worth following!"

ComicFan2023: "I've always liked your work, but I'm really disappointed after learning this. Creation should be honest, not twisting facts to exonerate yourself!"

BrooklynGirl: "The character in the video is exactly like the 'first love'character in the comic! It's so obvious that the author is talking about how she destroyed someone else's relationship! It seems the 'bad woman' in the comic is actually wronged!"

HonestOpinion: "My mom's family was broken up by a mistress, and seeing someone like Annie still able to parade around makes me angry! I hope more people see the truth!" My heart sank. This time, Sarah wasn't just twisting facts;she was completely inverting black and white. How should I respond to this? A direct denial would seem like quibbling;a detailed explanation would look defensive... Stay calm, Annie. Think about what Howard would do. He always saw through to the essence of things, never swayed by emotions.

I began writing down a response strategy. This wasn't a simple comment attack; it was a carefully planned reputation war. In this battle, I wouldn't surrender easily.
###Chapter 87: Crisis Into Opportunity

Annie's POV

I closed my office door and sank back into my chair, taking deep breaths to calm myself.
Sarah's online attack was spreading faster than I'd anticipated. When I first noticed those comments, I khew this wouldn't end simply.Looking more carefully through my comic's comment section now, it had indeed transformed into a battlefield.

The comment implying I was the "real homewrecker" had sparked a virtual war. Sarah was attempting to flip the narrative completely,portraying herself as the victim while casting me as the manipulative destroyer of her "true love" with Philip. Absolutely ridiculous.
When facing accusations without evidence, countering them is actually quite straightforward. I told myself, calmly beginning to search for what I needed.

Robert Johnson had been a somewhat notable entrepreneur when he married Sarah, and their wedding had been covered by several local New York media outlets. It took me only a few minutes to find exactly what I needed. I first took screenshots of Sarah and Robert's wedding coverage, then retrieved the digital copy of my marriage certificate with Philip from my cloud storage. These two timelines spoke for themselves-Philip and I had married a full year and a half after Sarah and Robert. Before hitting publish, I carefully considered my response:′′SOyou were still dating your ex-boyfriend a year and a half after marrying your husband? Isn't that the definition of 'two-timing?"After posting, the tide in the comments section shifted immediately.My readers quickly realized I was never the "other woman," and Sarah's entire narrative was pure fiction.

Apologies began flooding the comments section:

TruthSeeker: "I'm sorry for jumping to conclusions! She completely misled us!"

ComicLover45: "I can't believe I fell for her lies. Your evidence is irrefutable."

ArtisticSoul: "Timestamps don't lie! You were never the other woman!"

NYCGirl: "I should have been more careful instead of believing random accusations.So sorry,Annie!"

I smiled, graciously accepting their apologies: "If you truly feel guilty,perhaps consider purchasing some merchandise to support my work."

This wasn't a joke. Within minutes, the numbers on my sales dashboard began to skyrocket as if strapped to a rocket. The sting of Sarah's accusations gradually faded, replaced by an odd sense of satisfaction. She had inadvertently helped my business.

She created drama, and I made money. A fair exchange, I'd say.

I wasn't in a rsh for immediate revenge. My plan for dealing with Sarah had already taken shape, but timing was crucial. Her pregnancy temporarily provided her a layer of protection, but once the child was born,I would deliver my specially prepared"gift package," a reminder of the consequences of her actions.

For now, watching readers redirect their anger toward Sarah was satisfaction enough. They flooded her social media, criticizing her for fabricating lies and attempting to manipulate public opinion.
 "She tried to ruin Annie's reputation but only ended up boosting her sales!"

"Who tries to shame a comic artist and ends up advertising for her? Talk about shooting yourself in the foot!"

I was staring at the comments on my screen when my office door suddenly opened.

Howard stood in the doorway, his usually composed face etched with concern. He walked directly to my desk. "How are you feeling?" His voice was noticeably gentler than usual.

"I'm fine, why?" I looked up at him, puzzled.

Howard took my hand, his thumb brushing over my knuckles, sending warmth through me. "Susan mentioned there was a situation online.Someone attacking you?"

"Oh, that." I shook my head with a smile. "Just Sarah causing trouble."

"I handled it easily and managed to damage her reputation in the process,"
I added, a satisfied smile playing on my lips. "Actually, there are more people criticizing her now than me."


Howard's worried expression relaxed, though his hand still held mine."
You're not upset?"

"At this point, being upset wouldn't solve anything."Ianswered honestly."Instead, I asked myself how to turn this crisis into an opportunity.""Look..." I handed him my phone, displaying the dramatically rising curve on my sales dashboard. Howard took the phone,his eyebrows lifting slightly as he reviewed the numbers."You managed to increase sales in this situation? How did you do that?" I explained my strategy in detail, recounting how I had exposed Sarah's lies with concrete eviddence, then channeled readers' sympathy and guilt into merchandise purchases.

"People are fascinated by stories of affairs and betrayal," I explained. "Sarah tried to paint me as the villain who destroyed someone else's relationship, then shamelessly played the victim in my comics."

"When they discovered she had manipulated them, they felt foolish and guilty," I said with a smile. "I simply gave them a way to make amends-by supporting my work."

"Considering how many people were following this drama, even if only one percent decided to buy something..." I gestured toward the still-climbing sales figures.

Howard moved beside me, sitting on my office sofa with his arm naturally resting across my shoulders. His usually cold voice carried unmistakable approval. "Annie, with that mindset, you'll succeed at anything you attempt."

I accepted his praise confidently. "People need to evolve,don't they?Getting stuck in emotional reactions doesn't solve problems."

"When emotions eventually subside, the problem is still there waiting to be addressed," I continued. "Better to handle issues as they arise."
I looked directly into Howard's eyes. "Otherwise, how can we enjoy life?" Howard's lips curved into a rare, genuine smile. "Indeed." After Howard left, I continued monitoring the comments section.Sarah was still attempting to stir up negative sentiments,which I found strangely entertaining. Like a child refusing to admit defeat, repeating the same mistake over and over. I decided to respond publicly again: "Is there a problem? I'm human too-I need to make a living. I have to think about earning enough money to support my mother and myself. What will happen to me when I'm old if I don't maximize my earning potential while I'm young?"

As expected, my fans rallied around this pragmatic viewpoint, redirecting criticism back toward Sarah:

MoralHighGround: "What's wrong with her? Isn't it enough that she's the actual affair partner who destroyed someone else's marriage? Now she keeps harassing the victim's comment section!"

BrooklynGirl: "She tried to deceive all ofus, but our eyes are wide open now. And then she uses these ridiculous excuses to make us attack Annie again? Is she mentally stable?"

HonestOpinion: "The evidence is clear-Annie was never the otherwoman.Sarah needs to stop spreading lies."

Reading these supportive comments, my mood lightened. Leaning back in my chair, I contemplated Sarah's motivations.

She was challenging me out of jealousy over my growing fan base and success. Her attempt to turn readers against me was intended to force me to stop creating altogether. But it had only backfired. The more Sarah wanted me to sop drawing, the more determined I became to continue. I wouldn't just continue creating-I would focus on improving the quality of my storytelling and artwork with each update.The larger my fan base grew, the more frustrated Sarah would become. Until she gave birth, this would be my strategy-to provoke her with my own success. Consider it interest accumulating on the debt of pain Sarah had caused me. And when her child was finally born... I would deliver my special surprise. When that moment came, Sarah would truly regret the harm she had caused.

I refocused on my drawing tablet, channeling my determination into creating better work. The feeling of my fingers sliding across the screen gave me a sense of power-this was my world, my creation,and no one could take that away.
###Chapter 88: Pathetic Me

Philip's POV

I was reviewing the quarterly financial reports for Philip Investment Group.The numbers looked impressive. Even after losing several collaborative projects with Howard Technologies, my company remained strong. That brought me satisfaction.


I glanced at Brian's photo on my desk-him at three years old, laughing at the Central Park Zoo. The empty frame beside it bothered me. I'd removed Annie's photo weeks ago but hadn't replaced it. The empty space made something twist in my chest.

Annie should have returned to me by now. Instead, she was building a new life at Howard Technologies. The thought of her with Howard made my jaw clench. I slammed the financial report shut, making my assistant look up nervously.

My phone rang. Sarah's face on the screen. I paused before answering,surprised by my own reluctance.

"What is it?" My voice sounded cold. I was getting tired of Sarah's constant demands and mood swings. But then I remembered she was carrying my child and tried to soften my tone.

′′Mystomach feels uncomfortable..," Sarah's voice trembled. I recognized the pattern-Sarah always needed me when I was busiest at work."It's all Annie's fault," she continued, sniffling. "She exposed our relationship online." Annie's name made me sit up straight, anger burning in my chest. How dare she? She already had Howard's attention-wasn't that enough? Why couldn't she leave us alone? "People are attacking me, calling me a 'homewrecker,'" Sarah sobbed. "I don't even know what I did wrong."

I felt suddenly protective. Sarah was pregnant with my child. I couldn't let anyone hurt her or my baby, no matter how annoyed I sometimes felt with her. I remembered how Annie needed peace during her pregnancy with Brian. How could Annie attack another pregnant woman? This wasn't like her at all. What happened to the gentle Annie I knew?

"Can you please ask Annie?" Sarah pleaded. "If she tels me what I've done to offend her, I'll correct it immediately!"

I clenched my fist. Some part of me knew I might be getting manipulated,but I was too angry to think clearly. I considered myself a logical businessman, but with Annie and Sarah, I always ended uap ruled by emotions.

"T'll handle this," I said, ending the call. I needed to confront Annie.How could she treat a pregnant woman this way,especially after going through pregnancy herself?

I stared at Howard's contact on my phone. I couldn't call Annie directly-she'd blocked my number. But I could reach her through Howard. This wasn't about winning Annie back, I told myself. This was about protecting Sarah and my unborn child.

I pressed call. Howard answered with a cool "Can I help you?" He sounded surprised to hear from me. I didn't waste time: "Ask Annie why, as a woman, she keeps targeting another woman.What's the point of that?" The anger in my voice gave me satisfaction. I wanted Howard to see Annie's flaws-to see her spiteful side.Maybe then he wouldn't think she was so perfect. "Could you clarify which lady Annie is allegedly harassing?"Howard remained calm, almost sarcastic. His tone suggested my accusations were ridiculous, That made me even angrier.

"Sarah Johnson," I said, my teeth clenched tight.

The line went quiet. I pictured Howard looking down on me-this man who had taken everything that should be mine: my wife, my son's affection,even my social position. My jealousy burned hotter.

"Mr. Thompson, this doesn't concern you," I said, trying to sound calm."I don't want to direct my anger at innocent people, so please put Annie on the phone." I sounded polite, but inside I was furious. Who was he to get between Annie and me? This was our business.

"She is my girlfriend," Howard stated firmly. Each word felt like a knife in my chest. "And I've heard about the conflict between them today."
"So you're protecting her?" I asked mockingly, my anger obvious.

Howard laughed coldly. "What else would I do?"

Every word he spoke made me angrier. "Throughout this entire situation,she hasn't done anything wrong. What kind of boyfriend would I be if I let you lecture her?" Hearing him call himself Annie's "boyfriend" made me dizzy with rage.Even though I had Sarah, even though I ended my marriage to Annie,I couldn't accept her being with someone else. Annie should always be mine.This thought was ugly, and it disgusted me, but I couldn't deny it was there. "Since their conflict began online, Isuggest you search for the complete story there first," Howard said calmly. He was talking to me like I was a child. "Understand the truth before passing judgment." His tone made my blood boil, "Our companies maintain a partnership," Howard continued, "yet you're easily provoked by Sarah's words, quick to attack my girlfriend without considering the consequences. This seriously calls into question your professional judgment."

His words hit me like cold water. Was he threatening my business? Over a woman? "After all that talk, you just want me to leave Annie alone,right?"I almost shouted.


"From a professional standpoint, your impulsiveness makes you an unreliable partner," he said flatly. Each word stung my pride. "From a personal standpoint, you claim to love Annie, yet you consistently doubt and criticize her based on others' accusations."

"I regret everything Annie once had to endure," Howard added. Those words stabln business, people always respectebed my heart.

d me, flattered me, did what I wanted. Howard showed me none of that.He was suggesting I'd been a terrible husband who didn't deserve Annie.The worst part? Deep down, I knew he was right. That made me even angrier.


"Learn the details of the situation first," Howard suggested. He used the same superior tone I often used with my employees. Being talked to this way made me feel both ashamed and furious.

"Fine, I will," I snapped back. I grabbed my phone and searched social media. The first comments I found did criticize Sarah, just as she claimed. My anger grew-how could Annie be so cruel? This wasn't like her at all. But something made me keep searching. I needed to know why strangers were defending Annie. After more searching, I found a video showing what really happened: OSarah had first attacked Annie's comics and character

DAnnie had responded with evidence showing Sarah started it

OSarah had lied more,claiming Annie was the real "other woman"

DAnnie had posted our marriage certificate and Sarah's wedding announcement with her ex-husband, proving who was lying

My anger vanished, replaced by shame and embarrassment. Sarah had tricked me again, and I'd fallen for it like an idiot. I'd accused Annie without checking facts first. This wasn't even the first time-I'd believed Sarah's lies about Brian before too. Why did I let Sarah manipulate me so easily? Maybe because she knew exactly how to trigger my need to control Annie?

A horrible thought hit me: maybe I didn't really love Annie. Maybe I just couldn't stand her being outside my control. I couldn't accept that she was happier without me than she ever was with me. The thought made me sick,but I knew it was true.

"Have you finished reading, Mr. Baker?" Howard's voice startled me-I'd forgotten he was still on the line.

"Yes," I answered, feeling like a child caught doing something wrong.

"Do you still want to defend Sarah?" OSarah had first attacked Annie's comics and character

"Have you finished reading, Mr. Baker?" Howard's voice startled me-I'd forgotten he was still on the line.

"Yes," I answered, feeling like a child caught doing something wrong.

"Do you still want to defend Sarah?" I couldn't answer. I was too ashamed. Once again, I'd made a fool of myself in front of Howard, proving he was right about me all along."There's nothing wrong with acting foolishly, as long as you recognize your limitations," Howard said calmly, but with a sharp edge. "If Annie truly wanted to create trouble for both of you, she's had plenty of opportunities. But she hasn't. She just wants to forget everything related to you. Yet you two keep entangling her." Each word hit me hard. The worst part was knowing he was right. Annie never started these conflicts-it was always Sarah and me who wouldn't leave her alone.


"Why?" Howard spoke slowly. "Do you think she's easy to bully because she has no one protecting her?"

That hurt. I should have been Annie's protector, not someone who hurt her. Now Howard protected her, and I was the person she needed protection from. This complete role reversal made me feel lost and jealous.

"No, absolutely not," I denied quickly, but my voice gave me away.

"Good," Howard said with disgust and hung up.

I sat in the dark of my study, flipping through photos of Annie and me.

A thought of Howard's arm around her waist sent me lurching to my feet,my fist clenched tight. The phone screen cracked under my grip,a jagged line splitting across our faces.

I threw the phone onto my chair and caught my reflection in the window-hair disheveled, expensive shirt wrinkled. A bitter laugh escaped me.


Here I was, Philip Baker, Harvard Business School graduate, CEO of a major investment firm-pacing around like a teenager over a woman I claimed not to want. Outmaneuvered by Sarah, outclassed by Howard,yet somehow still convinced of my own brilliance. Pathetic.
###Chapter 89: The Prank

Howard's POV

I hung up the phone, feeling a wave of disgust wash over me. This marked the third time Philip had called regarding Sarah's complaints about Annie. I've encountered countless adversaries in the business world,but rarely someone as lacking in judgment yet so self-assured as Philip Baker. An involuntary smirk crossed my lips as my fingers drummed lightly against the polished surface of my desk. The man was utterly foolish.


Annie emerged from a nearby room, immediately reading my expression.

"Philip again?" she asked, leaning against the doorframe.

I nodded, making no effort to conceal thecontempt in my eyes."Mr.Baker seems to believe his ex-wife is bullying his poor pregnant girlfriend online." I deliberately lowered my voice, infusing it with unmistakable sarcasm. "What an absurd accusation."

Annie walked over and settled onto the sofa. "I figured as much. Sarah faces resistance online and runs straight to him crying." I moved to join her, pulling her gently ontomy lap. I couldn't keep the disgust from my voice. "This so-called top-tier investor jumps to conclusions without performing even the most basic fact-checking." I ran my thumb over her knuckles, feeling the softness of her skin."What's more ridiculous is that he claims to love you while consistently defending someone who hurts you.""He never truly loved me," Annie stated calmly. "He just wants me back to play nursemaid when Sarah gives birth." A surge of anger rose within me. "What did he do to you?" Annie averted her gaze. "When I was still in the hospital after my miscarriage, he brought Sarah home and let her sleep in our master bedroom while arranging for me to stay in the guest room."

My body tensed instantly, a fierce protective instinet burning in my chest.If Philip had been standing before me at that moment, I couldn't guarantee I would maintain my composure. Imagining Annie lying alone in a hospital bed while her husband welcomed another woman into their marital bed-such behavior was utterly repulsive.

After taking a deep breath, I managed to say with forced calm,"Aman without principles." But I knew my voice was cold enough to freeze theair between us.


"Sarah's been causing you trouble lately. Would you like me to intervene?"I asked, already mentally listing three potential strategies to silence Sarah permanently.

Annie shook her head with a slight smile. "That won't be necessary. Her antics have actually brought me more readers and increased sales." She looked up at me, her eyes shining with determination. "I can handle this."

I gazed at her confident, composed demeanor, feeling genuine admiration sweep through me. To remain so resilient in the face of such challenges,transforming obstacles into opportunities-Annie's strength and intelligence never ceased to amaze me. This was one of the many reasons I found myself so deeply captivated by her. I squeezed her hand gently. "Ifyou need anything, juast tell me." I heard my own voice soften. Annie leaned against my shoulder, and I could feel her body relaxing. It occurred to me that during her time with her ex-husband,she had never received this kind of support. This strong woman in my arms had once been forced to face every storm alone. "It's noon already. Shall we have lunch together?" I asked quietly.

"Yes," Annie nodded in agreement.

I took Annie to a small restaurant hidden in a narrow alley in Midtown Manhattan.


"Susan recommended it," I explained simply. "The chef is supposedly quite skilled."

When the food arrived, Annie took a bite and her eyes brightened. "This is really excellent."

I watched her expression with a sense of satisfaction.

Suddenly,a young woman bounded up to our table, her eyes wide with excitement.

"Mr. Thompson! You really came!" she exclaimed. "I'm Molly from the marketing department. This is my family's restaurant!"

Before I could respond, she dashed toward the kitchen. "I'll have Dad prepare some special dishes!"

Annie raised an eyebrow at me. "A friend?"

I shook my head. "I'm not even sure who recommended this place." I took out my phone and called Susan to inquire about the situation. After a brief conversation, I hung up, feeling slightly puzzled. Just then,Molly returned with a plate of bright red food and was about to sit down beside me. "Do you mind if I sit here?" she asked Annie."Actually, I do mínd," Annie replied frankly. Molly blinked. "Then can I sit next to you instead?"

Annie nodded in agreement, and Molly immediately began enthusiastically serving her food. "My father's spicy stir-fried pork is our signature dish!"

I noticed that all the newly arrived dishes were unusually red and spicy,and more strangely, Molly's attention had completely shifted from me to Annie.Something didn't feel right.

Annie took a bite, and I could telI the food was extremely spicy, but she maintained a composed expression. "A very unique flavor."

"Right?!" Molly's face lit up with excitement.

After finishing our meal, Molly mentioned she needed to stay behind to help,so I escorted Annie back to the office.

Back in my office, I led Annie to my private lounge area.

"I noticed something interesting earlier," I leaned closer to her, lowering my voice. "You seem particularly adept at charming women who are initially interested in me."

Annie laughed. "What are you talking about?"

"First Catherine Morgan, now Molly," I gently caressed her cheek. "The moment they see you, they can't take their eyes off you."

"Are you jealous?" Annie moved closer, wrapping her arms around my neck. I shook my head, feeling an unusual sense of humor. "Just observing an interesting phenomenon." My voice unconsciously deepened. "But I can hardly blame them..." I leaned in to kiss her lips. The kiss started gently, then gradually deepened. I felt her close her eyes, grip my shirt tightly, and instinctively move closer. Her body heat radiated through the thin fabric of her blouse,making my heart race.

My hand slid from her waist to the small of her back, savoring the softness and curves I found there. Images of last night flashed through my mind-her naked beneath me, her skin glowing enticingly in the moonlight,her lips parted, the sounds she made driving me to the edge of reason. I wanted to feel all of her again, to press her down onto the office sofa,unbutton her blouse, and taste every inch of her skin with my tongue.

Just as I was about to take things further, an intense burning sensation suddenly spread from my lips, forcing me to pull back abruptly. My expression must have been quite distorted.

"What's wrong?" Annie looked at me, confused.

"Too spicy," I frowned, my lips stinging painfully.

Annie finally realized that the spice from lunch had lingered on her lips.Seeing my expression, she couldn't help but smile. "Should I get you something to drink?"

"There's a vending machine downstairs," I nodded, feeling extremely uncomfortable.

On our way out of the office, my keen eyes caught two figures hastily ducking around the corner of the hallway-Catherine's blonde hair and Molly's distinctive jacket. I immediately understoodeverything. Molly had deliberately served the spiciest dishes to Annie but not to me-this was a carefully designed prank. Catherine and Molly must have conspired together, aiming to make me burn when kissing Annie. Watching them hiding in the corner,giggling,I maintained my composure externally while internally beginning to contemplate how to respond to this "amusing" challenge. Howard Technologies never lacks creativity, and as CEO, I have a responsibility to demonstrate the company's innovative capabilities, even when it comes to pranks. Catherine and Molly had clearly forgotten one important fact: in this building, the true master of strategic planning is me.

I glanced at Annie following behind me and decided not to tell her the truth just yet. The opportunity to respond to this prank would come,and the method would need to be memorable enough.
###Chapter 90: A Taste of Revenge

Catherine's POV

Molly dashed out of the restaurant and headed straight for the Tech Department, where I was waiting. This recent addition to Howard Technologies' marketing team had quickly become one of my few genuine friends at the company. Her love of gossip and practical jokes unexpectedly matched my own temperament. Though sometimes too straightorward, her innocent enthusiasm always made our dull workdays more entertaining.

I spotted her from across the hallway, her face flushed with excitement as she waved frantically.

"Catherine!" she called breathlessly, clearly winded from running.

I immediately went to meet her, eager to know the results of our little scheme. "How did it go?"

Molly's eyes sparkled with mischief. "I followed your plan exactly! Annie had no idea, and she tried all the spiciest dishes."


I couldn't help but smile slyly. "Excellent. Let's go watch what happens next."


As we hurried through the corridors of Howard Technologies,I found myself contemplating my complex feelings toward Howard Thompson.While he'd been decent enough to me-even offering my father some investment advice-I knew it was only because of Annie.'In fact, I distinctly felt that Howard didn't particularly like me.

No, that wasn't quite accurate. More precisely, Howard seemed to view me as an interloper-an uanwelcome visitor interrupting his private moments with Annie.This thought irritated me. Annie and I were good friends! It was perfectly natural for us to spend time together. Howard had absolutely no right to be annoyed by our friendship.

"Hurry up!" I pulled Molly by the hand toward our hiding spot near the elevators.

We carefully concealed ourselves around the corner, waiting for Howard and Annie to emerge from his office. The spicy food prank was simple yet brilliant-Molly had deliberately served extremely spicy dishes only to Annie and not to Howard, so when they kissed (as couples inevitably do),Howard would feel an unexpected burning sensation on his lips.

As we waited, I recalled how Margaret Thompson had once inadvertently revealed at a charity gala that her seemingly invincible son Howard had a little secret: he couldn't handle spicy food at all. Even the tiniest bit of chili would make him lose his composure. This had been the inspiration for our prank.

When Howard and Annie finally walked toward the elevator, I glimpsed Howard's momentarily comical expression-his eyebrows twisted upward,his lips trembling slightly, and fine beads of sweat forming on his forehead.That perfectly maintained mask of cool composure had crumbled instantly.He quickly turned away, as if not wanting Annie to notice his discomfort.

After the elevator doors closed, we finally emerged from our hiding place.

"Success!" Molly and I high-fived. The prank had gone exactly according to plan.

"Yes!" Molly could barely contain her joy, clapping her hands together. I proudly lifted my chin, like a swan displaying its elegance. "From this moment on, all past tension between Howard and me is officially erased!" Molly looked at me with fresh curíosity. "You actually know Mr. Thompson personally?"

She clearly assumed we were just regular employees who could only admire Howard from afar in the hallways.

"I once pursued him," I answered without hesitation.

Molly's eyes widened in disbelief. "Are you serious?"

"Of course," I confirmed. I'd always been someone who owned up to my actions.

Molly blinked rapidly, processing this information. "I heard that employees who show interest in him or confess get either demoted or fired.



She leaned in closer, lowering her voice to a whisper. "How are you still working at Howard Technologies? Does he secretly have feelings for you?"

Her ridiculous suggestion made me laugh. "Absolutely not."

Molly tilted her head, looking confused. "No?"

"When I confessed to him, he made it very clear he wasn't interested in me,"I explained matter-of-factly. "Later, after Annie and I became friends, he let me work at Howard Technologies as a favor to her."


"Oh. I see," Molly said, sounding somewhat disappointed. "I thought I was witnessing the beginning of a passionate office romance!" Hearing this, I quickly glanced around to ensure no one could overhear our conversation. Once I confirmed we were alone, I leaned toward Molly. "Don't ever say anything like that again," I warned her seriously."If Howard heard you saying such things..." I paused for emphasis,"he would fire me without hesitation!" Molly immediately covered her mouth with her hand. "I understand! I won't mention it again!"

However,our celebration was quickly interrupted. My phone suddenly rang, the screen displaying Howard's direct line. My heart sank, and after a moment's hesitation,I answered.


"Miss Morgan, please bring Molly to my office immediately." Howard's voice was brief and forceful. He hung up without waiting for my response.

After ending the call. I felt a chill creep up my spine. I looked at Molly,who was still blinking those innocent wide eyes, seemingly unaware of the danger we now faced.

"What's wrong?" she asked, noticing my change in mood.

I maintained a serious expression. "Howard wants to see us."

"Then let's go," Molly replied casually.

I pulled her aside and whispered in her ear: "Have you forgotten we just pranked him?"


My reminder finally made Molly realize the potential consequences of our actions. Her eyes widened with anxiety. "Do you think he's going to get back at us?"


"Possibly," I patted her shoulder reassuringly. "We both need to be mentally prepared. Whatever he says, we absolutely cannot show any unusual reaction. Understand?"


Molly's expression immediately became serious. "Understood!"
###Chapter 91: A Taste of Revenge Part II

Howard's POV

I observed Catherine and Molly nervously approaching my office.

After receiving my call, these two women had delayed a full twenty minutes before appearing. Standing before me now, they deliberately maintained some distance from each other, as if trying to dissociate themselves.


Catherine's face was noticeably pale, her fingers constantly twisting together; Molly's gaze darted around, avoidingdirect eye contact with me.Seeing their nervous demeanor, I nearly laughed out loud but maintained my expressionless facade.

I casually set down the documents on my desk and addressed them in a deliberately controlled tone: "There's a new game project I'd like to assign to both of you. I specifically called you here to ask..."

I paused meaningfully, noting how Catherine's shoulders visibly tensed and Molly held her breath. Then I continued,"...if you have the capacity to take on this responsibility."

My tone remained strictly professional, without any indicaton that I was aware of their prank.

Catherine appeared momentarily stunned by this unexpected turn.She blinked rapidly, her lips parting slightly before closing again. Molly glanced toward Catherine, uncertain how to respond,her fingers nervously fidgeting with the hem of her clothing."Well?" I prompted simply. "We'd be happy to take it on!" Catherine responded eagerly without hesitation. Her voice suddenly rose by about eight pitches, her shoulders visibly relaxing.

I calmly continued, "I've already spoken with the department head. You can meet with him directly on the twentieth floor."


"That's great!" Both women noticeably relaxed, the tension leaving their faces as they excitedly left my office.

I watched them go, finally allowing myself a small satisfied smile.
Everything was proceeding according to my expectations.

*I always remember a slight.*

*Dare to play a prank on me?*

*I will certainly retaliate.*

*Though my methods are rarely obvious, people typically don't realize what's happened even after suffering the consequences.*

The office door was gently knocked on again, and Annie walked in. She had noticed my earlier interaction with Catherine and Molly, her expression curious. "Isn't there only one new project in the gaming department?" She paused before continuing, "I remember you discussing it with Susan. Wasn't that project particularly urgent?"

I allowed my expression to soften, explaining with a hint of humor: "That's correct."I elaborated, "Catherine has too much free time in the marketing department. She never does any actual work, just spreads gossip...""If we don't assign her to a department where she'll be appropriately challenged and busy, she might leave the company without learning anything of value."I took Annie's hand, feeling the softness of her skin, and added, "I simply want her to learn more skills."

My gaze fell on Annie's rosy lips, recalling the taste of chili, and I inwardly winced.


Catherine, that overly active social media enthusiast. She was too fond of meddling-this time she had even managed to get Annie to eat spicy food without direct intervention, thereby preventing me from kissing Annie.

I leaned back in my chair, my fingertips lightly tapping the desk as I contemplated my next move. I imagined that during the next group meal,Catherine might recommend extremely spicy dishes to Annie under the guise of sharing food recommendations. If this situation repeated itself,would Annie and I ever be able to kiss again?

No, I firmly refused to let anyone deprive me of intimate moments with Annie.


Just then, Susan called to inform me that the car was ready, reminding me that I had a business meeting to attend today. After explaining the situation to Annie, I made my way to the underground parking garage.




In the underground parking garage, I sat in the back seat as the driver started the engine. The driver braked promptly, and I suddenly noticed Sarah Johnson standing not far ahead, her visibly pregnant figure particularly striking in the sunlight. My eyes revealed undisguised contempt.I recalled that just yesterday she had been causing trouble for Annie online,and now she appeared at the company. I wondered what new plan she had to make Annie uncomfortable. Closing my eyes, I gently pressed my temples, considering how to permanently resolve this issue. Though Annie didn't want my help, being constantly harassed by someone like Sarah must be frustrating.

Seeing Sarah standing there, her gaze fixed on my car, I could guess what she was planning. This woman's behavior was too obvious, her amateur performance almost laughable. I instructed my driver: "Mitchell, slow down and pay attention to the lady ahead."

When my driver unexpectedly braked early. Sarah seemed somewhat taken aback, her prepared posture suddenly becoming awkward. Unwilling to miss this opportunity to interact with me, she quickly adjusted her strategy and walked directly toward my window.

"Stop," I commanded, while observing Sarah's eager approach. I lowered the window, curious about what new trouble she intended to create.

Sarah got straight to the point: "I want to talk to you about Annie Baker."Her voice was deliberately gentle, but the calculation in her eyes was unmistakable.


I responded coldly: "If I want to know anything about her, I'll ask her directly. I don't need you to tell me." My fingers tapped lightly on my knee,my patience limited. "Is there anything else?"

"I know you love Annie..." Sarah continued through gritted teeth, the jealousy in her expression distorting her makeup. I could sense that my protection of Annie would only increase her resentment toward Annie. She couldn't understand why a woman who couldn't even keep her own husband could now receive unconditional love from another man. Sarah continued with a light laugh: "And you trust her completely."Her tone became mysterious, as if she possessed some important secret. "You can choose not to listen to me, to remain in the dark forever." I looked at her deliberately mysterious expression, feeling only disgust. She paused, attempting to create a dramatic effect: "But can you guarantee that when you finally learn the truth...your relationship won't be affected at all?
###Chapter 92: No One Can Stop Me

Sarah's POV

I stood in the underground parking garage of Howard Technologies,gently caressing my protruding belly, my eyes fixed on the sleek black luxury car slowly approaching. Caroline had just texted to inform me that Howard was heading out for a business lunch meeting. As an insider at Howard's company, Caroline could easily access his schedule-information crucial to our plan.

My original strategy was to "accidentally" rush in front of Howard's car as it was leaving the garage, then pretend to be knocked down before the vehicle actually made contact. I would fall to the ground, screaming and clutching my stomach. This "accident" would force Howard to take me to the hospital. Afterward, I'd seize the opportunity to accuse him of hitting a pregnant woman, threatening to expose the incident online if he didn't take responsibility. Howard Technologies' stock would surely plummet,and Howard would be compelled to visit me daily at the hospital. Through these regular interactions, I was certain we would develop some kind of connection.


However, things didn't go according to plan. The black luxury car slowed prematurely, then came to a complete stop. The driver had clearly spotted me in advance. My plan was ruined.

*Damn it! This isn't how I imagined this would go.*

But with Howard right there in the car, I didn't want to miss this rare opportunity. I immediately adjusted my approach, walking as naturally as possible toward the window. I watched as the window slowly lowered,revealing Howard's perpetually expressionless face.

"I want to talk to you about Annie Baker," I made my voice sound as gentle as possible, hoping to capture his attention. "If I want to know anything about her, I'll ask her directly. I don't need you to tell me," Howard responded coldly, his fingers lightly tapping his knee. "Is there anything else?"

*So arrogant! No wonder Philip always complains about him. But you'll listen to what I have to say-no one can resist the information I'm about to reveal.*

"I know you love Annie..." I worked hard to control the jealousy in my voice. Looking at him, this high-and-mighty man so protective of Annie,I couldn't understand it. Why would a woman who couldn't even keep her own husband now receive all the attention of another man? It wasn't fair!

I continued with a light laugh: "And you trust her completely." I deliberately mnade my tone mysterious, as if I possessed some important secret.

"You can choose not to listen to me,to remain in the dark forever," I stared directly into his eyes, "but can you guarantee that when you finally learn the truth... your relationship won't be affected at all?"

Howard stared at me, his gaze so piercing it felt like he could see through my soul. I felt a wave of discomfort, but I couldn't back down now.

"Even if you truly don't care, you could at least hear me out," I added. "After knowing the truth, if you're certain it won't trouble you, then you can send me away. Isn't that fair?"

To my surprise, Howard signaled his driver to open the passenger door."Get in and talk," he commanded briefly.

*Perfect! He took the bait!*

I had intended to sit next to Howard, but when I opened the door, I found he had deliberately positioned himself on the side furthest from the door,maintaining an obvious distance between us. This small gesture irritated me, but I controlled my expression and gracefully slid into the car.

This was my first time observing Howard up close. His profile was sharply defined, his jawline angular, exuding an unapproachable, austere quality.He wore a perfectly tailored suit, every detail exuding refinement and power. Though I hated to admit it, he was indeed more masculine than Philip, more reassuring. He radiated a steady strength that didn't come from his appearance but from his inner confidence and control.

*No wonder Annie is attracted to him. What a shame-if we had met under different circumstances, perhaps...*

I quickly adjusted my thoughts, focusing on my plan. "Did you know how promiscuous Annie was before she got together with you?" I began my offensive.

Howard's lips curved slightly upward, as if mocking my attempt. "She only dated one man, married him, and eventually divorced him because her husband cheated." His cold gaze turned toward me, his tone clearly sarcastic. "If such a woman is considered promiscuous... what does that make a woman like you?"

*Damn him! How dare he belittle me like this?*

I felt my face burning, as if I'd swallowed fire. I almost lashed back.wanting to tell him he knew nothing about me, that I wasn't the kind of woman he imagined. But I had to stay calm, for the sake of my ultimate goal. After taking a deep breath, I changed tactics: "Before you defend her, do you know how she lost the baby in her womb?" Howard merely raised an eyebrow: "Oh?" *That's it, show interest. Now I'll deliver the fatal blow!* I couldn't help smiling, certain Howard would soon change his view of Annie. "Because she was unfaithful during her marriage, she had an affair with my husband, slept with him, and that's what caused her miscarriage!"


I eagerly observed Howard's reaction, expecting to see shock,anger,or at least doubt cross his face. I fantasized about him immediately pulling out his phone to confront Annie. However, his expression didn't change in the slightest.


"First, you've already divorced the man you call your husband,so he should be referred to as your ex-husband," Howard calmly corrected me.

*What? Is that all he cares about?*


"You can't change your ex-husband's relationship status just because you seduced someone else and became the other woman," he continued, his voice infuriatingly steady. "Don't try to smear Annie by implying she's the same kind of woman as you, one who seduces another's husband."

*This bastard! How dare he speak to me this way!*

"Second, her miscarriage occurred before she had any relationship with your husband," he added.

*How would he know that? Does Annie tell him everything? Even something like this?*

I felt a pang of jealousy pierce my heart. Philip and I never had that kind of honesty. "And, when she fell down the stairs, I was the one who took her to the emergency room," Howard's words felt like a bucket of cold water poured over my head. *What? Him? How is that possible?* I struggled to hide my surprise, hastily countering, "You got her there in time, so the baby was saved! It was only because she was having an affair with my ex-husband that she lost the baby!"

Howard's eyes suddenly became sharp and dangerous: "Do you think I'm an idiot? How could a baby survive a fall from that height? Why don't you try it yourself? If your baby survives such a fall, then I'll believe what you say."

*Is he threatening me and my baby? This cold-blooded bastard!*

I felt a wave of fear and instinctively shielded my stomach.

"Stop the car!" Howard suddenly commanded.

The driver immediately pulled over.

"You need to get out now," Howard said, the disgust in his voice making me feel a wave of humiliation.


I wanted to argue, to continue with my plan, but looking at Howard's icy stare, I realized my attempt had failed. I reluctantly exited the car, the door slamming shut behind me.


Standing on the sidewalk, watching Howard's car disappear into the distance, I felt a míxture of frustration and anger.

*Why didn't it work? My tactics always worked on Philip.* I bit my lip, thinking. Aren't all men concerned about whether their women are "pure"? Why was Howard completely unmoved by the suggestion that Annie might have cheated? *Perhaps he truly loves her. Perhaps their relationship is deeper than I imagined.* This thought irritated me even more. My approach must have been flawed. Howard clearly didn't care about what I mentioned. I needed to reconsider my strategy.

I took out my phone and dialed Caroline's number.

"Did you get the photos?" I asked directly.

"Of course," Caroline answered confidently. "Though they're just scenes of ordinary conversation. I managed to capture some special angles. Even strangers looking at these photos would think there's something special between you two."


My mood immediately improving. Although today's plan hadn't been completely successful, it was just the beginning. I had more strategies,more methods.


I would get everything I wanted, and no one could stop me. 
###Chapter 93: False Evidence

Annie's POV

I sat in my new office at Howard Technologies reviewing files for my children's book. My small office wasn't much, but it was quiet enough for me to work without interruptions. Howard was at a business mneeting.giving me time to focus on my drafts.

As I traced the outline of my new character with my finger, I noticed how different this story felt from my previous ones. It was brighter somehow,more optimistic. Maybe it reflected the changes in my own life lately.

A knock at the door interrupted my thoughts.

"Come in," I called,assuming it was Susan with some documents.

The door opened and a woman I didn't recognize walked in. She was in her early thirties, wearing a white suit with her golden-brown hair in a tight bun. She looked perfectly put together, but something about her eyes made me instantly uncomfortable and her perfume was suffocating.

"Hello, I'm Caroline Gluck from Marketing," she said with a smile that seemed rehearsed. "I came to see you. Someone sent me some photos I think you should look at."

I looked up, realizing this was my first time meeting Caroline in person.We'd exchanged a few messages before, but that was it. The moment I saw her fake smile that didn't reach her eyes, my internal alarm went off. "Nice to finally meet you in person, Annie. We've chatted a bit on the phone, remember?" Her voice was honey-sweet, but with an undercurrent I couldn't quite place.I nodded politely, maintaining a friendly facade while my internal radar went on high alert. Why would she suddenly appear at my office? Andwhat photos could be so important?

Something wasn't right.

"I'm sorry, but I'm not interested in photos," I replied calmly,returning my attention to my sketches.

Caroline ignored my response completely. She stepped forward and placed her phone directly in front of me. "Look, Howard and Sarah look so much like a couple here, don't they?"

The screen displayed several photos of Howard and Sarah talking inside a car. Though the conversation appeared ordinary, the angles had been carefully manipulated to create an impression of intimacy. In one, Sarah leaned forward, her face uncomfortably close to Howard's. In another,Howard's hand appeared to be reaching toward her, though it was clearly just the awkward perspective.

My stomach dropped as I stared at the photos. They weren't random snapshots-they'd been carefully staged. I glanced up and caught Caroline watching me with eager eyes. She leaned forward, tapping her fingers on my desk, clearly waiting for me to break down.

It hit me then: Caroline and Sarah were working together. Only Sarah would know Howard's schedule well enough to set up this "chance"meeting. Caroline's job was to show me these photos and watch me fall apart. They'd planned this whole thing to trap me. I kept my face blank as I pushed the phone back to her, refusing to show any reaction. "Sarah is quite charming, isn't she? She got Mr. Thompson's attention so easily," Caroline said with fake concern, clearly enjoying what she thought was my pain. "What do you have to offer compared to her?" She raised an eyebrow and went on: "When Philip was your husband. Sarah took him without trying. Even your son calls Sarah 'mom'now."She paused, watching me closely for signs of hurt. "And now you finally found a good boyfriend... but he's attracted to Sarah too."

I saw the joy she barely hid at thinking she was hurting me, but I felt strangely calm. I ran my fingers along the desk edge and took a deep breath, deciding to fight back instead of defending myself.

I kept my cool and even smiled slightly. "Is that so?" I said casually while playing with my pen. "Well, if she's got Howard's attention now..."

I deliberately set down my pen and picked up my phone, scrolling through my contacts with an almost theatrical flourish until I reached the blocked numbers. "Perhaps I should call Philip?" My voice carried a hint of sarcasm. "With Howard as her new supporter, Sarah probably doesn't need Philip's money anymore, right?"

Caroline's face changed instantly from smug to horrified. Her eyes went wide,her mouth dropped open, and all color drained from her face.

"That's between them!" she yelled, lunging for my phone and almost knocking over my coffee. "You can't interfere!"

I leaned back easily, avoiding her grabbing hands. "Your reaction is interesting, Caroline." I put my phone down and folded my hands."It shows that Howard and Sarah aren't actually involved. If they were,Sarah would have already told Philip herself,right?" Caroline tried to catch her breath and straighten her clothes. Her eyes wouldn't meet mine. "How did you know?" she whispered. "From the moment you showed me the photos," I answered honestly,gently swiveling in my chair. "Your plan was too obvious-you wanted to anger me, to make me suspicious of Howard, correct?" I stopped turning and faced her directly. "Did you and Sarah really think I'd be so easily manipulated?"

I stood up and walked to the window with my back to her. "You expected me to see these photos, get upset, and accuse Howard of cheating." I turned around to face her. "He's logical and would get tired of my accusations. Eventually we'd start fighting,and our relationship would fall apart."

I crossed my arms and watched her fidget. "Then Sarah could make her move. That's what you two planned, right?"

Caroline's fingers twisted together, her gaze flickering. Suddenly, as if finding renewed courage, she lifted her chin: "You're just making excuses!"Her voice rose. "Even if I showed you a video of them kissing, you wouldn't believe it. Because Howard is the best man you could find, and you're desperate to keep him. Even if he cheats, you'll pretend not to see it."

Her words struck a nerve, poking at old wounds. I forced mnyself to breathe deeply, then slowly walked back to my desk, tapping my fingers lightly on its surface. "If you want me to believe you, it's simple," I said calmly. "Repeat what you just told me in front of Howard."

Carolíne's eyes widened as if she'd been doused with cold water: "You want me to offend Howard?" Her voice was nearly a shriek. "According to you, he's now infatuated with Sarah," I said methodically,organizing the papers on my desk, my tone as casual as if discussing the weather. "If you help him get rid of a clingy woman who refuses to leave-meaning me-he should be pleased, shouldn't he?" I looked up, meeting her gaze. "If you don't dare, it only proves I'm right."Caroline stood there, visibly caught in a dilemma. Her fingers fidgeted incessantly, and her hem was crumpled from her nervous handling. If she did as I suggested, she would likely lose her job; if she refused, her scheme would obviously fail. I could see the thoughts tumbling through her mind, emotions flashing across her face-annoyance, embarrassment.calculation, and finally, compromise.

After weighing her options, she chose a dramatic exit. She took a deep breath, feigning indignation: "I was only trying to help you,and you don't believe me." She raised her voice, her tone exaggerated, like performing a one-woman show. "Fine! When they officially announce their relationship,don't come crying to me!"

With that, she straightened her posture, turned around haughtily, and left,her high heels clicking sharply against the floor. She slammed the door,leaving a suffocating cloud of perfume swirling in my office.

After she left, I let out a long breath and dropped the fake smile. I fell back into my chair and rubbed my temples. Acting calm in front of Caroline took effort, and Sarah's constant attacks on my relationship were wearing me down. This wasn't just random drama-it was a planned attack.


I picked up my phone and found Howard's number, my thumb hovering over it. His meeting mattered more than this petty scheme: Besides, I trusted him. I didn't need to bother him with every little problem.

Trust. The word made me smile sadly. It was the hardest lesson from my marriage to Philip.

I returned to my sketches, my pencil making a few lines on the paper,but I found my concentration had been broken. Despite my efforts to stay calm,
Caroline's words had triggered certain memories-my marriage to Philip,how completely I had trusted him, and how he and Sarah had betrayed me together.

I put down my pencil and covered my eyes, taking a deep breath. Howard wasn't Philip. They were nothing alike. I knew that. But old wounds still hurt sometimes when you least expect it.I got up and opened the window, letting the cool fall air hit my face.I looked at the busy streets and tall buildings below. The city view always helped me calm down.

No. I wouldn't let Sarah and Caroline's tricks damage what Howard and I had built.

I had a book to finish and a life to build. No one's games would distract me from that.
###Chapter 94: What Are You Planning?

Annie's POV

I saved the final illustration for my children's book and closed my tablet.My fingers were stiff from hours of detailed work, but finishing the project gave me a sense of accomplishment.

The peaceful moment ended when my office door burst open. Catherine Morgan stumbled in, her makeup smeared by tears, her designer blouse wrinkled.

"Annie!" she wailed, dropping into the chair across from my desk. "This is absolutely unbearable!"

I set my tablet aside. "What happened?"

"Your boyfriend happened!" Catherine dabbed at her eyes with a crumpled tissue. "Do you know where he sent me? That new gaming project team!"

I kept my expression neutral, though I had a good idea what was going on."I heard about your new assignment. How's it going?"

"How's it going?" Catherine's voice rose an octave. "I've been there for hours without even being able to use the bathroom! Two hours, Annie!The project manager watches us like a hawk. I had to make up an emergency just to escape for a few minutes!"

She leaned forward, eyes wild with frustration. "The workload is insane.The deadlines are impossible. And the worst part? Howard did this on purpose! He set a trap, and Molly and I walked right into it!"

I reached across the desk and patted her hand. "You've been working really hard. I'm sorry it's been difficult."

"He's terrifying," Catherine whispered, glancing nervously at the door. "I never thought he'd go this far just because of a little prank."

"A prank?" I asked, though I'd already guessed about the spicy food incident Howard had mentioned.

Catherine waved her hand dismissively. "Just a silly joke. Nothing worth mentioning." She quickly changed the subject. "The point is, this new position is killing me!"

I studied her carefully. "Despite the difficulties, have you learned anything useful?"

Catherine paused, caught off guard by my question. "Well... I guess I have picked up some new skills. The project lead is actually brilliant-when he's not driving us insane with deadlines. And the technical aspects are interesting..." Her voice trailed off.

"But?" I prompted.

"But it's exhausting!" she exclaimed, throwing her hands up. "I didn't sign up for this kind of pressure! I want my comfortable job in marketing back.All I did there was coordinate events and manage social media. It was easy."

"I thought you were planning to take over your father's company someday,"I reminded her. "The Morgan family business is substantial. Won't these management skills come in handy?" Catherine sighed and slumped in her chair. "I was thinking... maybe I could just find a husband willing to marry into the family and let him run Dad's company. Then I could keep working here, doing something simple." I couldn't help but laugh at her naivety. "Catherine, that's a dangerous plan. If you hand over control to someone else, what's to stop them from taking everything and leaving you with nothing? Your father built that company with hard work, not by finding someone else to do the difficult parts."

She frowned, clearly not having considered this perspective before."But learning all this technical stuff is so hard..." Her complaint sounded childish even to her own ears, and she winced.

"The things worth having rarely come easily," I said. "If you want to be respected as more than just 'Morgan's daughter,' you need to develop real professional skills."

Catherine looked at me for a long moment, then grudgingly nodded. "I guess you're right. It's just... nobody ever pushed me this hard before."

A sharp knock interrupted us. The gaming department's project manager-a stern man with thick glasses-poked his head in.

"Miss Morgan, your fifteen-minute break ended thirty minutes ago," he said,checking his watch. "We have a milestone to hit by six."

Catherine shot me a desperate look, silently pleading for rescue, but I just gave her an encouraging smile. With a dramatic sigh, she stood and smoothed her wrinkled blouse.

"Coming," she said reluctantly. As she trudged toward the door,she glanced back at me. "This conversation isn't over."

As Catherine left, I noticed Howard standing in the doorway. The subtle smile on his lips told me he'd heard at least part of our conversation. He stepped into my office,closing the door behind him.

"I'm back," he said, walking over to kiss my forehead. "I missed you."

I stood and hugged him, breathing in his familiar scent. "I missed you too,"I admitted, surprised by how mnuch I meant it.

As I held him, I couldn't help comparing him to Philip. My ex-husband rarely expressed missing me during the day. Had he ever truly loved me?I doubted it now. Howard never hesitated to show his feelings. There was something reassuring about a man who wasn't afraid to be vunerable.

"Sit down," I suggested, pointing to the sofa in the corner. "You look tired.How was your meeting?"

Howard studied my face carefully. "Something's different about your tone.What happened while I was gone?"

I took a deep breath, deciding to be direct. "Someone showed me photos of you and Sarah Johnson talking in your car today."

His expression darkened immediately. "Let me guess-Caroline Gluck?"

I nodded. "She claimed you didn't love me anymore, thatyou were developing feelings for Sarah instead." I kept my voice steady, meeting his eyes.

Howard's jaw tightened. He reached for my hand. "This was Sarah's plan all along. She approached me in the parking garage, insisting she had important information about you. She claimed you were hiding something from me."

"And you let her into your car to hear what she had to say?" I asked,curious rather than accusatory.

"I wanted to know what lies she would make up," Howard answered calmly. "I've been expecting her next move since she started harassing you online."

"What did she tell you?" I was genuinely curious about what new story Sarah had coneocted.

Howard's grip on my hand tightened slightly. "She claimed your fall down the stairs wasn't what caused your miscarriage." His voice was carefully controlled. "She said you had an... inappropriate relationship with her ex-husband, Robert. And that was the real reason you lost the baby."

I felt cold at his words. Of all the lies Sarah could have chosen, this one cut closest to a painful truth-though not in the way she'd implied.

Howard continued, his eyes never leaving mine. "Of course I know what exactly happened. And I want you to know that I trust you completely."

His unwavering faith in me warmed my heart. After years with Philip,who questioned me at every turn, Howard's trust felt like a precious gift.

"Thank you," I whispered, squeezing his hand. "That means more than you know."

"You called me that day, remember? When you were in danger?"

The memory rushed back-the desperate phone call I'd made to Howard after waking up in Robert's apartment, drugged and disoriented. I'd barely known Howard then, just enough to have his number, but he had been the only person I could think to call.

"You called me for help," Howard continued, his voice gentle but his eyes sharp with anger. "I sent people to investigate immediately.I know everything-how Phílip and Sarah drugged your drink at the charity event,how Robert took you to his apartment while you were unconscious, how you managed to escape by appealing to his wounded pride and sense of competition with Philip."

I felt exposed yet strangely secure. Howard knew more about my darkest moments than I'd realized. But instead of judgment, all I saw in his eyes was admiration and protectiveness.

"You were incredibly brave that night," he said, touching my cheek. "It's one of the many reasons I admire you, Annie." For a moment, I glimpsed something dangerous in Howard's eyes-a cold,calculating look that reminded me he wasn't just the gentle man who held me at night. He was also a powerful businessman who eliminated obstacles without mercy. I had little doubt that he'd already planned some form of punishment for Philip and Sarah.

"I can't believe Sarah dared to bring this up to you directly," I said,shaking my head.

Howard's lip curled slightly. "She thought she could manipulate me.I made it clear I knew the truth. I told her I was the one who took you to the emergency room after your fall. I said if a baby could survive such a fall, it would be a miracle." His voice turned ice-cold. "Then I suggested she try falling down the stairs herself to test her theory."

I looked up sharply at that. "Howard..."

"I didn't push her," he clarified quickly. "I merely pointed out how absurd her claim was."

I nodded slowly, thinking. "Still, her baby muast be protected."

Howard looked at me with genuine confusion. "Why? After what she did to you-after she indirectly caused the death of your child-why would you care about hers?"

"Don't you want revenge for your lost child?" he asked, his voice soft but intense.

I met his gaze steadily, my voice calm and certain. "It's precisely because I want revenge for my child..."

I let the sentence hang unfinished, a small smile playing at my lips.Howard studied me for a long moment, his expression changing from confusion to dawning realization, then to admiration mixed'with concern. "Annie," he said slowly, "what are you planning?"
###Chapter 95: A New Relationship

Annie's POV

Howard's question hung between us: "Annie, what are you planning?"

I smiled at him, savoring this rare moment of confusion.Howard Thompson wasn't a man accustomed to being left in the dark.

"Nothning illegal," I assured him. "Just a different kind of revenge."

"Different how?"

"What would hurt Sarah more than physical pain? What would destroy her more thoroughly than any direct atack?"

Understanding dawned in Howard's eyes. "Exposure."

I nodded. "Exactly. Sarah values her reputation above all else. She's crafted this image of a devoted mother and victim. If people saw who she truly is..



"The manipulator who drugged a pregnant woman," Howard finished coldly.

"Her attacks are growing bolder. The photos with Caroline, approaching you directly-she's desperate. And desperate people make mistakes."

Howard looked at me with fresh appreciation. "You've been documenting everything." "Yes. Once Sarah gives birth to Robet's child, I'll reveal the truth to Philip." His lips curved into a slight smile. "I didn't realize you had such a calculating side." "I learned from the best," I replied. "Now I understand that real power lies in patience."

Howard took my hand. "Just promise me one thing. Let me help when the time comes."


I nodded, feeling a warmth spread through me at his support."Deal."




After work, we picked up Lucy from her classes. We found her playing happily with Penny, both girls giggling as they practiced gymnastics poses.Under Lucy's pleading gaze, Howard agreed to have Penny over, and we headed home.


Thomas Anderson was already waiting for their daily training. By the end,Lucy had barely broken a sweat, while Penny and her mother Sue Peterson looked exhausted. The girls immediately ran upstairs, leaving the three adults in the living room.

I handed Sue a bottle of water. "Thomas's training sessions are always intense."


After Howard sat down, he asked, "How's your project coming along?"

Sue's expression shifted to professional mode. "I've reached step six already,two weeks ahead of schedule."


"Impressive," Howard remarked. "Most of our best team members would be at step three by now."

Howard nodded. "Take a few days off once it's complete." Sue's eyes brightened. "Penny and I can make weekend plans." I noticed Sue's gaze darting upstairs. "How's Penny doing these days?" Sue's expression softened, though worry soon followed. "Good, exceptfor school... and Dave's been causing trouble again."

"Still harassing you?" I asked with concern.

"Three years divorced, and he still thinks I'm his 'property," Sue's voice carried disgust. "When Penny hides from her own father, I just..." Her voice trembled, "wish he would disappear."

She composed herself before her expression brightened. "But something happened the night before last that's made things much better."

"It was Thomas," Sue said softly, her eyes sparkling. "He helped us tremendously."


Howard and I exchanged a glance. Sue clearly had feelings for Thomas beyond gratitude.

"Would you like to share?" I encouraged.

"Thomas was walking us home when Dave suddenly appeared outside our building," Sue explained. "Penny immediately became frightened and hid behind Thomas."


"What did Thomas do?" I asked, noticing the warmth in her tone. I'd observed how her breathing quickened whenever Thomas came near during training.

"He calmly told me, 'Sue, take Penny inside. I'll handle this.'" She shook her head in wonder. "In that moment, I suddenly felt safe. Like someone was finally on my side."

"Dave was drunk and confrontational," she continued. "He demanded to know who Thomas was. Thomas stood like a wall in front of our door and didn't back down,"

"Dave shouted, 'She had my child, so she belongs to me! She can't date anyone without my permission!'" Sue's voice hardened. "Thomas told him,'The law doesn't recognize your twisted logic. Sue's decisions are her own.and you have no right to control her life.'"


Sue's face brightened as she described the scene. "Thomas warned Dave that he'd escort us home every day from now on, and if Dave showed up again..." she paused, "his knuckles would 'have a conversation' with him.Dave actually backed down."

"How did Penny react?" Howard asked.

"She asked Thomas if her daddy was really gone. He knelt to her level and said,'People like that are cowards. They only bully those they think are weak. If you're strong enough, they'll be afraid of you."


Sue smiled. "Penny declared she would learn gymnastics with Lucy to become super strong and make her daddy afraid of her."


After a moment's hesitation, Sue continued more softly, "I was worried Dave might return for revenge, so I asked Thomas to stay the night."

"When I woke up, Thomas and Penny were in the kitchen making French toast. She was laughing like I haven't seen since before the divorce." Sue's fingers unconsciously stroked the water bottle. "Thomas has given her security and respect. He treats her like a person, not a custody bargaining chip."

I could see how Sue glowed talking about Thomas - a feeling remarkably similar to what I experienced when I met Howard. "Thomas has made quite an impression," I observed.Sue blushed. "He's different. Other men were either intimidated by Dave or too eager to take his place, Thomas just... exists. Confidently, kindly,without demands." "Has he been helping with Lucy's training long?"Howard asked.

"Six months, but we really started talking when Penny joined a few weeks ago."


"And?" I prompted when she hesitated.

"There's something in the way he looks at me," Sue whispered. "Like he's genuinely interested in who I am.".

Her phone chimed. She checked it and smiled. "Thomas is asking about dinner tonight."

"He's coming over again?" I asked.

Sue nodded,blushing. "He's stayed the past two nights. For protection,in case Dave returns." Her averted eyes suggested more than protection.

"Am I moving too fast?" she asked suddenly, vulnerability evident. "After Dave,having someone respectful feels almost too good to be true."

"Only you can decide the right pace," I replied. "But Thomas seems to genuinely care about both of you."

"We talked until dawn last night," Sue said, her face brightening. "He told me things I never knew about Dave after seven years of marriage."

She put her phone away. "I should check on the girls." After Sue went upstairs,Howard turned to me. "Thomas and Sue. I didn't see that coming." "Sue deserves someone good after Dave," I said. Howard nodded. "Thomas is reliable, respectful,excellent with children. If anyone deserves a second chance at happiness, it's her." I leaned against HHoward, feeling contentment wash over me. "Speaking of second chances. I'm grateful for mine."

Howard pulled me closer. His lips found mine in a kiss that started gentle but quickly deepened with unmistakable hunger. My fingers slid into his hair, pulling him closer as warmth spread through my body. His hand trailed down my spine, sending shivers across my skin.

When we finally broke apart, both slightly breathless. I couldn't help but smile at the desire darkening his eyes. I traced his jawline with my fingertips, enjoying the slight roughness of evening stubble beneath my touch.


"What are you thinking about?" Howard asked, his voice lower than usual.

"That with you, I fear nothing," I whispered, pressing another kiss to the corner of his mouth. "Sarah, Philip, Caroline-none of them matter when I'm in your arms."

Howard's hands tightened possessively around my waist. "They shouldn't matter anyway. They're nothing compared to you."

I shifted to straddle his lap, my dress riding up my thighs. His eyes followed the movement, his hands automatically moving to steady me. I leaned forward until my lips brushed his ear.

"Let Sarah plot and scheme," I breathed, feeling a thrill as his fingers dug slightly into my hips. "When the time comes, we'll handle her together.But right now..."

I pulled back just enough to meet his darkened gaze, a smile playing on my lips. "Right now, I have much more interesting things on my mind."

Howard's answering smile was predatory as he stood suddenly, lifting me with him. My legs instinctively wrapped around his waist as he carried me toward the bedroom, all thoughts of Sarah and her schemes completely forgotten in the heat of his embrace.
###Chapter 96:I Believe Her

Brian's POV

I trudged up the steps to Grandma Ruth's Brooklyn apartment building.dragging my feet with each step. For the past several weekends, I'd spy on Mom and Howard's house, watching their perfect life from a distance.But today was different. I'd promised Grandma I would visit her instead.

The building was old but well-maintained. As I reached Grandma's floor,I saw her already waiting in the doorway. Her gray-streaked hair was pulled back in a simple bun, and her eyes lit up when she spotted me.

"Brian!" she called, hurrying toward me with open arms.

I let her hug me, feeling strangely small in her embrace. She smelled like lavender, just like Mom used to before everything changed. The familiar scent made my throat tighten.

She pulled back to study my face, her hands gentle on my shoulders. The way she tilted her head slightly to the side as she examined me was exactly how Mom would look when checking if I had a fever.

"These days, you've been suffering, haven't you?" she asked, her voice soft and concerned. The question caught me off guard. Nobody had asked how I felt in what seemed like forever. Dad was too busy with Sarah, Sarah was too busy pretending to be nice when Dad was around, and Mom... Mom wasn't around at all. "I'm okay," I started to say automatically, but something broke inside me.My chin trembled, and before I could stop them, tears were streaming down my face. "Grandma, it's all Dad's fault!"I choked out, my voice breaking. "Why did he have to cheat? Why did he make me spend time with Sarah? Why did he tell me all those bad things about Mom and make Sarah sound so perfect?"

I wiped furiously at my eyes, embarrassed by my outburst but unable to stop. "I'm just a kid! What did I know? If he hadn't done all that, Mom and I would still be happy together. I hate him!"

Grandma Ruth quickly pulled me into another hug, her hand gently stroking my hair as she guided me inside her apartment. "Shhh, let it all out," she whispered, closing the door behind us.

She helped me wipe away my tears with her soft handkerchief. "He's certainly no prize," she agreed with a hint of bitterness. "But I can see my Brian has recognized his mistakes. You're a good boy who knows when he's wrong."

I couldn't stop crying. The tears kept coming, months of bottled-up feelings pouring out all at once. "But it's too late, Grandma. Mom doesn't want me anymore."

"Your mother..." Ruth began, her tone serious.

I panicked, not wanting to hear my grandmother criticize Mom. It wasn't fair-Mom wasn't the one who did anything wrong.

"It's not her fauIt!" I interrupted quickly. "I was so horrible to her. Before all this happened, she was the best mom ever. She was always there for me."


Ruth's eyes softened as she looked at me, with that same determined glint I'd seen in Mom's eyes when she was thinking deeply about something,"Your mother loved you and your father deeply. She gave everything for both of you. But you and your father betrayed her."

Her words stung, but I knew they were true. I remembered how I'dscreamed at Mom that I hated her, how I'd told her Sarah was better.The memory made me feel sick.

"I know she might need time," Ruth continued,her voice gentler now. "So,where are you living these days? With Philip and Sarah?"

I let out a bitter laugh. "No. After they got married, Sarah stopped pretending to care about me. Whenever Dad isn't home, she's awful to me.And Dad sometimes takes her side... he letsher be mean to me."

Ruth's eyes widened in shock.

-"I moved to Grandma Betty's housefor a while," I continued, trying to sound casual. "But she cares more about Sarah's baby than about me. So I moved out and live by myself now."

"Philip let you move out? A child your age?" Ruth's voice had risen in disbelief. "Has he lost his mind? Abandoning his own son for that woman?
I believe he does support you financially?"

I shrugged, trying to act like it didn't hurt. "No, but it's okay."

Ruth grabbed my hand and started leading me toward her bedroom."Grandma has money. I'll give you some."

"No!" I pulled my hand away. "Mom helped me save a lot of money before the divorce. As long as I don't waste it, I'll be fine for a long time."

Ruth's expression softened with pride. "Your mother always thinks ahead.She plans for everything. That's one of her best qualities."I nodded in agreement, feeling a pang in my chest at the mention of Mom's thoughtfulness. She had always protected me, even when planning for a future where she might not be with me. "But it's not safe for a child to live alone," Ruth continued, her forehead creased with worry in the exact same way Mom's would whenever I climbed too high on the playground.

"I'm not completely alone," I assured her. "Mitchell, our driver, and Ms.Taylor, mny tutor, live with me. They're really nice to me."

Ruth still looked concerned. "Would you like me to move in with you? To keep you company?"

The offer surprised me. "You would do that?" I asked, feeling a rush of hope. Living alone had seemed brave at first, but the nights were long and lonely. Having someone who actually cared about me in the same house would make everything better.

Ruth tapped my forehead gently with her finger, another gesture so like Mom's that I felt a lumpforming in my throat. "Of course I would."

"That would be awesome!" I couldn't help jumping up and down with excitement.

Ruth watched me, her smile tinged with sadness. "What if I talk to your mother? Maybe she could come see you, and you could talk things out?"

My excitement vanished instantly. "No, don't do that," I said quickly. "I don't want to make things harder for her."

The truth was, I wasn't ready to face Mom yet. Not after everything I'd done. As evening fell, Ruth busied herself in the kitchen, preparing what she called a "proper dinner" for me. The small apartment filled with delicious smells that reminded me of holidays and special occasions from before everything fell apart. She moved around the kitchen with the same efficient grace as Mom, never wasting a single motion. "So, how are things at school?" she asked casually as she set a plate piled high with food in front of me. "Are you still friends with that boy you used to mention... Max, was it?"

I bit my lip, not meeting her eyes. "Max isn't my friend anymore,"I admitted after a moment. "After Sarah started being mean to me,Max changed too. He told everyone in class that I'm 'unwanted' because even my own mother doesn't love me anymore."

Ruth's hand froze in midair, her expression darkening. "That child sounds terrible."

I shrugged, pushing food around my plate. "It's okay, Grandma. I have new friends at school now." I hesitated before adding, "And Lucy is nice to me."

"Lucy?" Ruth raised an eyebrow. "Who's that, dear?"

"She's a little girl who lives with Mom now," I explained. "Her name is Lucy Thompson. She's Mr. Howard Thompson's niece. He's taking care of her because her parents died. Mom is dating him now."

Ruth's eyes widened slightly. "Oh? Tell me more about your mother's...situation."

I took a sip of water, gathering my thoughts. "Mom works at Howard's company now. She makes children's books-she's really good at it.Howard is super rich and owns this huge company. He's really tall and serious-looking, but he's actually nice," As I talked about Mom's new life, I found myself sharing more details than I'd planned. "They live in this beautiful house with a huge yard.Lucy has her own playground and everything." "And this Lucy," Ruth prompted gently. "What's she like?" I couldn't help smiling now. "She doesn't talk much-she has somethingcalled selective mutism because of what happened to her parents. But she always shares her snacks with me at school. One time when Max tried to push her, I shoved him and pulled her away."

Ruth looked intrigued. "That's kind of you."

My smile grew wider. "And she thanked me."

Suddenly, a thought struck me, and my expression turned serious."
Grandma, if Mom marries Howard, Lucy would become my sister,right?"

Ruth nearly dropped her fork. "Well, technically yes,but-”

"I want that to happen," I interrupted, my voice stronger than it had been all day. "I want Mom to be happy. I want Lucy to be my sister. I just don't know how to tell Mom I'm sorry."

Tears threatened to spill over again. "I said so many mean things to her.I did so many hurtful things. She'll never forgive me."

Ruth reached across the table and squeezed my hand. "Don't say that,
child. Your mother loves you more than anything in this world. Give her
some time,give yourself some time. Everything will work out."

I believe her.
###Chapter 97: The Jade Gift

Annie's POV

Howard pushed me against the wall, our lips colliding instantly. His kiss was both rough and passionate, making my knees weak. I grabbed his tie,eagerly pulling it loose while his fingers quickly unbuttoned my blouse.

"Now," I whispered against his lips, feeling his solid chest pressed against mine.

He let out a low growl, hs hands gripping my thighs as he lifted me up.My back hit the bedroom door, my legs wrapping tightly around his waist.Howard's eyes were filled with primal desire as his lips left a trail of hot,wet kisses down my neck, making me tilt my head back and release a soft gasp.

"Harder," I breathed into his ear, my fingers running through his hair,pulling firmly.

We stumbled toward the bed, clothing scattered along the way. Howard's palms roamed over my body, each touch igniting new sparks. When he laid me on the bed, moonlight filtered through the curtains,highlighting the perfect contours of his bare upper body. I reached out to pull him toward me, longing to feel his warmth again.

"You're beautífu," he said softly, his voice rough with desire. Time blurred as our bodies intertwined. Howard's movements transitioned from initial urgency to something more deliberate, yet no less iñtense. My body responded to his every action, our chemistry feeling as though it had developed over years. He knew what I liked, what I needed, even before I realized it myself. "Look at me, Annie," he commanded, his hands anchoring my hips. My eyes met his, seeing raw desire and something deeper in those depths.Our bodies collided fiercely on the bed, the rhythm urgent and primal. My fingers left scratches down his back as pleasure built within me like an electrical current.

When the final release came. I gripped his shoulders tightly, my entire body trembling. Howard followed shortly after, his tense muscles relaxing under my hands. We maintained that position for several minutes,our breathing gradually steadying, sweat cooling on our skin.

Howard rolled to lie beside me, his arm encircling my waist. He pressed a gentle kiss into my hair. We lay quietly, enjoying each other's presence.Time seemed to stand still, with only the distant ticking of a clock reminding us of the outside world.

In the aftermath of our passion, I lay beside Howard. Howard's arm rested possessively across my waist, his breathing deep and even against my neck.

As much as I wanted to remain in this warm, safe cocoon, I knew I should check on Lucy. I carefully slid out from under Howard's arm, collecting my scattered clothing from the floor. I dressed quietly, trying not to wake himn, though I could feel his gaze on me as I turned.

"Where are you going?" he asked, his voice still carrying remnants of desire,deep and raspy.

"I should check on Lucy," I explained, leaning down to place a gentle kiss on his lips.

Howard nodded, watching me, his eyes mixing reluctance with understanding. "Don't be long."

I slipped out of his bedroom and into the hallway, hoping not to encounter anyone in my slightly disheveled state. I had only taken a few carefuI steps when Sue's voice caught me from behind. "Annie? I've been looking for you."

I turned, feeling heat rise to my face, but Sue's expression held no judgment.

"Edward and Eleanor Parker are here to see you," she said. "They're with Lucy and Penny in the playroom."

I was surprised by the unexpected visit from Lucy's grandparents. "Thank you,Sue.I'll go right away."

Pushing open the playroom door, I saw Edward and Eleanor Parker sitting on a small sofa, watching Lucy and Penny playing with toy airplanes at the other end of the room.

They rose to greet me as I entered.

"Annie," Eleanor said warmly, "thank you for taking such good care of our Lucy."

I smiled, genuinely touched by her words. "Lucy is a wonderful child. It's a joy to know her."

Edward nodded, his eyes showing deep emotion. "Since you came into her life, we've seen such a change in her. She talks more,smiles more..."

"Howard has done most of the work," I said honestly. "He loves her very much."


"We can see that," Eleanor replied. "At first, when William and our daughter passed so suddenly, we were concerned. We worried that Howard,being a business-focused bachelor, might not provide the nurturing environment Lucy needed."

Edward added, "But these past few weeks staying here have proven us wrong. Howard treats Lucy like his own daughter." Just then, Lucy and Penny decided the playroom was too small for their"flying competition." The two little girls rushed toward the door with their toy planes, nearly colliding with Howard who had just appeared in the doorway.

"Whoa, slow down, little pilots," Howard laughed, stepping aside to let them pass. He glanced at me with a questioning look, and I nodded in response.

The four adults followed the laughing girls downstairs to the spacious living room. Sue was arranging cups on the coffee table and smiled as we entered, preparing more refreshments.

"Penny, we should head home," Sue glanced at her watch.

"Five more minutes, please," Penny begged, demonstrating airplane stunts with Lucy.

Sue gently insisted, "It's getting late, honey. You have school tomorrow."

As Sue and Penny were preparing to say goodbye, Eleanor retrieved an elegant wooden box from her handbag. She opened it carefully to reveal a stunning jade bracelet. The green stone gleamed under the soft living room lights.


She touched the jade gently, her expression full of reminiscence. "I've been thinking about this for a long time."

Edward sat across from her, quietly asking, "Oh?" "I had planned to give this to our daughter," Eleanor explained, her voice soft with memory. "Before her wedding, she came to me and said,'Mom,this bracelet is so beautiful. I love it. When I get married, will you give it to me?" Eleanorcontinued, "I said of course. But when she got married and I offered it as a wedding gift, she refused. She said that if worn daily,such a precious bracelet might get damaged. She asked me to keep it safe at home.1


She looked up at me, her eyes filled with regret. "I always planned to find another occasion to give it to her. But before I could do so, she passed away."

Eleanor's gaze returned to the bracelet. "Lucy is still too young...so I thought perhaps we should give this bracelet to you, Annie."

Sue quietly left with Penny who had said her goodbyes, while Lucy ran over to hug my leg, playfully demanding I join her airplane game.

I took the box and opened it, my fingers lightly tracing over the smooth green stone. For a brief moment, I felt overwhelming emotion at being offered such a family heirloom - something that had once been meant for Lucy's mother. It felt like acceptance, like being welcomed into their family circle.


"I couldn't possibly accept something so precious," I said, closing the box."Perhaps you should save it for Lucy."

Eleanor responded without hesitation: "We've made our decision."

I smiled, a mischievous thought forming. "Well, if you've given it to me,then it's mine to do with as I please, and you can't control who I give it to.



Edward and Eleanor exchanged surprised glances, clearly not expecting this response.

Edward sighed, though with a hint of amusement in his eyes. "Since you've made up your mind, we won't force you."

"Good," I said, crouching down to hand the box to Lucy, "This is from your grandparents, Lucy. It's very valuable, so you must take good care of it."

Lucy looked confused, her gaze shifting between me and the box. She carefully opened it, curiously examining the bracelet inside. After a moment's consideration, she accepted the box, then immediately walked over to Howard.


"Dad, can you keep this safe for me?" she asked seriously, looking up at him.

Howard gently took the bracelet and nodded. "Of course,I'll keep it safe."

"I'll put it in the safe," he said, heading upstairs.

Lucy turned to her grandparents, giving them a sweet smile. "Thank you,Grandpa and Grandma."


Edward and Eleanor appeared deeply moved, with tears shimmering in Eleanor's eyes. "You're welcome,dear."

Lucy came back to give me a tight hug. "Thank you too,Mom."

Hearing this title, warmth flooded through me. I patted her back gently,noticing the clock now showed nine o'clock.

"You're welcome, sweetheart. But it's getting late-time for a bath and bed."


Lucy nodded, the day's excitement seemingly catching up with her. She waved goodnight to her grandparents, then took my hand as we headed upstairs.


After a quick bath and teeth brushing, Lucy climbed into bed, her eyes bright with anticipation for our nightly story. I sat beside her with her favorite fairy tale book as she snuggled close. Howard leaned against the doorframe, watching us with a tender expression I'd never seen on Philip's face.


Soon Lucy's eyelids growing heavy. By the time I finished the story,she was fast asleep. I tucked the blanket around her small frame, and quietly slipped out of the room.


Howard waited for me in the hallway, extending his hand. "Would you like to talk on the balcony?"

"I'd love to."
###Chapter 98: My Last Chance at Being a Father
Philip's POV

I sat in my car, staring up at the balcony of Howard Thompson's mansion.Annie and Howard stood there together, holding hands as they looked at the night sky. They weren't kissing like the other night, but this simple moment seemed more intimate,more real.

I checked my watch - almost midnight. Two hours wasted watching someone else's lie instead of living my own.

Annie had changed. Before, she would desperately explain herself whenever I accused her of something. Now? She'd blocked my number.Howard stood between us like a wall I couldn't break through.

My knuckles turned white as I gripped the steering wheel. Annie finally had someone to protect her. The thought made my chest ache.

Howard put his arm around Annie's waist, and she smiled - a real smile I rarely saw during our marriage. A smile I never caused.

Why did I still attack Annie every time Sarah complained about her? Why couldn't I stop myself?

Had I always treated Annie this way? Made her feel accused, unheard,unprotected?


No wonder Howard said she'd never choose me again. Who would return to someone who hurt them so consistently?

I had everything a man could want - wealth, success, a child on the way.Yet here I was, hiding in the dark, watching my ex-wife like some pathetic stalker. Tears ran down my face. I knew I should leave her alone. If I truly loved her, I'd want her happiness, even without me.

But I couldn't stop coming here night after night. These brief glimpses of Annie were all I had left.

I wiped my tears away, disgusted with myself. Philip Baker crying over a woman who'd moved on. What had I become?

My phone rang. Sarah's name on the screen. I answered, already regretting it.


"Hello?"

"Annie encouraged people to cyberbully me..." Sarah's voice was controlled,calculated. "Didn't you stand up for me earlier? After you hung up,you never contacted me again. I want to know what happened."

"Do I look like an idiot to you?" I snapped, gripping the phone tightly.

"Is it because I've been treating you decently lately? You think that means I still love you? That you can manipulate me however you want?"

"Philip, I don't understand what you mean..." Sarah sounded confused,which only made me angrier.

"You understand perfectly," I said. "You started trouble with Annie online.When she defended herself, people criticized you. Then you told me Annie was cyberbullying you!"

I hit the dashboard with my free hand. "I believed you and confronted Annie! And what happened? I looked like a fool when I learned the truth!All because you lied to me!"

"Sarah, I won't believe a single word you say from now on."

Silence. I could practically hear her calculating her next move. "I'm sorry..." she finally said, her voice softening. "Being pregnant and criticized online made me emotional. If you don't like it, I'll change next time!"


"Really?" I couldn't hide my disbelief.

Suddenly, Sarah's tone changed completely. "Oh! Philip, come quickly! My stomach hurts terribly!"

Her voice rose in panic. "What if I'm miscarrying?"

Despite my anger seconds before, fear took over. I'd aIready lost Brian.This baby was my last chance at family.

"Don't worry, I'm coming right away!" I started the car.

"Okay," Sarah whispered.

I looked at the balcony one last time as I pulled away. Howard and Annie had gone inside, their peace undisturbed by my presence.

As I drove to Sarah's apartment, I cursed myself. Hadn't I just promised not to believe her lies? Yet here I was, rushing to her at the first mention of danger to the baby.


What is wrong with me? I ran a red light. At work, I made decisions based on data and logic. With women, I became completely irrational.

I found Sarah lying on her apartment floor,face pale.

"How are you feeling?" I knelt beside her.

"Not good," she whispered. "Take me to the hospital."

I remembered Annie after her fall - how I wasn't there, how I failed her.I couldn't make that mistake again. "It's going to be okay. I'm here," I lifted her carefully.

Sarah wrapped her arms around my neck, her head against my shoulder.
As I carried her to the car, I felt both worried and suspicious. Was this another trick? I couldn't risk it - not with my child's life at stake.

"T'll drive fast, but safely," I placed her in the passenger seat. "We'll get there in time."


Sarah smiled weakly. "I trust you."

I sped through empty streets, running yellow lights. We reached the hospital in minutes, and I carried Sarah straight to the emergency room.

"My wife is pregnant and having severe abdominal pain," I told the nurse,the word "wife" slipping out by habit. "She needs immediate attention."

The staff took Sarah for examination while I paced the waiting room,imagining the worst.

What if she loses the baby? I can't lose another child.

The hospital smell brought back memories of Annie's miscarriage - my absence, my failure. I checked my watch repeatedly, growing more anxious by the minute.

This time will be different. This time I'll do everything right.

The doctor finally approached me.

"There's nothing to worry about," he said. "Both mother and baby are perfectly healthy."

Relief flooded through me. "Thank you,doctor."

I helped Sarah to a seat, keeping my voice gentle. "We're fine. Nothing's wrong." She stroked her belly, smiling. "That's wonderful. I don't know how I would have faced you if something had happened."

"Don't talk like that," I said, genuinely relieved the child was safe.

Sarah's expression changed. "Actually, I think this is Annie's fault."

"If she hadn't responded to me online," Sarah said softly, "people wouldn't have attacked me. My stomach wouldn't have hurt... and you wouldn't have had to rush here so late."


She grabbed my sleeve. "Could you contact Anne and talk to her about this? I am pregnant. She should be more considerate. For the baby's sake!"

"Absolutely not! That's ridiculous!" I pulled my arm away. "If you want to avoid conflict with her, stop provoking her!"

"I can't do that!" Sarah's eyes filled with tears. "I love you, but you love her! Every time I see her doing well, I feel so jealous!"

Her voice dropped to a whisper. "I always wonder if I need to be as good as she is to deserve your love. But I can't be like her. So I try to bring her down... to make it seem like we're not so different. It helps me cope."

She started crying. "If you ask me to stop, I'll suffocate. Philip, please,for the baby's sake... help me."

I saw exactly what was happening. Sarah was using our unborn child to manipulate me into hurting Annie again. The thought made my stomach turn.


But what if she was right about stress affecting the baby? What if my refusal caused complications? Could I live with that?

I looked at Sarah's pregnant belly. I thought of Brian, who barely spoke to me anymore. I thought of the child Annie and I lost. How many more chances would I get to be a father?

I gave in. I borrowed a phone from someone nearby and called Annie.

"Who is this?" Annie sounded suspicious.

"It's Philip." I spoke quickly. "Please don't hang up. I have something important to tell you."

"What do you want?" Her impatience was obvious.

"When Sarah mentions you online, could you not respond?" I hated myself with each word. "Your response today got her criticized. It affected her baby... she almost miscarried."


As I spoke, shame washed over me. I was letting Sarah manipulate me into attacking Annie again. I was becoming the villain in Annie's life once more.


But my fear of losing another child overpowered everything else.I had failed Brian. I had failed Annie. This baby was my last chance at being a father.


I waited for Annie's response, my heart poundling. How had I sunk this low? When had I become a man who would hurt someone he claimed to love for a woman he didn't even trust?


The silence stretched on, a perfect judgment for what I had become. 
###Chapter 99: Persistent Philip

Annie's POV

The night breeze caressed my skin as I leaned against the balcony railing,gazing at the distant lights of New York City with a newfound softness in my eyes. Today's events-from Catherine's dramatic complaints about her new work assignment to the touching gift from Lucy's grandparents-though complicated, left me feeling unusually content.

Howard stood beside me, his tall frame blocking the cool wind. He turned to face me, and in the moonlight, his usually serious face had softened.

"Lucy's grandparents seem to like you," he observed, studying my profile.

I smiled, shaking my head gently. "They're just transferring their feelings for their daughter. Because I take care of Lucy."

Howard's gaze lingered on me, his eyes filled with unmistakable admiration. "No, it's more than that."

I reached out to lightly touch his face. "But you're different. You genuinely love me."


"Yes," Howard admitted without hesitation. "The first time I'saw you was at the hospital. Lucy pointed at you and said you were Brian's mom."

His voice grew softer, more intimate. "You looked so vulnerable then, yet gentle and beautiful at the same time."


Howard found my hand, his thumb tracing circles in my palm. "The next time I saw you was when you fell down the stairs and lost your baby."

His expression momentarily darkened. "You were lying in a pool of blood.your face pale. That's when I realized how much suffering you'd endured,how terribly you'd been treated." He pulled me closer, his warmth enveloping me. "As we spent more time together. I gradually discovered the real you-independent, resilient, with clear goals and dreams."

His gaze met mine, intense and sincere. "Before I realized what was happening, I was drawn to you. By the time I became aware of it,I had fallen deeply in love with you."

Howard didn't seem to expect an immediate response. Instead, he cupped my face in his hands and leaned down to kiss me. I closed my eyes,losing myself in the gentle pressure of his lips on mine.

This peaceful moment was interrupted by my phone ringing. I reluctantly moved away from Howard to check the caller ID-an unknown number.My instincts told me I should answer.

"Hello?" I asked cautiously.

"Annie, it's Philip." His voice immediately made me tense. "Please don't hang up. I have something important to tell you."

My body stiffened, fingers tightening around the phone. "What do you want?"


Howard noticed the change in my demeanor, his brow furrowing with concern. I put the phone on speaker so he could hear too.


"When Sarah mentions you online, could you not respond?" Philip's voice sounded tense, almost desperate. "Your response today got her criticized.It affected her baby... she almost miscarried."


The same ridiculous logic again. Sarah publicly attacks me online, I simply clarify the facts, and I'm asked to be silent? Because "she's pregnant"? As if pregnancy is some kind of immunity card that allows you to hurt others without consequences. I listened with increasing disbelief to Philip's absurd request. After everything Sarah had done to me-after the child I lost because of her-he was asking me to silently accept her harassment?


Is he really that naive? Or has his intelligence completely failed him? A grown man, CEO of a Wall Street investment firm, making such a childish request. Does he truly believe the world revolves around Sarah because she's carrying a child? This kind of thinking that ignores right and wrong is suffocating. Philip has always been like this, only seeing what he wants to see, interpreting everything in the most self-serving way possible.

"Philip, do you hear yourself?" I asked coldly. "Do you realize how absurd you sound?"

"Please, Annie. For her child's sake-"

"You dare," I interrupted, my voice sharp. "From the beginning, this entire situation,I have been the victim. And now, just because she claims her child might be affected, I should let her spread lies about me?"

Philip's voice turned defensive. "She's pregnant!"

"And that gives her the right to harass me online? Damage my reputation?"My voice rose as years of suppressed anger surfaced. "Philip, let me ask you something-is that child mine?"

There was a pause before he reluctantly answered, "No."

"Then I have no obligation to tolerate her behavior," I said firmly. "I know better than anyone that she's using this child to keep you close.She would never let anything happen to it."

I took a deep breath, calming myself. "Tell your girlfriend to stay away from me. Because next time, my response won't just be clarifying facts."

Without waiting for his reply, I ended the call and immediately blocked the number. My hand trembled slightly as I put down the phone.

Howard took my hand, his touch reassuring. "That was Philip?"

"Yes," I nnodded, taking deep breaths to calm myself. "He borrowed someone else's phone to call me because I've blocked his number."

Howard's lips twisted into a contemptuous smile. "He really goes to great lengths to defend Sarah."


Before he could say more, his own phone rang. He glanced at the screen.raising an eyebrow in surprise.

"Speak of the devil," he murmured, showing me Philip's name on the screen.

Howard answered with professionally cold couresy,"Mr. Baker, what can I do for you?"

Philip's voice came clearly through the night air. "Can you limit the resources provided to Annie? Perhaps reduce her promotion opportunities?"


Howard's face remained impressively neutral, though I could see anger flickering in his eyes. "The affairs of my company are none of your business,Mr.Baker."

"But if Annie didn't have so many followers, Sarah wouldn't be attacked online," Philip insisted, his reasoning both desperate and flawed.

Howard's patience was visibly waning. "If Sarah hadn't provoked Annie in the first place, none of this would have happened. Don't you think that's the real issue here?"


"I'm just asking for your help," Philip's voice took on a pleading quality I'd rarely heard during our marriage. "For Sarah's child." Howard's tone turned icy. "I suggest you find the real problem instead of asking the victim to make further concessions."

There was silence on the other end for a moment before Philip spoke again.his voice low. "I understand Annie is the injured party here. But I'm desperate, Howard. Sarah is using the child to manipulate me, I know that.But what if her claim about stress affecting the baby isn't a lie? What if my refusal causes complications?"

There was a note ofvulnerability in his voice. "I've already lost Brian-he barely speaks to me anymore. I lost Annie and the child we should have had. This might be my last chance at being a father."

Howard's expression softened slightly, though his voice remained firm."
Then perhaps you should focus first on being a better father to Brian,
rather than enabling Sarah's behavior."

"It's not that simple," Philip sighed. "Nothing is simple anymore."

"I can't help you with this problem, Philip," Howard finally said. "Annie has been through enough because of you and Sarah. I won't let you victimize her again."

After the call ended, Howard pulled me close, his arms wrapping protectively around me.

"He's a mess," I whispered against Howard's chest.

Howard nodded, his chin resting on top of my head. "He made his choices.Now he has to live with them."

We stood in silence for a while, watching as stars appeared one by one in the night sky. Despite these interruptions, a sense of peace still enveloped me. For the first time in years, I felt truly protected,truly valued.

"You handled Philip so calmly just now.,." Howard began,a note of admiration in his voice. "You've changed."

I smiled at him. "I've learned that sometimes the most powerful response is simply refusing to engage."

"You always had that strength," Howard replied, tucking a strand of hair behind my ear. "You just needed to discover it."

"It's getting late," I said softly, glancing at my watch. "I should check on Lucy, make sure she's sleeping well."

Howard nodded, pressing a light kiss to my forehead. "Go ahead. I'll stay out here a little longer."


I took one last look at the quiet New York skyline below, wondering if just a short while ago, Philip had been somewhere down there,watching us.I was no longer the Annie Baker who could be pushed around, and that change was profound and irreversible.
###Chapter 100: Howard Thompson, Your Luck Won't Hold Forever.
Sarah's POV

I sat on the sofa, my eyes fixed on Philip as he stood in the hospital hallway making his call. He'd borrowed someone's phone, so I couldn't hear Annie's side of the conversation. A flutter of anxiety mixed with anticipation rose in my chest. I knew Philip would stand up for me. After all, this baby was my trump card-the mere mention of it was enough to make him obey.


I studied his profile, noting how his brow furrowed deeper by the second,his expression growing increasingly troubled. A twinge of unease rippled through me. Had Annie refused him again? Why couldn't that woman just quietly accept my taunts? The thought irritated me, but I knew better than to let it show on my face.


Philip ended the call and walked back into the room in silence. I immediately switched to my concerned expression, eyes widened with practiced vulnerability.

"How did it go? Did Annie agree to back off?" I asked softly, making my voice sound small and hopeful.

"As you wanted, I got chewed out. And no, Annie didn't agree to anything." Philip replied, frustration evident in every syllable.


Hearing his response sent a wave of satisfaction through me. Annie may not have yielded, but Philip had been scolded-exactly what I'd hoped for.Every time he defended me and suffered for it, he became more dependent on me, more in need of my comfort and validation. I felt that delicious sense of control, the corners of my mouth lifting involuntarily.

I suddenly realized I was smiling and quickly tried to compose my
features, but it was too late. Philip had noticed.

Something shifted in his gaze, a flicker of suspicion that made my heart race. I couldn't let him see through me.


"I'm so sorry," I quickly grabbed his hand, adding a deliberáte tremor to my voice. "I only asked for your help because I have no other man to rely on."


I paused, allowing my eyes to moisten slightly as I looked up at him."I had no idea Annie would be so cruel to you just because you tried to help me."


I watched Philip's expression carefully,noting how his anger seemed to subside somewhat, but he pulled his hand away sooner than expected.Inwardly, I felt a flash of annoyance. Why was this man becoming increasingly difficult to manipulate?

"Hmm." Philip's response was curt, his eyes no longer meeting mine.I could sense his eagerness to leave.

This wasn't a good sign. I had expected him to double down on supporting me after Annie's rejection, as he usually did. Instead,he seemed to be distancing himself. My mind began calculating my next move,though I maintained my fragile demeanor outwardly.

Philip stood up. "It's late, and I have work tomorrow. I should get going."

I quickly assessed the situation-trying to make him stay might backfire.Since I'd already accomplished my goal of making him confront Annie,tonight's mission was essentially complete. Besides, I had more important matters to attend to.


"I won't see you out then," I said softly, already planning my  next steps for after his departure. I stood at the door, watching Philip's retreating figure, my mind already crafting ways to use this incident to getcloser to Howard. After Philip's car disappeared from view, I quickly closed the door and pulled out my phone.



This was a perfect opportunity to capture Howard's attention,perhaps even plant a seed of doubt about Annie in his mind.


I found Howard's number, took a deep breath to compose myself, and dialed. When I heard his voice, my pulse genuinely quickened-not just from nervousness, but from the effect his deep, magnetic voice had on me.

"Hello?" Howard's voice sounded calm and distant.

"It's me, Sarah Johnson." I deliberately made my voice sound soft and slightly anxious. "Mr. Thompson, did Philip just contact Annie?"

There was a pause on the other end, followed by a simple "Hmm?" This response caught me off guard; typically, men showed more concern when I displayed vulnerability. I quickly adjusted my approach.


"I didn't think he would do that," I continued, injecting a note of hurt into my voice. "I just mentioned feeling upset..."


"Who could have imagined he'd get so angry and call to complain." I added, while internally knowing this was precisely the outcome I had orchestrated. Having Philip attack Annie, then playing innocent with Howard-a win-win situation in my book.

But Howard's reaction completely blindsided me.

"You don't need to explain anything to me. I'm not interested in your affairs." His voice was as cold as ice.


His words stung. I was accustomed to men paying attention to me,defending me, considering my feelings. But Howard seemed completely immune to my tactics. I bit my lip, experiencing a mixture of genuine disappointment and feigned hurt.

"Are you saying that because you're afraid of making Annie angry?" I asked tentatively, wondering if Annie was the obstacle preventing me from getting closer to Howard.

"Not at all," Howard's rebuttal was calm and direct. "Sarah, you started this whole thing."

His subsequent words cut into my pride like a knife: "Then Annie defended herself with evidence... everyone criticized you. Logically,things should have ended there, but you couldn't accept that, so you had to find someone to fight your battles. Now you're playing innocent with me,shifting all responsibility to Philip who was just trying to help you. It's absurd."


I felt a surge of anger and humiliation. How dare he speak to me this way?Even more shocking was his next question.

"How do you think Philip would feel if he knew all his concern for you was repaid with this kind of betrayal?"

Howard's words sent a chill through me. How had he seen through me so easily? The character I'd so carefully constructed seemed completely transparent to him, I couldn't help wondering if I had underestimated this man.


My situation was suddenly precarious. Philip's support was beginning to waver, and Howard was completely unmoved by my charms. I urgently needed a new benefactor, or things would become very difficult after the baby was born.

My tone became stiff as I tried to salvage some dignity:′′Aa CEO of your stature, surely you're not petty enough to gossip about trivial matters like this?"

I was warning him, hoping he wouldn't share our conversation with Philip.If Philip learned how I spoke about him behind his back, I might lose his support entirely.

Howard responded with casual indifference: "I might mention it in passing at work."


His answer made my blood run cold. Was he threatening me? I didn't know how to respond and opted for silence.

The line went dead. Howard had hung up. I stared at my phone screen,a wave of humiliation and anger washing over me.Why wasn't Howard as easily manipulated as other men?

I refused to end things this way. I dialed Howard's number again,planning to restart the conversation with a different approach. But the call indicated he was busy. I tried several more times with the same result.

A terrible thought occurred to me-had Howard blocked my number? I opened my photo gallery, selected my most flattering selfie, and attempted to send him a message. In the photo, I was smiling, my expression a calculated blend of innocence and seduction that worked on most men.

But the message failed to send.

This tíme, anger completely overwhelmed me. I wanted to throw my phone against the wall, to scream, to release this feeling of humiliation.But I ultimately controlled myseIf. I knew I couldn't lose control, at least not now.


I took several deep breaths, forcing myself to calm down, If Howard was immune to my usual tactics, I would need to devise a new plan. I wouldn't give up-I never easily surrendered something I wanted.' I gently caressed my abdomen, a cold smile spreading across my face.I still had Philip in my grasp, this baby, and many other resources I could leverage. Howard Thompson, your luck won't hold forever.
