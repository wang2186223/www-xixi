###Chapter 1 Tattoo


Inside the VIP ward of Kretol City Hospital.

Amelia Flynn reclined on the white sheets, her attention fixed on a video playing across her tablet, sarcasm evident in her eyes.

A raging fever had landed her in the hospital, but her fiancé, Jaxton Morrison, was busy spending time with someone else at a luxury hotel.

The video clip captured the grainy shadows of a hotel hallway, yet there was no mistaking the woman next to Jaxton-Amelia's half-sister, Dayna Flynn.

Amelia put away the tablet and turned to look at the person before her, her gaze cool. "What if I say no to getting a tattoo?"

Clayton Dobson, Jaxton's assistant, wasn't surprised by her reaction. If he were in her position, he would also find it hard to accept the situation.

What kind of man spent the night at a hotel with a woman and then asked his fiancée to cover for him?

The Morrison Group was at a critical juncture, and as the heir, Jaxton being caught in such a scandal had already affected the company's stock prices.

For the family's sake, a public statement from Amelia, Jaxton's fiancée, seemed the only way to patch the damage.

Though the video blurred Dayna's face, the tattoo on her waist, Jaxton's initials, stood out as plain as day.

Acting strictly on Jaxton's instructions, Clayton had come to persuade Amelia to get the same tattoo as Dayna's.

By doing this, they could spin the narrative online and bury the brewing scandal.

With a look that mingled sympathy and resignation, Clayton said softly, "Miss Flynn, this is what Mr. Morrison wants. If you don't cooperate, there might be issues with Mrs. Davis' treatment next week..."

He left his sentence dangling, but Amelia understood him perfectly. This was Jaxton's threat.

Jaxton was using her grandmother, Michelle Davis, as leverage to threaten her.

Michelle required special treatment every week, and in all of Kretol, only the renowned doctor, Marc Chapman, could provide it.

Amelia didn't know how Jaxton had convinced Marc to treat her grandmother, but with him using her grandmother to threaten her, she had no choice but to comply.

Several minutes slipped by before Amelia turned to lie on her stomach.

Nearby, the tattoo artist arranged his equipment with quiet efficiency.

Nothing about the anesthesia worked for Amelia due to her special condition.

By the time the tattoo artist finished his work, sweat clung to Amelia's skin, soaking the thin fabric of her hospital gown, while her face looked pale.

"I'm sorry you had to endure that, Miss Flynn."

Clayton's words came as he approached, snapping a quick photo of the fresh tattoo on her waist. Then, he sent the photo to Jaxton.

After receiving Jaxton's reply, Clayton finally breathed a sigh of relief.

He nodded to the tattoo artist, who quickly left the room without a sound.

"Try to get some rest, Miss Flynn. I will come pick you up in the evening," Clayton said to Amelia.

Not bothering to wait for a reply, he left the room.

Only then did Amelia allow herself to open her eyes.

A dull ache pulsed at her lower back as she struggled upright and made her way into the bathroom.

Catching sight of the new tattoo-an exact match to Dayna's-in the mirror, her eyes grew cold, and her chest felt heavy.

Hours slipped past, and by seven that evening, Amelia found herself escorted by Clayton to the Morrison Group's press conference.

When she arrived, she found that Jaxton was already there.

Spotlights caught Jaxton's striking features, his perfect posture, and the tailored suit he wore.

As Amelia's gaze fell onthe suit, a shadow of sadness crossed her eyes.

A month of effort had gone into creating that piece for him. Two years ago, she'd stitched and shaped every detail of that suit by hand, pouring her heart into it.

She still remembered Jaxton's joy when he had received it.

Yet, in just two years, the suit remained the same, but Jaxton had changed completely.

"Miss Flynn, what's your response to the recent scandal as Mr. Morrison's fiancée? Do you have something to say about it?You-"

Shock silenced the reporter mid-question, his attention caught by the scene unfolding in front of him.

Without warning, Jaxton drew Amelia close and lifted her shirt just enough to reveal the new tattoo.

Cameras flashed as the tattoo-identical to the one from the scandalous video-came into full view.

Feeling the unwanted touch, Amelia was repulsed. As she looked up, she could even see the hickey on Jaxton's neck.

A shudder of disgust rolled through her body, and she pressed her lips together to keep it from showing.

"Amelia, why don't you tell everyone what happened last night?"

Jaxton sounded gentle, but his gaze was full of ridicule toward her.

Frustration simmered within Amelia, yet thoughts of her grandmother made her hold back.

She forced a polite smile and said, "It's all a big misunderstanding. The woman in the video with Mr. Morrison was me."

One of the reporters said, "Oh, so that's what happened! Looks like your relationship is quite stable. Should we be expecting a wedding soon?"

Hearing that, Jaxton pulled Amelia into an embrace, his eyes shining with fake tenderness for the cameras.

After a while, his phone rang, the name "Dayna" lighting up thescreen. When he saw it, he immediately let go of Amelia.

The reporters, fortunately, had already begun to disperse. Otherwise, this would have raised their suspicions.

Even from a distance, Amelia could hear Dayna's soft, aggrieved voice and Jaxton's soothing words.

Refusing Clayton's offer of a ride, Amelia left the event and made her way to her apartment by herself.

Night fell over the city as she sat alone by the window.

After a while, she retrieved her phone and dialed a number.

Three rings echoed before the call connected, but there was only silence on the line afterward.

Had it not been for the faint sound of breathing, Amelia might have thought no one was on the other end of the line at all.

After a while, she drew a shaky breath and finally found her voice. "Does your promise to me still stand?"
###Chapter 2 She Is Going To Get Married


On the other end of the line was a man, dressed in black, carrying himself with an effortless elegance, his sharp features nothing short of captivating.

There was a flicker of surprise inhis eyes now.

Silence dragged on until Amelia found herself unable to wait any longer. She said, "Sorry, I was being impulsive. Just ignore what I said-"

"Yes."

Her words were cut short by the man's low voice.

She was shocked by his response.

Truth be told, she had regretted her words almost immediately after saying them.

Letting go of her engagement to Jaxton was one thing, but agreeing to marry Wyatt Stewart felt like playing a dangerous game.

In the darkness, Amelia's mind wandered back to a year ago.

It was late at night, just like now, when she had left the hospital as usual, only to encounter the barely conscious Wyatt in an alley on the west side of Kretol.

At the time, Amelia didn't know his identity, so when he offered to repay her after she'd saved him, she jokingly asked if he meant he would do anything for her.

He answered with a nod, and she couldn't help but tease that she might want himn to marry her.

Her proposal had just been a joke, an impulsive bit of fun. Never once had she expected Wyatt to agree.

But she already had an engagement with Jaxton, arranged before her mother's death, so she quickly explained she was only joking.
Knowing about her engagement, Wyatt made no argument. Instead, he quietly said that if she ever chose to end things with Jaxton, he would marry her. He promised to keep this offer valid for two years.

That offer hadn't expired yet.

How the call ended, Amelia couldn't recall.

All that remained clear was Wyatt's words on the phone, telling her to get ready for a wedding in thirty days.

She was really going to get married to someone, and that someone was not Jaxton.

Amelia lay in bed in the dark, feeling exhausted but unable to fall asleep.

Just as her thoughts began to fade, an onslaught of notifications rattled her phone.

Since her grandmother was in the hospital, she never turned off or silenced her phone.

She checked her phone and saw a photo of shredded pieces of clothing.

Recognition settled in after a moment-this was the pieces of the suit Jaxton had chosen that day, the very one crafted by her hands.

Accompanying the photo was a message from Dayna. "Sorry, Amelia. I had no idea you made this suit for Jaxton. I honestly thought it was just a regular suit, so when I saw it was dirty, I cut it into pieces to get rid of it. Hope you're not mad at me."

There was a smugness to Dayna's words that was impossible to miss.

When Amelia didn't reply right away, another message from Dayna appeared. "Jaxton says it's no big deal.Just a piece of clothing, not worth much."

Amelia knew that ignoring Dayna wouldn't help her sleep. If she left things hanging, the messages would just keep coming.

With a few quick taps, Amelia replied, "Jaxton's right; it's only a piece of clothing.I am not mad."

She then made sure to block Dayna's number before setting her phone aside. No part of her reply was a lie-she truly felt no anger.

After all, things like this had happened so often over the past two years that she'd lost count.

If she let herself get upset each time, she would have lost her mind long ago.

Lying back down, Amelia found she couldn't fall asleep.

A thought crept in-would her mother feel regret seeing her daughter's life turn out this way?

Dayna, the illegitimate child of Amelia's father, was a few months younger than Amelia.

When Amelia's mother, Katrina Davis, discovered Dayna's existence, she sent her abroad.

Yet, the endless burden of work soon caught up to Katrina, and her health began tofail.

That same year Katrina's health failed, Ricky Flynn-Amelia's father-brought both Janessa Patel and Dayna back to the country and into their home.

Nothing about this arrangement escaped Katrina's notice. She understood perfectly well that life with a stepmother would not be easy for Amelia, especially since Ricky had neve been a man of kindness.

To protect her daughter, Katrina made plans for Amelia to marry Jaxton.

This decision came easily, since Katrina and Laura Morrison, Jaxton's mother, had been close friends for decades.

Amelia and Jaxton had grown up together, and with her and Laura's connection, Katrina believed Amelia would have a good life after marrying Jaxton.

However, Katrina had no way of knowing how much people could change.

Just before her death, Katrina called Jaxton over and pressed him for a promise to take good care of Amelia.With both Katrina and Laura present, Jaxton's answer rang with conviction.

His assurance was so convincing that even Amelia believed him. But now...

At dawn, Amelia was pulled awake by a force. As she opened her eyes, she saw Jaxton's face,full of anger.

He was gripping her wrist tightly, the pain forcing her to pull away. "What's your problem? Why are you acting like this first thing in the morning?" she asked.

"You think you're clever, Amelia? Besides complaining to my mother, what else can you do?" Jaxton said.

That accusation made Amelia furrow her brows.

The video had spread online, and there was no chance Laura missed it.

But as soon as Jaxton heard from his mother, he jumped to the conclusion that Amelia must have tattled.

Amelia didn't even have the energy to waste explaining things to him.

The matter just strengthened her resolve to break off the engagement.

To Jaxton, Amelia's silence was an admission. He continued his harsh remarks throughout the journey to his family home.

Yet,as soon as they entered the Morrison family's residence, Jaxton changed his attitude completely.

Watching him change his demeanor so quickly, Amelia rolled her eyes. She had been so blind before, unable to realize that he was just a hypocrite.
###Chapter 3 Do You Like Them


"You've been through so much, Amelia. I'm truly sorry."

The moment Amelia entered the living room, Laura reached for her hand with gentle urgency and spoke up.

Not a single year seemed to touch Laura's appearance; though she was well into her fifties, she could easily pass for forty, thanks to her careful self-care.

Right now,her usually composed features overflowed with genuine concern.

For as long as Amelia could remember, Laura had always shown her kindness. Every time Jaxton stepped out of line, Laura was there to defend her and scold him.

Yet,Laura's idea of discipline was just some mild reprimand. It hardly made any difference.

Today was no different.

Laura fixed her son with a piercing look. "Apologize to Amelia right now."

Normally,Amelia would have brushed off the matter, saying it was no big deal.

But this time, she suddenly felt tired of it all. Before Jaxton could open his mouth, she said, "Laura, I've got a bit of a headache. I'm going to lie down upstairs."

One look at Amelia's pale cheeks was all Laura needed. "Of course, get some rest. I'll have someone inform you when dinner is ready."

With a slight nod, Amelia quietly went upstairs.

As soon as Amelia vanished from sight, Laura's patience snapped. She turned to Jaxton and said, "Have you lost your mind? Why are you involved with Ricky's illegitimate daughter?"

"Mom,illegitimate or not, she is Ricky's daughter. And besides, Janessa knew Ricky first. What they had was true love."
"You..."

Anger hit Laura so hard that she had to steady herself as dizziness washed over her.

Taking a deep breath, Laura forced herself to calm down.

Looking at her son with a composed expression, she said, "Whatever you do with Dayna is your business.But remember this-Amelia is your fiancée. She's the only one who will ever be accepted into this family as your wife."

This wasn't the first time Laura had said this. Jaxton had heard these words countless times.

This time, though, he asked her, "Mom, do you want Amelia as a daughter-in-law because of Katrina, or is it because of the sixty percent of shares she owns?"

Profit always came first for businesspeople.

Laura was no exception to the rule.

Her agreement to this engagement was never just because of her friendship with Katrina; Amelia's shares in the company weighed heavily in the balance.

Katrina had built the Flynn Group herself. Even after her early death, she had left Amelia with sixty percent of the company's shares.

Laura said, "Since you know that Amelia holds sixty percent of the company shares, you should treat her right. Jaxton, I'mn doing all this for your own good. A marriage with Amelia sets you up for success. Dayna can't match her looks or her capabilities. If you keep involving yourself with Dayna, it'll only end up hurting Amelia and making her feel disappointed in you.One day,you'll regret it. You-"

"Stop, Mom. That's enough. I never said I wouldn't go through wvith marrying Amelia." Clearly annoyed,Jaxton cut Laura off and stormed upstairs.

Inside her room on the second floor, Amelia sat on the sofa near the window, quietly observing the fountain's gentle spray in the garden below.

Just then, her phone suddenly buzzed with a message. Her eyes grew wide as she saw the photo she had just received.

In the photo were two silver wedding rings, elegant in their simplicity-exactly her taste.

"Do you like them?"

Wyatt's message appeared beneath the photo, and Amelia wasted no time replying,"What are these?"

"Do you like them?" Wyatt just repeated the question.

She took a breath, hesitated, and finally replied, "Yes, I do."

Once the message was sent, nothing but silence followed from Wyatt's end.

Unknown to Amelia, when Wyatt saw her response, a subtle smile played on his face.

That unusual expression did not go unnoticed by the man beside Wyatt.e you actually smiling? Who are you,and what have you done to the real Wyatt?"

Wyatt's smile vanished instantly when he heard his friend's teasing words.

Wyatt's change of expression was so sudden that Marc almost thought he had just imagined his smile earlier.

"How's Mrs. Davis holding up?"

Wyatt was talking about Amelia's grandmother.

Marc's tone grew somber as he answered, "Nothing has improved. Her heart is getting weaker. Even if I try my best to treat her, I'm afraid she doesn't have much time left."

"So you are not so skilled as a doctor after all."

Doctors hated to hear doubt cast on their expertise, and Marc was no exception, especially since he was an internationally renowned physician.

Marc bristled. "What's that supposed to mean? I'm a doctor, not a miracle worker. Speaking of Mrs. Davis,there's something I don't understand. You asked me to treat her, but why do it by having me agree to the Morrison family's offer?"

That arrangement made him appear as though he was in it for the money.

Rather than explain himself, Wyatt turned his focus to a set of sketches scattered across the table.

Drawn on the page was the design for a set of wedding rings-the very ones he had just shown to Amelia.
###Chapter 4 Meeting Him For The Second Time


At the Morrison family's residence.

After lunch, Jaxton would usually rush to leave with Amelia.

But today was different-he stayed.

Just then, Laura said, "There's a business banquet tonight on the east side of Kretol. The Stewart family is behind it, and rumor has it Mr. Wyatt Stewart arranged everything himself. Jaxton, you should bring Amelia to attend. Our family's influence may not match the Stewarts', but it's a great opportunity for us. If Mr.Stewart shows up, it could be your chance to make a valuable connection."

Hearing about the banquet made Amelia hesitate, a protest rising in her chest. Yet, the mention of that man changed everything, compelling her to nod in agreement.

After all, the person Laura had just mentioned was the man she was about to marry.

Not long after, Jaxton and Amelia climbed into his car,ready to leave.

An unexpected ring cut through the quiet; Dayna was calling Jaxton.

Without shame, Jaxton answered the call, making no effort to hide it from Amelia.

Their flirty exchange filled the car,making Amelia feel a pang of discomfort.

"Pull over.Now."

Amelia's sudden command startled the driver, who instinctively stomped the brakes.

Tires shrieked, and Jaxton, caught mid-conversation, accidentally let his phone slip from his grasp.

Amelia wasted no time; as soon as the car stopped, she opened the door and stepped out.

Shock registered on Jaxton's face. He leaned out, irritation clear in his voice. "Amelia, what's wrong with you?You-" Before he could finish speaking, Amelia headed straight for the nearest bus stop, never once looking back.

Jaxton could only watch her walk away, disbelief written across his features.

Even the driver blinked in confusion. This had never happened before.

He glanced at Jaxton through the rearview mirror and cautiously asked, "Mr. Morrison, shouldI-"

"Drive!" Jaxton interjected coldly.

With a quick nod, the driver put his foot to the pedal, not saying anything more.

Jaxton flashed Amelia a derisive smirk as his car swept past her.

If she insisted on taking public transport, he'd gladly let her have her way.

Ignoring Jaxton's petty exit, Amelia kept her gaze steady ahead.

She'd rather endure the cramped ride on a city bus than spend another suffocating minute with him.

Yet, Amelia had just waited a few minutes before a sleek, silver-gray luxury vehicle glided to a stop nearby.

When the tinted back window rolled down, Wyatt's striing features appeared.

His driver approached Amelia respectfully, saying, "Miss Flynn, Mr. Stewart wants you to join him in the car."

Sliding into the elegant interior, Amelia felt her heartbeat speed up.

This was her second meeting with Wyatt.

He wasn't just any man; he was the heir to one of Kretol's most powerful families and her soon-to-be husband.

No matter how she tried to make sense of it, everything about this situation felt unreal.

Aside from the driver's quiet question about her destination, silence filled the car.

When Amelia glanced at the man beside her for the third time, Wyatt turned to her and asked, "Do you have something to say?" So many questions tangled in her mind-why had he agreed to marry her when it had been little more than a joke on her part?

Had he truly agreed to it to repay her for saving him?

But he was rich and powerful, someone who had endess means to repay any favor. Why marriage, of all things?

Unable to suppress her curiosity any longer, Amelia softly asked, "Can you really convince Jaxton to break off the engagement and find the solution to cure my grandmother?"

"Yes," Wyatt responded coolly.

Although she wanted to press him for more details, his distant demeanor kept her silent.

As the car eased to a halt outside her apartment, Amelia quickly opened the door and stepped out, offering a polite nod. "I appreciate the ride,Mr.Stewart.Goodbye."

"Hold on."

Just as Amelia was about to enter the building, Wyatt's deep voice sounded from behind her.

Spinning around, she saw a beautifully wrapped box being extended toward her through the car's window.

Her eyes first landed on Wyatt's sculpted hand before even noticing the box.

He was blessed with good looks, and even his hands seemed perfect.

"This is for you."

Wyatt's voice drew Amelia out of her daze, and without thinking, she accepted the box.

Before she could ask what was in the box, the car drove away.

Left standing in the silence for a moment, Amelia made her way back to her apartment, clutching the unexpected gift.

After she arrived home, curiosity got the better of her, and she opened the box. A burst of vibrant red greeted her eyes.

Pulling out the red gown, Amelia felt pleased-she loved the color.

Bright colors had always called to her, but years of pleasing Jaxton's taste for understated style had dimmed her wardrobe.

Now, with the end of her engagement to Jaxton drawing near, she finally felt free to embrace her true taste.

By seven o'clock, Amelia left home in the red gown.

She then opened the passenger door of Jaxton's car.

Amelia hadn't anticipated Dayna's presence, while Dayna was shocked by the outfit Amelia had chosen.

In Dayna's memory, Amelia always wore light colors.

Her good looks often seemed to dim because of her plain clothing. Tonight, however, she turned heads in the bold red gown, looking captivating.

From the driver's seat, Jaxton caught sight of Amelia's new look, and surprise flickered across his face.

Before he could say a word, Amelia shut the car door and slipped into the back seat.

Jaxton hadn't intended to bring Dayna along but couldn't resist her tears and pleas.

At first, he'd felt uneasy about bringing Dayna, but seeing Amelia's bold look sparked anger inside him."Amelia, do you really think that dress is appropriate for tonight? Are you going there to seduce someone?"
###Chapter 5 The Rings


"Don't forget who you are. You are my fiancée; are you already looking to betray me?" Jaxton said.

"Isn't it funny you'd say that, Jaxton? You're the one who doesn't know how to stay loyal," Amelia retorted,her laugh edged with sarcasm.

Turning her gaze to Dayna's daring dress, she let her eyes linger on her chest with a clear sense of contempt. She said to Dayna, "You keep pushing up what you don't have, and still, there's almost nothing to show."

"You..." A deep flush crept over Dayna's face, anger and jealousy swirling in her eyes.

Though both she and Amelia stood tall and slim, only Amelia's fgure held the curves she so desperately wished she had.

"The clock's ticking. That business banquet kicks off at seven-thirty. Are you sure you want to keep wasting time here arguing?" With that, Amelia shut her eyes, clearly wanting to end the conversation.

None of this realy mattered. She planned to end her engagement to Jaxton soon. Then, she wouldn't have to see Jaxton's and Dayna's annoying faces again.

Still, for her grandmother to get the treatment she needed, Amelia knew she had to steer clear of pointless arguments.

Even though she preferred peace, some people just liked to stir up trouble for her.

Dayna spoke up as Amelia's indifference rattled her. "I swear, Amelia, I didn't steal your seat on purpose.Jaxton asked me to sit up front. He said it's more comfortable."

"It's no big deal. If Jaxton's fine with it, you're even welcome to take my position as his future wife," Amelia said.

"Don't think for a second my mother's approval keeps you safe from me calling off our engagement," Jaxton said angrily.

"Is that so? Then why not call it off right now?" Amelia snapped her eyes open and locked her gaze on him.

A spark of defiance danced in her eyes.

The fire in her eyes only made Jaxton's anger rise.

He believed that Amelia's boldness came from having his mother's support.

Yet, his mother's influence indeed left him powerless to act and call off the engagement.

"Don't forget that you still need Marc's help for your grandmother's treatment. Without me, Marc won't treat her," Jaxton said.

The weight of those words pressed down on Amelia, and she fell silent.

Satisfaction flickered in Jaxton's eyes when he saw that, a smirk settling across his face.

By this time, the car had arrived at the venue.

Once the doors swung open, Dayna was quick to fix her makeup. She then got out, holding Jaxton's arm.

Yet every curious gaze in the lobby aimed past her, landing on the spot where Amelia was.

Stunned whispers rippled through the lobby as Amelia swept inside with effortless poise.

The unexpected attention toward Amelia left Jaxton feeling slightly uncomfortable, though some part of him swelled with pride.

When Amelia veered off towards a quieter path, Jaxton reached out to grab her wrist, halting her."Where do you think you're going?"

Dayna tightened her grip on Jaxton's arm as he held onto Amelia.

Amelia said in annoyance,"You only need to take care of Dayna. Leave me alone."

Without another word, she brushed his hand away and walked toward a quieter area. An instinct to follow tugged at Jaxton, but Dayna's grip on him tightened. "Come on, Jaxton. We should join the people over there."

She gestured toward the circle of business leaders clustered nearby.

After another glance in Amelia's direction, Jaxton let himself be led away by Dayna.

Settling alone into a quiet corner, Amelia let herself breathe freely for the first time that evening.

"Good evening,Miss Flynn."

A young man approached just as Amelia reached for a drink, catching her off guard.

She looked at him, puzzled. She didn't know who he was.

Returning her gaze with professional courtesy, Davin Kirk introduced himself, saying, "I'm Mr. Stewart's assistant. Mr. Stewart wants to see you."

Wyatt's boldness surprised Amelia, but after a brief pause, she agreed and rose to follow Davin out.

Stopping at the lounge entrance, Davin pulled the door open for Amelia andthen left.

Lifting her gown slightly, Amelia entered the room.

A tall figure by the window turned around to face her.

Wyatt's eyes lit with quiet amazement as Amelia stepped into the room. "You look stunning in that dress."

"Thank you forgiving me this dress, Mr. Stewart," Amelia replied awkwardly after a long silence.

Raising an eyebrow, Wyatt walked over and stopped justin front of her. "You know, given our relationship,there's no need for you to thank me."

Amelia blinked in confusion.

Their relationship?

"We are about to get married, aren't we?" Wyatt said, sensing her confusion. Part of Amelia wanted to remind him she was still, officially, engaged to Jaxton.

Yet, as she held his steady gaze, all she managed to say was, "Mr. Stewart, why did you ask me to come here?"

"Give me your hand."

"What?" Amelia was puzzled by Wyatt's request.

If she didn't know her hearing was fine, she might have thought she had misheard him.

Wyatt simply said, "Your hand, Amelia."

Amelia offered her left hand as requested.

As soon as she did, he held it.

Despite his cold expression, his touch radiated unexpected warmth.

Suddenly, something cold slipped onto her finger-a silver ring, delicate and elegant.

She stared at the ring-the same one he had shown her earlier that day.

Her gaze stayed fixed on the ring, and she was rooted to the spot. Without realizing it, she found herself looking over at Wyatt's left hand. His ring finger had no band.

Suddenly, another ring was handed to her, and Wyatt extended his hand. "Put this one on my finger for me."

"Isn't this a bit inappropriate, Mr. Stewart?" Amelia said. ###Chapter 6 Do You Really Think Jaxton Loves You


Amelia couldn't even speak smoothly because of her shock.

Wyatt continued to hold out his hand, his voice steady as he responded,"What makes it inappropriate?"

Nothing about this felt quite appropriate,yet Amelia couldn't explain why.

She suddenly felt the room's temperature rise.

Her hand was just about to grasp the ring when a sharp knock echoed at the door.

From the hallway, Davin's voice called out, "Mr. Stewart, we need to go. The event is starting."

Relief swept through Amelia.

Letting her gaze linger on the ring, she said, "Maybe we should wait until my engagement ends to do this,Mr. Stewart. You are clearly busy now. I will head down first."

Not giving him a chance to answer, she swept out of the lounge.

Anyone watching would think she was fleeing from a ghost.

Wyatt watched her retreat, the corners of his mouth lifting in quiet amusement.

At least she hadn't rejected him putting on the ring for her, right?

Instead of waiting for the elevator, Amelia darted toward the stairs, eager to put distance between herself and that room.

It was only when she reached the stairs that she felt she could breathe normally again.

"Amelia,is that you?"

Just as Amelia was about to descend the stairs, Dayna appeared from around the corner.

 Her earlier meeting with Wyatt drifted through Amelia's thoughts. She studied Dayna, curiosity flickering in her eyes. "Weren't you supposed to be with Jaxton? Why are you here?"

"Seems to me I should be the one asking you that, Amelia."

"What are you trying to say?"

Amelia could not be sure if Dayna had seen anything. Still, something wary flickered in her eyes when she heard those words, though her face showed no sign of change.

Dressed in a sleek black dress, Dayna walked over to her. "Amelia, Jaxton cares about only one woman,and it isn't you. Even with your engagement, you cannot force his feelings. Why are you still clinging to him?"

Amelia fell silent at Dayna's words.

Smugness danced in Dayna's gaze as she savored Amelia's quiet. "If you're smart, you'll let Jaxton go before you embarrass yourself further."

"Dayna, do you really think Jaxton loves you?" Amelia asked.

"Without a doubt."

The sight of Dayna's absolute confidence made Amelia let out a low laugh. "Funny, I once believed he loved me,too."

Memories of Jaxton's vow to Katrina, promising he'd cherish her, drifted through her mind.

Before Dayna could respond, Amelia continued with a smile, "If he really loves you, then why doesn't he break off his engagement with me? Why is he just keeping you as the other woman? Tell me, Dayna-does that sound like real love to you?"

Dayna was stunned by Amelia's words.

With nothing more to say, Amelia turned away, slipping past Dayna.

However, a sudden, piercing scream rang out before Amelia reached the bottom of the stairs.

Turning around,Amelia caught sight of Dayna tumbling down the staircase. Shock rooted Amelia to the spot; she was unable to believe what she was seeing.

Dayna's scream drew everyone's attention, and the first person to rush over was Jaxton.

When he saw Dayna's dress stained with blood, he looked so worried.

"Jaxton, please don't blame my sister. She didn't push me. I slipped and fell by myself," Dayna said.

With all three of them showing up together, Amelia, the so-called fiancée, faced nothing but judgment from every corner of the hall.

Meeting Jaxton's stare without flinching, Amelia stated plainly, "I didn't push her."
###Chapter 7 That Is How I Apologize


"Amelia, what kind of person are you? If it wasn't you who pushed her, did Dayna fall down the stairs by herself? You've bullied her since you were kids, always taking her things, and now,you push her down the stairs just to secure a place in the Morrison family. You really will stoop to anything to get what you want,"Jaxton said.

"My answer hasn't changed. I didn't do it," Amelia said.

If there weren't so many people present, Amelia wouldn't have even bothered to say anything.

But she didn't want her reputation to be ruined.

Letting the accusation linger would destroy what was left of her reputation, which had taken blow after blow these last two years.

"Who else could it have been? Only you and Dayna were here just now," Jaxton said.

"You heard what she just said; she admitted she slipped on her own," Amelia said.

"Jaxton, it's true. I lost my balance. This isn't Amelia's fault." Dayna jumped in the second Amelia finished speaking.

Earlier,Dayna had already noticed there were no cameras around, making it all too easy for her to play the victim.

Dayna's words only made Jaxton's fury grow. His glare seared into Amelia. "So she just happened to fall on her own, and you're the only witness?You expect anyone to buy that?"

"I also saw that she fell on her own."

Before Amelia could reply, a calm voice sliced through the tension.

Wyatt's arrival drew every eye, and the crowd instinctively parted to let him pass. Davin trailed just a step behind him.

Without raising his voice, Wyatt surveyed the scene, his attention finally landing on Jaxton. "I witnessed it myself. That woman slipped on her own."

The weight of that statement settled heavily as he glanced at Dayna.

The second their gazes locked, fear flickered across Dayna's face.

Never in her wildest calculations had she imagined that someone would witness her fall.

If anyone else had spoken up, she would have argued that they had seen it wrong, but Wyatt's authority left her no room to protest.

No one in Kretol matched Wyatt's influence.

Stunned into silence,Jaxton could only stare at Dayna, struggling to process Wyatt's words.

Without missing a beat, Dayna's eyes were filled with tears as she clung to his arm. "I told you l fell on my own, Jaxton. My head's spinning. Will you take me to the hospital now?"

On instinct, Jaxton gathered her in his arms and hurried out of sight.

As the pair disappeared, Amelia moved toward Wyatt, starting to thank him, then stopping herself. Instead,she said, "If you hadn't seen it, I would have been wrongly accused today."

She remembered him telling her not to thank him and changed her words.

Wyatt replied in a low voice, "I didn't see a thing."

For a second, confusion flashed across Amelia's face. "Then why did you speak up for me?"

"Because I believe you're telling the truth."

His trust shocked Amelia. Wyatt, barely more than a stranger to her, had chosen her side, while her own fiancé had never shown any faith in her innocence.

Considering Jaxton's actions, Amelia felt that marrying Wyatt would only make her life better. Still, she needed to confirm one thing.

"Mr. Stewart, can you promise me that once I end things with Jaxton, Marc will keep treating my grandmother?" she said.

Even though Wyatt had promised this before, she wasn't willing to take chances where her grandmother's health was concerned.

"I promise."

"Then I believe you."

Little did she know, Wyatt was the one who had arranged for Marc to accept the Morrisons' offer in the first place.Hearing his promise now, she felt a wave of relief.

"I'll also help you win back the Flynn Group's shares," Wyatt said.

Those words brought a flicker of surprise to Amelia's eyes. He seemed to know her heart better than most.

Those shares meant more than money to her; they were Katrina's legacy, rightfully hers.

Even without Wyatt's help, she was ready to fight for what was rightfully hers.

Wyatt's assurance gave her all the courage she needed to end things with Jaxton for good.

She had barely walked into her apartment when Jaxton's call came through, asking her to go to the hospital.

Dealing with Jaxton and Dayna was the last thing she wanted to do.

But...

"Amelia, think about your grandmother before you make any decisions," Jaxton said.

"I'll go," Amelia replied with a sigh.

Ending the call, she drove straight to Kretol City Hospital.

Inside the hospital room, Dayna played the part of the victim, while Jaxton hovered with anxious devotion. The instant Jaxton spotted Amelia, he said, "Say sorry to Dayna. Right now."

"You expect me to apologize to her?" Amelia asked.

Her stare brimmed with disbelief, as though she'd never heard anything so absurd before.

Seeing Amelia's expression, Jaxton frowned. "You pushed Dayna down the stairs. You should apologize to her."

With Jaxton focused on Amelia, Dayna's satisfaction glimmered in her eyes, just out of his view.

Without further argument, Amelia answered, "Alright. I'll apologize."

Her steps were unhurried as she moved closer to the bed.

When she reached Dayna, she raised her hand and slapped her.

The sharp smack echoed throughout the room.

Dayna and Jaxton froze for a moment, stunned, until Dayna finally let out a scream.

In an instant, Jaxton grabbed Amelia's wrist. "Have you lost your mind?"

Amelia didn't hesitate. Her other hand landed a stinging backhand across his face.

"Amelia!"

Jaxton's temper erupted, eyes blazing, as he reached for her again, but Amelia kicked him away before he could do anything to her.

"You wanted me to apologize. That is how I apologize. Are you satisfied now?" she said.
###Chapter 8 You Have No Right To Cancel It


Pain left Jaxton hunched on the floor while Amelia watched him with a cold, satisfied twist to her lips.

Taking a swing at him had lived in her mind for ages; finally, today, she'd let her fury loose.

Patience was never her strength, but she'd bottled up her temper for her grandmother's sake.

That restraint was gone now. She refused to play nice any longer.

"Jaxton, I'm done. Let's end our engagement," she said.

Dayna, halfway out of bed to help Jaxton up, froze at Amelia's words. A spark of hope lit up her face, but Jaxton's next move quickly put out any of her excitement.

Forgetting his own pain, Jaxton stood up, brushed Dayna aside, and closed the gap between himself and Amelia, grabbing her wrist.

Without warning, Jaxton shoved Amelia back against the wall near the door.

Rage flashed in his glare, burning with wounded pride.

He was indeed dissatisfied with her, but that didn't mean she had the right to leave him.

With a sneer, he mockingly said, "What makes you think you can just end things? Your mother's gone, and your father has never cared about you. Without the title of the future daughter-in-law of the Morrison family,you're nothing. Only I get to decide when we're over, not you."

Part of Amelia had always expected this response from him.

This man was hypocritical and arrogant, with a ridiculous sense of pride. The simple suggestion to call the engagement off had clearly pierced his pride.

Turning her gaze toward Dayna, Amelia kept her voice steady. "Let's be honest, you've never really wanted me. Calling off the engagement just means you can be with Dayna openly-" "Enough!" Jaxton, stung by her composure, interjected. "You want to make a scene, fine, but you'd better remember what you should and shouldn't say. Our future marriage is just a business move. If I don't say no,you have no right to cancel it. Do you understand?"

Arrogance sharpened every word he spoke.

Before she could react, he leaned in, his lips lowering until they hovered dangerously close to hers.

Even with pain searing through her arm, Amelia thrashed against Jaxton's grip, desperate to break free.When his lips hovered just above hers, she jerked her head away, voice sharp with outrage. "Have you lost your mind? This is a hospital, Jaxton! Or did you forget the woman you love is lying right there?"

Her biting words rolled off Jaxton, who only seemed intent on humiliating her.

Pinned against the wall, Amelia realized her legs were her only weapon.

Right as she prepared to drive her knee upward, the ward door flew open with a bang.

"This is a hospital, not a hotel. Try to behave accordingly."

Marc's gaze landed on Jaxton, dripping with disdain.

He continued, "Mr. Morrison, maybe your reputation doesn't mean much to you, but you still have to consider that some of us don't want to see something like this. Don't assume everyone else shares your shamelessness."

Marc let his gaze drift over to Dayna as he finished speaking.

Both Dayna and Jaxton flushed with embarrassment, but neither dared to retort.

There was more to Marc than just his fame as a skilled doctor. He was the heir to the powerful Chapman family.

"Miss Flynn, your injury needs attention. Allow me to treat you properly," Marc said to Amelia, gesturing for her to leave with him.

Walking quietly beside Marc toward his office, Amelia remained baffled by his unexpected kindness toward her.

Nevertheless, she was undeniably grateful for his timely assistance.

Observing him treating her injury, Amelia murmured a sincere thanks.

Just as her words faded, Marc responded bluntly,"You don't have to thank me. You're not the reason l stepped in to help."

Those words felt like a puzzle, leaving Amelia momentarily speechless.

Reading the confusion plainly on her face, Marc calmly added, "You'll understand one day."
###Chapter 9 You Really Shouldn't Put Up With Him Anymore


With a silent motion, Marc indicated Amelia should pull up her sleeve.

The marks left by Jaxton's grip were already blooming into deep, ugly bruises.

Since Amelia bruised so easily, her arm looked alarming.

Marc reached for a medical swab, dabbed on ointment, but then stopped midway. He shot a glance at Amelia's arm before standing up and walking out of the office.

Left behind in the room, Amelia stared after him, utterly baffled.

Before long, a nurse stepped inside to handle Amelia's treatment instead.

With her gaze fixed on the floor, Amelia didn't catch the surveillance camera pointed directly at her chair.

Meanwhile, at the Stewart Group, a video call ringtone echoed through the conference room, making everyone tense up.

Sitting at the head of the table, Wyatt glanced around coldly. "Isn't there a policy to keep all phones on silent during meetings? Who left their phone on?"

A sudden chill swept through the room as Wyatt's voice cut in, drawing lowered gazes and furtive glances from everyone present. Curiosity burned behind every stare, searching for the person bold enough to cross Wyatt.

Finally, every gaze landed on Davin.

Wyatt frowned slightly, and before he could speak, Davin hurriedly produced a yet-to-be-released phone."Mr. Stewart, it's your phone."

He placed it next to Wyatt and took a step back.

Marc's name flashed across the screen. Wyatt didn't hesitate; he ended the call in a blink. "Let's continue the meeting."

But the silence didn't last. A message notification sounded from his phone almost immediately.

Intent on ignoring it, Wyatt's attention snagged on the incoming image, and curiosity got the best of him.

The image expanded under his fingertips, revealing unmistakable bruises marring Amelia's arm.

People in the conference room noticed that Wyatt's expression turned cold in an instant.

***

Marc didn't make another appearance until after Amelia had left the hospital.

Amelia had wanted to ask him about her grandmother's situation, but the nurse had explained that Marc was swamped.Amelia could only leave disappointed.

"Amelia, over here!"

Stepping outside the hospital, Amelia spotted Carlee Larson waving at her from across the sidewalk. Carlee was one of the few close friends Amelia had.

The Larsons might not have had deep pockets, but as an only child, Carlee grew up surrounded by affection and learned to see the silver lining in everything.

Carlee's cheerful grin, paired with her youthful features, swept away the heaviness Amelia felt.

Smiling,Amelia made her way over.

The moment she got close, Carlee grabbed her by the arm, making her wince from the sudden sting.

Worry flickered across Carlee's face as she instantly released her grip. "Amelia, what's wrong?"

"It's nothing important," replied Amelia with a casual shrug. She tried to brush it off, but Carlee refused to let it go. That left her no choice but to roll up her sleeve and reveal the bruises.

Carlee's jaw clenched when she caught sight of Amelia's bruised arm. Her voice trembled with anger."So that's why you wanted me to come pick you up. Who hurt you? Was it Jaxton again? You really should up with him anymore, Amelia. He never deserved you, and you-"

"Don't worry about it. I'm done with him," Amelia interjected as she settled in the passenger seat.

This made Carlee pause as she was about to fasten her seatbelt. She turned to Amelia, eyes wide with excitement. "Wait-what do you mean? Is Jaxton calling off the engagement?"

"No, that's not it. I plan to call off the engagement myself," Amelia replied, her voice gentle but certain.

Because she knew Carlee would never let go of the subject, Amelia explained her new arrangement with Wyatt,though she kept his identity a secret. She didn't want to startle Carlee.

News of Amelia's decision to leave Jaxton had Carlee grinning ear to ear. But hearing there was someone else, Carlee's shock grew, and she reached up to check Amelia's forehead. "You don't have a fever, do you?This is so wild. I would have never imagined you would do something like this."

Not wanting Carlee to bombard her with questions endlessly, Amelia gently pulled her friend's hand away.She let out a tired sigh and asked her to start the car.

With Amelia urging her on, Carlee turned the key and drove off, but not toward Amelia's apartment. Instead,the car headed in the opposite direction.
###Chapter 10 Keep Your Hands Off Her


Looking at the club outside the car window, Amelia spoke to Carlee with a look of disbelief. "Why did you bring me to a club?"

"There's only one reason people go to clubs-to forget their troubles for a while and have some fun."Dragging Amelia out of the car, Carlee swept them through the entrance. "You really have rotten luck, you know. Bad day after bad day. But luckily, you still have me, and I plan to make you very happy tonight."

Amelia could not deny that life with Jaxton would turn into pure chaos.

But when she thought about Wyatt, Amelia believed he would never add to her problems.

That thought flickered through her mind just as Carlee swept her into a private room.

Determined to lift her friend's spirits, Carlee called over a handful of striking men from the club to join them.

Soon,Amelia found herself at the center of attention, encircled by charming faces. Carlee seized the microphone and announced, "Gentlemen, whoever brings a smile to my friend's face tonight is in for a generous treat!"

Everyone at the club knew Carlee never hesitated to spend big.

The reward she dangled wasn't small change; it was at least one hundred thousand dollars.

Her offer sent the men flocking to Amelia's side.

"You've spent two years as Jaxton's fiancée, and you've suffered a lot because of that.Since you're ending your engagement, you can finally relax and have fun now." Carlee leaned in and handed a glass of wine into Amelia's hand. "I snuck this wine out from my dad's private stash only for you. Enjoy it."

Grateful for Carlee's good intentions and still carrying a weight of frustration because of Jaxton, Amelia accepted the wine.

She forgot,however, that it had been ages since she last drank, and before long, a dizzy spell washed over her.

Carlee noticed Amelia's dazed expression and quickly ushered the men away. "You all right,Amelia?"

"My head's spinning a bit."

"Feeling dizzy? Don't worry; I'll get you home right away."

With one arm around Amelia, Carlee led her out of the room, only to see her friend's eyes flutter shut.Amelia was clearly drunk.

Seeing Amelia in this state, Carlee began to regret her decision to bring Amelia here today.

Considering the recent scandal involving the Morrison Group, Carlee feared Jaxton might give Amelia even more trouble if he found out about this. She quickly decided to slip her out the back.

At the rear entrance, the elevator was usually off-limits. This time, as Carlee approached with Amelia, it slid open.

Carlee believed fortune seemed to be smiling on her this time.

Just then, Wyatt stepped out of the elevator, the heavy scent of alcohol hitting his senses. A frown appeared on his face, and distaste flashed in his eyes.

Davin rushed forward and planted himself as a barrier before Wyatt.

Leaning heavily against Carlee, Amelia let her hair drape over her face, so Davin didn't recognize her.

The moment Carlee made her way to the elevator with Amelia, Davin said, "Excuse me, that elevator isn't open to everyone.Please choose another one."

With her attention fixed on Amelia, Carlee hadn't even noticed anyone approach until she found her path blocked.Nearly losing her balance with Amelia in tow, she felt her temper flare. "Whether it's private or not,this is still a club. You think you own the elevator?"

Without another word, she pressed forward, determined to get inside.

Watching her push past, Davin furrowed his brows. Wyatt alone used this private elevator, not just for the club but for the entire building.

Additional protests formed on his lips, but Wyatt interjected, his voice already tight with impatience, "Get security here.Now."

Realizing that Wyatt's patience was wearing thin, Davin quickly called the security team.

It didn't take long before the security team arrived.

Carlee spotted a few familiar faces in the security team since she had been here often, but she was shocked by the captain's sudden respectful posture toward Davin.

"Mr. Kirk, how can I help you? Oh, Mr.Stewart..."

The captain at first assumed Davin was here on his own. However, when he caught sight of Wyatt, his composure shifted in a heartbeat.

He barely managed a greeting before Davin interjected, "Make these two leave. And make sure nobody gets near this elevator from now on."

Hearing the order, the captain barked at his team, "Why are you all still standing there? Get them to leave.Now."

Being manhandled by staff was a slap in the face for Carlee, who was used to getting her way. As soon as one guard reached for Amelia, Carlee snapped, swatting his hand aside and yelling,"Try it,and you'll regret it!"

That threat made the security crew pause and glance at their boss. With no response from him, they grew even rougher.

Things escalated quickly, and Amelia stumbled, nearly crashing to the floor.

Carlee was furious and anxious, almost in tears, when a clear, cool voice said, "Stop."

Instantly, every guard froze in place. As Carlee's confusion mounted, she suddenly felt Amelia pulled from her side. Wyatt had swept Amelia up, cradling her in his arms with her flushed cheeks catching the ligh Wyatt's gaze turned deep as he took in the sight of Amelia like this.

The scene terrified Carlee, and she quickly approached Wyatt.

Bathed in the bar's lights, Amelia's beauty could silence a crowd. Even Carlee, who'd seen her countless times, felt enchanted.

So,Carlee's first thought was that Wyatt had taken a liking to Amelia.

That realization landed on her like a blow. What kind of mess had she stirred up now?

Anxious, Carlee rolled up her sleeves and exclaimed, "Keep your hands off her!"
###Chapter 11| Know You're Awake


Davin's hand shot out, stopping Carlee before she could even reach Wyatt.

Wyatt wasted no time, already carrying Amelia into the elevator.

When the doors slid shut, Carlee's eyes shimmered with tears. Everything felt as though it was collapsing around her.

Davin, perhaps moved by the sadness etched across her face, softened his tone as he said to her, "There's no need to worry. Mr. Stewart will take care of Miss Flynn."

"I don't need him to take care of her. I can watch over my own friend!" Carlee snapped,her voice sharp even though she knew that Davin worked for a powerful man.

Davin shrugged off her words without a second thought. After releasing Carlee, he turned to wait for the elevator to follow Wyatt.

***


In the underground parking lot.

Davin arrived in time to see Wyatt carefully settle Amelia inside his car. He couldn't hide his surprise.

For five years, Davin had worked with Wyatt and understood better than most that the man had a notorious obsession with cleanliness.Hardly anyone, no matter how familiar, had ever riddenin Wyatt's car,much less someone who was drunk.

Yet Amelia, wo was drunk, had not only gotten into Wyatt's car but was also nestled in his arms now.

Amelia hadn't been this drunk in a long while. Her head throbbed, and the world spun, but a clean, cool scent drifted over her and helped her relax, drawing her closer to it.

Looking down, Wyatt noticed how Amelia clung to him. A flash of surprise flickered in his eyes, replaced almost instantly with a gentleness. Davin, watching the scene as he got closer, couldn't hide his astonishment at Wyatt's sudden tenderness.Still, he steadied himself and said, "Mr. Stewart, Mr. Jenkins is still waiting for you in the private room.ShouldI-"

"Call Marc. Tell him to meet me at Hillside Villa quickly," Wyatt said before Davin could finish, waving the driver to start the car.

That instruction sent a jolt through Davin. He remembered all too well the threats Wyatt had faced in the past. He thought that Wyatt was feeling unwell after being drugged or something; that was why he had asked him to call Marc over. Wasting no time, he dialed Marc's number. "Mr. Chapman, something happened to Mr. Stewart. Head to Hillside Vila now!"

***


Hillside Villa stretched across a hill on the eastern edge of Kretol, its grounds sprawling far and wide.

Automatic gates swung open as Wyatt's car rolled to a stop at the entrance.

Hearing the car, Kurt Lewis hurried out to greet Wyatt and opened the car door. "Mr. Stewart... Who is this young woman?"

Having served the Stewart family for decades, Kurt had practically watched Wyatt grow up.

Most people never dared to ask Wyatt personal questions, but Kurt could get away with it every now and then.

Wyatt ignored the question and told Kurt to have thestaff prepare the east master bedroom.

Kurt,thrilled by the news, dashed back into the house. He wanted to tell Wyatt's mother that her son had finally brought someone home and that she no longer needed to worry about his marriage issues.

Meanwhile, Wyatt climbed the stairs with Amelia resting quietly in his arms. He set her down on the bed with care, not waking her up.

He reached for the blanket, but before he could pull it over her, the door burst open with a bang. "Why did you call me over in such a panic? Did you get hurt? You-" Marc, out of breath and still wearing his doctor's coat, hurried in. The wordsfroze on his tongue when he saw Amelia.

"She's had too much to drink tonight. Could you check on her?" Wyatt said.

Marc felt both resigned and angry. "So let me get this straight, you called me here just to check on Amelia?"

Wyatt didn't get the chance to explain. Marc continued, "Do you know that I just finished a surgery. The moment I heard something might've happened to you, I hurried over. And now, you're telling me it's only to check on someone drunk. You are so-"

"That research project of yours could use funding, right? I'll wire one hundred million.If things go well,there might be more," said Wyatt from the sofa, breaking into Marc's rant before he could finish speaking.

That promise of investment made Marc's annoyance melt away, and his eyes lit up. Still, he paused as he glanced over at Amelia lying on the bed. "Most of my equipment comes from overseas. A hundred million is just the start. Could you give me more... No, never mind. I'll make it work. I shouldn't complain."

With one stern look from Wyatt, Marc immediately bit back any further protest.

Then,he made his way to Amelia's side. While he listened to her breathing, his eyes sparkled with interest."Honestly, Miss Flynn looks just fine to me."

After he finished speaking, Marc packed his things and prepared to leave. Wyatt, still settled on the sofa,watched this with a hint of surprise.

Suddenly,Wyatt realized something, and he found himself glancing at Amelia.

Amelia, even though she kept her eyes shut, could feel someone watching her. Warmth spread across her face as she lay there, perfectly still.

Marc couldn't help but chuckle at the scene, sharing a quick look with Wyatt before he stepped out of the room.

Silence enveloped the room, and Amelia lay rigid on the bed.

She had regained consciousness when Kurt spoke earlier, but she did notdare open her eyes. Her mind raced. She'd been out drinking with Carlee. Why was she here with Wyatt now?

How could Wyatt have caught her in such a drunken state?

Now,she was at a loss as to how to face Wyatt.

Would he change his mind about marrying her? Maybe seeing her like this would make him reconsider the matter.

While she wrestled with her thoughts, a gentle laugh filled the room. "You're not fooling anyone. I know you're awake. Why not just open your eyes?" Wyatt said.
###Chapter 12 I Just Want You To Be Yourself


Wyatt's words shattered any chance Amelia had at pretending to sleep.

She opened her eyes, and the first thing she saw was the amusement in his gaze.

That look chased away most of her nerves, and a bashful feeling crept up on her out of nowhere.

Every time Wyatt's eyes lingered on her, she found herself squirming. Instinctively, she pushed herself upright, but the world spun wildly, nearly sending her tumbling out of bed.

Before she could fall, his urgent warning, "Watch out!" reached her ears, and his steady hands caught her just in time.

Helping her settle upright, Wyatt looked at her pale face, concern flickering in his expression.

Reaching for his phone, he said, "Stay still. I'm getting the doctor."

"Don't! That's not necessary!"

Humiliation already burned inside her after everything Wyatt had seen. She couldn't bear for anyone else to witness her like this.

Her urgent words made Wyatt pause, and he set the phone aside without another word.

A hush swept through the room, stretching out between them.

Wyatt settled on the sofa close by, while Amelia, pressed against the headboard, picked up a trace of that clean, familiar scent she'd noticed before.

"You..."

Both Amelia and Wyatt spoke at the same time. Wyatt stopped short and gave her a small nod, signaling her to speak first.

Remembering every foolish detail from earlier, Amelia shrank under his gaze and stared down at the covers. "I'm sorry for everything tonight. If you're having second thoughts about marrying me, l-"

"Mr. Stewart, the soup's done. Should I come in?"

Before Amelia couldfinish, Kurt's voice rang out from outside the door.

Wyatt voiced his permission. Kurt walked in, set the bowl down quietly, and slipped out again, not meeting anyone's eyes.

No one saw the smile stretching across Kurt's face as he closed the door behind him.

Kurt's sudden appearance left Amelia at a loss, her words drying up as Wyatt's face grew serious. She couldn't find the courage to speak again.

Without warning,Wyatt lifted the bowl and gently brought a spoonful of soup close to her lips.

Caught off guard by his gesture, Amelia instinctively tried to take the bowl herself, but he smoothly moved it away from her grasp. "You're still not feeling well. Let me feed you."

Hlis voice was as gentle as ever, yet his tone was firm.

Even as he spoke, he held the spoon steady, waiting for her to comply.

Seeing his resolve, Amelia soon stopped resisting and parted her lips to accept the soup.

With every sip, she noticed her head clearing; whether it was because of the warmth of the soup or her body slowly regaining strength, she didn't know.

As soon as the bowl was empty, Wyatt set it aside, then fixed her with a steady look. "What are you sorry for?"

Whatever calm Amelia had regained vanished, replaced by a rush of anxiety.

There would have been some comfort if he had sounded angry or upset. But the gentleness in his voice rattled her more than a sharp accusation ever could.

If Jaxton had witnessed her in such a state tonight, he would undoubtedly have humiliated her. So, Amelia's first instinct with Wyatt was that he would despise her for this. After all, in high society, people cared about appearances above all else.

However, Wyatt hadn't criticized her once. He simply took care of her, every action careful and considerate.

As the silence stretched between them, Wyatt waited, not rushing her for a response.

After a few moments, Amelia took a slow breath and met his gaze. "Everything that happened today is my fault."

Finishing her admission, she dropped her eyes and fidgeted with her fingers, unable to hide her nerves.

Wyatt caught the anxious fidget, a small smile breaking through his serious face. "There's nothing to apologize for. You didn't do anythig wrong."

He paused briefly. "Even if you do make mistakeslater on, there's no need to apologize. No matter what happens, I'll be there for you."

Though his promise could have sounded too sweet, Wyatt delivered it with the quiet seriousness of a news report.

It was this sincerity that assured Amelia he meant every word.

His words only made her firmer about marrying him.

She believed this man was indeed different from Jaxton.

As their conversation wound its way to this moment, Amelia saw no reason to bring up ending their arrangement anymore.

Since Wyatt had shown his sincerity, she felt it was right to make her stance clear,too.

Fixing her gaze on him, she said with honest resolve, "You don't have to worry. Nothing likethis will happen again. Once we're married, I'll respect your boundaries, do my best to be a proper wife, and make sure your reputation stays intact."

This was the basic principle she held for marrying Wyatt, one she believed she should uphold. Still, something in Wyatt's eyes-those drawn brows and that subtle frown-hinted that he wasn't pleased with her words.

Pausing for a breath, Amelia tried again."And if there's anything else you want from me, just tell me. I'll do everything I can to-"

"There's only one thing I'll ever ask from you," Wyatt said in a low voice before she could finish. "I just want you to be yourself. That's all I ask. Even after we marry, I want you to live the way you want and do whatever makes you happy."

Hearing Wyatt's words, Amelia was taken aback.

From the moment she was engaged to Jaxton, everyone had told her to remember her place, to do nothing that would tarnish the Morrison family name, and never to embarrass Jaxton.

Yet here was a man of higher status than Jaxton, telling her to be herself.

That realization sent a wave of warmth through her chest, and she couldn't help but smile at Wyatt. "Mr.
Stewart, I'll remember what you said."

From now on, she would be herself.

When Wyatt saw the smile on her face,his expression softened.

This, he thought, was the Amelia he knew.
###Chapter 13 Meeting Her Future Mother-in-law


"Where is she? Where's my future daughter-in-law?"

The unexpected swing of the door sent a jolt through Amelia.

Turning around, she spotted a woman whose elegance was impossible to ignore.

One look at those refined features told Amelia everything she needed to know; Wyatt's strong resemblance to the woman was undeniable. The woman was clearly his mother.

Amelia had imagined countless scenarios of meeting her future mother-in-law, but never had she thought it would be like this.

Without any hesitation, the woman, Della Stewart, swept across the floor and caught Amelia's hand. "You have no idea how long I've been waiting for you."

Excitement glowed on Della's face, and her grip was so warm and certain that Amelia felt like she had suddenly become someone precious.

Della truly believed Amelia was precious.

With Wyatt nearing his late twenties and showing zero interest in romance for years, her hope for grandchildren had nearly faded. She had coaxed and pleaded for him to meet women, but he would not budge.

Irritated by her persistence, he had even left for another country before.

But just when her patience had all but run out, a sudden call from Kurt changed everything.He told her Wyatt had finally brought a woman home.

That tiny spark of hope had jolted her into action. She had rushed over.

Earlier, she worried that Kurt's news was just wishful thinking.Meeting Amelia-so poised and graceful-wiped away all her doubts. Her son had finally brought someone home, and what a lovely surprise his choice turned out to be. The joy inside Della felt impossible to contain.

Amelia could hardly meet Della's eager gaze without growing more self-conscious by the minute.

She wondered if Della discovered the truth, that she held the title of Jaxton's fiancée, would she still be so warm toward her?

Worry flickered in Amelia's eyes as she pondered that thought.

Suddenly, a gentle hand grasped hers, removing her from Della's grip.

"Please calm down, Mom. You're making her nervous!"

Wyatt's words nearly provoked Della into snapping at him.

Yet, one look at Amelia, who seemed pale as a sheet, stopped Della in her tracks. She immediately felt a pang of guilt. She didn't want to scare away her future daughter-in-law.

Her tone softened in an instant. "What's your name?"

Amelia realized she couldn't hide her identity anymore.

Wyatt,picking up on the unease growing in Amelia, knew what she was thinking and wanted to comfort her.

Yet before he could get a word in, Amelia softly said, "Mrs. Stewart, my name is Amelia Flynn. I'm the daughter of the Flynn family."

"The Flynn family?"

While the Flynns held some standing in Kretol, their power couldn't match that of the Stewarts.

Realization dawned on Della as she pieced together Amelia's identity.

A subtle shift came over her expression.

Amelia's anxiety grew when she noticed that. Her hands balled into fists without her even noticing.

Surely,once her connection to Jaxton came to light, she would be shown the door by the Stewart family. Bracing for harsh words, Amelia was startled instead by the sharp sound of a slap. She glanced up in surprise.

With a quick swing, Della had landed a slap on Wyatt's arm and scolded him, "Did you seduce her just because sheis pretty?"

Neither Amelia nor Wyatt had expected such a gesture, leaving them both speechless.

Before he could gather himself, Wyatt found Della's hand landing again and again on his arm.

He caught hold of Della's hand, a flush rising to his cheeks. "Please, Mom. That's enough."

Wyatt sounded resigned, his embarrassment clear. Amelia had never seen him this flustered before.

For the first time, she saw that beneath Wyatt's usual composure, there was room for awkwardness and vulnerability.

Once Wyatt blocked her next move, Della dropped her hand and flashed a warm, welcoming smile at Amelia.The motherly affection returned; she looked nothing like the person who had just been hitting Wyatt.

"Amelia, it's clear to me that Wyatt must have been the one who seduced you. I won't claim he is perfect,but he certainly outshines anyone from the Morrison family. When it comes to talent and looks, he truly has no equal. But what I'm proudest of is that he is reserved and principled. You'll never catch him being unfaithful.He's also a virgi-"

"Mom!"

Wyatt's urgent interruption cut through the room. His tone was a little sharper than usual.

Della was startled by his sudden interruption.

She narrowed her eyes, clearly displeased. "What's the matter with you? There's no need to raise your voice like that."

"Miss Flynn needs some time to herself. She's not feeling her best, so we should let her rest," Wyatt said.

Every fiber of Della's being wanted to stay, but hearing that Amelia was unwell made her decide to leave. Still, as she reached the door, she turned back to Amelia and said, "Amelia, Wyatt really is good. Besides being slightly older, he's quite perfect for-"

Wyatt's expression clouded at that. He quickly crossed the room, gently pushed her out, and shut the door,locking it behind him.

With Della finally gone, an awkward silence lingered in the room.

Breaking the silence, Wyatt said, "It's getting late. You can stay here tonight. I'll take you home tomorrow morning."

Amelia offered a gentlenod in reply.

Returning to his calm composure, Wyatt reminded her to get some rest before quietly leaving the room.

So much had happened tonight.

Once the door clicked shut, Amelia finally let out the breath she'd been holding.

The bed felt like a cloud beneath her, but sleep stubbornly stayed away.

Thoughts of Wyatt and Della drifted through her mind, filling her with a sense of hope.

Maybe, just maybe, fate would be kinder to her than it had been to her mother.
###Chapter 14 Wyatt Is The Man Amelia Is About To Marry


Amelia awoke abruptly, startled by the sound of muffled sobbing.

Lifting her heavy eyelids, she saw Carlee beside her, eyes rimmed with red.

Without waiting for Amelia to speak, Carlee threw herself into her friend's arms and clung to her tightly."Amelia, I thought something terrible had happened to you...

Surviving the long, anxious night had taken everything Carlee had.

Ever since Wyatt had taken Amelia away, dread had crept in; she had been so worried about Amelia. She had even considered asking for the Morrison family for help.

But the memory of Jaxton's shameless behavior made her abandon that idea.

Determined to do something, Carlee spent the entire night calling in every favor and investigating the identity of the man who had taken Amelia away.

At last, she discovered that the man was Wyatt and felt despair settle over her.

For someone like her, the Stewart family felt worlds away. Her family's influence was nothing compared to theirs, and nobody she knew could get in touch with Wyatt.

So,she had stubbornly planted herself at the gates of Hillside Villa until sunrise.

She vowed that if Amelja didn't emerge safely by dawn, she'd immediately call the police.

When Davin arrived to deliver documents to Wyatt, he immediately spotted Carlee at the entrance.

Recognizing Davin instantly, Carlee seized his arm and refused to let go until he agreed to help. With Wyatt's reluctant approval, Davin finally brought her inside.

Only when Carlee laid eyes on Amelia did she feel a sense of relief.

"Hey, calm down. I'm okay," Amelia said soothingly, gently rubbing Carlee's back as she felt the genuine panic in her friend's embrace.

Gradually, Carlee regained her composure.

After handing Amelia her phone, Carlee asked, "Amelia, why did Wyatt bring you here? Has he taken a liking to you?"

Amelia barely had a chance to answer before Carlee continued speaking, her worries tumbling out. Concern flickered in her gaze as she looked at Amelia.

"You haven't even managed to officially end things with Jaxton yet, and you're already planning to marry someone else. Now, if Wyatt suddenly takes an interest in you as well, how on earth will you live your life peacefully in Kretol?"

Carlee had no idea Wyatt was the very man Amelia intended to marry; just imagining the potential gossip and ridicule Amelia might endure was enough to bring fresh tears to her eyes.

When Amelia finally confessed that Wyatt was the man she was about to marry, Carlee went completely still in shock.

Without hesitation, she reached over to feel Amelia's forehead. "You're not running a fever, so why are you talking nonsense?"

Carlee's reaction had Amelia bursting into laughter.

Her grip tightened on Carlee's hand as she explained, "I didn't mention it to you sooner because I thought you'd freak out."

"You're serious? Wyatt is actually going to marry you?" Carlee asked.

Seeing Amelia nod, Carlee let out an excited shriek.

In her delight, Carlee lunged for a hug, but Amelia moved, dodging her embrace.

Excitement practically danced in Carlee's eyes. "I can't believe my luck! If Wyatt becomes your husband,nobody in Kretol will dare mess with you.I'll benefit from this, too!" Carlee's excitement couldn't be contained.

Once the thrill wore off, her playful side returned in full force.

Snuggling up beside Amelia, she grinned mischievously."Spill it-did anything wild happen last night? Tell me,how are Wyatt's skills in bed?"

The question took Amelia a moment to process. Then, her face grew hot with embarrassment.

Carlee's laughter turned teasing when she saw Amelia blush. "He might look cold, but men like that usually surprise you in bed. Tell me I'm right!"

Amelia finally couldn't take it anymore and pinched Carlee's arm. "Stop talking nonsense!"

"How am I talking nonsense? Are you telling me nothig happened between you two last night? I refuse to believe-"

Locking eyes with Amelia, Carlee let her words trail off. She gaped, disbelief coloring her voice. "Wait,nothing really happened last night?"

Seeing how unruffled Amelia looked, Carlee felt her confusion grow until a wild thought dawned on her. Her eyes went wide.

With a gasp, she blurted out, "Amelia, do you think that Wyatt is unableto perform in bed?"
###Chapter 15 I've Finally Figured It Out


Amelia was halfway out of bed when those words hit her, nearly sending her tumbling to the floor.

Quick reflexes saved her-she grabbed the edge of the nightstand just in time, steadying herself before she could fall.

Carlee said, "Amelia, I've finally figured it out."

Amelia, about to speak and hearing Carlee's words, felt resigned and could only open her mouth to ask,"What have you figured out?"

A thoughtful frown marked Carlee's face. "I kept wondering what would make Wyatt want to marry you.Don't get me wrong; you're smart, gorgeous, and in amazing shape. But just being incredible isn't enough to hook a guy like Wyatt."

With his family's status, Wyatt could have his pick from a whole parade of stunning women.

The line of volunteers for his affection could probably stretch from his driveway all the way to the city center.

Carlee's theory only grew firmer in her mind. "There's only one explanation-Wyatt must have problems in the bedroom!"

Suddenly, the earlier excitement drained from Carlee's eyes, replaced with pity. "Amelia, you should think about this more carefully. Marriage is for life. Tying yourself to Wyatt means giving up any hope for passion,and you can't cheat on him. You'll be stuck with zero physical satisfaction for life."

Initially,Amelia had thought Carlee was just spouting nonsense, but by the end of her analysis, even she began to believe her a little.

The truth was, Amelia couldn't fathom Wyatt's reason to want to marry her, either. It hardly seemed likely that the debt for saving his life could be the reason. Plus, thinking back on every encounter, Amelia realized W/yatt was always polite, never once overstepping boundaries when he was with her.

Still, it was exactly that careful courtesy that left Amelia wondering if Carlee's theory was true.

"Take last night, for instance. Even I felt something watching you like that; you are captivating," Carlee admitted. "But a man like Wyatt can remain so composed? That definitely says something."

Meanwhile, out in the hallway, Davin silently wished he could block out every word drifting through the door.

His eyes flicked toward Wyatt, who was standing beside him.

Wyatt caught the odd look. Instantly, Davin snapped his gaze away. He then rapped his knuckles against the door, determined to put a stop to the conversation inside.

The sound of the knock snapped the exchange to an abrupt halt.

When Wyatt entered the room, both women looked uneasy, especially Carlee, who felt Wyatt's gaze was far colder toward her than the night before.

Even with Hillside Villa's thick walls, Carlee's voice had found a way to pierce through. Wyatt had heard what she had said.

Looking at Amelia, Wyatt said, "I've brought in a team of specialists for your grandmother and asked Marc to oversee her treatment. You'll need to meet with him at the hospital totalk to him about her treatment plan."

The efficiency stunned Amelia. She hadn't expected Wyatt to move so fast.

Relief and gratitude flooded her face,and she forgot about Carlee's earlier words completely.

Amelia's eyes lit up. "I'Il go to the hospital right away!"

Wyatt shook his head gently. "There's no need to rush. Breakfast is ready. Let's eat before going."

Although her instinct was to skip the meal, Amelia reconsidered the idea. For Wyatt's sake, she agreed to sit down and eat with him first.

With Carlee whisked away by Davin, only Amelia and Wyatt remained at the table.
Amelia's mind was miles away, tangled with worry over MMichelle's treatment, so she didn't notice that the table was filled with her favorite dishes.

Perched atop the mountain, Hillside Villa was isolated-grabbing a cab here was out of the question.

Only when she finally slipped into Wyatt's car, the cool leather and silence wrapping around her, did she feel her mind settle in peace.

This sudden calmness brought Carlee's earlier speculation rushing back to her.

Was there really any truth to what Carlee had hinted at-that Wyatt was incapable in bed?

Even if he was, Amelia realized she didn't mind. The marriage had given her much more than she'd expected already.

Sill, as the car glided down the winding drive, she found her gaze drifting to Wyatt's certain area.

Unbeknownst to her,Wyatt noticed it. A vein in his temple twitched as he caught her glance.
###Chapter 16 That's A Lie


The sleek car rolled to a gentle halt at the front of the hospital. The driver stepped out first and opened the door for Amelia.

Amelia offered Wyatt a quick goodbye, slung her bag over her shoulder, and climbed out of the back seat.The vehicle slipped out of sight as she lingered for a moment. Then, she turned and started for the hospital entrance.

Hardly a second passed before a hand clamped around her wrist. Jaxton's voice, sharp with accusation,rang out close to her ear. "Amelia, you're sneaking around with another man now?"

Dayna was being discharged today, and Jaxton had come here to pick her up.

Catching Amelia with another man was the last thing he had expected.

Seeing the easy smile on Amelia's face as she exited the car, Jaxton felt his jaw tighten.He could not remember the last time she had smiled at him like that.

That car might not have stood out to most people, but Jaxton recognized it at once. Only a handful could afford that model, which had not even reached the public yet.

Jaxton often imagined owning that model himself, though he understood it was out of reach for someone like him.

Watching Amelia step out of a car that rare left his hands trembling with anger and his vision clouded with jealousy.

Nervousness flickered in Amelia's eyes. Rather than feeling fear, she had the awkward realization that she and Jaxton had yet to end their engagement. The idea of Wyatt being dragged into unnecessary trouble unsettled her.

Yet Jaxton mistook the look in her eyes for shame. He asked, "Who was that man?"

Without waiting for an answer, Jaxton continued, "When have you sunk so low? Did you really think landing a wealthy old man meant you could just toss our engagement aside? Amelia, you have no shame. I-"

Amelia cut him off, voice steady, retorting, "Watch your mouth!"

With a burst of anger, she tore her wrist free from Jaxton's grip and delivered a stinging slap to his cheek.

Insulting her was one thing, but she would not tolerate any disrespect toward Wyatt.

Seeing the confrontation, Dayna hurried to Jaxton's side, only for him to brush her off with a harsh glare.He then said to Amelia in anger, "So now you are flaunting your new man and think you can lay a hand on me?Don't test me, Amelia. I will ruin that man easily!"

Casting a cold look at Dayna, Amelia said with contempt, "How about taking a long look in the mirror before hurling accusations at me? Just so you know, I helped cover up your last scandal. If you cause trouble again,don't expect me to help you."

She vowed she would never help him again.

Jaxton's features tightened after he heard her words; the fire in his eyes quickly snuffed out. Even so, he refused to let the matter go.

He tried again, warning her, "You'd better remember your grandmother's still a patient here. Do you think l 

Amelia cut him off, her voice cool and firm, saying, "My grandmother's treatment is no longer your concern."

Those words hit Jaxton like a slap, leaving him speechless. He had always relied on using Amelia's grandmother to control her, but now, the tactic failed for the first time.

He panicked for a moment, but then, he quickly composed himself, convinced that the old man Amelia was involved with must have given her the confidence to be like this.

Wearing a smug grin, he said, "Don't fool yourself, Amelia. Only Marc has the skills to treat your grandmother. The man you are involved with can't buy Marc's help. Marc will never agree to-" Interrupting him again, Amelia's voice held no room for doubt. "Marc has already agreed to be my grandmother's attending physician and will oversee all her future treatments."

Her certainty left Jaxton reeling; he was unable to believe what he had just heard.

How could this be possible?

Securing Marc's medical expertise was nearly impossible. Even when Marc had agreed to help the Morrison family, it had been merely because he had felt like it.

In Jaxton's mind, Marc managing ongoing care for Amelia's grandmother was impossible.

Holding onto his conviction, Jaxton blurted out, "That's a lie!"

Amelia, tired of him, saw no point in arguing. She prepared to step past him, only to see a familiar nurse making her way over-the same nurse who had once treated her injuries.

The nurse offered a pleasant smile. "Miss Flynn, Dr. Chapman has asked for you. Let me walk you to his office."

"Let's go," Amelia said as she followed the nurse.

Left behind, Dayna leaned in and said to Jaxton, "Turns out her new man really has pull. He managed to get Marc to take her grandmother's care."

Jaxton's lips curled in derision. "Marc's ego is legendary. He never listens to anyone, not even the Flynn family. There's no way her rich lover managed to convince Marc to treat her grandmother."

To Jaxton, the nurse's appearance was just part of Amelia's ruse. He felt certain that before long, Amelia would come crawling back to him, desperate for his help.
###Chapter 17 The Payment


No sooner had Amelia settled into the chair across from Marc's desk than he passed her a folder filled with documents.

"My team and I have put together this treatment outline," said Marc, his tone measured. "Go through it. If it meets your approval, we'll begin Mrs. Davis' treatment right away."

Taking the thick stack of treatment plans in her hands, Amelia offered a word of thanks, then quickly began scanning the pages.

Every aspect of Michelle's care had been considered, from initial procedures to each step of rehabilitation after surgery.

Wyatt's efforts to bring Marc onto the case already put Amelia at ease, and seeing the thoroughness of the treatment plan gave her even greater comfort.

Once she finished reviewing the file, she raised her gaze, her gratitude evident. "Dr. Chapman, I've read through everything. I have complete faith in you. I trust that you'll heal my grandmother."

Marc waved away her praise, shifting his weight in his seat. "I appreciate your trust, but I need you to understand something. No doctor can promise a perfect outcome. I'll give my all for treating her, but surgery always involves risks, and I can't guarantee her recovery."

His commitment was unwavering, especially for Wyatt's sake, but even the best physician could not control everything.

Amelia,more aware than anyone of her grandmother's frail health,listened carefully.

Marc's honesty did not rattle her. She said, "I understand everything you've said, Dr. Chapman. Rest assured, I am prepared to face any outcome."

A trace of sorrow clouded her features as she spoke. Long years in medicine had made Marc almost immune to the grief of people. Yret as he studied her expression, his voice softened in reassurance. "Try not to lose hope so quickly. I am a skilled doctor, after all. Miss Flynn, you can believe in me a little more."

Marc's packed schedule allowed little time for small talk, so once they finalized the treatment dates,Amelia readied herself to leave.Before she could step through the doorway, a sudden thought made her pause.

Every medical detail had been addressed, but a vital piece was missing-the cost of the treatment had not been discussed.

A surge of worry swept over Amelia, prompting her to turn around. "Dr. Chapman,could you tell me what expenses I should expect for my grandmother's treatment?"

In the past, the Morrison family had always picked up the bills for her grandmother's treatment.

Now that she was determined to end things with Jaxton, continuing to rely on the Morrison family's money was no longer an option.

But her personal finances felt stretched thin.

Holding sixty percent of Morrison Group's shares sounded impressive, but until she got married, those shares were only symbolic-she had no access to real funds.

Marc reassured her, "You can set your mind at ease. Mrs. Davis' treatment has already been paid for."

He had received a hundred million dollars from Wyatt, after all.

And Wyatt might give him more as the treatment progressed, and the prospect left Marc more than a little thrilled.

Without needing to ask, Amelia knew who had taken care of the bills-Wyatt.

Not only had Wyatt arranged for Marc's involvement and a specialized team, but he had also covered every expense,leaving Amelia overwhelmed with gratitude. She had never imagined he would handle it all like this without mentioning anything to her.

Jaxton, on the other hand, had made a habit of reminding her how much he had spent on Michelle's treatments.

Jaxton paying for her grandmother's treatment was part of wwhy she had endured him endlessly.

Meanwhile,Wyatt had gone above and beyond for her, never seeking thanks or recognition.

Stepping out of the hospital, Amelia weighed whether to call Wyatt and tell him that she would pay her back,but she felt the gesture felt hollow and forced.

Just then, her thoughts were cut short by the sudden buzz of her phone.

Recognition of the incoming number chilled her mood in an instant, but habit had her pressing the answer button.

On the other end of the line, a man spoke, his tone brooking no argument. "You need to come home today."

Even though they were on the phone, Amelia could sense Ricky's dissatisfaction toward her.

Little hope remained in her heart for any warmth from her father, but the ache of detecting his dislike toward her still lingered.

She kept silent, prompting Ricky's irritation to spike. "Amelia, did you hear me?" he snapped.

Choosing her words carefully, she replied, "What's it about?"

Memories of old wounds kept her from calling him "Dad."

Blood ties were hard to ignore, though. No matter how she tried, she couldn't completely cut him off.Besides, her late mother's things were still in the Flynn family's house.

As usual, Ricky kept his reasons hidden, repeating only that she must return home, even resorting to threats.

Fed up, Amelia finally agreed, hanging up with a blank expression.

She wondered why her father, who hadn't reached out to her in a long time, suddenly insisted on seeing her now.
###Chapter 18 Are You Trying To Drive Me Mad


Inside the Flynn family estate.

As soon as Ricky ended his call, Janessa offered him the cup she had been holding. After he accepted it,she slipped around the sofa and began massaging his shoulders with practiced hands.

Once she felt him relax, Janessa spoke up, her words soft and deliberate. "You really ought to have a serious word with Amelia. She's on the verge of marrying the son of the Morrison family now. Her behavior reflects on all of us-not just the Flynn family, but the Morrison family, too. If she keeps mixing with unsavory company,what will they think of us? The Morrisons might believe we've failed to raise her properly. If they start to doubt us and decide against future business, it will affect our company."

Janessa had been with Ricky for over twenty years and knew him better than anyone.

His reputation mattered more to him than anything, even if it meant putting up a false front.

Hearing Janessa's words, Ricky remained silent, simply slamming the cup down in anger, causing coffee to spill onto the table.

Seeing this, Janessa didn't say another word and instead gave Dayna, who was sitting on the sofa, a meaningful look.

Picking up on the silent cue, Dayna moved quickly to take Ricky's arm. "Dad, maybe everyone's got it wrong. I'm sure my sister isn't the type to do such things. Just because she was seen getting out of some man's car doesn't mean she has been messing around."

But her attempt at soothing only made Ricky's anger boil over. He shot to his feet. "There's no need to defend her. That woman has shamed us all."

He then went upstairs, leaving the living room in silence. Dayna and Janessa shared a look of satisfaction.

The idea of finally turning the tables on Amelia brought Dayna a thrill she didn't try to hide. It wasn't until ten o'clock at night that Amelia leisurely walked into the Flynn family home.

The instant Amelia crossed the threshold, she found the entire Flynn family in the living room,sitting on the sofa. Ricky had been waiting for her all day, his anger nearly at a boiling point.

Not missing a beat, Ricky greeted her arrival with a sarcastic remark, saying, "Why not just wait until the clock strikes midnight before coming home?"

Unbothered, Amelia met his gaze. "Midnight belongs to tomorrow. I gave my word I'd come today,so l kept it."

Her tone matched the chill in her expression. She looked as if she were addressing a stranger rather than her own father.

Such defiance was enough to send Ricky's anger over the edge.

Fury twisted his features as he said, "Amelia, is it so hard to act like Jaxton's fiancée and stop dragging our family's name through the mud? Must you cause a scandal? You're as unmanageable as your mother."

That comparison made Amelia angry, her voice echoing through the room. "Enough!"

Startled by her outburst, the other Flynns stared at her.

Emotion clouded Amelia's eyes, turning them red. "You have no right to speak about my mother like that-not after everything she sacrificed for this family. Every penny the Flynn family has was earned by her! You seem to forget who actually built the Flynn Group. Without her, you'd be nothing."

Ricky bristled, unable to control his emotions. "Are you trying to drive me mad?"

Each word from Amelia struck deep, reopening old wounds.

Long ago, Katrina's achievements had eclipsed Ricky's own. At banquets and gatherings, every toast would go to her first. Being her husband meant living in her shadow, and for Ricky, the memory was a constant,bitter reminder.

But Katrina's death had changed everything. People finally stopped whispering about his dependence on his wife's success. Yet, Amelia's words dredged up the sting of every past humiliation.

At first, disbelief froze Ricky in place. Seconds later, fury sent him lunging across the room,swinging his hand toward Amelia's cheek.

Dayna's excitement reached a fever pitch when she saw that. She sprang to her feet, hoping that Ricky would beat Amelia to death.

Amelia, anticipating the blow, met Ricky with cold readiness. She quickly shoved his arm aside, her movement sharp and decisive.

Just then, the sound of bones dislocating echoed in everyone's ears.

Pain doubled Ricky over as he grabbed his lower back, his wail echoing through the room.

The turn of events caught everyone off guard. Even Dayna, who had been hoping for disaster, was shocked.

Janessa acted quickly,dashing forward to steady Ricky. "Are you all right, darling?"

Pain twisted Ricky's face so completely that not a sound escaped his lips. Only a lookof pure malice burned in his eyes as he fixed them on Amelia.

His expression was not one of a father looking at his daughter, but of someone staring at their enemy.

Years ago, that same look would have left Amelia trembling and full of tears.

But now, Amelia felt nothing.

Without flinching, Amelia met his stare, a mocking smile tugging at her lips. "I wondered why you were so eager to make me come back. It turned out you just wanted to scold me. Too bad you accused the wrong person.The one bringing shame to the Flynn family isn't me, but the daughter you treasure, Dayna."

Scrambling todefend herself, Dayna blurted out, "How could you say something like that, Amelia? You're the one seen climbing out of another man's car, not me-"

"Being seen in a man's car is better than being caught in  an engaged man's bed. Wouldn't you agree?" Amelia said calmly
###Chapter 19 Always Taking Her Side


Ricky stood frozen, taken aback for a moment before disgust twisted his features. "How dare you talk about your own sister that way? Apologze to Dayna right now!"

Without so much as a word, Amelia let out a scornful laugh. She retrieved her phone and held it up for Ricky,playing a video of Dayna and Jaxton caught in the act.

The sound echoed through the living roomn-male gasps tangled with a woman's breathless moans, the volume cranked so loud that it made the walls seem to vibrate.

A look of terror overtook Dayna. Her voice shook as she said, "Dad, please, you have to let me explain.This isn't what it looks like."

She had never expected Amelia to have such a damning video. Anxiety crashed over her in waves.

Watching Dayna's panic, Amelia felt a cold satisfaction settle in her chest.

Now,her sister would know how it felt to be betrayed by the one close to her. "What's left to explain, Dayna?
Want to tell us it's not you in the video? You are not the one who has slept with Jaxton?"

"That's enough, Amelia!"

Tears spilled down Dayna's cheeks as she lunged for the phone, desperate to stop the humiliation, but Amelia was prepared for her move and held the phone easily out of reach.

The scene left Ricky's face shadowed with fury, his glare switching between Dayna and Janessa.

Wasting no time, Janessa hurried to smooth things over. "Don't listen to her, darling. Amelia is just stirring up trouble. There's obviously some misunderstanding. You know Dayna-she's always been innocent. She would never do such a thing."

As she spoke, Janessa shot Dayna a meaningful look, silently urging her to feign innocence.

Dayna picked up on her meaning instantly. Through tears,she launched into her plea. "Dad, please-it's not what you think. If anyone's to blame, it's my sister. I didn't know if she was truly with someone else, but she was always picking fights with Jaxton. That night, Jaxton was drunk; he thought I was her..."

"Dayna, do you honestly believe that story yourself?" Amelia said.

Dayna ignored Amelia and said to Ricky, "Dad, you can't possibly think I'd do something so shameless,right?"

Tears streamed down her cheeks, and for a moment, Ricky's rigid expression softened, though suspicion still clouded his gaze."Is what you said the truth? Jaxton mistook you for Amelia, and that's why he slept with you?"

"If you don't trust me, call Jaxton yourself to ask him about the matter. For Amelia's sake, I was planning to forget the whole thing ever happened," Dayna said.

Janessa didn't miss a beat, stepping in with watery eyes. "Amelia, as your stepmother, I must point out-Dayna has always protected you. Yet you, as her elder sister, only look for ways to bring her harm. Isn't that a bit heartless?"

Their words left Amelia's face colder than before.

Without acknowledging either woman, she turned to Ricky. "That footage was recorded by a reporter in a hotel. If Dayna's so blameless, why was she even there in the firstplace? Even if Jaxton was as drunk as she claimed, what about her? A man that drunk can't do anything, and in the video, Dayna's the one taking charge.She-"

"That's enough!" Ricky exclaimed, cutting her off with a sharp glare. "This isn't your sister's fault. Put the blame where it belongs-on Jaxton. In the end, this happened because you never truly won his heart, not after all this time."

Stillness swept through the living room. Relief flickered across Dayna's and Janessa's faces after they heard Ricky's words.

Any lingering connection Amelia felt toward her father disappeared at that moment.

"You are always like this, taking her side over mine,"Amelia said, her voice stripped of emotion. All her life, whenever trouble brewed between Dayna and her, Ricky's support for Dayna never wavered-Dayna could do no wrong in his eyes.

With that, Amelia gathered her things and went upstairs, her face expressionless.

A flicker of unease crossed Dayna's features, but Janessa nudged her on. So, she said, "Dad, I'm telling the truth. I can call Jaxton right now, if you'd like-"

"Shut up!" Pain lanced through Ricky's back, forcing him to swallow his frustration. Once he recovered slightly, his attention fixed on Dayna. "Are you ready to be honest now?"

Ricky's voice was calmn, but Dayna could feel the storm brewing beneath his composed demeanor.Meeting his cold gaze, she couldn't help but shiver.

Before she could speak, Janessa tried to smooth things over."Darling,this is all just-"

"I wasn't talking to you." Ricky's interruption was colder than ice."Let her answer for herself. Or are you about to tell me you've known about this all along?"

Ricky shook off Janessa's hand, fixing a fierce gaze on her.

He had chosen not to press the issue of the video in front of Amelia, unwilling to give her the satisfaction of witnessing his frustration. But he wasn't easily fooled; a single glance of the video was enough for him to confirm what had really happened.

Janessa, cornered by Ricky's questions, let her strength drain away and dropped to her knees. Dayna instinctively walked to help her up, but Janessa's quick glance held her back.

Kneeling there, Janessa caught a faint softening in Ricky's hardened expression.

"The footage is real, but don't blame Dayna. Jaxton's the one who pursued her. Dayna has never been anything but innocent. She really had no choice..." Janessa immediately directed blame to Jaxton, casting Dayna as the victim.

Watching Ricky's anger melt away, Janessa tested the waters with a suggestion. "Darling, you know Amelia's loyalty to this family is questionable. Even if she marries Jaxton, there's no guarantee she'll support us. But Dayna is different; she would never betray you. Dayna and Amelia both bear the Flynn name,so why not let Dayna get married to Jaxton?"

"Don't talk nonsense," Ricky retorted, shutting her idea down at once. "Don't let me hear you suggest such a thing again. The engagement between Amelia and Jaxton will not change."

Those words crushed any hope Janessa had been harboring, leaving Dayna crestfallen as well.

Emboldened by desperation, Dayna stepped forward, her voice trembling. "Dad, Jaxton doesn't even care for my sister. His heart belongs to me. Why can't he end things with her and choose me instead? If I were the one engaged to Jaxton, I'd do everything to support our family."

As she spoke, Dayna worried that Ricky might get angry. But seeing him remain silent and not showing any anger,she felt encouraged. "Dad, don't you love me the most? Support me on this, please."

Ricky's voice grew weary. "Dayna, things aren't as simple as you want to believe. Even if I agree to this,you'd have to convince Jaxton to leave your sister for you. And that's probably not going to happen."
###Chapter 20)I Am Going To Kill You


Instinct almost made Dayna want to say that Jaxton would agree, but suddenly, the memory of the hospital incident flashed in her mind.

She remembered how Amelia had insisted on ending the engagement, and what had Jaxton done in return?

Rather than agreeing, he had exploded with anger right there.

Catching the conflicted look on Dayna's face, Ricky offered a wry smile. "Looks like you already know the truth, Dayna. You've always been clever. Now that you have your answer, I trust you'll know the right step to take from here."

He left Dayna with that thought and turned his attention to Janessa, who remained on her knees.His tone softened."Dayna is my daughter. I won't let anyone mistreat her. But the Morrison family tie is vital for us,and we can't afford a single mistake.Is that clear?"

Janessa picked up on the warning in his stare and bobbed her head in frantic agreement.

Pleased with her reaction, Ricky helped her up from the floor. His focus returned to Dayna. "Stay away from Jaxton from now on. Do you understand me?"

Although Amelia felt a storm of protest inside, she also nodded under Ricky's gaze.

Just then, a sudden, thunderous crash rang out from upstairs.

Dayna's features changed at once, and she dashed upstairs, arriving just as Amelia shoved her piano over the balcony's edge.

Months of anticipation for that grand piano had led to this-now a deep, ugly crack marred the instrument.

There was no hope for fixing it.

The cost for the piano alone was staggering-over five million spent and months of pleading with Janessa.But now, Amelia had destroyed it in a heartbeat. Originally, Amelia had meant only to gather her belongings and leave quietly, but her key had failed to open the door to her room.

She hurried to the storage room for tools and forced her way in, only to discover her room transformed into Dayna's personal piano studio.

In a fit of resolve, Amelia didn't hesitate to push the piano straight off the balcony

Besides the piano, the room was filled with various decorations and items. Amelia grabbed them at random and tossed them out without even looking.

Dayna.watched in horror, her chest tight with pain. Ricky's presence downstairs forgotten, she shrieked and charged at Amelia, her voice cracking. "Amelia, I am going to kill you!"

While Dayna's rage exploded, Amelia's face showed nothing but composure. As Dayna lunged for her Amelia caught her wrist, then gripped a fistful of hair.

"Let go,Amelia-ah!"

Amelia didn't ease up, pulling so hard that Dayna felt as if her scalp was being torn off.

This was the Flynn family's home, and Ricky was only a floor below. That thought gave Dayna a final burst of nerve as she glared at Amelia and threatened, "Dad's right downstairs; don't you dare-"

Her words barely left her lips before Amelia dragged her toward the balcony, pinning her against the rail.

From up there, Dayna had a clear view of her shattered piano.

Terror gripped her. For a moment, all she could do was stare, too frightened to speak another word, fearing Amelia might truly push her off.

The stairway erupted with noise as Ricky came over and spotted the chaos. His cheeks blazed with anger."Amelia, have you lost your mind? Stop this right now!"

"You have thirty minutes to clear these things out of my room and put everything back where it belongs. If you ignore this, you know what will happen," Amelia said. She grabbed Dayna's wrist and shoved her forward, eliciting another sharp cry from Dayna's lips.

Janessa's hands shook when she saw the scene. It had never crossed her mind that Amelia would behave like this even while Ricky was present.

Just then, the driver arrived to take Ricky to the hospital, and Janessa had no choice but to call the servants to move the items, complying with Amelia's demand.

Only after that did Amelia let go of Dayna. Just then, her phone started to ring.

A text had just come in from Carlee. When Amelia checked her phone, she found a photo of Jaxton locked in an embrace with a woman she didn't recognize.

That woman wore a daring outfit, a wild look in her eyes, and there was an obvious intimacy between the woman and Jaxton.

Just as Amelia prepared to send Carlee a reply, Dayna snatched the phone right out of her grasp.

Frozen as she stared at the photos, Dayna refused to believe Jaxton could ever do such a thing.

She always saw herself as Jaxton's one true love. To her, even Amelia's engagement meant nothing to Jaxton.

Amelia reached for her phone, but Dayna hurled it to the floor, smashing the screen. "All of this is fake. You paid someone to fabricate this photo, didn't you?"

Without hesitating, Amelia shoved Dayna's face toward the broken glass, pressing it down with force.

While Dayna sobbed, she exclaimed, "Amelia, don't try to fool me with some fake photo! Jaxton would never betray me. I'm the one he really loves."

Amelia's laughter echoed coldly. "Time will tell just how little Jaxton truly values you."
###Chapter 21| Need To Talk To You


When Amelia pressed the power button of her phone, the screen stubbornly remained black, no matter how many attempts she made.

All her data and contacts were on it, and a call from the ward could come at any minute.

Thinking about this, she fixed Dayna with a cold glare.

Dayna had just smashed Amelia's phone in a fit of anger, and now, faced with Amelia's icy stare,her face turned pale with fear.

Meanwhile, Janessa kept ordering the staff to move faster. Once everything Amelia owned was set back in place,she made her way over to Amelia.

With Ricky already on his way to the hospital, Janessa dropped her usual act. "Amelia, I've done what you wanted. Now let go of Dayna!"

A scream from Dayna was the only response Janessa received.

Dayna's last stunt involved a dramatic fall down the staircase, injuring her hand. Amelia's move this time made the injury sting all over again.

Though anger flickered across Janessa's face, seeing what was happening made her force herself to calm down.

Knowing Dayna had broken Amelia's phone, Janessa offered compensation, leading Amelia to release Dayna, who cried that her hand was broken, asking Janessa to take her to the hospital.

Amelia only made a brief visit home. Yet, almost the entire Flynn family was bound for the hospital because of her. Now, no one among the staff would dare show her disrespect.

Amelia scanned her room with a cool expression, locked the door after she stepped out, and carried a wooden box as she left. Settling into the car, she opened the box.

Inside were various high-end jewelry pieces, gifts she'd received from childhood, mostly bought by Katrina.

Amelia intended to sell these items and use the money to repay Wyatt.

After all, he had shouldered her grandmother's hospital bills. She believed she needed to repay him for that.

After closing the boox, Amelía started the car.

By the time she arrived home, the hour had crept well past midnight. She took out her keys, balancing the box against her hip, and fumbled to unlock the door.

Suddenly,footsteps pounded through the quiet hallway, their urgency slicing through the night air.

She quickly turned the key, feeling the footsteps closing in. The smell of liquor drifted toward her.

Without thinking, she kicked backward, landing a strike asa familiar yelp echoed behind her.

She then turned and saw Carlee sprawled on the floor.

Dropping her bag, Amelia let the box fall and rushed to help Carlee into her home, reaching out as she said,"What are you doing here? You could have said something."

Carlee grumbled, "I sent that photo to you, but you never replied to me, and I couldn't reach you. I got worried and hurried over without even finishing my drink. Is this how you welcome your friends? That kick hurt,you know!"

"Are you alright? Do you want me to take you to the hospital?" Concern laced Amelia's voice as she looked at Carlee.

Carlee quickly said, "I'm not setting foot in any hospital!"

Amelia let out a sigh, meeting her defiance with gentle persistence."It's just a regular check-up. They might not even need to give you an injection or anything. They will just examine you-"

"No way, I'm not going!" said Carlee, her voice sharp. For all her efforts, Amelia could not get Carlee to budge. Carlee had a strong aversion to needles, which made her particularly resistant to hospital visits.

Realizing she was fighting a losing battle, Amelia dropped the subject. "Dayna smashed my phone earlier.Could I borrow yours so I can reach Monroe?"

Without so much as a pause, Carlee handed the device over. While Amelia took it, Carlee muttered,"What's wrong with Dayna? Did she lose her mind smashing your phone?"

The call went through, and a rough, slightly groggy voice sounded from the other end of the line."Why are you calling me at this hour? Are you drunk?"

"It's Amelia. I need to talk to you," Amelia said.

Suddenly, the tone on the other end brightened, and the excitement was unmistakable."Waiyou're calling from Carlee's number? | figured she was out cold by now."

Monroe Smith was one of Amelia's rare trusted friends, just like Carlee.

Monroe was a guy. After her engagement to Jaxton, Amelia had limited their contact to avoid displeasing the Morrison family.

Still, it didn't affect their friendship.

Once the initial greetings were over, Amelia moved to the heart of her call.

She reached out to Monroe for a reason. He worked in luxury resales, and her jewelry collection was far too valuable to pass off to strangers. She wanted him to help sell them.

Carlee, who had been listening nearby, suddenly spoke up. "You should've told me you needed cash! I've got over ten million, and if you need more, my dad will help."

"Same goes for me, Amelia. I can transfer you a few million right now if you need iit,"Monroe said.

A soft smile flickered across Amelia's lips as she gently refused their help. With a little pressing from the two,she finally revealed the matter about her grandmother's hospital bills. Hearing the truth, Monroe went silent. A moment passed. Then, he agreed to help sell her jewelry pieces and arranged to meet her the next day to take them.

Amelia didn't mention Wyatt's involvement to Monroe, and Carlee chose not to bring it up, either. After the call ended, Carlee couldn't help but say to Amelia, "With your marriage to Wyatt coming up soon, it's normal for him to cover your grandmother's medical bills."

"Regardless of what he thinks, this is money I have to pay back," said Amelia, her tone firm.

After a pause, she added, "Carlee, I want to start working now."

Carlee saw how determined Amelia looked, and worry crept into her voice. "Do you really think the Morrisons will be okay with that?"
###Chapter 22 Jaxton Is Tricked


No matter what the Morrison family thought, Amelia wouldn't be swayed from finding a job.

With her grandmother's hospital bills piling up, the money from selling her jewelry would barely touch what she owed Wyatt. Working was the only option left.

But she didn't want Carlee to worry about her, so she quickly changed the subject. "What was up with that photo you sent me?"

Mentioning the photo set off a spark of anger in Carlee's eyes. "Jaxton isn't just sneaking around with Dayna. He's also involved with other women."

Amelia's calm stood in sharp contrast to Carlee's fury. Watching Carlee's anger bubble over, Amelia only shrugged and offered a laugh. "Don't waste your timne being angry at someone like him. He is not worth it."

Carlee had been angry for Amelia. Once she realized Amelia wasn't fazed by it, she cooled off. Then,catching sight of Amelia's shattered phone screen, curiosity got the better of her. "Don't tell me Dayna did this? She's really lost her mind, hasn't she?"

Thinking about Dayna's meltdown, Amelia said in a mocking tone, "She gives her whole heart to Jaxton,but who knows if he even appreciates it? She even accused me of fabricating the photo."

Carlee gave a resigned shake of her head. "That girl's hopelessly obsessed, and nothing's going to fix it."




At the hospital.

Dayna had put on a show of confidence for Amelia, insisting Jaxton's love for her was unwavering.

However, in truth, the sight of that photo had sent her heart tumbling into chaos.

Amelia's blow had dislocated Dayna's hand; her hand looked swollen and clumsy beneath fresh bandages. Pain shot through Dayna every time she tried to grip her phone, sweat beading across her forehead.

Using her good hand, she dialed Jaxton's number.

The call went unanswered, and a heavy chill settled in Dayna's chest.

Could Jaxton havereally betrayed her?

Was that photo real?

The questions gnawed at her until she could barely think straight.

Desperation took over. Dayna called Jaxton over and over, not stopping until he finally picked up

Her frustration boiled over the moment she heard his voice.

She said, "Where have you been? Why haven't you been answering my calls? Are you with another woman right now?"

Shock spread across Jaxton's face as Dayna's accusations rang through the phone.

For as long as he could remember, Dayna had been nothing but gentle. Never before had she erupted with such anger.

After storming away from the hospital, Jaxton had assumed Amelia would come chasing after him with apologies. When she didn't, annoyance gnawed at him.

To distract himself, he wandered into a bar, chasing pleasure with a stranger. Only then did the edge of his irritation dull.

Even though he knew he was in the wrong, Dayna's tone irked him. "Are you interrogating me?"

That impatient bite in his tone was all it took for Dayna's bravado to fade.

Experience had taught her what he liked-submissive, gentle women.

Thinking about this, Dayna dialed down her anger and let her voice tremble. "Jaxton, please don't be upset.I'm not angry at you, just worried. You wouldn't answer my calls, and Amelia hurt my hand. It's really painful. Could you please come see me at the hospital? I need you..."

Just then, the bathroom door opened, and a woman with wet hair and seductive eyes walked toward Jaxton.

Noticing he was on the phone, Layla Palmer paused for amoment, then smiled and wound her arms around him silently. Her fingertips traced slow patterns at his waist.

Desire stirred inside Jaxton at her touch, but then, Dayna's quivering voice reached his ears. He caught Layla's hand and shot her a silent warning, then said to the phone, "Don't cry. I'll come by the hospital to visit you later."

Dayna, soothed by his promise, stopped sobbing.

Once the call ended, Jaxton turned his full attention to Layla, pulling her close and losing himself in the heat of their passion. The room was soon filled with their tangled moans.

Afterward, Jaxton got up from the bed.

Reclining against the headboard, Layla watched him. When he spoke, his voice was cold and direct. "You know the rules. Take the pill now."

Forcing a smile, Layla replied, "Of course, Mr. Morrison."

With Jaxton's eyes on her, she fished out a bottle of pills from her bag and swallowed one.

Her cooperation brought a brief look of approval from Jaxton. He fished a check out of his pocket and tossed it to her.

Taking the one-million check, Layla remained composed, but inwardly,she was ecstatic.

This much money would take her years to earn, but now, she had it from just one night with Jaxton.

As Jaxton gathered his things to leave, Layla moved fast, slipping her arms around his waist. "Mr. Morrison,don't forget about me."

He found her boldness both amusing and appealing. A playful squeeze at her chest drew a sharp gasp, and he grinned. "Wait for me to call you,Layla." She let go of him with a satisfied smile and saw him off.

After Jaxton got inside the elevator, Layla dashed back inside the room, locked herself in the bathroom, and leaned over the toilet, forcing herself to vomit up the pilI she had just swallowed.
###Chapter 23 Speed Up


All across the Stewart Group's headquarters, bright lights chased away the darkness of the night

With purposeful strides, Davin entered the CEO's office, a bundle of photos in hand.

Wyatt,lost in whatever glowed on his monitor, kept typing on his keyboard with a steady rhythm. Only when Davin drew near did he finally pause.

"These photos just came in, Mr. Stewart. You'll want to see them," Davin said, holding out the photos.

Wyatt reached for the photos, but Marc beat him to it, snatching the stack with a swift movement.

Situated at the very center of Kretol, the Stewart Group's building was not far from the Kretol City Hospital.Marc frequently dropped by Wyatt's office. And, he was standing beside Wyatt's desk now.

As Marc thumbed through the photos, showing Jaxton tangled up in bed with Layla, he couldn't hide his disdain.Without a second thought, he tossed them onto Wyatt's desk. "Your love rival's taste in women is bizarre, choosing to overlook someone as beautiful as Amelia for someone so unremarkable."

Wyatt's eyes skimmed the photos, his expression cold and dismissive. "He doesn't deserve Amelia."

The look on Wyatt's face drew a chuckle from Marc. "Jaxton doesn't deserve Amelia. You're the only one who is worthy of her, right?"

Those words prompted Wyatt to turn and pin Marc with a look. "Since you have so much free time, focus on that research project instead. One hundred million dollars is on the line, and if you can't deliver results, the funding stops there."

"Alright, alright. I came here to visit you out of goodwill, but if you're going to chase me off, then I'll leave,"Marc grumbled, sensing Wyatt's patience wearing thin.

Reaching the door, Marc paused with his hand on the knob, then turned around. "Actually, I almost forgot.There's something you might want to know. It's about Amelia." Wyatt's curiosity flickered, and he gestured for Marc to continue.

Grinning, Marc delivered the news with relish. "The entire Flynn family landed in the hospital today, and their injuries aren't minor. Don't worry, Amelia's fine. In fact, rumor is she's the reason Ricky and Dayna got hurt.She went all out; Dayna's wrist is seriously injured."

"Nobody gets to mess with my woman," Wyatt said.

Marc burst out laughing while Wyatt, usually so composed, seemed to turn into a lovesick man right before his eyes.

Once Marc had left, Wyatt turned and fixed his gaze on Davin. "Look into the situation about the Flynn family for me."

With a firm nod, Davin glanced at the scattered photos. "Should we keep tracking Jaxton's movements?"

"Yeah. Keep an eye on him. What's the status on our project in the eastern district of Kretol?"

Davin had just put away the photos when Wyatt's question prompted him to report on the progress of the project.

After that, Davin added softly, "At most, we'll be ready to open bidding on the east side in a week. I wouldn't be surprised if the Morrisons catch wind soon."

Wyatt's mind raced with possibilities the second Davin finished his report.

Moving to the window, he took in the bright city lights and weighed his next steps. When he finally spoke,his instructions were firm. "Put everything else on the back burner. The east side project comes first."

That decision caught Davin off guard. It hit him just how much Amelia truly meant to Wyatt.

Every move, from the ongoing surveillance of Jaxton to fast-tracking the project, was because of Amelia.

At first, Wyatt had mapped out a month-long plan.

In that scenario, Amelia would have been free from her engagement to Jaxton in a month.

But Marc's update had changed everything. Wyatt felt an urgent impatience settle in.
What the Flynns had put Amelia through was unforgivable. Waiting another month was out of the question.
Wyatt believed he needed to let Amelia cancel her engagement to Jaxton as soon as possible.
###Chapter 24 The Outstanding Graduate Of Kretol University


Taking action always came naturally to Amelia. No sooner had she made up her mind about working than she plunged into the task ahead.

All through the night, she toiled over her resume, determined to land a new job.

Stacks of papers and polished certificates lay on the table, offering her a sense of calm confidence.

Her last two years hadn't been spent building a career, but she still held a coveted distinction as one of Kretol University's top graduates.

Renowned throughout the country, Kretol University was known for its tough standards, admitting only a handful of outstanding students every year.

On top of that, Amelia also held a certificate as an accountant.

Business management was her major in college. A sharp head for numbers ran in her family, and her curiosity drew he to accounting electives.

Only a few months had passed since she got the certificate.

While morning light crept through the apartment, Carlee, who had crashed in Amelia's place overnight,padded out barefoot and spotted the documents spread across the table.

Both women had studied at Kretol University, though Carlee's diploma nearly slipped through her fingers.

Had it not been for the timely support of Amelia and Monroe, Carlee might not have graduated successfully.

Flipping through the certificates, Carlee couldn't resist saying to Amelia, "Come work in my company instead.Why hand your talents to strangers? If I convince you to join us, my dad will be over the moon."

Amelia,worried that the matter might cause trouble for the Larson family, politely declined the offer with a smile. Despite understanding her friend's hesitation, Carlee continued, "You're a real gem,Amelia. Jaxton never appreciated you, and that's on him. l-"

A sharp knock cut her off mid-sentence.

Monroe had arrived.

He had arranged with Amelia the night before to pick up the jewelry pieces today.

He came bearing breakfast for everyone, plus a brand-new phone for Amelia.

With years of friendship between them, Amelia accepted his thoughtful gift without a second thought

Once breakfast wrapped up, Amelia gave Monroe the jewelry box.

Before Amelia could sayanything, Carlee nudged Monroe and said, "Go ahead and make money off other folks, but if you try to turn a profit with Amelia's things, you'll have me to answer to!"

Waving her fist in warning, Carlee made Monroe scoff. He said, "Do you seriously believe I'd do something like that to Amelia?"

"Sorry, but in my eyes, you are exactly that kind of person-a sly businessman," Carlee said.

Seeing the two about to bicker like they had in college, Amelia quickly intervened. She said to Monroe,"ln business, we will follow the rules. That's our professor's motto. You can just treat me as another client on this matter."

"I'll have a look at the jewelry firMonroe replied.

Monroe's eyes sparkled when he opened the box.

He had spent his life surrounded by luxury goods thanks to his parents' business, and years of exposure had given him an expert's touch.

Every piece Amelia offered was nothing short of top-tier.

"Amelia, after taking a good look at everything, I'm ready to offer one hundred and twenty million for this,"he said. "That's too generous, Monroe. If you buy at that price, you won't earn anything," Amelia said.

Monroe's generous offer left Amelia stunned. It was well above her expectations. She believed he wouldn't get any profit.

Meanwhile, Carlee absorbed the figures and fell silent, knowing that Monroe was helping Amelia.

Monroe said to Amelia, "I am a businessman, and I won't do a deal that will only bring me loss. At this price, I won't make much, but there's still some profit. You-"

"One hundred million, Monroe. That's final. If you can't accept it, I'll just take my things elsewhere."

No matter how much she valued Monroe's friendship, Amelia refused to let him help her at his own expense.

Years of knowing her left Monroe clear on one thing-when Amelia drew a line, it was set in stone. He relented with a nod.

Knowing that Amelia hadn't slept the previous night, Carlee pulled Monroe away from Amelia's apartment,letting her getsome rest.

Despite the sleepless night, Amelia didn't feel tired. Looking at the resume and certificates on the table, she opened her laptop to check the job listings online.

Just as she clicked on the site, a knock came at the door.

"Why are you two back again? Did you two forget something..."

Expecting Carlee and Monroe, Amelia opened the door, only to find Jaxton standing there.

Whatever warmth had been in her expression disappeared. "Why are you here?" she asked coldly.

Jaxton had spent the night by Dayna's side at the hospital, all too aware that Amelia's actions had landed both Dayna and Ricky in the hospital.

Watching Amelia act as if nothing had happened, he felt his frustration boil over. "How can you be so cruel,Amelia?"

Amelia was accustomed to Jaxton's tendency to jump to conclusions about her. The memory of the photo from last night drifted through her mind. With a mocking laugh, she replied, "And you think you have the right to judge me, Jaxton?"

Jaxton said, "You went to the Flynn family and injured your father and your sister. Isn't that the very definition of cruel? You..."

Hearing that, Amelia finally pieced together his reason for showing up at her door so early.

For someone like Jaxton, Amelia had no interest in explaining, nor did she want to waste her time on him.

Turning, she walked awvay. Jaxton's frustration mounted as he realized she was ignoring him.

"Are you even listening to me, Amelia? Explain why you did that!" he exclaimed.
###Chapter 25 Are You Trying To Disgrace My Family


Jaxton stared at the table covered with certificates and resumes, feeling deeply humiliated.

His gaze burned with anger as he locked eyes with Amelia. "You want to work?"

Before Amelia could utter a word, he ripped the resume. "Who told you that you could work,Amelia? Are you trying to disgrace my family?"

Among the wealthy families of Kretol, everyone believed that wives were expected to remain at home, not going out to work.

The idea of Amelia working, risking the Morrison family's reputation, drove Jaxton to tear the resume even more viciously.

When the document was in tatters, he tossed the ruined pieces at Amelia. Shreds of paper fluttered down around her like confetti.

Watching him destroy the resume only made her scowl, but as soon as he reached for her certificates,Amelia moved fast. She pushed him aside and scooped them up,refusing to let him touch them.

She could always print out another resume, but the certificates were irreplaceable.

Everything she had achieved was written in those certificates. She refused to let Jaxton ruin them.

Jaxton stumbled back a few steps from Amelia's push. Regaining his balance, he stared at her. "Amelia, I will never agree to you working!"

"That decision is mine to make. You have no say over my choices, and you can't keep me from working,"Amelia said.

"You..." His face twisted with anger, and his vision seemed to blur, but then, a cold laugh slipped out as he thought of something. "You've spent two years doing nothing since you graduated from college. Do you honestly believe you're still that promising graduate from Kretol University? Even if I let you find a job, what decent work would you get? Or is it cleaning floors you're aiming for now?"

None of his words made her falter. Amelia's expression stayed calm.

After driving Jaxton away, she curled up on the sofa, her eyes filled with exhaustion and a hint of hurt.

What right did Jaxton have to humiliate her like that?

Suddenly,her new phone rang. Seeing the caller's name, she hurriedly grabbed her phone.

Drawing in a deep breath, she pressed the answer button.

"Hello? Do you need something?" Amelia asked.

Amelia tried to hide her emotion, but Wyatt picked up on it immediately.

Hearing the warmth in his voice almost made her lose her composure.

She wanted to ask Wyatt when she could finally be free of Jaxton. She wanted to tell him everything Jaxton had said to her, but she could not force the words out.

They would get married only because of an agreement, wit Wyatt offering her more help than she could ever expect, but he was never obligated to stand up for her.

Silence hung between them for a moment. Wyatt, thinking back to what Marc had said, thought Amelia's troubles came from the Flynn family. He was ready to offer some comforting words, but Amelia spoke up first. "Mr. Stewart, are you free right now? There's something I need to talk to you about."

"Tell me when. I'll go see you," he said.

"Is now a convenient time?" she asked.

Checking the time, Wyatt replied, "Give me twenty minutes."

Amelia wanted to meet Wyatt to repay him for Michelle's medical expenses.

Once he agreed, a weight seemed to lift from her shoulders. She then remembered that Wyatt had also called her earlier. "Mr. Stewart, why did you call me earlier?" "There's an auction tonight at Pearl Bay. I want you to join me. We'll sit on the second floor, so you won't be spotted."

This was a simple request,and Amelia immediately agreed.

After ending the call, Wyatt turned to Davin. "Let everyone know I'll be attending the auction tonight."

"If word gets out, the staff at the auction house will probably want to thank Miss Flynn personally,"Davin teased,noticing his boss in a good mood.

Pearl Bay Auction House was a Stewart family business, but there were countless auction houses under the Stewart family name,and Wyatt rarely attended auctions.

Making an appearance there tonight was less about business and more about the opportunity to see Amelia.

Choosing to drive himself, WVyatt left the driver behind and headed straight to Amelia's apartment building.

The moment his message arrived, Amelia grabbed her bag and made her way downstairs. Wyatt had arrived exactly twenty minutes after their call.

When she reached the car, Wyatt stepped out and opened the passenger door for her, which shocked her.

Wyatt,a powerful figure, was treating her with such care that it made her feel shy.

"Mr. Stewart, since it's nearly lunchtime, would you care to join me for a meal before we go?" she said.

Although she had already prepared the bank card, handing it over out of the blue would feel awkward.

A little conversation over lunch would help ease them into the topic of repayment.

Ten minutes later, Wyatt's car stopped at an exclusive restaurant.

Amelia knew this place. It was a members-only restaurant that only served five guests a day.

With practiced ease, Wyatt led her inside, proving that he was familiar with this place.
###Chapter 26 Having A Meal With Him


Stepping into the restaurant, Amelia became aware of a gaze on her-someone's attention clung to her even as she settled into her chair.

Her search for the source landed on a gentleman wearing gold-rimmed glasses, seated a short distance away to her left. His elegant suit and poised manner made him stand out.

His polished demeanor marked him as someone important, though she didn't know him.

He made no effort to look away once their eyes met, holding her gaze.

Meanwhile, Wyatt picked up on Amelia's slight unease. Tracking where she was looking, he frowned,reading the situation quickly.

His plan had been to savor a quiet afternoon together with Amelia. If only he had known this would happen,he would have booked the whole place.

The man, having caught Wyatt's attention, rose from his seat and strolled over to their table.

"So, it realy is you, Mr. Stewart. For a moment, I thought I was mistaken. I didn't expect to find you here today.I thought you were busy with work."

"Even a packed schedule can't keep a man from enjoying a good meal, right, Mr. Mills?" Wyatt said.

Their conversation was friendly enough, but the man's eyes kept drifting to Amelia, curiosity shining through. After all, he had never seen him with a woman by his side before.

Sensing the direction of his gaze, Wyatt shifted his position, shielding Amelia from view. "We'll catch up another time, Mr. Mills. I wouldn't want to interrupt your lunch."

Understanding the hint, Colton Mills ended the conversation and headed back to his table, offering Amelia a polite nod. She also nodded in response, her face composed.

Wyatt then introduced the man's identity to Amelia. Among the city's most powerful families were the Stewarts,the Mills,the Chapmans, and the Harveys.

Colton was the heir to the Mills family.

Amelia had suspected he might be someone of stature. Still, learning he was the Mills heir sent a ripple of nerves through her.

She hesitated, then asked softly,"Wyatt, is it going to cause problems for you that Mr. Mills saw us dining together?"

After all, she was still Jaxton's fiancée, and Jaxton's affair with Dayna had made her the subject of gossip recently.

Deep down,Amelia feared damaging Wyatt's reputation.

Wyatt, pouring her a glass of water, looked surprised by her concern. Setting the warm glass in front of her,he said, "Here in Kretol, nobody would dare gossip about me. You have nothing to worry about, Miss Flynn."

His assurance was gentle, and the confidence i his eyes was impossible to miss.

That answer caught Amelia off guard fora moment. Then, a warm smile soon spread across her face.

Whenever Wyatt was at her side, his gentle ways almost made her forget his immense influence. He was the son of the powerful Stewart family.

Before she could reply, the waiter appeared with steaming plates of food.

The moment those beautiful dishes landed on the table, Amelia's whole face lit up-they were all her favorites.

Instead of digging in right away, she waited, fork in hand, for Wyatt to eat first.

Noticing Amelia's obvious excitement, Wyatt felt delighted, and a genuine smile spread across his.features."Go ahead and try them. I hope they're to your liking."

After Wyatt began eating, Amelia wasted no time joining him.

Before coming here, she had thought the dishes at this place would be expensive and bland, but now,she realized she had been terribly wrong.

The food here was incredible.

Wyatt, not particularly focused on culinary delights, found his appetite inexplicably improved as he watched Amelia eating so happily.

Suddenly, applause swept through the dining room.

The chef emerged from the kitchen, his good looks and charisma evident. People in the restaurant started murmuring.

"It's rare to see Sanford serve anyone personally..."

"Who's managed to get Sanford to cook for them tonight?"

The murmurs of admiration filled Amelia's ears, piquing her curiosity.

She wondered who would receive such special treatment.

Sanford Chapman, without a word, made his way straight to Amelia, setting a mango mousse delicately beside her plate with a smile.

Al around Amelia, the sound of envious chatter grew louder.

"This dessert is just for you, Miss Flynn. Let me know what you think," Sanford said, his voice cheerful.

Mango happened to be Amelia's favorite fruit, but instead. of answering Sanford, she glanced across the table,looking at Wyatt.

Wyatt reached for a fork on the tray and offered it to her with a nod.

The first taste sent sweetness rushing through her, the flavor spreading warmth to every corner of her mouth.

Never in her wildest dreams had Amelia expected Wyatt to arrange something like this for her.

She realized now that this little surprise had been carefully planned by Wyatt. Her thoughts drifted to the Morrison family.

She had been engaged to Jaxton for two years, and she'd often shared meals with his family, but the table never held anything she especially liked. Every dish catered to Jaxton's tastes, and thanks to his allergy,mango had all but vanished from her life.

"This is wonderful. I really love how it tastes," she said.

Sanford,hopeful for a word of praise, started to move closer to her, but a single sharp look from Wyatt sent him back to the kitchen.

Noticing how pleased Amela looked, Wyatt let out a warm laugh. "If you're this happy eating here,、I'dlove to bring you here whenever you want."

His words pulled Amelia out of her daze. She quickly shook her head, saying, "Your schedule's packed as it is. I can't keep taking up your time."

Suddenly remembering why she'd come, Amelia sat up straighter.

Taking a card from her bag, she pushed it towards Wyatt with both hands, sincerely saying, "There's a hundred million dollars on this card. Please accept it as thanks for helping my grandmother with her hospital bills."

Wyatt stared at the card in silence, his eyes hard to read, but Amelia sensed that he was angry.

She wondered if she'd struck a nerve or come across as ungrateful.

She added, "Mr. Stewart, I wasn't trying to offend you. I just-"

"You don't want to owe me anything. I get it," Wyatt said, his gaze returning to its usual calm. "That's fine.I'll respect your decision."

Without waiting for a reply, Wyatt picked up the card and then pushed it right back to her.

"Miss Flynn, if you'd rather not owe me, I understand. But I hope you won't refuse this as a gift for our wedding, unless you want me to give it to the Flynn family?" The moment Wyatt mentioned that, Amelia's refusal was swift and certain.

"My father's only interested in what he can gain. If he finds out about our marriage, he'll only see you as a tool to get money and climb the social ladder.He will cling to you."

"Well, in that case, keep this for yourself."

Under the guise of a wedding gift, the card made its way back to Amelia's hands.

Only after she accepted it did Wyatt share some unexpected news. The month-long agreement might be adjusted, and she could soon end her engagement with the Morrison family.

The words were such a relief that Amelia grabbed onto Wyatt's sleeve without realizing it.

Wyatt's gaze drifted to her hand, his eyes catching on the engagement ring she still wore, and a quiet joy glimmered in his expression. "I've already asked Davin to take care of everything."

"Thank you, Mr. Stewart! Really,thank you!"

As she spoke, she realized she was holding Wyatt's sleeve and quickly released it.

She missed the flicker of sadness that crossed his face as she poulled away.
###Chapter 27 Invitation Letter From Pearl Bay Auction House


Inside the Morrison family's residence.

"Care to tell me where you disappeared to last night?"

Jaxton walked through the front door, only to spot Laura waiting for him with crossed arms.

Unease began to creep in as memories from the previous night flickered through Jaxton's mind.

With the dust barely settling from the last scandal, Jaxton knew Laura would get angry if she discovered he had spent time with Layla last night.

Searching for the right excuse, Jaxton tried to compose himself. Before he could speak, Laura vented her frustration, saying, "I've warned you again and again to stay away from Dayna. Why is it so hard for you to listen? Are you waiting for Amelia to give up on you, or are you determined to push me past my breaking point?"

Realizing Laura had no idea about Layla, Jaxton felt a wave of relief wash over him.

However, as soon as Amelia's name left Laura's lips, his irritation boiled over. "You're the only one who still thinks Amelia is a good person. Did you know she's the reason Mr. Flynn and Dayna landed in the hospital?"

In all her interactions with Amelia, Laura had only seen the girl's good manners, so she could not accept what she was hearing. "Amelia would never do something like that!"

"Why not? Dayna and Mr. Flynn haven't left their hospital beds yet. That is proof," Jaxton said.

Laura noticed Jaxton wasn't backing down, and for a moment, uncertainty clouded her eyes.

Watching her face change, Jaxton continued, "Don't let Amelia fool you, Mom. I actually followed your advice and went to see her first thing today. You wouldn't believe what I discovered. She's been sending out resumes, trying to get a job in secret. Imagine what people will say if word gets out that my fiancée is looking for work. Our family will become a laughingstock." Jaxton thought Laura would be furious upon hearing this.

But she simply wore a look of mild annoyance. With his patience fraying, he said, "Mom, aren't you mad about this?"

She met his gaze with a cold stare. "Do you think I can't see through your little schemes?"

Jaxton had suffered a lot from Amelia recently, and with Laura around, he couldn't really do anything to Amelia. Secretly, he wished his mother would step in and put Amelia in her place:

Although Laura wasn't overtaken by anger, she was displeased with Amelia looking for a job. Amelia's actions indeed did not consider the Morrison family's reputation.

Laura caught the resentment flickering across Jaxton's face, and her voice turned cold. "I've told you before, when something happens, you need to think it through first before acting. You don't have to worry.Amelia won't be working."

At those words, Jaxton's whole face brightened. He fixed his gaze on her."Mom, as long as you stop her,Amelia definitely won't dare to object."

"Stopping her myself will only make Amelia resent me." Laura shook her head and let a mysterious smile slip across her lips. Pulling out her phone, she called her assistant.

Any company associated with the Morrison family or less powerful than them wouldn't dare hire Amelia because they didn't want to cross Laura.

As soon as she ended the call, Laura turned the moment into a lesson. "Remember what I said, Jaxton. No matter the situation,keep your head cool-"

"I need to go, Mom.I have things to do."

Laura's words made Jaxton impatient. He snatched up his coat and started for the door, only for her to halt him in his tracks.


Certain that another lecture was coming, Jaxton frowned. But then, Laura just held out an elegant envelope to him. "Mom, this is an invitation letter from Pearl Bay Auction House. How did you manage to get one?" he said.
###Chapter 28 Would You Give Up Your Spot For Me Tonight
The Stewart Group's Pearl Bay Auction House had built its reputation on glamorous charity events.Invitations were coveted, serving as the golden ticket for anyone hoping to join Kretol's elite circles.


The Morrisons had always been on the outside,never once having received an invitation to such celebrated gatherings.


"I had to pull quite a few favors for this. I've prepared five million for you to attend the auction tonight,"Laura said.



"Isn't the charity auction just for show? Do we honestly have to throw around that much money for it?" Jaxton replied.



"Clearly, you're missing the point. Anyone who steps into Pearl Bay Auction House is already someone of  consequence. That money will do more for our reputation than any business deal ever could," Laura said.


Year after year, Laura's scolding rolled off Jaxton's back. When she failed to bring up Amelia this time,he sensed something was off. "So you're not letting me bring Amelia for this?"


"| might have spoiled her too much, and now, she thinks she can do as she pleases. Tonight, she needs to see that the Morrison name is her only access to the elite circle."



"You should have taken a firmer hand with her ages ago. Amelia's gotten reckless because you always let her get away with things," Jaxton said.


"That's enough! Even if Amelia's not going with you,you are not taking Dayna there, not under any circumstances," Laura snapped.


Jaxton hadn't even thought of bringing Dayna. But now that Laura had said that, a stubborn streak inside him flared up, stronger than before. He gave Laura his word on the surface, repeating his assurances that he would not bring Dayna.



But as soon as he stepped outside, Jaxton wasted no time and called Dayna.


When he told her about the auction and invited her instead of Amelia, Dayna immediately agreed and asked Janessa to help arrange her discharge from the hospital.


Janessa, who grasped the weight of the Pearl Bay event far better than Dayna did, recalled Ricky's warning and dared not breathe a word of this to him.She scraped together five million from nearly all her savings for Dayna.


***



Nestled on Kretol's southern shoreline, Pearl Bay Auction House stood by the sea.


By eight o'clock that evening, Amelia slid her car into a parking lot of the auction house.


Wyatt had promised to pick her up, but last-minute  work at the Stewart Group had pulled him away.


Refusing Wyatt's offer to send a driver, Amelia took the wheel herself to come here.


Tonight, Amelia wore a bright yellow gown. The off-the-shoulder style highlighted her graceful neck and striking figure.


The layers of yellow roses in the pattern on her dress made her resemble a blooming flower.


Passersby couldn't help but let their gaze linger on her.


Rushing toward the entrance, she had just reached it when a guard blocked her path. He offered a polite smile. "Excuse me, Miss. Could you show me your invitation?"


Embarrassment rushed to Amelia's cheeks. It hadn't crossed her mind that an invitation was required to enter the auction house.



While she fumbled with her phone, ready to text Wyatt, the sound of derisive laughter reached her  ears.



Dayna walked over in a crisp white gown, clinging sweetly to Jaxton's arm. She stopped in front of Amelia. "Amelia, Pearl Bay Auction House isn't a place where anyone can just wander in. Only those with invitations can get past the doors."


"Have you been waiting for me all this time, Amelia?If you're so desperate to go in, you can beg me. And I might bring you in."


Jaxton, who had noticed the striking woman by the entrance, was shocked when he realized it was Amelia. His astonishment then faded almost at once.



Though Amelia wanted to ignore Jaxton at first,something in Dayna's cold stare made her change her mind.



A quick check with security confirmed the rule-one guest with an invitation could only bring one company. Fixing Jaxton with a pointed look, Amelia asked, "If you take me with you, what about Day/na?" "Dayna can ride home with the driver. She is obedient and sensible, unlike you, who fusses over every little thing," Jaxton said.


That answer sent Amelia into a fit of laughter.


Her laughter drew the attention of many, including Wyatt, who was just preparing to get out of his car.


Davin, who was about to open the car door for him,quickly said, "Mr. Stewart, I'll go handle that."


"Wait." Wyatt stopped him.


When Amelia's laughter faded, she fixed Dayna with a piercing stare. "Dayna, would you give up your spot for me tonight?"


Dayna tried to smile, but her expression was closer to a grimace. Of course, she wasn't willing to do that.This chance was rare; why should she hand it over to Amelia?


When Dayna kept quiet, Amelia turned to Jaxton with a knowing look. "Looks like Dayna isn't willing to give up her spot for me."
###Chapter 29 The Auction





Jaxton subconsciously glanced at Dayna, a hint of doubt flickering in his eyes.


Nerves twisted inside Dayna. The last thing she wanted was to tarnish her image in front of Jaxton,but she also didn't want to give Amelia the chance to attend the auction.



In a desperate act, Dayna dug her nails into her thigh, summoning tears just as Amelia's voice cut through the moment. "Dayna, are you about to cry again? You've gotten involved with my fiancé, yet l haven't even cried at all. What do you have to cry about?"



Now, Dayna didn't know whether to cry or not.


With Amelia's sharp words, everyone nearby recalled the recent scandal. In an instant, the crowd's attention fell on Jaxton and Dayna. Low voices swirled around Jaxton. His glare bore into Amelia, sharp enough to wound.


He knew exactly what she was doing.


She wanted to humiliate him!


People might only call Jaxton a playboy, but the stares aimed at Dayna brimmed with harsh judgment.


Every passing second, the crowd's chattering swelled. Insults hung in the air. Dayna's tears finally broke free.



Every part of her wanted to shout that she was the one Jaxton truly loved. Amelia, never truly wanted by Jaxton, was the one forcing herself into her relationship with Jaxton.


Before Dayna could defend herself, she spotted Jaxton walking inside the auction house, rage in every stride. Forgetting the crowd, she rushed after him.



With Jaxton and Dayna gone, Davin moved quickly to Amelia's side after Wyatt's discreet nod. Pearl Bay Auction House had a special passage for Wyatt, and when Amelia followed Davin through,Wyatt was waiting for her at the elevator door.


Stepping inside the elevator, Wyatt met Amelia's gaze, his mood clouded. "No one told me the Morrison family was invited. I've already made the call. They'll be kicked out."


If not for Amelia, Wyatt would have let the engagement between Amelia and Jaxton end long ago.



"There's no need to send them away. Let them bid.At least the money will go toward charity. They might be shameless, but their money's got no faults,"Amelia said.


"Fine, if that's what you want, I'll do as you say,"Wyatt said.


Watching Amelia's calm expression, Wyatt felt his anger fade on the spot.


Not missing a beat, Davin fished out his phone and sent a message to the auction house's manager.


The auction was held on the first floor, bout the true VIP seats were in the rooms on the second floor.



Relaxing on a plush sofa with Wyatt on the second floor, Amelia enjoyed a sweeping view of the first floor through the glass.



A downward glance revealed Jaxton and Dayna taking up seats in the very back row.



Apparently, Dayna had found a way to make Jaxton stop being angry, and the two were chatting and laughing now.


Only when the auctioneer's voice rang out did Amelia turn her attention to the stage.


Back when Katrina had still been alive, the Flynn Group had poured money into struggling communities each year. Because of this, Amelia had always taken a genuine interest in charity events.


Even though her own finances were stretched thin these days, she still wanted to contribute what she could.



However,disappointment crept in as the auctioneer introduced the very first item for bidding.


What appeared on stage was a gaudy golden bracelet, dripping with pink diamonds-Amelia winced at the sight. It was tedious.


While Amelia privately cringed at the sight, Dayna suddenly offered one million for the piece.


The bracelet was worth at most five hundred thousand, yet Dayna started with one million,drawing everyone's attention to her, curious to see who the naive fool was.



However, basking in the sudden attention, Dayna couldn't help but smile to herself.


The embarrassment she'd suffered earlier at the entrance was still fresh, and she believed this was her chance to redeem her reputation. With a public gesture of charity, she thought people would see her as a kind person. The auctioneer, caught off guard for a second,quickly collected himself. His wide smile returned as he said, "Such generosity from this lady! On behalf of the children you'll help, thank you. One million-is there anyone wwho wishes to go higher?"



"Two million!"



Bids from the second floor drew the crowd's eyes up to the private room where Amelia and Wyatt sat.


Amelia glanced at Wyatt, eyebrows raised in confusion.



"You seemed interested in the bracelet," Wyatt said.


He hadn't really noticed the auction item at all. He only saw Amelia's eyes lingering on it, and on a whim, decided to place a bid.


A small pause later, Amelia replied, "I don't go for stuff like that."



"Three million!"



Dayna had no clue that Wyatt was her competition.In her mind, the mystery bidder was deliberately trying to make things difficult for her. What else could explain such a crazy price hike over a simple bracelet?



"Five million!" Davin said after receiving a signal from Wyatt.
###Chapter 30 A Bidding War





Gasps shot across the room, and Dayna's eyes burned with fury as she fixed her gaze on the second floor.



Meanwhile, the auctioneer on stage couldn't hide his delight, convinced that fortune had favored him tonight.


"Would you like to go higher, miss?" he asked Dayna.


Although Janessa had prepared only five million for her, there was no way she would back down like this.


Silence settled like a heavy cloud over the hall, all eyes locked on Dayna. Her cheeks burned, stung by the scornful glances around her.


Without a word, she turned to Jaxton, desperation flickering in her eyes.


Keen and quick to pick up on the situation, the auctioneer didn't miss a beat. Sensing Dayna's dilemma, he turned to Jaxton. "Sir, do you want to raise your bid?"



Those who had focused on Dayna now shifted their gaze,waiting to see Jaxton's next move.


Displeasure crept over Jaxton's face, both toward the auctioneer's tactics and Dayna's gesture, but he was left with no choice. He had to grit his teeth and lift the offer by another million.



"Ten million!"



As soon as Jaxton set down his paddle, Wyatt shot a signal toward Davin, and Davin raised the bid to a new height.



The bracelet's value had rocketed, far beyond its starting price. But for the wealthy people gathered on the second floor, tossing around ten million barely registered as a loss.



Jaxton was in a tight spot. Conceding now would bring  disgrace to the Morrison family. In an instant, the auction transformed into a showdown between Jaxton and Wyatt.



Jaxton kept nudging up the offer by a million each round, while Davin-actingon Wyatt's cue-raised the bid continuously, eventually bumping the price straight to fifty million.



Anger flashed in Jaxton's eyes as he stared up at the second floor, refusing to quit, and pushed the bid up another million.



On the second floor, Davin watched Jaxton with thinly veiled amusement, thinking that he was a fool.No one in Kretol had dared to compete with Wyatt like this before.



Just as Davin prepared to up the bid once more,Amelia's voice rang out. "Stop!"


Looking straight at Wyatt, she said firmly, "A bracelet like this can't possibly be worth more than a few hundred thousand. Even if you have money to burn,why throw it away like this?" For Wyatt, such a sum was like spare change.


Still, he gave Amelia a respectful nod after her words reached him. "Fine. I'll do as you say."


Davin wasted no time setting the microphone down.


The hush that followed from the second floor disappointed the crowd, while Jaxton's expression shifted.



The price of the bracelet-fifty-one million-soared far above the amount Laura had prepared for him.


Dayna, sitting uncomfortably beside Jaxton, found herself at a loss. While it had been Jaxton who had continued to raise the stakes, it had been her actions that ignited the bidding war.


Applause sounded as the auctioneer congratulated Jaxton. Dayna, uncertain, tried to slip her hand into Jaxton's, but he jerked away.


Her injured hand throbbed even worse after his abrupt reaction, prompting a sharp cry of pain.Yet,the auctioneer's next words made her forget about 
her pain.


With Dayna as the one who had begun the bidding war,both she and Jaxton now had to bear the weight of the final cost together.


Jaxton's scowl softened just a bit after he heard that.


Dayna instinctively wanted to back out, but seeing Jaxton's gaze, she forced a strained smile. "Jaxton,don't worry. I'll share the cost of the fifty-one million with you. This whole mess was my fault. I'm sorry..."


With teary eyes and a trembling voice, she looked at him, waiting for his response. Seeing her like this, he could only say, "It's alright. You don't have to pay half."



Hope fluttered in Dayna's chest; she was convinced his words came from his love for her. But his next words left her stunned.



"You can only pay twenty-five million. I'll take care of the rest."
###Chapter 31 VIP Guests Only





When Dayna heard Jaxton's words, her face went slightly stiff. When he looked her way, though,she still managed a smile of gratitude. "Jaxton, you are always so good to me!'


Silence settled between Jaxton and Dayna for the rest of the auction, neither daring to bid.


During this time, Amelia spotted a pair of cufflinks that caught her eye and quickly placed a bid of one hundred thousand. With Davin's help with the bidding, no one else dared to place a bid, making Amelia very pleased.


As the auction drew to a close, Jaxton tried to slip away with Dayna, but security blocked their exit and ushered them into a lounge nearby.


Once inside, the auction house staff demanded immediate payment for the bracelet. Even after pooling their funds, Jaxton and Dayna could scrape together only ten million. They both knew the Stewart family held the reins at Pearl Bay and hurriedly explained that more time was needed to pay the rest.


The auction house manager didn't make things difficult for them, simply stating that if payment wasn't received within a week, they would personally visit them to collect it.



Once outside the lounge, Jaxton picked up his pace,desperate to leave. Dayna quickly caught hold of his hand,stopping him short.


"What are you doing?" The frustration Jaxton had tried to bury quickly resurfaced, his patience thinning.


Dayna didn't rush to explain herself. Instead, she fixed her eyes on the figure ahead of them.


Jaxton followed her line of sight and spotted Amelia.


Jaxton and Dayna subconsciously moved towards Amelia, only to be blocked by security. "That elevator is for VIP guests only. You can't go there!"



"VIP guests?" Jaxton repeated.


His and Dayna's astonishment was written all over their faces.



Since when did Amelia have that kind of status?



The idea seemed impossible.


As Amelia vanished around the corner, Dayna's fingers curled into fists in anger.


Feigning shock, she blurted out, "Did Amelia come here with that old man she is supposedly involved with?"



Suddenly, her voice sharpened with realization. "So that's it! The people on the second floor targeted us because of her. I can't believe Amelia set us up like this. She's always picking on me, but this time, she dragged you into the mess, too, Jaxton. She has never cared about your feelings..."



Dayna's eyes glittered with satisfaction when she saw Jaxton's face darken.



***




When Amelia exited through the private passage with Wyatt, she planned to drive herself home, but Wyatt stopped her.



"It's too late for you to drive on your own. Let me take you home. I'll send someone to take your car back," he said.



Even though the city still hummed with life and the clock had barely struck ten, Amelia accepted Wyatt's offer,handing her car keys to Wyatt's subordinate.



No sooner had Amelia settled into Wyatt's car than Davin handed her the cufflinks she had bid on earlier.



Amelia's brows shot up in surprise, and she said, "I thought I'd have to wait until tomorrow to get these."


With a quick look at Wyatt for approval, Davin said with a grin, "Pearl Bay Auction House falls under the Stewart Group's name." Everything clicked for Amelia at once.



Accepting the box containing the cufflinks from Davin, she turned and offered it to Wyatt, who blinked at her, clearly surprised.



Trying not to seem too forward, she explained,"You've done so much for me lately. I picked these cufflinks for you, thinking they suit you. I hope you like them."



With their platinum finish and understated silver-gray pattern, the cufflinks had reminded her of Wyatt's polished elegance when she saw them.


Still, Amelia worried that their simplicity might not match his wealth or taste.



Before she could get lost in her worries, Wyatt extended his hand.



With a gentle laugh, he locked eyes with her. "Would you mind putting them on for me, Miss Flynn?"


Relief washed over Amelia. Her fingers trembled slightly as she lifted the cufflinks, breath catching at their closeness.



She could even hear Wyatt's heartbeat.


The moment she secured the second cufflink, Amelia drew back, sitting up straight. Wyatt, though,didn't look away; he met her eyes and grinned. "How do they look on me?"



Against his black silk shirt, the silver-gray cufflinks shimmered coolly, adding an extra touch of refinement to'his look.



After a thoughtful pause, Amelia replied, "They look really good on you."


With that admission, she found herself unable to meet his gaze, as the weight of his attention made her cheeks burn.



Soon, the car slowed in front of her apartment building. Just as she reached for the car door handle,Wyatt's low voice stopped her. "Miss Flynn, are you free sometime soon?"



Confused, Amelia turned to look at Wyatt. Quick to answer, Wyatt said, "My mother would like to treat you to a meal."


The truth was, ever since meeting Amelia, Della had been hoping for a second meeting. Wyatt, however,had held his mother back, not wanting her to rush things. Della, respectful of his wishes and worried about frightening Amelia, refrained from pushing the matter.


Meanwhile, Davin could tell that it wasn't Della who wanted to see Amelia, but rather Wyatt who wanted to spend more time with her.


Amelia genuinely liked Della and agreed readily.


Her response brought a rare smile to Wyatt's lips. "I'll come and pick you up for the meal."


Before Amelia left, Wyatt thanked her for the cufflinks again.


Though she wondered if his compliment was just courtesy, his words still warmed her heart.


While Amelia was feeling happy, the Flynn family and the Morrison family were in chaos.
###Chapter 32 Rejection





At the Flynn family's residence.


Once Dayna left the hospital, Janessa's heart fluttered with hope.



She envisioned Dayna dazzling Kretol's elite, maybe even forging ties with a family more powerful than the Morrisons.



However, that hope shattered the moment Janessa learned what had actually happened. Dayna had spent everything on a bid.



Every cent of that five million had been her secret savings, and now, it was all gone. Besides, finding the extra twenty million seemed impossible.


As worry creased Janessa's brow, Dayna broke the silence. "Mom, maybe we should talk to Dad and ask him for help with this. Twenty million is nothing for him." At that, Janessa became furious. Lowering her voice,she said to Dayna, "You don't understand. Your father just came home from the hospital today, and if he finds out you're still tangled up with Jaxton, he'll lose his temper. Do you really want him to get angry with you?"



"But Mom, how else are we supposed to get the twenty million?" Dayna asked.


"Aren't you still with Jaxton? He's the Morrison family's son. Surely, coming up with a few tens of millions wouldn't put a dent in his wallet."



At first, Janessa had considered Jaxton as the perfect match for her daughter, but the disaster at the auction this time made her doubt that.



She even questioned whether Jaxton truly liked her daughter. Otherwise, with his wealth, he shouldn't have asked Dayna to pay.


Dayna gave a small shake of her head. "Mom, didn't you always tell me to be thoughtful and gentle around Jaxton? If I don't pay this time,what will he think of me? Please figure out a way to solve this for me."



Dayna's response nearly made Janessa scream.She snapped, "You make it sound so simple! This is twenty million we're talking about, not a measly twenty thousand!"



Money was a sore subject for Janessa. Even with her title as Ricky's wife,real control of the Flynn fortune was Ricky's, Besides the occasional spending money, everything else was locked away from her reach.



Saving up that five mnillion had taken her more than a year.


Yet, Janessa could never bring herself to confess such humiliating truths to Dayna.


"Let's drop the matter for now. Go get some rest.I'll figure out a way to manage the money problem," she said to Dayna with a sigh.


Once Dayna left, Janessa moved toward her dressing table.



She stared at her collection of jewelry and trinkets,feeling a wave of reluctance to part with them. Still,for the sake of a better future, she gritted her teeth and dialed the jewelry pawn shop's number.



***



At the Morrison family's house.



Jaxton had hoped to settle his twenty million quietly.Since he was the heir of the Morrison family, Laura didn't restrict him much regarding money.


Yet,because the coveted invitation had cost Laura so much effort, she took a keen interest in every detail of the auction.



She pressed Jaxton relentlessly for answers until he finally caved and shared what had happened.



Watching Laura's expression harden with anger Jaxton decided not to mention Dayna at all,choosing instead to throw all the blame on Amelia. Bitterly recalling the night, Jaxton said, "Mom,Amelia stabbed me in the back. She and the man she is involved with targeted me on purpose!"



The truth was, Jaxton had only glimpsed Amelia's figure from afar, but he convinced himself that the man she was involved with had been on the second floor at that time.



Laura was taken aback to learn that Amelia had enjoyed VIP treatment at Pearl Bay Auction House. A flicker of surprise showed in her eyes.



As for Jaxton's claim about the man Amelia was involved with... She didn't believe it at all.



Her years of experience in business told her Amelia carried herself with the poise and confidence of someone raised well. She would never mess around with some man like that.



Jaxton grew even more irritated as Laura continued to put her trust in Amelia.



When Laura suggested he invite Amelia to a meal at home soon, he lost his temper, storming out and slamming the door behind him.



Watching her son's angry retreat, Laura remained calm and composed.


She believed that persistence would eventually pay off-Jaxton didn't need to like Amelia now, but he would marry her in the end.



***



In Kretol's bustling city center, Amelia frowned as she read the email on her phone.


Another job offer had just slipped through her fingers, the latest in a string of disappointments.



For days now, she had sent out one resume after another, only to be met with rejection.


At first, she had blamed her two-year employment gap for this.



But even when she managed to land an interview and passed, the companies still withdrew their offers at the last moment.



One or two incidents like this might not have raised any suspicions, but facing rejection so many times had made her think that something was off.


With her eyes on the glass tower overhead, Amelia called Monroe.



The line barely rang before Monroe picked up the call.



After explaining her situation in a few short sentences, Amelia said, "Monroe, I know this is a bother, but could you look into what's happening?"



"Amelia, you don't need to be so formal with me. 1have answers for you in two hours, tops. Just leave it to me."



"Thanks, Monroe. I will treat you to a meal sometime," Amelia replied.



The call ended, but instead of heading home, Amelia made her way to a café nearby. With lunchtime approaching, she found she wasn't hungry, so she ordered just a cup of coffee.


Watching office workers hurry past outside the window, she felt a pang of regret sweep over her.


As a distinguished graduate of Kretol University,she had received many promising offers right after graduation. But she had turned them all down for Jaxton and the Morrison family.



Only thirty minutes had passed before Monroe called her again.


Thanks to his career, Monroe kept close ties with Kretol's most influential people, always ready to tap into his network.



Before Amelia could ask, Monroe's voice burst out,laced with outrage. "Your mother was really mistaken when she thought that the Morrison family was good for you! Jaxton is a jerk, and his mother is just as bad..."
###Chapter 33 JJoining The Stewart Group
Finding that Laura had secretly pulled the strings against her, Amelia felt her frustration simmer beneath the surface.



She had always shown Laura respect and courtesy,never expecting to be sabotaged by her.


When she thought about the self-doubt she had experienced over the past few days, her hand holding the cup shook slightly.


"Everything okay, Amelia?"


The sound of Monroe's voice, heavy with worry,broke through her thoughts.



His concern gave her a quiet sense of comfort,making her calm down.


After she reassured Monroe that she was alright, she ended the call.


Right then, the sharp rap of knuckles against the window drew her gaze. She looked up to see Davin standing outside the window, with a car nearby.


The rear window of the car slid down, and Wyatt's familiar face appeared.


Inside the comfort of Wyatt's car, Amelia learned that the Stewart Group's headquarters was nearby.



"Miss Flynn, is there something important that brought you here today?"



Wyatt's deep voice filled the space between them as the car pulled away, his question revealing an unexpected trace of concern to Amelia.


Thinking about the scene earlier, Wyatt couldn't shake the ache that settled in his chest.



The person he cared deeply about, with reddened eyes, had brought coffee to her lips with a trembling hand. That was a sight he never wanted to see again. Something about Wyatt's steady presence made Amelia feel reassured.



Unable to hold back, she mentioned her failed job search but kept Laura's scheming to herself.


After Katrina's passing, Laura had been rather kind to her,and Amelia felt grateful for it.


However, after today, she felt she owed nothing to the Morrison family.


Wyatt, however, picked up on the missing pieces in her story. Everything he knew about Amelia told him she wouldn't be like this because of a difficult job search alone.



But since Amelia didn't wish to elaborate, he didn't press further.


It was only after Amelia finished speaking that she remembered an important matter: she was about to marry Wyatt.


If even the Morrison family wouldn't allow her to work, would the Stewart family permit it? Wyatt's quiet only heightened her worries. If he too expected her to stay home after marriage, would she be trapped as a housewife for life?



A heavy feeling crept over her when she thought about that.



Just then, Wyatt's voice cut through her anxiety with a gentle question. "Have you ever thought about working for the Stewart Group?"



Shock filled Amelia's eyes as she stared at the man beside her.


With a small cough, Wyatt continued, "Your achievements at Kretol University haven't gone unnoticed. If you're interested, the Stewart Group could use someone like you. In fact, I need a secretary, and there happens to be an opening."


From the front seat, Davin saw Wyatt's serious demeanor through the rearview mirror, and the corners of his mouth twitched.



Not once had Davin ever heard Wyatt mention needing a new secretary.



Wyatt's words brought a hint of delight to Amelia's eyes.



Landing a role at the Stewart Group was every job seeker's dream. Yet, as her excitement faded, Amelia felt a wave of hesitation.



Working as Wyatt's secretary would be no easy task,and with two years away from the workforce,her confidence wavered. Was she up for the task?



"Should you be interested, Miss Flynn, you're welcome to a month-long trial. At the end of your internship, whether you want to stay or not is entirely your choice," Wyatt said.



Some of Amelia's unease slipped away with that proposal. The last thing she wanted was for others to believe she'd coasted on family ties.



A trial period would give her a chance to prove herself, and time at the Stewart Group could only sharpen her skills, making it easier for her to take  over and manage the Flynn Group in the future.



"Miss Flynn, the Stewart Group provides the best benefits in Kretol. Even during the trial period, the base salary for Mr. Stewart's secretary is twenty thousand, with triple pay for regular overtime and quintuple pay for holidays," Davin said.



"You talk too much," Wyatt scolded, but his glance at Davin carried a hint of approval, as if saying, "Well done."



Wyatt's mention of a trial period had already swayed Amelia's decision, and Davin's words only made her want to accept the offer more.



Considering the road ahead, Amelia decided to be honest."Mr.Stewart, after our marriage, I still want to keep working. Will you support that?"


"Miss Flynn, do you remember our conversation at Hillside Villa?" Wyatt said.



Without giving her a chance to reply, he added,"Marriage won't change your freedom.Whatever you choose, you'll always have my support."


That promise swept away the last of her worries.Amelia reached into her bag, pulled out her resume,and handed it to Wyatt with a cheerful grin. "Here you go, Mr. Stewart. This is my resume."


The Stewart Group's recruitment and HR matters were handled by dedicated staff, so Wyatt didn't need to deal with them personally.


It was the first time he had personally reviewed someone's resume, and he read it very carefully.


As Wyatt combed through her achievements, Amelia took out her certificates for him to see. Each one got his full attention.


On the surface, Wyatt remained calm, but inside, he was genuinely impressed. Amelia was truly exceptional.


Watching from the front, Davin saw the big pile of certificates and suddenly felt pressured himself.


Amelia waited, nerves fluttering, until Wyatt set aside the resume, turned to her, and reached out his hand with a warm smile. "Miss Flynn, I have great confidence in your abilities. You can join the Stewart Group."
###Chapter 34 Laura's Invitation





When Wyatt reached out to.shake Amelia's hand, a spark lit up in her eyes. She caught hold of his hand and, with a teasing wink, said, "Thank you, Mr.Stewart, for believing in me. I promise to give my best and never let you down."


Driving Amelia back to her apartment, Wyatt reminded her to visit the Stewart Group within three days for onboarding and confirmed their dinner plans with Della.



Wyatt's show of encouragement chased away every dark thought in Amelia's mind that was caused by Laura.



Bursting with excitement, Amelia hurried to tell her grandmother the good news. However, on the way to the hospital, she received a call from Laura.


Laura's voice sounded warm, mentioning how they hadn't seen each other lately. She invited Amelia to join her for dinner tonight.



Thinking back on Laura's past tricks made Amelia pause, but she chose to accept the invitation, out of respect for what they'd once shared.


During their call, Laura slyly brought up the auction,pretending to worry about Amelia while actually criticizing her.


Whatever joy Amelia felt evaporated after the call.Not wanting her grandmother to see her upset, she only called her grandmother, giving up on the idea of visiting.


After the call, she fired off a quick message to.Wyatt,asking whether he could share some security footage from Pearl Bay Auction House with her.


Several minutes ticked by with no response, leaving Amelia to wonder if she had crossed a line by asking Wyatt for that.



Right as she was about to send another message to him,Wyatt's name flashed on her screen-a video call request.


On her screen, she noticed his background-a sleek conference room. He seemed to be in a meeting.



"I'm in the middle of something here, so I can't talk long. Davin will contact you. Just let him know what you need, and he'll take care of it," Wyatt said.


Understanding he was busy, Amelia hurried to apologize, her face showing genuine regret as she reached to end the call.


But Wyatt's expression softened as he said, "It makes me happy that you'd reach out to me first when you needed help."


His words made Amelia's face flush. She ended the call in a hurry. After a while, her phone rang with Davin's call.



After a brief explanation to Davin, the video footage she needed was sent to her.


With the footage of Jaxton and Dayna at the auction in hand, Amelia headed straight for the Morrison family's residence.



***



Inside the Morrison family's home.


Dayna's words had twisted Jaxton's thinking,convincing him that Amelia had set him up during the auction. A heavy resentment for her took root in his heart.



With his eyes scanning the dining table filled with delicious dishes, Jaxton's face was dark, not a trace of warmth in his demeanor.


Spotting Jaxton's sour mood and worryingit might sour the evening's plans, Laura took a moment to clarify why she had really asked Amelia over for dinner.



Given her understanding of Amelia, Laura was confident Amelia wouldn't cross any boundaries, so she wasn't concerned about Amelia's interactions with the man she was supposedly involved with.


Back in the day, Laura herself had forged connections for the sake of the Morrison family's business.



Her intention in inviting Amelia today was to leverage Amelia's connection with the mysterious man, as anyone who could access the second floor of Pearl Bay Auction House was of significant status.



Understanding exactly what his mother was plotting,Jaxton fumed on the inside but bit his tongue. He knew arguing with Laura was a lost cause.



The moment Amelia stepped through the front door,Laura greeted her with a warmth that seemed almost rehearsed, guiding her straight to the dining room.



"Amelia, I asked the chef to make some of your favorite dishes. Please tell me if there's anything else you're craving. I'll have it made right away," Laura said.



For the first time in two years, Amelia saw several dishes she genuinely liked set out before her in the Morrison family's house, which made her confused. This was odd.



Not quite able to read Laura's intentions, Amelia quietly took her seat, deciding to wait and see what would happen next.


Sure enough, as soon as Amelia picked up her fork,Laura said, "Amelia, I already scolded Jaxton. I instructed him clearly to take you to the Pearl Bay Auction House, but | didn't expect him not to follow my order. But Jaxton mentioned seeing you with someone else there. Why didn't you say something about that to me before?"



Amelia knew that if Laura had truly wanted her to attend with Jaxton, she could have called her to inform her of it before. She saw through Laura and Jaxton's little performance, finding the whole act faintly amusing, though she kept her expression perfectly composed.
###Chapter 35 Falling Out





Laura mistook Amelia's quietness for guilt, and a trace of satisfaction flickered across her face.



She shot Jaxton a warning look to stop him from saying anything, then said, "Amelia, to avoid any misunderstanding, would you mind telling me who accompanied you to the Pearl Bay Auction House?"


At the sound of Laura's question,Amelia-who had been studying the floor-lifted her gaze, startled.


She wasn't foolish. She understood the implication behind Laura's words immediately.



She pretended not to understand the meaning of Laura's words; instead, shepresented the video that Davin had sent her to Laura.



Everything that had happened at the auction appeared plainly on the screen, and Laura's expression shifted the moment she saw Dayna in the footage.



The moment Jaxton saw Laura like that, dread settled in his gut. He pointed a shaky finger at Amelia, asking, "What did you just show my mother?

You-"



"Shut up!" Laura cut him off, stormed forward, and slapped him before he could finish speaking.



Jaxton had put up with plenty of lectures from his mother over the years, but this was the first time she'd struck him while someone else was present.



Shocked, he pressed a hand to his cheek, eyes wide."Mom, how could you hit me because of Amelia?Have you lost your mind?"



Regret flickered in Laura's eyes after the slap, but Jaxton's outburst made her itch to strike him again.Still, she restrained herself since Amelia was here.



Fixing Jaxton with a hard glare, she said, "What did you promise me? How dare you drag Dayna to the Pearl Bay Auction House and stir up trouble? And you're even blaming Amelia for everything?"



Those words wiped the anger right off Jaxton's face,leaving him speechless.


Only then did Laura turn back to Amelia. "Yes, Jaxton made a mistake, but he probably acted out of frustration. You're his fiancée, after all. If you went out to work, our family's reputation would be affected.What you did-"



"To protect the Morrison family's reputation, you even contacted all those company heads behind my back so none of them would hire me,"Amelia said.



If Laura hadn't brought up work, Amelia might have kept pretending like nothing had happened.



But now, Amelia didn't want to put up with this any longer. "Sorry to disappoint you, Laura, but l've already found a job. I'll start working soon."


"Who do you think you are, talking to my mother like that? Clearly, you have no sense of respect!" Jaxton exclaimed. Mockery flickered in Amelia's eyes as she met Jaxton's glare. "Of all people, Jaxton, you should be the last to talk to me about respect."



"You-"



"Enough! I don't want to hear another word from either of you!"



Laura's stern command sliced through the room.After collecting herself with a slow breath, she turned to Amelia.



"You don't seem to understand. I'm trying to protect you. Our family's reputation demands that you act with dignity. How could you go out to work like you are just an ordinary person?"she said.



After a pause, she continued, "So, which company hired you? I'll help you resign soon."


As she said this, Laura was filled with anger. She wanted to see which company would dare ignore her influence and hire Amelia.



She even suspected that Amelia might only be bluffing.


Amelia said, "Actually, Laura, I'll be joining the Stewart Group. I doubt you have enough influence to make the Stewart Group heed your wishes. When I begin working, I won't have as much time to drop by.You should know this. I have other matters to attend to, so I'll take my leave now. Enjoy your meal."


She then picked up her bag and left the Morrison home without a backward glance.



The idea of mentioning the cancellation of her engagement toLaura had crossed Amelia's mind more times than she could count, but she had held back. Still, today, she had truly fallen out with the Morrison family.


Laura watched Amelia go, lost in thought. Jaxton said to her, "Mom, look at her. She doesn't show you the slightest bit of respect anymore."


"That's enough. Don't make things any worse.Amelia just wants a job; it's hardly a crime. If that's her wish, let her do it," Laura said. "Have you completely lost your senses, Mom?"Jaxton asked.
###Chapter 36 Having A Meal With Della And Her Friends
Laura burned with frustration at Jaxton's shortsightedness, her temper simmering. Yet, when she noticed the bright red imprint on his cheek, she forced herself to remain calm. With a steady breath,she explained, "You really don't understand this, do you? We're talking about the Stewart Group here.The bidding for the east side project in Kretol is about to begin. If we use our connection to Amelia to approach the Stewart Group, we'll have a real advantage. Mr. Wyatt Stewart himself recommended this project. If our family gets the contract, our status in Kretol will significantly rise."


By now, Jaxton finally grasped Laura's point.



But recalling Amelia's resolute demeanor earlier Jaxton questioned skeptically, "Mom, do you think Amelia will help us connect with the Stewart Group?" Laura felt her patience wearing thin again upon hearing Jaxton's words. "Had you stayed away from Dayna, Amelia would never have turned against you.Jaxton, you must trust my judgment. Let Dayna go and devote yourself to Amelia."


Jaxton's irritation was clear, but Laura refused to force him to agree this time. Choosing a gentler approach, she said to him, "No matter how attached you are to Dayna, keep Amelia content at least until the project is ours. If another disaster like the auction occurs, I'll have no choice but to tell your father everything."


Jaxton's stubbornness crumbled when he realized the weight of his mother's warning.



Amelia had just left the Morrison residence when her phone rang with Monroe's name lighting up the screen.



She barely had time to say hello before Monroe blurted out, "Amelia, I have huge news for you!"


Monroe's usual energy had become more measured after years working in business, but excitement now bubbled in his voice.



The change in his mood brought a smile to Amelia's face. Teasingly, she replied, "What is it, Monroe? Are you finally tying the knot? That would be news worth celebrating."


With a dramatic roll of his eyes, Monroe couldn't help but smile as he replied, "Your stepmother just sold a stash of jewelry today, Amelia. Are the Flynns heading for financial ruin?"


After that, concern edged into Monroe's tone. "If the Flynn family really does go under, will you be all right?"



It only took a moment for Amelia to guess the reason behind the sale.



Dayna's empty pockets had likely pushed Janessa to sell off her jewelry to help her.


No one understood the selfishness of Amelia's father better than she did. She knew Janessa was left out  of the Flynn fortune.


"Monroe, can you get hold of those jewelry pieces?"Amelia asked.



"I probably can, but why do you want them?Honestly, these aren't nearly as good as the pieces you gave me."


"I have my plans for them," Amelia replied.


"Fine, I'll make sure they're delivered to your apartment as soon as I can."


The next day, Amelia chose a refined outfit before heading to a restaurant downtown.



A waiter led her to a private dining room on the second floor.


The moment she stepped through the door, Amelia wondered for a second if she'd entered the wrong room. At the center of the room, Della sat waiting for her.


Seated on either side of Della were two elegantly  dressed women, their eyes locking on Amelia the moment she entered.


Although several sets of eyes watched her, Amelia could sense nothing but warmth and a lively curiosity, which she worked hard to disregard.


Before she could offer a greeting to Della, Della had already stood up and clasped her hand. "Amelia,you are finally here."


Spotting Della's attempt to pull out a chair for her,Amelia quickly put a stop to it.


Choosing not to protest, Della stopped the gesture and sat down beside Amelia. Pride gleamed in her gaze as she turned to the other women. "Take a good look at Amelia. She is gorgeous, isn't she? Oh,remember your manners, and don't startle her."


Thanks to Della's introductions, Amelia finally learned the identities of the two women. The poised lady on the left turned out to be Holley Green,Wyatt's aunt. The woman on the right was Malinda Mills, Colton's mother. Holley,who had made the trip from Prevda, was both gentle and smart, known for her savvy in business.She'd come here after hearing whispers about her exceptional nephew's mysterious girlfriend.


From her very first look at Amelia, Holley understood why her nephew, who was notoriously picky with women, was smitten with her. Amelia was captivating.


Holley herself found it difficult to look away from Amelia's striking features.


While Holley admired Amelia with quiet appreciation,Malinda looked at Amelia with curiosity.


When Colton had first mentioned a woman in Wyatt's life, Malinda had doubted him completely.


However, watching Della interact with Amelia changed her mind in a heartbeat.


Their small talk drifted on until the waiter began to serve the dishes.



While Amelia didn't adore every single dish, she  found that most of them were to her liking.



Still, being surrounded by unfamiliar faces left her slightly unsettled.



She couldn't help but wish Wyatt were there. She felt she would be more at ease with him present.



Noticing her discomfort, Della spoke up. "Wyatt had planned to be here, but he was called to an urgent meeting at the company. He puts work above everything, and that's wrong. But don't worry,Amelia. I'll have a word with him on your behalf later!"


"That's all right, Mrs. Stewart. I-"


"Please, don't call me Mrs. Stewart. It sounds too formal," Della interjected. "Just call me Della."



Calling Della by her first name, Amelia recognized,made them feel closer to each other.



When she noticed Della's encouraging look, Amelia smiled and addressed her as "Della," which brought a spark of joy to Della's face. Throughout the meal, Della went out of her way to look after Amelia, ensuring that her plate was never empty.


On the other side of the table, Malinda's and Holley's reactions were different.


Della's fondness for Amelia prompted Malinda to silently consider her impression of Amelia, while a subtle glimmer of regret crossed Holley's eyes.
###Chapter 37 I'll Be Amelia's Husband Soon
After more than an hour had slipped by, every person at the table finally set down their cutlery.


Throughout the meal, Della's kindness had made Amelia feel right at home. Just as Amelia was preparing to say her goodbyes, the private room's door swung open with a soft creak.



Wyatt stepped inside and took in the scene. His eyes flickered with surprise at the sight of extra guests,and his brows knitted together.



When he saw Amelia's composed expression, he relaxed his brows. He then offered a polite greeting to Della's friends.



From her seat, Della caught the subtle change in her son's face and shot him a teasing glance. "I'm still at this table, you know. Are you afraid Amelia might be picked on? You rushed here like a knight in shining armor, looking so worried about her."


"I was just nearby and thought I'd stop by," Wyatt said.



While she could have called out his fib, Della chose not to. She simply told him to drive Amelia home.



***



"I didn't know my mother had invited her friends to the meal. Sorry about that."


Wyatt turned to Amelia and apologized the moment he settled into the driver's seat.


If not for the last-minute crisis at work, he would never have left Amelia on her own for the meal. He only hoped the evening hadn't left her feeling uncomfortable.



Seeing the concern in Wyatt's eyes, Amelia felt warmth spread through her chest.


She answered with a lighthearted smile, "Don't worry about it. We're going to be family, so this is bound to happen anyway."


With those words, Wyatt felt the tension leave his shoulders. Soon, the car arrived at the destination.


As Amelia stepped out of the car, she noticed that Wyatt also got out. He then pulled a velvet box in deep blue from his pocket.



"My mom asked me to give you this. She wanted you to have it," he said.



Amelia couldn't help but wonder why Della hadn't handed over the gift herself earlier, but the reason became clear as soon as she opened the box.



Resting inside the box was a stunning brooch, its sapphire stone as big as her thumb and shimmering in the light.



The sapphire alone was immensely valuable and rare.


Amelia felt a wave of gratitude, yet she couldn't bring herself to accept something so expensive. She snapped the box shut and immediately tried to return it to Wyatt. "Could you let Della know I'm truly grateful for her generosity? But I can't accept something this valuable."


"If you refuse it, you should return it to her yourself,Miss Flynn. My mother won't spare me if I do it in your place. Surely you wouldn't want me to get scolded by her, right? Besides, if you don't accept it now, after we're married, you'll have to accept it then anyway."



Confusion flickered across Amelia's face as she looked at Wyatt.



Wyatt wasted no time. He pulled the brooch out and fastened it to her dress. Today, Amelia wore a beige spaghetti-strap dress and a soft wool cardigan.



Even though his fingers never brushed her skin, a warm blush crept up her cheeks.



"This brooch is a Stewart family heirloom meant for my parents' daughter-in-law. It looks perfect on you,"Wyatt said. "Amelia?"



Amelia had just parted her lips to respond when Monroe's voice drifted over from a distance.



From his car, Monroe saw Wyatt's gesture, mistook him for Jaxton, and nearly stormed out to intervene.


When the car drew closer, Monroe realized that the man with Amelia was not Jaxton. However, Wyatt's face seemed even more intimidating than Jaxton's to Monroe.



Due to the Smith family's business ties, Monroe had met Wyatt on a few occasions before.


He didn't understand how Amelia knew Wyatt, but considering the Stewart family's status in Kretol and afraid that Amelia would get bullied, Monroe immediately positioned himself protectively in front of her.



Wyatt looked at Monroe with no recognition. Seeing Monroe's stance and hearing him address Amelia like that made him feel animosity toward Monroe. His  eyes grew frosty until Amelia stepped in, pulled Monroe aside, and introduced Monroe to him.


Learning Monroe was, like Carlee, a friend from Amelia's college days, the coldness in Wyatt's expression quickly faded.


Wyatt reached out his hand to Monroe with a genuine smile. "Nice to meet you. I'm Wyatt Stewart,and I'll be Amelia's husband soon."
###Chapter 38 If You Ever Cause Her Pain,I Won't Let You Off





Monroe had come here to deliver something to Amelia. Wyatt's words caused the box in Monroe's hand to fall to the ground with a thud.


Gemstones and jewelry-once owned by Janessa-scattered in every direction, but shock kept Monroe rooted to the spot.


For a moment, he stared at Wyatt. Instinctively, his hand reached toward Amelia; he wanted to tug at her and ask her if Wyatt's words were true, but before he could touch her, Wyatt stopped him.


He then saw Wyatt's cold, intense stare.



Wyatt's glare alone seemed to warn him that touching Amelia would have consequences, and Monroe quickly snatched his hand back. Still desperate for answers, he asked, "Mr. Stewart,what  do you mean by that?"


Amelia had planned to tell Monroe about Wyatt later,but the current situation forced her to explain things to him now.



In the past couple of years, Monroe had stepped into his family's business and witnessed firsthand the ugly side of the wealthy. After he listened to Amelia's explanation, a deep crease formed between his brows.



But he didn't say anything, simply gathering up the scattered jewelry and offering it to Amelia before leaving.


Looking at the items in her hands with a hint of disdain, Wyatt asked, "What are these?"


"These are what my stepmother sold off," Amelia replied.


After hearing this, Wyatt asked, "Should I help the Flynn Group find new business deals? Or do you want me to invest in shares under your name?" For a brief moment, surprise flickered across Amelia's face before she burst out laughing.



With a smile, she shared the story behind the jewelry,explaining the situation. Wyatt really hadn't expected that the Flynn family had been treating her so poorly.



After hearing everything, Wyatt said, "If you want,Amelia, I can make the Flynn family disappear from Kretol overnight."



Amelia looked at his earnest expression. There had been moments she had wanted revenge, but thinking of her mother, she gave up on the idea.


Not noticing that Wyatt had changed how he addressed her, she gently replied, "Let me handle things with the Flynn family myself. Still, I really appreciate what you're willing to do, Mr. Stewart, but this is something I have to do on my own-"



"Amelia, don't you think it's about time you changed the way you address me? We are, after all, about to get married soon," Wyatt interjected. Though he typically paid little mind to how people addressed him, something about Monroe's easy manner with Amelia had struck a nerve and made him want to say this.



Amelia, unaware of Wyatt's thoughts, agreed that their relationship warranted a change in how she addressed him.



She looked at him and asked, "Would you like me to call you Wyatt from now on?"


When Amelia said his first name, an unfamiliar sensation stirred inside Wyatt, and he quickly gave his approval.



After Wyatt's car pulled away, Amelia stepped inside her apartment, the box of jewelry clutched securely in her hand.



Setting her priorities straight, she decided to first put away the brooch Wyatt had given her.


Fully aware of what it meant, she knew she couldn't just give it back, but she also knew/it deserved better treatment than the rest of her jewelry. So, she carefully locked it away in her safe.


Wyatt, meanwhile, left in high spirits in his car, a hint of a smile on his lips, until he noticed the vehicle parked down the street.


Spotting Wyatt's car, Monroe wasted no time and stepped out of his own car.


Wyatt motioned for his driver to stop, then got out of the car to walk over to Monroe.



Neither man spoke right away. The silence between them stretched as they sized each other up.



Eventually, Monroe couldn't keep silent. "Mr. Stewart whatever your reason is for marrying Amelia, if you ever cause her pain, I won't let you off!"


His long friendship with Amelia meant he wouldn't just stand by if anyone hurt her.


Even facing someone as influential as Wyatt, he resolved to look out for Amelia, remembering all the kindness Amelia's mother had shown him before. He knew his bold words might not sit well with Wyatt,but his eyes held steady, unflinching.


"No one's ever had the nerve to threaten me before.You realize a single word from me could ruin your entire family, right?" Wyatt said.
###Chapter 39 Leave, Or I'll Get Security To Toss You Out
Monroe's confidence weakened, but his resolve stayed firm. "If you hurt Amelia, my parents won't stand idly by."



Wyatt's expression, usually cold as steel,unexpectedly softened after Monroe's words.


A spark of admiration flickered across his face. "Mr.Smith, you're worrying over nothing. The scenario you fear simply won't happen."


"So tell me, Mr. Stewart, when the day comes that Amelia no longer holds your interest, will you allow her to leave on her own terms?"



With years of business acumen, Monroe knew how to read people's expressions. Picking up on Wyatt's change in attitude, he pressed further.


He always understood that once Amelia tied her fate  to Wyatt's, her freedom would only come at Wyatt's bidding.



If these words came from anyone else, Wyatt would have dismissed them outright. But seeing the concern in Monroe's gaze, he replied calmly, "This isn't your affair to meddle in, and my feelings for her are not some passing fancy."



Ending the conversation there, Wyatt turned away and climbed into his car.


Monroe stared after the vehicle as it disappeared, his thoughts circling around Wyatt's words just now.


Had Wyatt harbored feelings for Amelia all along?


Still, as someone who had known Amelia since childhood, Monroe had never heard her mention any connection to Wyatt before.


Settling into the driver's seat in his car, Monroe reached for his phone, tempted for a moment to dig up information on Wyatt.

 
But he talked himself out of it almost instantly.  After a while, he called Carlee.


Once the line connected, Monroe wasted no time."What's really happening between Amelia and Wyatt?"


"You finally found out about their relationship?"


Carlee's reply held a note of surprise. For a second,Monroe let it slide, but then, realization dawned. "So you've been keeping this from me all along."


"Yeah. Remember that night I took Amelia out for drinks? We bumped into Wyatt..."



Monroe's grip on the steering wheel tightened after he listened to Carlee recount the bar incident. "How could you keep such a big secret from me? Next time you go out partying, don't expect me to cover for you with your father!"



Carlee, hearing this, became anxious and quickly divulged everything she knew. She warned him to keep things quiet, especially since Wyatt's and Amelia's reputation was on the line. After all,  Amelia's engagement with the Morrison family still hadn't been called off.



But Monroe couldn't focus on anything else and directly asked, "Was Wyatt really not able to perform in bed?"


Hearing that, Carlee let loose a string of curses and ended the call, leaving Monroe with an odd look lingering on his face.



Monroe hadn't expected that the supposed reason behind Amelia's marriage to Wyatt would be something so bizarre.


***



At five in the evening, Amelia drove to the Flynn Group.


Before Katrina's passing, Amelia had often visited Flynn Group, but she hadn't been here once in the past two years.



Cradling a box against her chest, she stepped inside and found her path blocked by the company's new  receptionist.


Amelia wasted no time and introduced herself, only to be greeted with mocking laughter.


"Miss Flynn practically lives here. If you want to pretend you're her, you should've considered plastic surgery to change your face first."


The receptionist had never seen Amelia before, but she recognized Dayna, who came to the company often.



She thought Amelia was pretending to be Dayna.


Memories of expensive presents from Dayna flashed in the receptionist's mind, and she looked at Amelia with disdain. "Leave, or I'll get security to toss you out."



Amelia's stare turned cold after she heard that.



It was a cruel twist. Her mother's company had become a playground for her father's illegitimate daughter, while she was barred from even stepping inside.  Pulling out her phone, Amelia scrolled for Ricky's number and dialed, refusing to back down.


The receptionist's suspicion grew when she caught sight of Amelia's calm determination, but she quickly brushed it off when the call didn't connect. Clearly,she thought, Amelia was just putting on a show.


"Stop wasting my time. This isn't the place for-""Amelia?"



Before the receptionist could finish speaking, a striking figure walked over and embraced Amelia.
###Chapter 40 The Flynn Group Will Be In Her Hands
The woman was dressed head to toe in crisp white.Her suit radiated confidence and polish, lending her an air of authority that outshone her unremarkable features.



That close embrace between the woman and Amelia caught the receptionist off guard, erasing any trace of smugness from her expression. Her face turned pale in an instant.


"M-Ms. Kirby, do you know her?" she stammered.


"Absolutely. This is Mr. Flynn's daughter."


That response left the receptionist even more baffled. If Amelia was Mr. Flynn's daughter, then who had she been seeing as Mr. Flynn's daughter all this time?



Brushing off the receptionist's confusion, Dalia Kirby reached for Amelia's hand, her eyes bright with emotion. "Why didn't you let me know you'd be coming by? Two years have passed since | saw you last. Since Katrina's death, I... Oh, I shouldn't have brought that up."



Back in college, Dalia had led an ordinary life util Katrina spotted her potential, helping her become both a shareholder and a cornerstone of the Flynn Group.



To Dalia, Katrina had been more than a mentor; she'd been a guiding force in life. Dalia, nearly fifty,had never married, and because of Katrina, she always treated Amelia as her own.



For two years, Amelia hadn't seen Dalia, aware that Ricky had made Dalia's work life miserable,constantly scheming to remove her from the company.



After a brief exchange with Dalia, Amelia approached the smug receptionist with a cold glare. "You are fired." The receptionist was shocked at first. Then, her fear hardened into defiance. "Being the CEO's daughter doesn't give you the right to fire me. You're only abusing your power by doing this."


Before another protest could rise, Amelia met her glare and asked, "Do you even recall the very first rule in the Flynn Group's handbook?"


She then recited in a gentle but unwavering tone,"Every employee must treat others with dignity and greet all visitors kindly. You broke those rules today,so you can be fired."


"Even if that's true, you don't have the right to fire me. Only management can let someone go, and you're not even part of the leadership here."


Dalia didn't know what had happened between Amelia and the receptionist, but seeing the receptionist's attitude, she quickly said, "And who told you she's not part of the Flynn Group's management team? Amelia holds the largest stake in this entire company. If anyone has the power to remove a receptionist like you, it's her. Sooner or later, even the Flynn Group will be in her hands."


Soon,security escorted the receptionist away.


Word of the incident traveled fast, reaching Ricky. He quickly asked Amelia and Dalia to come to his office.


Truthfully, Ricky had known the moment Amelia set foot in theFlynn Group. Instead of welcoming her, he had ignored her call on purpose, hoping to teach her a lesson.


Seeing Dalia standing firmly beside Amelia only deepened the bitterness in Ricky's eyes.



Almost everyone Katrina trusted had either been forced out of the company or had turned into Ricky's supporters-except for Dalia.



Reflecting on Dalia's support for Amelia, Ricky fixed his cold stare on Amelia. "Who said you could wNaltz in here? What are you doing here, flaunting your power like this?"


Dalia's temper flared instantly, and she nearly snapped, but Amelia reached out and stopped her. "Let me speak to my father alone, Dalia. You should go and focus on your work," Amelia said.


As she spoke, Amelia gently soothed Dalia with a gentle touch.


Years of experience had taught Dalia restraint, and she caught herself before acting rashly.



Watching Amelia's calm resolve, Dalia offered Ricky a smirk that bordered on taunting before she turned to leave.


Ricky, still nursing his injured back, couldn't sit for a long time. The sight of Amelia calmly sitting down only fueled his irritation.


Instead of immediately presenting the thing she had to Ricky, Amelia took her time and let her gaze drift around the office.



Not a trace remained of Katrina's influence, even though this had once been her office.

 
"You shouldn't be here, Amelia. You need to leave now," Ricky said. Every time he saw her, he couldn't help but think of Katrina and the sixty percent of company shares Amelia controlled.



Although Amelia couldn't control those shares,neither could he claim them as his own. As the CEO of the Flynn Group, he held only fifteen percent of the shares, and thinking about this made him furious.



Katrina's careful planning haunted him, even after her death.



"Since I'll inherit this company one day, shouldn'tI get a head start now? Or are you not planning to hand the company over to me?"



Amelia's words only deepened the scowl on Ricky's face.



He would rather die than hand the company over to her.



Still, the truth about the shares forced him to hold his tongue about his thoughts, since the board kept a tight grip on the shares. Thinking about that, Ricky tried a gentler tone."You're still young, Amelia. There's no rush to take on such burdens. Running this company is nothing like you imagine. If something goes wrong under your management, you will feel guilty towards your mother."



It was clear he had no intention of giving an inch.


Amelia had already seen through him and had spoken only to press his buttons. She was patient-she intended to reclaim the Flynn Group, no matter how long it took.



She straightened, nudging a box across the desk toward Ricky.


Seeing this, Ricky was unable to hide his curiosity."What is this?"



"If you want answers, Dad, just open the box and find out for yourself," Amelia replied.
###Chapter 41 Salvage The Flynn Family's Reputation
Curiosity tugged at Ricky, though suspicion darkened his gaze the moment heremembered Amelia was the one who had brought the box here.



His guarded expression did not go unnoticed. With a look brimming with sarcasm, Amelia said, "What's the matter? Do you honestly think I'd smuggle explosives in here just to kill you? I am still here.I'm not about to throw my life away just to get rid of you.I haven't gotten my sixty percent share yet. There's no way I'd die before that."



Her taunt made Ricky's cheeks flush a deep red with anger. The ache in his side kept him from losing his cool, and he opened the box on the desk.


Only sparkling jewelry met his eyes. Relief washed over him, but irritation quickly followed. He shot a glare at Amelia. "Why did you bring jewelry here? What's the point?"



Seeing this, Amelia rose and dumped the jewelry onto the desk.



"Go on. Take a closer look. Don't you think these pieces of jewelry seem a bit familiar?" she said.


Ricky fixed his gaze on the jumble of jewels. Slowly,it dawned on him that these were gifts he had given to Janessa.



Whenever Janessa was around Ricky, she liked to play the part of someone careful with money.She barely wore the jewelry he'd given her, which explained why nothing rang a bell for him at first.


The realization hit hard, and a wave of shock passed over Ricky's face. With a sneer, he turned to Amelia."Did your mother never teach you right from wrong?What gives you the nerve to steal-"



Amelia cut him off by tossing a neat stack of receipts she had gotten from Monroe onto the desk.



The receipts were proof of transactions from selling the jewelry.


Ricky bristled, and the first words out of his mouth were an accusation. "This is impossible! You're making this up!"


"The receipts are real. Take a look at them. You're the CEO of the Flynn Group. Surely, you should be able to tell if the stamps are genuine, right?"


Amelia's words prompted Ricky to examine the stamps carefully.


There was no denying it-they were real.


Janessa had indeed sold the jewelry without a word to him. Even though he'd given the pieces to her, he believed Janessa had no right to sell what belonged to the Flynn family.


To Ricky, these pieces of jewelry were still family property.



Seething,he stuffed the receipts and jewelry back into the box and marched out of the office with it.  The sight sent Amelia trailing after him.



When he heard her footsteps behind him, Ricky's expression turned fierce. He shot her a glare, only to see her extend her hand toward him.



Confused, he stared at her hand.


"You need to pay me. I had to shell out a fortune to buy those pieces of jewelry back. Don't think you can just take them from me like this," Amelia said.


"How much do you want?"



"Fifty million."


Ricky didn't have time to argue with Amelia, but when she named her price, his grip on his phone tightened in anger, and veins bulged across his hand."I bought these for just over ten million, and you're asking for fifty million for me to buy them back now?"



"This isn't about the jewelry. I spent fifty million to salvage the Flynn family's reputation. Do you know what people said when they handed the jewelry to me? They wanted to know if Flynn Group was  bankrupt. If not for the reputation of Flynn Group and the Flynn family, I would never have come here. So,pay up-fifty million, not a penny less!"


Shaking with frustration, Ricky completed the transfer, his warning trailing behind. He insisted Amelia keep quiet about the matter.


No sooner had Ricky left than Amelia made her way to Dalia's office.



As soon as Dalia saw Amelia, she asked worriedly,"How did it go? Did Ricky give you a hard time?"



Waiting anxiously at her desk, Dalia had considered checking on the situation herself, but she'd held back to avoid complicating things for Amelia.



"You don't have to worry about me, Dalia. I know how to deal with my father. What worries me is you-my father views you as a constant obstacle and will do anything to kick you out of the company. Please be careful."



Dalia felt a bittersweet pride learning how well Amelia  had dealt with Ricky.


If only Katrina were still around, Amelia wouldn't have to fight these battles.


Dalia's voice turned serious as she said, "Don't worry. I'll make sure Ricky never gets any leverage over me."


Ricky wanted to oust her and take full control of Flynn Group, but it wouldn't be easy.


For Amelia's sake, she had resolved to stand her ground and remain in the company, no matter what it took.



Dalia looked at Amelia and said, "By the way,according to that agreement, you get those sixty percent shares after you're married. When is your wedding with Jaxton supposed to happen? Tell me solcan-"



"Actually, I'm ending things with Jaxton1," Amelia interjected.


Until this point, she had kept the plan to herself. Still,  the thought that Dalia might reach out to the Morrison family nudged her to reveal her plan now.



She braced herself for objections or questions.But Dalia just squeezed her hand, voice unwavering."Whatever you choose, Amelia, I'll always support you."


So many people had turned their backs since Katrina's passing, but Dalia remained steadfast in loyalty to Katrina, caring for Amelia.



Gratitude filled Amelia, though words felt inadequate.She would carry this kindness with her, always.


Though her main reason for coming here was to tell Dalia about the broken engagement, Amelia also had another matter to discuss with Dalia.



Hearing that Amelia needed her help, Dalia immediately replied, "Just tell me what you need. I'm ready to help."


Amelia glanced at the closed office door, then lowered her voice to whisper a few words in Dalia's ear.



Dalia's face lit up with understanding after hearing Amelia's words. "That will keep Janessa and her daughter busy for a good while. Alright, sit tight-I'l find someone to handle it right away."
###Chapter 42 Exposed





At the Flynn family's residence.



Janessa scraped together everything she could.After pawning her jewelry and pulling from her own savings, she finally managed to piece together a little over twenty million. As she wired the funds to the South Bay Auction House, she felt reluctant.



Meanwhile, Dayna, seated close by, finally let out a deep breath after seeing that, her relief unmistakable.



A moment later, she slipped her arms around Janessa's. Her lower lip stuck out as she said affectionately, "Mom, no one looks out for me like you do."


"This is the last time I'll come to your rescue. I meant what | said. Next time, you'll be on your own,"Janessa said. Her thoughts drifted to the jewelry she had sold.Fixing her eyes on Dayna, she dropped her voice."This matter is solved now, but you must keep this a secret from your father. Don't let him hear a word about it, or-"


Janessa stopped short as Dayna gripped her arm,whispering, "Dad's here."


Janessa's heart skipped a beat.



She cast a quick look at the clock. Ricky was home a full thirty minutes earlier than usual.


Her thoughts ran wild as she recalled her conversation with Dayna just now. Discreetly, she studied Ricky's expression.



Yet, Ricky's expression seemed calm, so she managed a gentle smile and crossed the room toward him. "Why are you home so early today?"



"There's a company charity auction coming up. I need you to give me two necklaces. The ones I gave you last year will do just fine," Ricky said. Janessa's heart sank when she heard Ricky's words.



She had sold those very necklaces. Was this just chance, or had Ricky found out that she had sold them?



Unable to hide her nerves, Janessa glanced at Ricky,who sat down on the sofa. Their eyes met. For a heartbeat, Janessa froze, panic prickling her skin.But then, she drew a steadying breath and willed herself to stay calm.


"Give me a minute; I'll get them for you."


Janessa moved upstairs without showing her nerves,and Ricky's eyes revealed a hint of confusion.



Janessa soon returned, clutching two sparkling diamond necklaces in her hand.



As soon as Ricky caught sight of the obvious fakes,his temper flared.



He snatched the necklaces from her grasp.



Janessa said, "Why insist on these two necklaces? These are the ones you gave me for my birthday last year.l-"



She tried to keep up the act, pretending she hated to let them go, but she didn't manage to finish her sentence. Ricky's hand cracked across her cheek with a force that made the room fall silent.


Five finger marks immediately. appeared on Janessa's face, and a trace of blood seeped from the corner of her mouth, indicating the great force Ricky had used.



Dayna couldn't stand by another moment. She hurried to Janessa's side and glared at Ricky, her voice tight with frustration. "Why are you doing this,Dad?"



Ricky brushed past Dayna's protest, his gaze burning straight into Janessa. "Do you take me for a fool? Or do you think I can't tell these necklaces are fakes?"


Janessa slowly lifted her head, shock clouding her features after she heard Ricky's words. Anxiety raced through her as she thought about the fake jewelry she had stashed away; she had been hoping Ricky would never notice the originals were missing.


Every detail of those replicas had been painstakingly copied, yet Janessa had never imagined Ricky-who had never cared about jewelry-would recognize that they were fake so easily.



A sharp clap from Ricky interrupted her thoughts.Just then, the driver walked over, holding a box."Want to know how I figure out these necklaces are fake?" Ricky asked, his tone icy.



Panic flickered across Janessa's face as her eyes landed on the box.



Without thinking, she fell to her knees. "Please, let me explain,honey."



Dayna also kneeled, tears spilling down her cheeks."Dad, you don't understand! Amelia and her rich backer tricked Jaxton and me from the second floor.They kept pushing up the bid.I-" But as soon as she realized that she said Jaxton's name,Dayna froze.



To her surprise, Ricky's mood shifted, a strange excitement glimmering in his eyes. "Did Amelia go to the second floor at the Pearl Bay Auction House?"


Burning with jealousy, Dayna blurted out, "Amelia didn't go there on her own! Her sugar daddy led her there. Even though she's engaged to Jaxton, she's out there messing around with another man. Does she want the whole family to become a laughingstock because of her? And besides-"



"Enough! I told you to stay away from Jaxton. Why didn't you listen?"



A sharp chill had settled into Ricky's voice, stripped of the warmth he usually reserved for Dayna.



Confusion clouded Dayna's eyes, her father's sudden harshness toward her baffling. But Janessa,who had been with Ricky for years, instantly understood him. She said to Ricky in a soft voice, "Don't take it out on her. Dayna never meant to upset you. She only went with Jaxton to meet some of the city's most respected people and support our family.If not for her, we would never have found out that Amelia had connections with such a powerful figure. It's strange she hasn't introduced that figure to us yet, don't you think?"
###Chapter 43 The New Hire





Ricky let Janessa's explanation settle, choosing to drop the subject of the jewelry for now. Instead,his mind circled around the mystery of Amelia's new social ties.



On his way out of the living room, he announced a new demand: Janessa would be responsible for submitting a full account of every household expense at the end of each month from now on.



Janessa put on a calm smile and nodded in agreement, but the second Ricky disappeared from her sight, she slammed her water glass onto the table. Fury sparked in her eyes as she glanced toward the doorway.


Kretol's wealthy wives seemed to bask in luxury, yet she stood out as the exception.


"How did Dad end up with the jewelry you sold,Mom?" Dayna asked. Not answering the question, Janessa snatched up her phone and dialed a number. "Has anyone visited Ricky at work today?"



"Miss Amelia Flynn visited him today," the voice on the other end of the line replied.



Janessa's eyes flashed with malice.



Realizing Amelia must have handed the jewelry to Ricky, Dayna immediately burst out with a curse.


Ricky, after stepping out of the house, first thought about talking to Amelia to get information about that influential figure. He then changed his mind moments later and told his assistant to investigate the matter.


***



At precisely nine the next morning, Amelia arrived at the.Stewart Group's main entrance.



Learning from her previous experience at the Flynn Group, she sent Davin a message in advance.



Settling into a seat in the lobby, she didn't have to wait long before Davin approached her. "Miss Flynn,sorry to keep you waiting. Let me take you to complete the onboarding process."



"Thank you so much."


"Don't mention it, Mss Flynn. Let me know if you run into any issues during your internship."



Knowing that in a matter of weeks Amelia would be his boss' wife made Davin eager to teat her with respect and care.



Amelia wanted to keep things under the radar, which was the whole reason she had texted Davin to help her with this. What she didn't realize was that Davin only listened to Wyatt when it came to matters inside the company.



So, when the receptionists saw Davin come to greet Amelia, they immediately spread the news in the company chat.



Soon, the whole company chat was buzzing about the mysterious new hire. Davin led Amelia upstairs in the CEO's private elevator. As they entered the CEO's office, Amelia saw Wyatt at work for the first time, looking serious and focused.



Dressed in a jet-black suit, with those gleaming silver cufflinks, Wyatt had a touch of aloof elegance.


When Davin made his quiet exit, the vast office suddenly felt even bigger, and Amelia found herself a bit nervous being alone with Wyatt here.



Wyatt's voice rumbled through the quiet office,drawing Amelia's attention. "Come here and sit down."



As soon as Amelia sat on the sofa, a glass of mango juice was placed in front of her.


The sweet, fruity aroma of mango drifted up,soothing her nerves in an instant.


"Your official role mnay be secretary, but I expect you to handle much more. Overtime could become a regular thing. Can you accept that?" Wyatt said. "That's completely fine with me," Amelia responded without a moment's hesitation to Wyatt's inquiry.



Determination had brought her to the Stewart Group.She was here to work and gain experience, not to enjoy any special favors.


Wyatt caught her steady gaze, and he smiled faintly."Relax. Whenever work feels too heavy, feel free to tell me."


Perhaps because they were in his office, their conversation was rather formal.


A soft knock at the door soon echoed, and Davin stepped inside, ready to escort Amelia to her office.


Amelia stood up, but Wyatt reached for her hand with a gentle, lingering touch to stop her.


His touch radiated warmth, sending a flutter through her heart.



Releasing her hand with care, Wyatt pressed the juice glass back into her grip. "Don't rush off just yet.Finish your drink first." Amelia downed the rest of the juice in one go, and without looking at Wyatt, she hurried out the door.



Wyatt watched her leave, his smile widening.


After exiting Wyatt's office, Amelia followed Davin down a sunlit hallway toward a room.



A gold-lettered sign marked the room as the "Administrative Services Department."



Davin's arrival brought the room to a standstill as every employee paused to look up.



"Everyone, meet Amelia Flynn, the new secretary for Mr.Stewart."



A round of applause swept through the room,and Amelia took the moment to observe her new colleagues.



Six desks filled the office, though one remained empty-her new workspace. Four men and one woman were looking at her with open curiosity.


Once Amelia sat down, Davin turned to the only woman there. "Sally, you'll be showing Amelia the ropes for the next few days."



Wearing a crisp blue blazer and rocking a sleek bob,Sally Jimenez gave off an air of competence.


With a confident smile, she replied to Davin, "You can count on me. Amelia's in good hands."
###Chapter 44 Being Ostracized





Sally waited until Davin had left before reaching for a thick file. "Take a look at the Stewart Group employee handbook. You'll want to read it," she said to Amelia.



Amelia reached out to take it, but Sally dropped the manual onto Amelia's desk with a thud.



Feeling displeased but careful to hide it, Amelia managed a polite thank you.



Settling into her chair, Amelia became aware of sidelong glances from the other employees. Each time she looked up to meet their eyes, they turned away quickly.


Still, Amelia caught a few unfriendly glances-some mocking, some dismissive.



Drawing in a steady breath, she reminded herself to stay composed, then opened the handbook and began to read.



Sally offered Amelia nothing beyond the manual for the rest of the morning.



Even when Amelia tried to ask Sally about her duties,Sally brushed her off with vague answers and little patience.



By the third time Amelia tried to talk to Sally, Sally's irritation was plain. "I have too much on my plate to be interrupted unless it's urgent. I and the other employees here have no connections in the company. If we don't do our jobs well, we'll be fired."


Those words explained a lot to Amelia. Suddenly,the cold shoulders around the office made sense.



She had indeed gotten in through her connections with Wyatt, so it wasn't entirely wrong for Sally and the others to dislike her for that.



Amelia said nothing more. Noticing Amelia's silence,Sally and her colleagues' disdain toward her became even more apparent. Getting hired at the Stewart Group required top-tier talent and determination. Each of them had fought for their spot.


None of them felt any urge to cozy up to someone who got in by connections.



Amelia spent the day in silence, loneliness settling in as the hours crawled by. After work, when the office emptied, she lingered, slumping over her desk,weighed down by disappointment.



Just then, her phone vibrated, snapping her out of her gloom.


It was a message from Wyatt. "Come downstairs."


Composing herself first, Amelia made sure not to look upset before getting inside Wyatt's car.



"So,how was your day?" Wyatt asked.



"Things went smoothly. Everyone was quite welcoming," Amelia replied.



Keeping her struggles hidden, she saw no reason to trouble Wyatt with office politics after everything he had already done for her.


Not wanting Wyatt to delve further into work matters,Amelia deliberately changed the subject. "Mr.Stewart, did you need something from me?"


"We're not at work right now. You don't have to call me Mr.Stewart."



He knitted his brows while he spoke, and his expression only softened when Amelia used his first name.



Plans for adinner out vanished when Wyatt saw how drained Amelia looked, so he just drove her home.



After watching Amelia enter her apartment, he immediately called Davin.


Back at the office, Davin was still buried in paperwork. When Wyatt's name popped up on his phone screen, he braced himself for more tasks, only to hear a very different request. Wyatt wanted a full update on Amelia's first day. "Mr. Stewart, is something wrong with Miss Flynn's work situation?" he asked.



"You have ten minutes. Find out how her day was today at work," Wyatt instructed before abruptly ending the call.


Even though Amelia had said nothing,Wyatt's intuition told him she felt down.



A few minutes later, Davin called Wyatt back,detailing Amelia's current situation in the office.


After finishing his report, Davin rushed to take responsibility."I should've noticed this sooner. Let me take care of it, boss."



"That won't be necessary. Act as if you were not aware of this."



"But Miss Flynn would-"



"She won't fold just because things get tough,"Wyatt interjected.


And he was right. Amelia proved her resilience the following morning by showing up at work early, her energy renewed.


Sally and the others looked at the spirited Amelia with complicated expressions.


Sally, in particular, felt shocked, considering she had thought that Amelia wouldn't come to work today.



Instead of hunting for tasks like she had yesterday Amelia kept to herself, writing something quietly at her desk.



The change unsettled Sally, who couldn't keep her focus.



When lunchtime neared, Sally put a document on Amelia's desk.



Spotting the file, Amelia let out a quiet sigh of relief.Still, she gave Sally a confused look on purpose."What's this?"



"It's our endorsement contract with the celebrity called Patton Carman. I've got it mostly wrapped up,and we've planned the signing for three o'clock. Something's come up, though, so I can't make it.Could you handle it for me?"


"Absolutely. Just send me the details," Amelia replied.



As she picked up the document and began reading it carefully, she failed to notice the fleeting shadow in Sally's eyes.
###Chapter 45 It's You





After reviewing the document provided by Sally,Amelia gathered additional information related to Patton.



By two-thirty in the afternoon, she was already en route to the scheduled meeting spot, determined to arrive ahead of time.



However, entering the private suite, she found both Patton and his assistant waiting. Their glare sent a chill through the room.


Fame had treated Patton well in recent years;he had won people over because of his charm and bright smile.



But upon seeing Amelia, he sneered and walked quickly out of the room.



Without hesitation, Amelia spun on her heel and hurried after him. Landing this deal marked her first task at the Stewart Group; failure wasn't an option.



Before Amelia could catch up with Patton, Patton's assistant, Sammy Ortega, blocked her path. "Even though the Stewart Group is indeed a leader in the industry, we're not short on options."



"I admit we made a mistake, and I apologize for it.Could you please explain what happened?" Amelia said, her eyes fixed on Patton as he disappeared around the corner.


Sammy looked ready to leave, but seeing Amelia's good attitude, he stopped. He exclaimed, "We said two o'clock. Take a look at the time now yourself!"


Glaring at her, Sammy thrust his watch toward her face. "Patton isn't someone with time to waste. He came here himself to close the deal with the Stewart Group, but you kept us waiting without a single word.He won't be working with your company now."



With that, Sammy turned and left.


Left alone, Amelia squeezed her fists together. She realized,with certainty, that Sally had set her up by telling her the wrong meeting time.


Still, chasing blame could wait. What mattered now was figuring out how to set things right.


Suddenly, an idea flashed through Amelia's mind.


Without wasting a second, she grabbed her phone and dialed Carlee's number.



"Amelia, shouldn't you be at the office right now?What's got you calling me in the middle of the day?"Carlee asked.



Carlee was still lying in bed after spending the previous night drinking. Hearing Amelia recount what had happened, she immediately sat up. "Damn it,that woman is outrageous! I'll come right over and-"


"Stop! I didn't call you to make you fight for me.I need your help," Amelia interjected.



Part of her wanted nothing more than to beat Sally up, but if she did that, she couldn't continue to work at the Stewart Group anymore. She didn't want that.



It was clear to her that Sally was trying to force her out of the company. Yet with each challenge thrown her way, Amelia's resolve to succeed only grew stronger.



She had reached out to Carlee for help in digging up Patton's schedule today. Carlee, who enjoyed partying and was a celebrity enthusiast, was the perfect person for the task.



***



At seven o'clock in the evening, the Night Owl Bar.


Amelia trailed behind Carlee, a miniskirt clung to her as she walked. Feeling uncomfortable, she said to Carlee, "Are you sure I have to wear something like this?"



" did the homework. Patton's into girls who dress like this."



Without much delay, a staff member ushered them into a private suite. Never having dared to wear something so short before, Amelia fidgeted nervously, fingers tugging at the hem.



Her anxiety vanished as soon as she spotted Patton lounging on the sofa inside the room, and she started to walk over, but Carlee caught her by the arm,stopping her.


The bar manager-already swayed by Carlee's generous tip-explained things to Patton and his companions, and it wasn't long before Amelia and Carlee were invited to stay.


Patton, his assistant, and two actors were in the room,though they were not as famous as Patton.



The moment the manager left, Amelia's determination kicked in, and she headed straight for Patton. The two actors couldn't help but tease,"Patton, you really have a magnetic charm. You always attract beautiful women."



Pride lit up Patton's face; Amelia's gesture seemed to please him. He shot a grin at his friends and said, "She clearly has great taste."



Closing the distance, Amelia reached Patton. Patton extended his hand. But the moment he recognized her, his expression turned stormy. He shot to his feet."It's you?"


"I'm sorry, Mr. Carman, about what happened earlier today. Please, just give me another chance," Amelia said.



"An apology can't fix everything. My collaboration with the Stewart Group has already been canceled,so you need to leave now!"



"Mr. Carman, I genuinely want to make amends.Won't you-"


"Leave now, or I'll call security."


Patton reached for his phone, but Amelia's hand darted out, snatching it before he could grab it.



Anger flashed across Patton's face. "Do you not understand what I'm saying?" "Mr. Carman, I will do anything I can for you to forgive me for being late this afternoon. Just say what you want me to do."


"You'll do anything?" Patton asked.


Amelia nodded, and Patton's expression turned sly.Lifting a bottle of red wine, he said, "If you finish this entire bottle, I'll forgive your tardiness this afternoon."
###Chapter 46 That Decision Is Final





The sight of a full bottle of red wine in Patton's grip brought a shadow across Amelia's face.



For someone who rarely drank like her, even a single glass of wine could leave her head spinning, and an entire bottle would be overwhelming.



It was clear that Patton was deliberately making things difficult for her.



"You're going too far!"



From across the room, Carlee hurried over to stand by Amelia's side, her eyes shooting daggers at Patton.



Patton's friends picked up on the tension and came to stand beside him.



They didn't know what had happened between Patton and Amelia. Still, they believed making a woman drink that much wasn't right. They wanted to intervene, but when they saw Patton's angry expression, they held back.


"You think I'm being unfair? She showed up late in the first place! Besides, she was the one who said that she would do anything to get my forgiveness.I am not forcing her to do it." Patton fixed his stare on Amelia. Her silence drew a mocking smirk from him."If this is too much for you, then you're free to leave  _



"Let me get this straight, if I finish this bottle, you'll forgive me for being late in the afternoon, right?"Amelia interjected.



That bold response made Patton pause, but his surprise faded fast.


He didn't believe she'd actually go through with it, so he responded, "You have my word. Drink it all, and I'll let the matter go."


Right after hearing those words, Amelia took the bottle from his hand. Since the wine was already uncorked, she braced herself and started to drink it.



Landing her job at the Stewart Group meant everything to her. She didn't want to fail at her first task.



Carlee's heart pounded in concern when she saw that, and Patton could hardly believe his eyes.


He had meant to make things difficult for Amelia,hoping she would give up. He hadn't expected her to actually drink the wine.



Carlee's worry for Amelia was obvious. She thought about grabbing the bottle from her grip,but she also didn't want to mess things up for Amelia. So, she could only watch her anxiously.



As soon as Amelia drank, the sharp flavor burned her throat, making her cough.


But she paused only for a moment before lifting the bottle again.


 
Determined not to back down, she continued drinking. When she reached the halfway mark,Patton stepped up and yanked the bottle away.


Despite his lingering anger, Patton was worried that Amelia might get sick after drinking too much wine.



Finding her hand empty, Amelia blinked, then looked at Patton and said, "Mr. Carman,you promised. If you go back on your word now, l-"


"That's enough. I said I'd let it go, and I will," Patton interjected, his voice cold but resolute.


Despite feeling sick from all the wine, Amelia felt happy at Patton's words.



She took a deep breath and stepped toward Patton,eager to discuss the contract. But before she could say anything, Patton added, "I'm willing to let your tardiness slide, but that doesn't mean we're moving forward with this deal. The contract's canceled, and that decision is final."



"Are you just messing with us?" Carlee, who had been by Amelia's side, was ready to argue, but Amelia stopped her.



Patton didn't stick around. He turned and left the room with Sammy at his side.


The two actors sent Amelia a sympathetic look before following Patton out the door.


Frustration turned Carlee's cheeks red as she watched them go. She turned to Amelia. "You're really going to let them leave like that? Didn't that mean you just drank all that wine for nothing?"


"Not entirely. At least Patton forgave me for being late today," Amelia replied with a tired smile. Then,she lowered her voice and asked, "Did you find what I asked for?"



"That bracelet is hard to find. But Monroe said he could get his hands on it, so it should be delivered here soon."



Roughly thirty minutes later, a delivery man brought a small parcel to Carlee.


Once she'd signed, Carlee opened the parcel, revealing an ordinary-looking bracelet. "You're really sure this little thing is going to change Patton's mind?" she asked, brow furrowed.



"He won't say no to the deal after he sees it. The contract is as good as signed," Amelia said, slipping the bracelet safely into her bag. "Let's go. I'll explain on the way."



As the car rolled through the city, Amelia filled Carlee in about the bracelet's backstory.



It was the last design by the latedesigner Jackson Avila, with only three similar ones in the world.



During her background check on Patton, Amelia had found out Jackson was Patton's favorite designer.That knowledge made her certain Patton would change his mind after seeing the bracelet.



Since Amelia's appearance at the Night Owl Bar cut Patton's dinner short, hunger caught up to him when he returned to the Kretol Hotel. He soon ordered food. After a while, Amelia pushed the cart piled with food out of the elevator. She leaned close to Carlee and whispered, "Keep watch. If anyone comes, stall them for me."



Carlee nodded and watched Amelia step forward to knock on the door.


When Amelia announced that she was from room service, Patton opened the door immediately. He then said, "Just set the food down and go."


Taking careful steps, Amelia stepped inside. She placed the plates on the table, arranging them neatly before turning to look at Patton.


Patton, just about to question why the delivery person hadn't left, froze when he recognized her.


A sour look crossed his face. "You again? Don't tell me you're following me around now."
###Chapter 47 Victory





As he spoke, Patton reached out to grab the phone on the table, intending to call the police, but Amelia had already anticipated his move and took it away before he could.



Irritation crept over Patton's features. "So this is the way people from the Stewart Group treat their business partners?"



The moment Patton said that, Amelia gently set the phone down and replied with earnestness, "Mr.Carman,I admit | was late today, but that was my mistake alone. The Stewart Group shouldn't be judged like that because of me."



"Regardless of what you claim, I will not-"


Patton's protest died mid-sentence as Amelia presented a bracelet to him, leaving him shocked."This... This is the 'Eye of the Gods'?" Temptation tugged at him to snatch the bracelet from Amelia's palm, but her knowing smile made him stop himself.



Trying hard to tear his gaze away from the bracelet,Patton continued, "Don't think that just because you brought the 'Eye of the Gods, I'll compromise. You being late was a deliberate insult. I won't work with your company."



He expected her to keep trying to change his mind,but Amelia's answer shocked him. "Since you refuse to work with us, Mr. Carman, I won't pressure you further."



With that, Amelia headed toward the door to leave,her movements unhurried.



Watching her leave, Patton was torn, especially when he saw the 'Eye of the Gods' in her hand.



Amelia walked slowly, counting down in her mind as she approached the door.


Just as she was about to reach the door, Patton's voice echoed from behind. "Wait."



The sound of his voice made a spark of hope flash in Amelia's eyes.


At last, victory was within reach.


Retracing her steps, Amelia approached Patton. He thrust out his hand, jaw set, and demanded, "Hand it over!"



Amelia's first reaction was to hand over the bracelet,but he angrily said,"The contract!"



Fumbling for a second, Amelia pulled out the contract she had prepared, offering it to him with a pen.



Without a moment's pause, Patton wrote his signature on the final page.



After tossing the contract toward Amelia, Patton wiped his hands as if brushing away dust, his anticipation growing as he finally took the bracelet.



Years of searching had led him to this very moment, and he couldn't help but study the piece with obvious delight.


"Count yourself lucky this time. Don't think you can fix everything with a gift next time," he said to Amelia.



Amelia said, "The right accessory belongs with the right person. I believe this one is meant for you-"


Rolling his eyes at her attempt to charm him, Patton cut her off, saying, "Enough. You've got what you came for. Shouldn't you be on your way by now?"


Taking the hint, Amelia quickly nodded and made for the exit.



Just as she was slipping out, she nearly collided with Sammy,who was stepping into the room.


Seeing Amelia, Sammy opened his mouth to say something in anger, but when he noticed the contract in her hand, his eyes widened in shock.



Sammy had been Patton's assistant for over two y ears. He knew that despite his young age, Patton was stubborn, and once he made up his mind,it was nearly impossible to change it.


Without wasting a second, Amelia quickly left. The haze from the wine had taken its toll, and she could barely stay upright now.


As soon as she exited the room, she collapsed against Carlee.


With the experience of Amelia's previous drunken incident, Carlee quickly realized Amelia was feeling the effects of alcohol. "Amelia, hold on. I'll get you home right away."


Amelia stayed silent, barely managing to keep her balance as nausea crept up on her.



"Damn it! Why is this elevator so slow?" Carlee cursed under her breath at the unmoving elevator display, but just as she finished speaking, the elevator doors opened.



"M-Mr.Stewart?"



For a split second, Carlee froze, unsure how to react to the unexpected encounter.
###Chapter 48 Setting Foot In Her Place


Carlee was not the only one taken aback. Amelia was equally stunned.

Last time, Amelia had completely blacked out, but this time, she was fully conscious.

Wyatt's sudden appearance worked like asplash of cold water on her. No longer leaning on Carlee,Amelia managed to stand up a little straighter as she stepped into the elevator.

Wyatt didn't hesitate to reach for her, expecting perhaps a stumble, but Amelia vomited on him.

At that moment, an uneasy silence fell.

Nearby,Davin and Carlee exchanged glances, panic in their eyes.

Moving fast, Davin yanked off Wyatt's jacket, while Carlee tried to steady Amelia.

Embarrassment snapped Amelia out of her fog. She wanted to stammer an apology, but Wyatt pressed a water bottle into her palm first. "Drink some water."

She drank the water, and the elevator soon reached the floor of the underground parking lot. They stepped out, and Wyatt opened his car door for her, signaling for her to slide in.

While Amelia climbed into the back seat, Carlee nearly followed her to get inside the car, only for Davin to gently stop her.

"Do you think Mr. Stewart will be mad at her? Will he kill her for vomiting on him?" Carlee asked Davin.

Davin gave her a sidelong look, the corner of his mouth twitching. "Relax. Nobody's getting hurt tonight."

Inside the car,tension built up. Amelia risked a sideways glance at the man beside her."Wyatt,what brought you to the Kretol Hotel?"

"I followed you," he replied.

Wyatt's voice carried a quiet certainty, as if following Amelia was nothing out of the ordinary. For a second, Amelia froze, unable to understand what he'd just said.

He had been tracking her movements since yesterday, quietly staying out of sight while letting her handle things on her own.

Only when she failed to leave Patton's hotel room for a while did he stop holding back.

The realization clicked into place for Amelia. "So you're the reason those security guards never caught up to me?"

All along, she'd thought she had simply been lucky, never suspecting that Wyatt had smoothed the path for her. Breaking into a high-end place like Kretol Hotel would have been impossible without his help.

Hesitating, she studied Wyatt's face before asking, "Does that mean you already know what happened?"

Wyatt didn't answer her question. Instead, he said, "Didn't I tell you before? If things get difficult, you can tell me. Why do you think that you can't rely on me?"

Locking eyes with him, Amelia saw no sign of anger or judgment in his gaze. That gentle steadiness gave her courage to say, "I can't turn to you for every little thing. This time, it was my mistake. I have to handle it myself so I don't make the same error again."

Although Sally's action was despicable, Amelia knew she might have avoided this mess by double-checking the meeting time herself.

Wyatt listened quietly, not saying a word as Amelia spoke.

Hoping for a reaction, she looked at him and added with genuine feeling,"Thank you,Wyatt."

Before he could get a word in, she continued, "I really mean it. I just want you to know how grateful l am."

"If you're really very grateful, why not make me a new suit?" Wyatt said.

His investigation into Jaxton had turned up an interesting detail-Amelia had once made a suit for Jaxton.

Jaxton, in Wyatt's eyes, wasn't worthy of anything Amelia made.

Wyatt would never admit that he was jealous. Clueless about Wyatt's thoughts, Amelia turned her gaze to his shirt.

Even though Davin had taken away the dirty suit jacket, a hint of alcohol still clung to Wyatt's shirt. With a small smile, she lifted two fingers. "I'll make you not just one, but two."

One as a token of gratitude, and the other as an apology.

Wyatt's jealousy melted the moment she offered to make him two suits.

Noticing Amelia's flushed cheeks and beautiful eyes, Wyatt felt an unexpected rush of desire. He quickly looked away and shifted in his seat.

Soon, the car glided to a stop in front of Amelia's apartment.

Amelia, still a bit woozy, stumbled on the stairs and nearly lost her balance.

For a split second, she gave in to gravity and shut her eyes, ready to fall, only to find herself in the firm embrace of the man behind her.

Before she could even think about wriggling free, Wyatt swept her up effortlessly.

Even when they reached the apartment door, WVyatt kept carrying her. He managed to fish out her keys from her bag and unlock the door.

Setting foot inside Amelia's place for the first time, Wyatt took a moment to look around after he placed her on the sofa.

Her home felt warm and stylish, filled with soft scents and decorated with thoughtful details. Every corner seemed to reflect her personality, from the delicate trinkets on the shelves to the cheerful magnets on the fridge.

Wyatt suddenly felt a strong desire to live here, imagining the happiness it would bring.

His eyes then fell on Amelia, filled with an intensity she couldn't ignore.

Without warning, he grabbed her ankle... 
###Chapter 49 She Is Still His


Heat rushed up Amelia's neck, locking her in place as her pulse thundered in her ears.

"Just hold still. Let me see if you've hurt your foot," Wyatt said.

Wyatt's words chased away Amelia's panic, replacing her confusion with a sense of relief.

"Looks like there's no sprain," he said.

With that, he casually slipped her slipper back onto her foot.

Nothing about the moment felt real to Amelia. Wyatt, the man everyone admired in Kretol, was treating her with such gentle care. What on earth had she done to deserve this?

Once Wyatt straightened up, she scrambled to stand as well, but as soon as she did that, her stomach let out a growl.

At that moment, she felt so embarrassed that she wanted to disappear. The sound of Wyatt's soft laughter only turned her cheeks warmer.

Wyatt noticed her flushed face and stifled his amusement, yet a sly grin still played on his mouth. "Go ahead and rest. I'll see what I can whip up in the kitchen for you."

Curiosity got the better of her, and Amelia raised her head. "You actually know how to cook? As someone of your status, you probably never have to do something like this,right?"

The buzz of alcohol made her bold enough to say that.

He lifted his gaze, his eyes clear as he fixed them on hers. "I thought you already knew what kind of person l was two years ago."

The meaning behind his words didn't register with Amelia at first, but when it finally clicked, color rushed up her neck. Her memory darted back to that night two years ago. She had found him bleeding in a deserted alley. She had stripped away his clothes to check his wounds.

But he had been unconscious at that time; how had he known that she had done that to him?

As Amelia's thoughts wandered, Wyatt had already gone to the kitchen with a smile.

After a while, he returned carrying a plate of food, only to find Amelia curled up and fast asleep on the sofa.

Seeing this, he gently carried her to the bedroom and covered her with a blanket. Subconsciously, Amelia reached out to hold his arm, nestling her face against it.

The tender way she held onto him left Wyatt quietly astonished.

Even through the fabric, he could feel the softness of her face, and he tenderly stroked her hair with his free hand.

Settling onto the sofa near the bed, he allowed his gaze to linger on her face.

Relief settled in his chest. Fortunately, she was still his.

Not long after, his phone buzzed. Not wanting to disturb Amelia, Wyatt quickly slipped out of the room before answering the call.

Davin's voice spilled through the line, filled with nerves and regret. "Boss, I have to admit, this was on me.I'm sorry."

Wyatt didn't answer for a while, leaving Davin anxious, cursing Sally inwardly.

Wyatt's mind drifted to what Amelia had said earlier. Then, he finally replied, "Let's not intervene for now.
You can help Amelia tomorrow, but only if she asks."

He paused for a moment, then added, "Have Carlee come to Amelia's place to take care of her now."

Already back at her own place, Carlee rushed to Amelia's apartment after she received Davin's call.

Bursting inside Amelia's apartment, she froze mid-step when she spotted Wyatt.
Eye contact from Wyatt put her on edge, and she quickly/ said, "Don't worry, Mr. Stewart. I will take good care of Amelia."

Hearing this, Wyatt nodded and softly thanked her.

Watching Wyatt leave,Carlee felt as if she were dreaming.

She turned to look at Amelia, sleeping peacefully like a baby, and thought of Wyatt's evident concern for Amelia. She was genuinely happy for her friend to have someone care about her so much like this.

The next morning, Amelia stirred, heat prickling her skin. Panic set in when she realized she was in someone's arms.

But the moment she saw that Carlee was the one who was holding her, she let out a relieved sigh.

Embarrassment crept in as she shook her head. What a wild idea-to think for a second Wyatt had been the one holding her. That was absurd!

Easing herself out of Carlee's embrace, she reached for her phone on the bedside table.

Panic returned when she checked the time-it was already past eight.

The noise of Amelia getting ready woke Carlee. Looking at Amelia, she asked, "Aren't you going to rest at home a bit longer? There's no need to rush back to work."

"I really have to go. If I don't show up at work today, everyone will think I'm at home crying about my mistake at work," Amelia replied.

After she had taken so much effort to get Patton to sign, she wanted to take the contract to Sally herself.
###Chapter 50 Confronting Sally


Amelia guided her car through the city streets, heading straight for the Stewart Group.

The clock had just struck eight forty as she entered the office, spotting only Sally at her desk.

Sally had arrived early specifically to wait for Amelia, but upon seeing Amelia appear as composed as ever as she took a seat, a flicker of panic crossed Sally's eyes.

Then,Amelia reached into her bag and withdrew a familiar document-the same contract Sally had handed her the day before.

Remembering shehad deliberately given Amelia the wrong meeting time, Sally said in a smug tone, "Patton didn't sign the contract, did he? You-"

Before she could finish, she froze as Amelia flipped openthe contract, displaying the signed page to her.Sally's face changed as she stared at Amelia. "How... How did you get Patton to agree to sign?"

Frantically, Sally snatched up the contract, hoping to find evidence of a forgery. But the company's seal stared back at her,genuine and undeniable.

Sally's changing expressions made Amelia's satisfaction grow. Her effort yesterday had paid off.

She let out a gentle laugh, watching Sally's distress. "Now that's funny,Sally. Wasn't it you who told me to close this deal? I thought you'd be happy. Why do you look so upset that I succeeded?"

Compared to Amelia's restraint yesterday, she appeared very assertive today.

Sally's face soured as she replied, "I have no clue what you're getting at. The contract was practically done before you got involved. Patton would have signed no matter who brought him the contract. Don't be too proud of yourself."

Amelia's gaze sharpened at Sally's words.

She had initially intended to give Sally another chance, but Sally's attitude changed her mind. A knowing smirk curved at Amelia's lips. "You really think nobody's going to find out what you tried to pull,Sally?"

"What are you even taIking about? I didn't do anything."

"Oh, really? You said the meeting time was at three when it was actually at two. What were you trying to achieve by doing that? What if I hadn't gotten the contract signed? Would you have taken responsibility for it?"

Brushing off the accusation, Sally stubbornly responded, "You're twisting things. I told you the meeting was at two in the afternoon. You misheard me."

Amelia's eyes turned cold after she heard that. "Everyone here heard what you said at that time. They can testify whether you intentionally/gave me the wrong time."

That accusation seemed to break Sally's facade. "Amelia, who do you think you are? You're new here.Whatever friends you've made, they wouldn't risk crossing me for your sake."

"Then you admit you set me up on purpose by telling me the wrong time?"

"Yes, I gave you the wrong meeting time on purpose. So what? Everyone has to put in the effort to earn a spot here.Why should you have the privilege to work here only because of your connections?"

"All this talk just shows you resent me for taking your place," Amelia said calmly.

When she had joined the company, she had curiously asked Davin why Wyatt didn't simply choose someone from the Administrative Services Department to be his secretary; after all, they were already trained.

Davin had answered by saying Wyatt had tried out everyone in the department for a whole week, but nobody had managed to impress him. Sally had been dismissed by him after seven days as his secretary.

Thus, Sally's animosity towards Amelia was not just about her getting her job using connections. She also resented Amelia for being Wyatt's secretary.

Amelia's words seemed to strike a nerve, exposing Sally's hidden insecurities.

Suddenly, Sally snapped, "You really did steal what should have been mine! What makes you think you deserve to be Mr. Stewart's secretary? What can you do that | can't?|-"

Before Sally could finish, the door suddenly swung open.

Wyatt and Davin stood in the doorway, joined by the other assistants, their eyes fixed on the unfolding scene.

When Sally saw Wyatt, her face went pale. Still, she managed a strained smile.A. Stewart,what brings you here today?"

"If I hadn't come here, I wouldn't have seen your true colorsWyatt said.

The words landed like a slap. Sally's bravado vanished, and she slumped in her chair. Still, she scrambled for an excuse, "Mr. Stewart, you shouldn't believe Amelia. I haven't done anything-"

"Yes, I gave you the wrong meeting time on purpose. So what? Everyone has to put in the effort to earn a spot here.Why should you have the privilege to work here only because of your connections?"

Without warning, Amelia pressed play on her phone. Sally's admission rang through the office, every word clear and undeniable.

Trying to get up, Sally's strength gave out, and she dropped onto the floor. She clawed her way over to Wyatt, reaching out in desperation, but he kicked her aside.
###Chapter 51 Suing The Company


Turning toward Amelia, Wyatt asked, "What do you suggest we do about Sally?"

With her voice steady, Amelia said, "If I hadn't kept the recording to prove she set me up, or if the contract with Patton hadn't been successfully signed, what would my fate have been in the company?"

A blunt answer came without hesitation. "You would have been fired."

"Then she deserves the same treatment | would have gotten," Amelia said.

"No! Please, don't fire me!" Sally exclaimed.

She rushed up to Wyatt as she pleaded, "Mr. Stewart, I've devoted five years to this company.given everything I had to it. You can't just dismiss me so easily."

No response came from Wyatt, who turned his attention to Davin instead. "See that the finance team processes her final paycheck."

That simple order dashed any remaining hope inside Sally. When she saw Wyatt's cold expression, the last traces of pleading in herexpression curdled into bitterness. Her voice rose, sharp and furious.

"If you fire me like this, Mr. Stewart, I'll drag this company to court!"

She had expected Wyatt to show some worry upon hearing this, but instead, his expression grew even darker.

Amelia felt a hint of hesitation, Sally's mention of a lawsuit weighing on her mind.

While Sally was clearly at fault, Amelia couldn't ignore that the whole situation stemmed from her own involvement. The idea that the Stewart Group might wind up in legal trouble because of her left her uneasy.

Before Amelia could say anything, Davin finally spoke up, his tone laced with ridicule toward Sally."Do you honestly believe the company doesn't know what you've been up to? If we go to court, you'll be the one answering for bribery charges."
All the fight drained from Sally in an instant. It had never crossed her mind that Davin was aware of her secret dealings.

In other companies, assistants usually had little opportunity to accept bribes, but the Stewart Group was different. Many people sought connections with Wyatt, and those without direct access turned to assistants like Sally for help.

Because of this, Sally-nothing more than an assistant--became the owner of many designer handbags and glittering jewelry, tokens from eager clients hoping to curry favor.

Wyatt had always been aware of this, but he had never cared about it. And Devin believed that if clients wanted to lavish the Stewart Group's employees with gifts to win goodwill, it was not his cocern.

Devin had just never expected Sally to be so foolish as to say something like suing the company.

A police car arrived not long after, and with regret clouding her eyes, Sally was led away in handcuffs.

No sooner had the police left than Amelia was summoned to Wyatt's office.

Expecting a conversation about Sally, she stepped inside, only to have Wyatt hand her a document and a list.

Before Amelia could ask Wyatt what this was about, she noticed two familiar names on the list-the Morrison Group and the Flynn Group.

She then set her attention on the document.

The file Wyatt handed to Amelia was the project plan for developing the eastern part of Kretol.

Amelia had heard Laura mention the project before and knew how invested Laura was in it, so she read the document carefully.

Intent on understanding every detail, she pored over the lengthy report for more than an hour.

When she finally set the file down, Wyatt pushed a glass of her favorite mango juice across the desk toward her. Only after Amelia had taken a sip did Wyatt break the silence. "Tell me, what's your take on thisproject plan?"

Thanks to her background in business management, Amelia immediately spotted a glaring issue with the proposal.

But she was conflicted about whether she should point it out.

Wyatt must have picked up on her uncertainty, because he quickly encouraged her, saying,"Don't hold back. Giveme your honest view. If it were you, would you take on this project?"

A single, honest reply escaped her lips."No."

Candid as her answer was, she felt a stab of unease knowing this was Wyatt's project and found herself sneaking a glance at his face for any sign of disapproval.

To her relief, Wyatt's calm remained undisturbed, so she continued, "The project is excellent, and the plan is flawless, but it demands too much from the developer's finances. Every stage demands even more capital than the last, so one miscalculation could drag the entire development team into a cash flow disaster."

All of this was Amelia's professional opinion, but given the circumstances, she instinctively tried to soften her critique."Of course, these are just my preliminary thoughts.I-"

Wyatt cut her off before she could finish, saying, "You're even smarter than I expected, Amelia!"

His praise and the unmistakable approval in his eyes took her by surprise.

Dozens of people had read this plan, yet Amelia was the only one to immediately identify its fatal flaw.

Wyatt added, "Both your father and the Morrison family have thrown their hats in the ring for the bidding of this project."

Amelia was aware that Laura had always wanted to establish a connection with the Stewart Group, so she wasn't surprised the Morrison Group was bidding for the project.

But thinking about the Flynn Group's fragile finances, she couldn't help but mutter, "My dad must have lost his mind!"
###Chapter 52 They Graduated From The Same University


Given the dire condition of the Flynn Group's finances, that project would have drained every last cent in no time-two days, and they'd be finished.

Wyatt caught the look on Amelia's face and, for once, couldn't hide his amusement. "Seems like some people just enjoy chasing the unattainable."

If Katrina hadn't established the Flynn Group and given a sixty-percent stake to Amelia, Amelia would have gladly·let Ricky run the company straight into the ground.

Wyatt picked up on Amelia's thoughts. Right then and there, he crossed Flynn Group's name off the list.Gratitude welled up in her.

After wrapping things up, Amelia made her way to the door, ready to leave. But just as she was about to exit,she turned around.

Wyatt watched as she returned for the glass of mango juice sitting on his desk. "Almost left this behind,"she said, giving him a small smile.

She then tipped back the glass and finished every drop.

Wyatt smiled as he watched her disappear down the hall after doing that.

When Amelia stepped back into her office, her lifted spirits were quickly crushed.

Despite Sally's well-earned punishment, the other four people in the department were close to her, and their eyes narrowed with resentment the moment Amelia walked in.

Those unfriendly glares didn't stop, not even after Amelia sat down.

She gritted her teeth and faced the group head-on. "Look, I get that you're angry with me. I entered the Stewart Group because of my connections with Mr. Stewart, but I'm confident I am suitable for my position."

"You haven't worked for two years. What makes you think you have the right to say that?" Matias Benson spoke up. He had been working in this company for the longest time among the four.

A brief attempt by the others to hold him back failed, and he walked over to Amelia.

He continued, "Sure, Sally shouldn't have set you up. But you landing this job with a two-year gap just because you know the boss doesn't sit well with us. Frankly, I think you'll only hold us back at work."

He didn't sugarcoat his words, yet Amelia didn't get angry.

Once he finished speaking, she answered steadily,"True, I haven't worked in a while. Still, as an honor roll graduate from Kretol University, I believe | am capable-"

"Hold on!" Matias stared at her, suspicion plain on his face. "You are an honor roll graduate from Kretol University? I also graduated from Kretol University myself, yet I never once saw your face on the wall of honor."

By the end, his skepticism had twisted into outright scorn; he was convinced that Amelia was making it all up.

"Just because my picture isn't on the honor board doesn't mean I'm lying."

Once those words left her lips, Amelia grabbed her phone, scrolled through her gallery for the certificate's photo, and handed her phone over to Matias without hesitation.

Last time, Jaxton had shredded her resume, so she had taken precautions to take photos of all her certificates.

Her photo had once hung on the honor board, but Jaxton's dissatisfaction with it had prompted her to ask a professor to quietly take it down.

As Matias studied the certificate on her phone, Amelia mulled over the idea of asking her professor to put her photo back someday.

"You studied business management? You actually are..."

Matias stared at the screen in disbelief, clearly remembering stories from his mentor about an exceptional senior who had captured the admiration of every teacher.The three colleagues crowded closer, unable to hide their surprise. One whispered, "Matias, is it real? She actually graduated from Kretol University? This certificate looks real enough. Still, you hear about fake diplomas all the time nowadays..."

Their murmurs nearly made Amelia laugh, and she opened her mouth to respond just as Matias approached her.

Bracing herself for a challenge, she straightened, only to hear Matias say,elia, I am sorry for treating you with disrespect before."

Matias's words left Amelia stunned.

Matias continued, "I also studied business management at Kretol University. 1..."

He seemed to have changed completely, enthusiastically sharing his school experiences with Amelia.

With Matias's attitude change toward Amelia and her honor roll credentials, Amelia's colleagues softened toward her, their attitudes shifting.

"Nobody told us you graduated from Kretol University with honors. If we'd known that, none of us would've tried to make things difficult for you."

Matias, as a fellow Kretol graduate, understood better than anyone how hard it was to earn the title of honor roll graduate of Kretol University.

Holding grudges wasn't in Amelia's nature, so she accepted their apologies.

Taking her phone back from Matias,she.teased,"Do you want to verify if my graduation certificate is real?"
###Chapter 53 Get Some Inside Info


Word about the Eastside Project's public bidding spread quickly the next morning, catching the attention of every savvy investor in town. The Morrison household hummed with a feverish kind of energy because of the matter.

"Seriously, Mom? What's so earth-shattering that you made me come back now?" Jaxton grumbled.

Just a few hours ago, he had been out at a bar, lost in the music and laughter. Laura's call had forced him to ditch his friends, and as he left, the guys had heckled him with enough sarcasm to spoil his night.

Back in Kretol, most heirs of wealthy families his age could sway the family's decisions,but he still had no right to make decisions in the Morrison family.

This was just another example. Laura called him, and he was forced to drop everything and race home.

The instant he stepped inside, Laura wrinkled her nose at the sharp scent of alcohol and smacked him on the arm. "I called you here for a reason. You need to go find Amelia and-"

"You called me back here just so I can go fetch Amelia?" Jaxton exclaimed.

Just hearing Amelia's name made his eyes flash with anger.

Laura's patience wore thin. "Will you stop interrupting me? Weren't you always complaining I never trusted you to manage a project on your own? Well, here you go-the entire Eastside Project is yours."

At the mention of the Eastside Project, the fury in Jaxton's eyes shifted to shock."Didn't you always say that project was so important that it could make or break the company? And now, you're dropping it in my lap?"

Jaxton struggled to process his mother's decision.

Choosing to ignore his skepticism, Laura said, "You're the only son I have. The company will be yours one day, so it's only right you step up and handle the Eastside Project." Laura's words sparked a hidden excitement in Jaxton, though confusion still lingered. "What's Amelia got to do with the Eastside Project bidding anyway?"

Laura let out a weary sigh, clearly bothered by his inability to understand the situation. "Don't you remember? Amelia's working at the Stewart Group now. We're not the only family chasing after the Eastside Project in Kretol. If you want an edge, you'll need to get some inside info. That's where Amelia comes in-"

"You're giving Amelia way too much credit. She barely has any pull in the Stewart Group, and I doubt she's allowed near anything important," Jaxton interjected, his sneer unmistakable.

"You're underestimating her. I had someone look into it. Amelia is Wyatt's chief secretary now," Laura said.

Leaning back on the sofa, Jaxton widened his eyes in disbelief, but he quickly said, "No way! Everyone working for Wyatt is the best of the best. He could have picked any person with exceptional skills. Why would he make Amelia his chief secretary?"

Laura always believed that Jaxton never gave Amelia enough credit, butit still stunned her to see him dismiss her entirely. A sharp reply left her lips. "Do you really not remember that Amelia graduated at the top of her class from Kretol University? With talent like hers, it's only natural she'd become Wyatt's secretary."

***


As the bidding for the Eastside Project drew closer, Amelia was working late at the Stewart Group. She didn't set foot in her apartment until almost ten o'clock that night.

Outside her apartment building, Jaxton had been waiting for hours. The instant her headlights appeared, he straightened, wearing a smile that rarely found its way onto his face, and waved.

When a waving figure appeared in the glow of her headlights, instinct told Amelia to slow down. Once she realized the figure was Jaxton, though, she stomped on the gas pedal instead.

Her car shot forward, the tires almost touching Jaxton's foot. He had to leap back, or else the wheel would have smashed his toes.

Annoyance already gnawed at him from the waiting. Amelia's reckless driving made his anger snap. He bolted across the grass, rushing straight to the front of her car.

As her car was forced to a stop, Jaxton's lips curled into a cocky grin.

He was about to approach the car door to talk to Amelia when he noticed her car reversing.

Puzzled, Jaxton watched her car back up until it suddenly moved forward and accelerated, heading straight for him.

A wave of panic swept over his face as he shouted, "Amelia, have you lost your mind? Hit the brakes, now!"

The wheels screeched on the road, the car stopping just inches from Jaxton.

Terror drained the color from his cheeks, and he tumbled to the ground.

Only when the engine fell silent and the car door creaked open did Jaxton scramble upright and charge at Amelia in anger. He swung an arm to strike, but Amelia slammed her door into his chest, sending him sprawling onto the pavement.

Glancing down at him without a shred of pity, Amelia said coldly, "Maybe next time I won't stop in time. You keep throwing yourself at my car, so if you get hurt, don't blame me."

Without another word, she strode off toward the apartment building, never once glancing back.
###Chapter 54 He Nearly Got Me Killed


From across the street, Dayna caught sight of the chaos and jerked her car to the curb, leaving the engine running as she stepped out and sprinted straight for Jaxton.

Panic flared in her chest at the sight of Jaxton doubled over and looking pale as chalk. She quickly held his hand and tried to help him up. The moment she applied pressure, Jaxton shoved her away with a pained gasp. "Don't touch me!"

Every movement sent fresh waves of pain through his body.

Overcome with worry, Dayna could barely stand still. Her eyes glistened, and she found herself pacing in frantic circles around him.

Eventually, Jaxton lost his temper and exclaimed,"Can't you see what's happening? Call an ambulance already!"

Snapping out of her panic, Dayna finally managed to pull out her phone, fumbling to make the call.

The moment paramedics lifted Jaxton onto a stretcher and into the ambulance, Dayna jumped behind the wheel of her car to follow the ambulance, all thoughts of Ricky's assignment vanishing from her mind.

She had been keeping an eye on Amelia, desperate to sniff out the identity of the mysterious man who had taken her to the Pearl Bay Auction House. Despite days of effort, the truth had stayed just out of reach.

Amelia watched the flashing ambulance lights vanish into the distance with Dayna's car trailing behind. Only then did she quietly draw her curtains.

***


At the Kretol City Hospital.

Doctors broke the news: Jaxton's broken ribs called for immediate surgery, but they refused to proceed without a relative's signature on the consent forms, no matter how much Dayna begged. "Miss, every minute matters. His condition is getting worse the longer we wait!"

At home, Laura waited for updates from Jaxton. Just then, her phone buzzed with Dayna's call, which she declined without a second thought.

After about six persistent attempts, Dayna finally got Laura to answer the call.

Annoyance bubbled up in Laura; she was ready to scold Dayna for being bothersome, but Dayna's desperate, tear-choked plea cut through the line. "MMrs. Morrison, please, come quickly to the hospital.Jaxton's injured."

"What happened?" Laura asked while urgently calling for her driver.

Deep down, Dayna wanted to expose all of Amelia's wrongdoings, but Laura ended the call before she could say another word.

Left staring at her phone, Dayna seethed, resentment simmering in her chest.

Although she and Amnelia both shared the Flynn name, Amelia's mother's wealth made everything different.People looked down on her just because she didn't come from wealth.

No matter how much bitterness she held for Laura, Dayna didn't hesitate to rush forward and greet Laura politely when she arrived.

But Laura, without a second thought, slapped Dayna hard across the face and pushed her aside,heading straight for the doctor.

A brief, heated exchange with the doctor later, Laura rounded on Dayna, her voice slicing through the hallway. "What were you thinking? Were you trying to get my son killed?"

"Mrs. Morrison, how can you blame me for this? If you want someone to point fingers at, blame Amelia-she's the reason Jaxton ended up hurt like this!" Dayna said.

She had been worried for Jaxton the entire time, doing everything she could to help him, but not a single word of thanks escaped Laura's lips-only harsh criticism.

Seeing Dayna's pitiful expression, Laura only felt her anger grow. "Don't put on that pitiful face. Jaxton is not here, so you don't have to put on a show like this. Amelía wouldn't have problems with him if you'd stop hanging onto Jaxton. Let me be clear-there's no way I'd let you marry Jaxton. If you know what's good for you,you'H stay away from him."

Laura had always looked down on Dayna. She believed a child born out of wedlock like Dayna had no right to be her daughter-in-law.

Never before had she confronted Dayna like this, but with Jaxton absent this time, she didn't hold back.

Tears streaming down her cheeks, Dayna left the hospital, unable to endure another second.

Laura fixed her gaze on the glowing red light above the surgery room door before pulling out her phone to dial Amelia.

Echoing the doctor's warnings, Laura's voice rose in accusation. "Amelia, Jaxton is your fiancé! How could you do something like that to him? Do you realize he suffered three broken ribs; he nearly-"

"Then do you know he nearly got me killed tonight?" Amelia interjected coldly. "He ran out in front of my car and forced me to brake hard. A car can flip over easily like that. If my car had flipped tonight, I would have been dead. So, breaking three of his ribs was just a small lesson for him."

Before Laura could get another word in, Amelia ended the call.

Dumbfounded, Laura stared at her phone. The ever-polite Amelia had just hung up on her.

She couldn't comprehend why Amelia had changed so drastically.
###Chapter 55 Ricky's Mother Is Here


Saturday plans for extra sleep vanished the moment Amelia's phone buzzed with a call from Dalia in the morning.

"Amelia, I've already sent that person over to the Flynn family's house. She will arrive soon."

Amelia instantly snapped awake at those words.

Thanking Dalia quickly, she tossed off her covers and hurried out of bed.

Without wasting time, she freshened up, grabbed her keys, and set off for the Flynn family's residence.

Inside the Flynn family's residence, chaos had already taken hold.

Janessa, always up before anyone else, wanted to impress Ricky with a homemade breakfast since he was spending the weekend at home.

Stepping onto the stairs, she spotted a figure on the living room sofa and nearly missed a step in shock."YouI...Why are you here?"

Eyes scanning every inch of the luxurious house, Lainey Flynn wasted no time assessing her surroundings.No matter how often she visited, each time, the decor left her awestruck, the greed in her eyes evident.

A beaming smile stretched across Lainey's face when she heard movement. The moment she realized it was Janessa, her expression twisted into a sneer, and she snapped, "I should be the one asking that question!Why are you here?"

Janessa couldn't quite shake her fear of Lainey.

Years ago, when her affair with Ricky had come to light, Lainey had found her at her home and dragged her to the street to beat her up, humiliating her for Katrina's sake.

Janessa's heart was filled with resentment towards Lainey when she thought about that. Careful not to disturb Ricky, who was still sleeping upstairs, Janessa said in a gentle tone, "Lainey, please,let's not argue. Ricky and I have been married for a long time. We're family now."

Lainey scoffed, "Married or not, you're nothing but a mistress who clawed her way up. Don't get comfortable-one day, some younger woman will take your place. My son could have anyone he wants with all his money."

Anger flared behind Janessa's polite facade, but she held back. She knew she needed to uncover Lainey's reason for coming here.

Forcing a faint smile, she asked, "So, Lainey, what brings you here so suddenly?"

"Oh, it's simple. My son invited me here and wanted me to enjoy a little luxury."

Seeing Lainey's smug expression, Janessa didn't believe a single word she had just said.

After more than twenty years being with Ricky, she knew the tangled relationships in the Flynn family better than anyone.

Lainey's favoritism had always been reserved for her younger son; she had barely tolerated Ricky until wealth changed her attitude toward him.

Despite her thoughts, Janessa kept up her hospitalty, signaling the staff to start preparing breakfast for Lainey.

Displeasure flickered across Lainey's face as she eyed the simple breakfast."Milk and bread won't do.l want porridge to start my day."

Janessa cursed at Lainey inwardly, but she still turned to the servant and told them to prepare the dish.

The servant barely took a step when Lainey called out to stop her. Then, Lainey turned her attention to Janessa. "I want you to make it for me."

Janessa opened her mouth to refuse, but before she could do that, Lainey continued, "Ever since you became Ricky's wife, I've never asked you to do anything for me. Making me some porridge shouldn't be too much to ask, don't you think?" Janessa clenched her fists as anger threatened to boil over.

Still, memories of Ricky's growing irritation with her recently cooled Janessa's temper. She forced herself to reply calmly, "Lainey, I'm not much of a cook. Maybe the chef-"

"Oh, don't pretend you are bad at cooking. Back when you first caught Ricky's attention, you often cooked for him, and he was satisfied with the food you made. Are you really unwilling to even make me a bowl of porridge?"

Janessa remembered her hard years growing up; she had had no choice but to learn her way around a kitchen from an early age. Cooking had once been her way to win Ricky's favor, but after marrying him,she seldom cooked.

Lainey's taunting brought those old wounds to the surface. Not finished yet, she kept digging. "You'll never be like Katrina-a real lady from a wealthy family, who never needed to cook anything herself. Why put on an act like that?"

Mentioning Katrina felt like a stab to Janessa's heart, but she could only swallow her hurt for Ricky's sake and quietly head toward the kitchen.

Complaints poured from Lainey the whole meal. Janessa's frustration eventually boiled over, and she abandoned the table, storming up the stairs.

Ricky, still deep in sleep, woke to Janessa's insistent shaking. He glared at her."Why are you waking me up at this hour...Wait,what happened?"

The sight of Janessa's tear-filled eyes startled him into sitting up.

Janessa turned away, struggling to compose herself. "I don't mind that you are inviting your mother here.But you could have given me a little heads-up. After all these years, you know she only favors your younger brother.Has she ever cared-"

"What are you talking about?" Ricky interjected, confused.

Seeing his puzzled expression, Janessa filled him in on everything that had happened. After that, she asked, "You were really not the one who asked your mother to come here?"

"Absolutely not. Why would I do that?" Ricky replied.
###Chapter 56 | Can't Reveal His Identity


Among Kretol's elite, the city's influental families often expected the women to attend countless social events. Ricky could never shake the anxiety that Lainey's unpredictable behavior might someday affect his reputation.

Rising from bed, Ricky wasted no time putting on his clothes and hurrying downstairs.

Janessa didn't waste any time, quickly heading downstairs after him.

But their search for Lainey turned up nothing in the dining area. A scowl formed on Ricky's face as he looked at Janessa.

Before she could offer any explanation, laughter floated in from the backyard-Lainey's voice mingling with Amelia's. Ricky exchanged glances with Janessa, and together, they strode toward the backyard.

In the backyard, Amelia gently guided Lainey along the path to the pavilion. It was uInclear how Amelia had managed to please Lainey, but Lainey, usually stern and cold, was now grinning broadly.

Witnessing this scene, Janessa suddenly felt a tightness in her chest, making it difficult to breathe.

Without hesitation, Ricky walked over. Shadows flickered across his gaze as he greeted Lainey. Then, he turned to Amelia, his tone sharp and cold. "Were you the one who invited your grandmother over?"

"That's right. I made arrangements for someone to bring Grandma from our hometown to Kretol."

Ricky clenched his jaw, nearly raising his voice, but. he held back his anger since Lainey was here."Why didn't you tell me before you brought her here?"

"Why do I need to do that? Grandma's not getting any younger. She deserves to come to Kretol from time to time and enjoy the life here."

Janessa couldn't hold her tongue anymore and said sarcastically,"SOcaring,are you? Why didn't you invite her to your own house then?" Amelia stared at her."Janessa, have you really forgotten this house still belongs to me? There's nothing wrong with letting my grandmother stay here. It isn't my place to judge, but shouldn't you, as her daughter-in-law, show a little more care for her? When my mother was alive, she always invited Grandma over."

"Don't even try to compare her to your mother! Your mother was born for this lifestyle. She can't even hold a candle to your mother," Lainey said.

Listening to the exchange, Janessa fought the urge to storm over and hit them both, but Ricky's presence forced her to grit her teeth and endure.

In fact, Lainey never truly liked Janessa, nor did she care much for Katrina.

Still, Katrina's fortune and generosity meant Lainey never dared cross her, even if she didn't like her.

Now that Katrina was gone, Lainey believed all the Flynn family wealth would eventually fall into Ricky's lap.
And the idea that Amelia would marry into wealth made Lainey soften her attitude toward her slightly.

Long ago, Amelia had seen her grandmother's true colors-her loveof riches always outweighed any family loyalty.

She might not hold much affection for her grandmother, but she did not hesitate to use her to get under Janessa's skin.

Without another word, Ricky decided he had had enough and motioned for Amelia to follow him inside,leaving Janessa behind with Lainey.

Stepping into the study, Amelia steadied herself, sure that Ricky was about to scold her.

But to her surprise, Ricky asked if she liked the birthday gift he had prepared for her.

Amelia's thoughts jumped to Dayna's visit yesterday. She pieced things together, guessing Dayna had come to her place at that time to give her something. "I don't know anything about a gift. What are you talking about?" she said.

The look of genuine confusion on her face prompted Ricky to pull out his phone and call Dayna. When he realized that Dayna's phone was off, irritation flashed in his eyes. Without a word, he turned and handed Amelia a small box from his desk drawer.

Right away, Amelia spotted Katrina's cherished diamond necklace inside the box; it was the piece she'd searched for the last time she was here. She hadn't found it then, and it turned out Ricky had it.

Without a second thought, she accepted the necklace.

Watching her accept the gift, Ricky hesitated before asking, "Who was with you at the Pearl Bay Auction House that day?"

It had struck Amelia as odd to see Ricky, always tight-fisted, suddenly acting generous. But now,she realized he had an ulterior motive.

Fixing him with a cool stare, she responded, "Just a friend. I can't reveal his identity."

Given Wyatt's status, she kept things vague.

Ricky, however, took her guarded reply as a sign she was unwilling to tell him the truth. His attitude flipped in a heartbeat. "Fine, don't tell me anything then."

Even though she knew how slippery and self-serving Ricky could be, Amelia couldn't resist a small, mocking smile at how quickly he had changed his attitude this time.

She gathered her things, preparing to leave, but Ricky suddenly said,"|heard you're working as Wyatt's secretary now."

Wyatt's name put her on alert. Amelia looked at Ricky, trying to read his intent.

Ricky continued, "Wyatt is the one who has come up with the Eastside Project. If the Flynn Group can land that contract, it would transform our standing. Don't forget that the Flynn Group is your mother's legacy.You owe it to-"

"I'd advise you to forget about that project if you want the Flynn Group to survive in Kretol," Amelia interjected, unable to keep quiet when she heard Ricky mention her mother.

Ricky's face darkened at her blunt warning. Seeing that, Amelia pushed down her frustration and continued, "You understand the weight the Stewart Group carries around here. Sure, that project looks tempting, but ask yourself-can the Flynn Group actually handle it with its current situation?"
###Chapter 57 People Change


Ricky understood perfectly well that the Flynn Group's finances were in dire straits. Still, the idea of joining forces with the Stewart Group dangled before him like a golden ticket he couldn't resist. Pulling off this partnership would bring him a level of respect he'd only dreamed about before.

Despite knowing Amelia's point made sense, Ricky refused to give up. "Maybe I can try for a bank loan. If the bank hears that I'm about to partner with the Stewart Group, I'm sure they'll stamp their approval on it."

This suggestion left Amelia utterly uninterested in continuing the conversation. A wave of gratitude washed over her; she felt thankful that Wyatt had already taken the Flynn Group off the list of possible partners.

Amelia reminded Ricky that she was just a secretary, not knowing much about the matter. Then, she grabbed her bag and left.

As Amelia departed the Flynn family's residence, Janessa was still being nagged by Lainey, which lifted Amelia's spirits slightly.

It was noon. Remembering that it had been a while since she last visited her grandmother, Amelia headed straight for Kretol City Hospital.

Michelle's only child, Katrina, had been her entire world, and losing her so early nearly broke her spirit.Were it not for Amelia's presence, Michelle might not have made it this far.

When Amelia entered the hospital room, Michelle's eyes sparkled with fondness, reminded of Katrina by Amelia's familiar face. She tried to sit up, prompting Amelia to cross the room and help her.

Once Michelle was settled comfortably, Amelia took a moment to study her grandmother's face and noted the color returning to her cheeks.

Although Marc had kept her updated about Michelle's treatment, Amelia felt a different kind of relief seeing with her own eyes how much her grandmother's energy had returned.

Wyatt's decision to assign Marc as the attending physician had worked wonders for Michelle's health,and Amelia couldn't help but feel a fresh rush of gratitude toward him.

Like always, Michelle wanted to hear about Amelia's daily life. The news that Amelia now worked at the Stewart Group brought a smile to Michelle's lips.good for you to be working, Amelia. Women should always have careers."

"l understand, Grandma. You don't have to worry.I'll work diligently."

"Let me focus on getting better while you pour your energy into work. Dr. Chapman is highly skilled, and my recovery is going well. Maybe I'Il even be able to attend your wedding with Jaxton."

The words brought a flicker of unease to Amelia's eyes.

Plans to end things with Jaxton were already firm in her heart, yet telling her grandmother the truth felt impossible. Michelle's fragile health could never take such news.

Amelia's silence immediately made Michelle suspect something was wrong.

The idea that Amelia would actually cancel the engagement never crossed Michelle's mind. After all, the marriage had been arranged long before Katrina's passing. She chalked up Amelia's mood to the usual couple's spat. "Every couple argues, you know. Everything will be fine eventually."

"You really don't have to worry about me, Grandma. I know how to handle my own affairs."

To keep herself from slipping up and noticing the fatigue settling into Michelle's face, Amelia hurried to say her goodbyes.

Unexpectedly, as Amelia turned a corner, she ran into Laura, who was also at the hospital.

Laura still hadn't let go of the grudge from the night before, upset over Amelia's abrupt hang-up. Though she understood what had truly happened with Jaxton's injury, she still blamed Amelia for the matter."Even if Jaxton was at fault, you didn't have to go so far as to break his ribs."

Hearing Laura defend Jaxton so blindly, Amelia retorted, "You can spoil him all you want, Laura; he's your son, after all. But I don't have the obligation to do the same."

Laura was momentarily stunned by Amelia's reply, and as the iciness in Amnelia's eyes grew sharper, Laura's expression turned dark. "You're not the same girl I once knew, Amelia.You've changed!"

Meeting Laura's accusing glare, Amelia let out a cold laugh. "People change. You've also changed. When my mother was alive, you never scolded me."
###Chapter 58 Accompanying Wyatt On A Business Trip


Leaving the hospital, Amelia and Laura parted ways unhappily. Seated in her car, Amelia found her mind drifting through memories, feeling deeply thankful for how much she had changed.

After a while, her phone buzzed with a call from Wyatt. He explained he needed to leave on a business trip and wanted her to come along.

Hearing that, she sped toward the airport, so intent on making it that she nearly ran a red light.

Once at the VIP lounge at the airport, she learned she would be traveling to Prevda with Wyatt.

Still trying to catch her breath from rushing here, she shot him a look and let out a sigh.little heads-up would have been nice. I don't even have a change of clothes with me."

"You don't have to prepare anything when you're with me," Wyatt replied, his tone easy.

His words brought a faint blush to her cheeks. Before she could reply, a staff member arrived to inform them it was time to board.

Inside the first-class cabin, only Wyatt, Amelia, and Davin were there.

Wyatt wasted no time. He set a laptop before Amelia and showed her a document.the Prevda proposal. Take your time with it."

Switching to work mode, Amelia focused on the document.

Reading through the details, she realized Wyatt's objective was to determine whether he should invest in a new resort in Prevda.

After scanning line after line, Amelia felt her eyes begin to ache. A quick glance up revealed Wyatt and Davin both still absorbed in work.

She pushed through her fatigue, unwilling to look idle next to her boss. It wasn't until the plane was preparing to land that they turned off their laptops.

Wyatt turned to Amelia, asking for her take on the resort project.

" think the project has real promise, but we need to visit the site before making any decisions. Factors like the landscape, how easy it is to get there, and the local culture all matter," she replied

"Once this assessment is over, if you find it feasible, you will be in charge of the project," Wyatt said.

"Wait, me?" Amelia was shocked.

Wyatt's nod was all the confirmation she needed, and a ripple of nerves ran through her. Handling something so big, especially as a newcomer in the company, seemed overwhelming.

As they exited the airport through the VIP channel, Amelia spotted a tall man striding towards them from a distance.

Jordy Green came into view. He was Holley's son and two years older than Wyatt. He always looked up to Wyatt, admiring his sharp mind and ambition.

Catching sight of Jordy, Wyatt paused and frowned. "What brings you here?"

Although Wyatt's words carried his usual composure, Amelia could sense an unfamiliar warmth threading through his voice.

"If your mother hadn't told me you were coming to Prevda, were you planning on keeping it a secret from me?" Jordy said.

"I just didn't want to trouble you," Wyatt said.

"It's no trouble at all."

Jordy knew Wyatt's personality well and chose not to press further when Wyatt fell silent.

Davin approached with a nod, greeting him politely,. Green." He then accepted the car keys Jordy handed over.

Following Davin's example, Amelia greeted Jordy also as"Mr. Green," catching Jordy off guard."No need for that! If you're going to marry Wyatt, you're practically family. You can call me by my first name," he said.

His words left Amelia a little flustered. Before she could respond, a lighthearted voice chimed in.

"Alright, enough teasing. You'll have her turning red."

Wyatt's words only seemed to heighten Amelia's embarrassment.

"Okay, I get it, I'll behave," Jordy said, breaking into a laugh.

Holley had already told Jordy about Amelia when she returned to Prevda after meeting Amelia.

As a talented designer who valued freedom, Jordy respected Wyatt's decision to marry Amelia soon.

Still, hearing about Wyatt's business trip to Prevda with Amelia sparked Jordy's curiosity, prompting him to come to the airport himself to see the person who had caught Wyatt's attention.

Upon seeing Amelia, Jordy understood why Wyatt had made that decision.

Jordy smiled and asked Amelia, "If you don't mind, may I call you Amelia?"

A friendly smile appeared as Amelia replied,f course not. That's what everyone at home calls me."

Jordy's grin grew wider at her answer. "Now, we can address each other by our first names."

Amelia chuckled and called him"Jordy,"which made Jordy beam with joy.
###Chapter 59 A Frosty Stare


Everyone got into Jordy's car, with Davin driving until they reached a cluster of upscale houses near the heart of town.

At first, Amelia believed the elegant house she was seeing belonged to Jordy, but as she stepped inside,the familiar touches instantly reminded her of Hillside Villa's signature style.

Spotting Amelia's curious glances, Wyatt approached her and asked in a gentle voice,"Do you like it here? If not, I own a few places outside the city, too. We can go there."

Before Amelia could respond, Jordy, who had followed them inside, spoke up.

"You should know, Amelia, I designed all those suburban homes as well. If this place isn't to your liking,you probably won't like any of the others."

Feeling a bit more relaxed surrounded boy the familiar decor, Amelia smiled and said, "I like this place. No wonder it stands out. You really left your mark, Jordy."

Whether she meant it as a genuine compliment or was just playing along, the pride in Jordy's eyes was impossible to miss. He cast Wyatt a smug look and remarked, "See, Amelia knows good design when she sees it."

After a pause, he couldn't resist adding,"1fyou ever want your own place designed, Amelia, I'm your guy.I'll give you a discount."

"A huge discount?" Amelia asked, her eyes sparkling.

"Absolutely, the best deal you'll get!"

The easy conversation between Amelia and Jordy got under Wyatt's skin. He couldn't hide his irritation and said to Jordy, "Shouldn't you be at work? Why do you have so much free time?"

Jordy took Wyatt's jab in stride, not the least bit offended. He changed the subject and suggested Wyatt take Ameliía to Moonlit Restaurant for dinner with him and Holley.

Wyatt had a good relationship with Holley, and knowing that she wanted to treat them to a meal, he agreed.

Once Jordy departed, Wyatt led Amelia upstairs to the master bedroom on the east side.

The soft pinks and pastel accents in the room caught Amelia off guard. She turned to Wyatt with a puzzled look. "What's the story behind this room?"

"This room was prepared just for you. Let me know if anything else you need, and I'll have people get it for you."

Learning the room had been prepared with her in mind, Amelia felt a warmth in her heart.

She surveyed the room and discovered that it had everything she needed. The vanity held her favorite skincare, and the wardrobe was stocked with clothes from the brands she liked.

Only then did it click-Wyatt's words at the airport made perfect sense. She really didn't need to prepare anything for this trip.

Rather than thanking him outright, Amelia simply let her happiness show as she took in the room.

Wyatt caught the spark of happiness in her expression. His own eyes softened as he reminded her to get some rest before heading out and gently closing the door behind him.

Alone in the room, Amelia bounced onto the bed, rolling across the covers with light laughter bubbling from her lips.

Now,she found herself increasingly satisfied with Wyatt as her future husband.

Plans for dinner with Holley's family drifted through her thoughts, prompting her to jump in the shower so she would look refreshed for the meal.

When she had opened the wardrobe earlier, she hadn't looked closely. Now, she noticed a drawer at the bottom filled with neatly arranged lingerie.

Embarrassment colored her cheeks as she snatched one quickly and closed the drawer, even though she knew it wasn't Wyatt himself who had arranged such intimate details.

When she reappeared downstairs, Amelia spotted Wyatt and Davin deep in their work, both looking at their laptops, making her feel a little uneasy. After all, as Wyatt's secretary, she was not working.

The sound of footsteps made Wyatt glance up instinctively, his eyes lighting up when he saw Amelia.

She wore a soft beige blouse and a flowing skirt in the same shade, her entire look radiating quiet elegance.

Wyatt had been working while waiting for Amelia. Seeing her come down, he immediately closed his laptop.

Wyatt and Amelia left the house together, a driver taking them to the restaurant. Davin stayed behind.

Holley had arranged the dinner at Moonlit Restaurant, the most renowned restaurant in Prevda.

As the car pulled up at the entrance, Amelia and Wyatt encountered Jordy, and after a round of greetings,the three of them made their way inside and up the stairs.

The sound of laughter from a young woman spilled out into the hall as they approached their private dining room.Jordy's face shifted at the sound, and he shot Wyatt a quick look.

Noticing that Wyatt's expression was unchanged, Jordy let out the breath he'd been holding.

Inside the private room, all conversation stopped as soon as the trio entered, and the three people already seated inside rose to their feet.

Holley greeted Amelia first, her voice warm and welcoming. "Amelia, it's wonderful to see you again."

As Holley received Amélia's greeting, Wyatt qietly pulled out the chair for Amelia.

Curiosity flickered across the faces of everyone in the private room, each one reacting differently to Wyatt's gesture.

Even though it was a simple act, Wyatt's gesture surprised them, since he was known as the Stewart Group's CEO and had never done something like that for anyone.

Amelia, for her part, didn't miss their reactions. She had previously met Holley in Kretol, so she was familiar with her. And when Wyatt greeted Jeffery Green, she followed, learning that he was Holley's husband. Jeffery smiled in return.

When Amelia turned to greet a young woman at the table, she was met with a frosty stare that seemed to chill the room.

The sharpness of that look caught Amelia off guard. After all, she was certain this was their very first meeting.
###Chapter 60 Someone Like You Is Not Worthy To Be With Wyatt


Elena Green stared at Amelia, who had taken the seat beside Wyatt, while her hands curled into fists beneath the table. She knew she shouldn't have come here today, but she just couldn't help herself.

Wyatt's history with women was practically nonexistent, which had Della quietly consulting others in search of a promising match.

As the only daughter in the second branch of the Green family-and the only girl among her relatives-Elena had always been Holley's favorite since Holley didn't have a daughter of her own.

When Della brought up the idea of finding Wyatt a wife, Holley intended to introduce Elena to Wyatt.

After all, Elena had long been interested in Wyatt, and the Green family also sought to strengthen their ties with the Stewart family.

Should Elena and Wyatt become husband and wife, it would be a good thing for both families.

But that plan collapsed when Amelia came into the picture.

After meeting Amelia in Kretol, Holley advised both the Green family and Elena to give up their matchmaking plan. Still, when Elena learned Holley would be treating Wyatt and Amelia for a meal, she also came.

Having arrived uninvited, Elena left Holley in a difficult position. Holley believed making her leave would only embarrass the Green family and Jeffery.

But now, seeing Elena's sharp glare toward Amelia made Holley wish she'd asked Elena to leave earlier.

"Elena, Amelia's an attractive woman, but it isn't polite to stare like that," Holley said.

At Holley's words, Elena's expression went rigid, though she quickly managed to force out a faint smile."I've just never seen another woman sit so close to Wyatt before. I guess I was just curious. Miss Flynn, I hope you don't take it the wrong way."

It was clear from Elena's tone that she had no intention of being friendly to Amelia, and Amelia's eyes turned cold.

Before she could say anything, Wyatt interjected, "Miss Green, we don't know each other that well. Please address me as Mr.Stewart."

Wyatt's words drew startled looks from everyone at the table except for Amelia.

Tears threatened to spill as Elena faced the sting of Wyatt's public dismissal, especially with Holley and Jeffery present.

Even with embarrassment burning on her cheeks, Elena composed herself and said, "Why are you so eager to distance yourself from me? Are you afraid that Miss Flynn might misunderstand something?"

Impatience flickered in Wyatt's eyes. He was about to say something when Amelia's gentle touch on his sleeve gave him pause.

When he looked down, he spotted Amelia's slim fingers on his cuff.

Whatever frustration he felt disappeared in an instant.

Amelia had no intention of letting Wyatt geton the wrong side of Holley's family on her behalf, and she was also no pushover.

She flashed Elena a playful grin. "Miss Green, why are you saying that? What is your relationship with Wyatt? Is there something between you two that I'm unaware of?"

Elena hadn't expected Amelia to say something like that to her, and her face darkened immediately.

Although Wyatt himself was unaware of the matter, both families had been optimistic about Elena and Wyatt being together before. However, Amelia's appearance had ruined what she had anticipated the most.How was that fair?

Trembling hands betrayed Elena's anger, while Amelia simply held her ground and looked her in the eye.

The air in the room thickened, tension mounting with every passing second.

Fortunately, at that moment, a waiter entered carrying plates, allowing Holley to change the topic and strike up a cheerful conversation withWyatt and Amelia.

Moonlit Restaurant's food was said to be the best in town, yet Amelia could hardly enjoy it after the conversation with Elena.

A few mouthfuls later, she stood up and quietly excused herself for the restroom.

Causing a scene during the meal was the last thing on Amelia's mind, and she didn't want Wyatt to be put in a tough spot because of her, so she lingered in the corridor outside the restroom, not wanting to return to the private room so soon.

No sooner had she settled into a bench in the corridor when a biting remark cut through the silence."Someone like you is not worthy to be with Wyatt."

Catching the hostility in Elena's eyes, Amelia retorted, "Miss Green, I didn't ask for your opinion. You can't decide Wyatt's future for him,either."

Those words hit their mark, and Elena's cheeks flushed with anger. Despite the sting, she kept her voice steady. "I'm simply telling the truth. You can't do anything to help his career. With my family's influence,Wyatt could go so much farther in his career if he chose to be with me."

"Miss Green, I wonder why you think the Stewart Group needs your help for its future."

Suddenly,another voice cut through the tension.

Amelia and Elena turned around at once, finding Wyatt and Jordy standing nearby.
###Chapter 61 Holding Her Hand


Spotting Wyatt,Amelia quickly stood and made her way over. "What brings you here?" she asked.

Wyatt answered, "You'd been gone a while, so I was worried that you might have gotten lost."

While the Moonlit Restaurant was spacious, Amelia believed it wasn't nearly confusing enough for someone to be lost in here. Still, she replied with a warm smile, "Let's hurry back before Holley and Jeffery start to worry about us."

A quick look at Elena standing off to the side gave Amelia pause. After abeat, she gently slipped her arm through Wyatt's.

But Wyatt dodged her.

She was momentarily stunned by Wyatt's action, while Elena, whose expression had been dark, couldn't hide a trace of joy in her eyes. But then, she saw Wyatt's hand move to hold Amelia's.

The delicate warmth of Amelia's fingers brought a rush of happiness to Wyatt, stirring something in his heart.

He had been wanting to do this for a long time.

Wyatt's spirits lifted while he held Amelia's hand. Yet, when his gaze found Elena, his expression iced over once more.

In the presence of Jordy, Wyatt said to Elena with a voice like steel, "I'll let things slide for the Green family's sake tonight. Next time, you won't be so lucky."

The warning sent shock through Elena. Fear widened her eyes as she turned desperately to Jordy for help.

Turning to Jordy, Wyatt continued, "Let Holley and Jeffery know that Amelia and I are heading back."

Jordy gave a nod and then turned to Amelia, his voice softer. "I will treat you and Wyatt to a meal soon." Amelia's lips curved into a friendly smile as she accepted, and together, she and Wyatt left the Moonlit Restaurant.

Once they'd gone, Jordy's frustration boiled over as he turned to Elena and snapped, "Have you lost your mind? Did you even realize what you were doing just now?"

Although nerves made Elena waver at first, hearing Jordy-who rarely raised his voice at her-speak so sternly only fueled her anger. "I'm your cousin! How could you take their side and not mine?"

The question nearly made Jordy explode in fury. He shook his head, unwilling to argue with her, and strode back toward the private room.

Inside, Holley and Jeffery were waiting, both glancing up as Jordy entered with a dark expression. Holley frowned and asked, "Where are Wyatt and Amelia? What happened?"

Jordy's irritation surged again. "Mom, you knew Wyatt was bringing Amelia to the meal. So why did you let Elena come?"

Seeing the accusation in her son's eyes, Holley also got angry."Don't raise your voice at me! If you're looking for someone to blame, ask your father what he did!"

The truth was, Holley had reserved the private room while only Jeffery was present. If Jeffery hadn't told Elena about the matter, Elena wouldn't have come here.

Put on the spot by both his wife and his son, Jeffery looked uneasy as he said, "I really didn't do anything-"

"Do you honestly believe your tricks are hidden from me?" Holley snapped.

Years in the world of business had made it easy for her to pick up on Jeffery's motives.

Even though Jeffery's care for Elena was sincere, his wish to see her with Wyatt was mostly for the Green family's interest.

Before meeting Amelia, Jeffery had believed Amelia wouldn't be more suitable for Wyatt than Elena.

Even after meeting Amelia, he was still somewhat unwilling to accept that Wyatt had chosen Amelia instead of Elena. No one could refuse the opportunity to establish a relationship with the Stewart Group, and Jeffery was no exception.

Inside the car, Wyatt lowered his voice in apology, assuring Amelia that Elena meant nothing to him.

Something about his earnestness made Amelia's lips curve in a gentle smile. "I could already see that."

From the way he treated Elena, it was plain for all to see that Wyatt felt nothing for her.

As the car rolled through city streets, Amelia found herself captivated by the dazzling lights outside the window.

Prevda, famous for its old-world allure, boasted centuries-old avenues that still buzzed with energy long after dark.

Spotting Amelia's fascination with the city,Wyatt followed her line of sight and then instructed the driver to pull over.

Before Amelia could ask him why he wanted the car to stop, Wyatt had already opened the car door and extended his hand towards her.

Ever since he first held her hand, he had become somewhat enamored with the feeling of their fingers intertwined.

Amelia didn't overthink it, considering she was wearinghigh heels and perceiving Wyatt's gesture as an act of gentlemanly conduct.

It wasn't until she had steadied herself outside the car that she realized Wyatt hadn't let go, prompting her to look at him in confusion.

"The road ahead is rough. It's safer if I hold your hand," Wyatt said.

Indeed, the cobblestone street beneath them made every step a challenge for Amelia in heels.

At first, the unfamiliar closeness felt odd to Amelia, butsoon, her attention drifted to the bustling street vendors and their cheerful shouts, and she forgot all about their intertwined hands. A sparkle of happiness appeared in her eyes. She hadn't felt this much joy since her college days with Carlee. She rarely visited such places after getting engaged to Jaxtori.

She loved bustling streets like these.

Wyatt had never mingled in crowded streets like these. The rush of bodies and constant noise unsettled him, but Amelia's bright smile made the experience worthwhile.

Amelia hadn't eaten much at Moonlit Restaurant, and the tempting smells of food now made her stomach rumble. However, considering Wyatt's status, she refrained from expressing her desire to try them.

She believed someone in his position likely wouldn't care for street snacks, so she resigned herself to moving forward, but Wyatt's hand stopped her in her tracks.

With curiosity in his eyes, he asked, "Why not try some food here?"
###Chapter 62| Believe You


Curiosity got the better of Amelia, so she asked, "Áren't you put off by these? The food here sits out in the open, with crowds brushing past all evening. Aren't you worried that we might get sick after eating it?"

Wyatt grinned and responded, "Honestly, our bodies are tougher than we think. A little street food now and then won't hurt us."

The sincerity in his answer had Amelia bursting into laughter, despite her best efforts to hold it in.

While Wyatt wasn't sure what had made her laugh, her amusement was contagious and lifted his mood.

After hearing Wyatt's words, Amelia found herself able to relax.

She went from stall to stall, arms soon full with snacks and a few souvenirs for her friends.

Wandering along with arms full, neither Wyatt nor Amelia noticed when the crowds thinned, and they ended up in a quieter alley.

With Wyatt's hand entwined with hers, Amelia strolledonward, her thoughts drifting back to the very first time they had met two years ago.

It was in a similar alleyway. Initially, she hadn't thought of helping Wyatt.

For a moment, she had intended to ignore him and walk away, but everything changed when Wyatt suddenly grabbed her ankle. Instinct kicked in-she gave him a sharp kick. Only after the kick did she realize what was happening...

The memory brought a smile to her lips. Catching Wyatt's confused look, she said, "Funny,you were lying in an alley back then,too."

Wyatt's features softened at her words as he thought about that. "I remember how terrified you looked.What made you decide to save me then?" he asked.

Amelia's cheeks grew warm at the question. How could she admit the truth-that his face alone made her hesitate to leave?

At first, she'd meant to just call the police and ieave, but one look at the handsome stranger lying helpless made her reconsider.

Of course, she couldn't let Wyatt know that, so she switched topics without missing a beaf, asking,what really happened that night? Why were you hurt so badly?"

Wyatt's status meant there were always people shadowing him for protection, anid even now, Amelía spotted a few distant figures tailing them to protect them with practiced subtlety. But back then, Wyatt had been hurt with no one to help him.

Wyatt didn't reply right away, the question giving him pause.

Just as Amelia began to worry she'd crossed a line by asking that, he spoke, his voice suddenly cold."My uncle set me up. He sabotaged the brakes on my car. I was on the highway when the brakes failed."

With just a few words from Wyatt, Amelia realized the danger he had been in at that time.

Losing the brakes on a highway could easily turn deadly.

Amelia wanted to ask why his uncle had done such a thing, but before she could say anything, she realized the answer.

People had always talked about power struggles in wealthy families, and inside the influential Stewart family,the stakes were probably even higher.

What had been a lighthearted mood between them vanished in a blink. Silence lingered until they reached the edge of the alley, when Wyatt finally said, "Amelia, if you marry me, you'll have to face those threats,too. Still, you can believe me when I say I'll do whatever it takes to keep you safe."

His earnest look caught her attention. She met his gaze and responded with certainty, "I believe you."

A mischievous smile appeared as she added, "Even though your family might be dangerous, my family is no better. That means we're on equal ground."

By the time they returned to where they were staying, midnight was close at hand. Davin sat in the living room, patiently awaiting their arrival.

Amelia felt slightly guilty about coming back so late and gave Davin some snacks and trinkets she had bought.

Despite working as Wyatt's assistant and having more money than some business owners, Davin smiled with genuine joy as he accepted the things from Amelia.

However, just as he was about to take a bite of a snack, he noticed Wyatt's icy gaze

He quickly said, "I should go back to my room and get some rest. Goodnight."

Without wasting another moment, Davin retreated to his room, snacks in hand.

Although Amelia had managed the waIk in heels without complaint earlier, exhaustion set in now that the excitement faded.She excused herself,letting Wyatt know she was heading upstairs to rest.

Watching her climb the stairs, Wyatt found himself sulking.

Even Davin had received something from her. What about him?

Unbeknownst to him, Amelia had picked out a gift for him as well. She had just forgotten to give it tohim.Only when she was back in her room that she remembered it.

She had bought Wyatt a small wooden carving, an adorable little rabbit.

Without wasting a moment, she slipped out of her room with the item.

Inside his bedroom, Wyatt had just removed his shirt and was about to slip into a robe when a gentle knock sounded at his door. Amelia called out, "Wyatt, are you still up? If you are, I have something for you.If you're sleeping,then I'll just-"

Before she could finish, he pulled the door open from inside.

He stood before her in a black robe, the sash loosely knotted. The sight of his chest, faintly visible beneath the fabric, caught her off guard.

Heat rushed to her cheeks, and the wooden rabbit slipped from her grasp, landing on the floor.
###Chapter 63 Her First Kiss


Without a second thought, Amelia bent down to pick up the little wooden rabbit. "I bought this at a stall and thought you might likeit," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

While she spoke, her eyes darted everywhere but at Wyatt. For a moment, she didn't know where to look.

Wyatt reached over and took the gift from her hand, his words gentle. "Thank you.I really like it."

The little rabbit reminded him of Amelia. That was the reason he had glanced at it several times before.

He never dreamed she'd notice his interest and buy it for him, and now, a spark of happiness filled his heart.

After passing the rabbit to Wyatt, Amelia made a move to leave. But before she could do that, he stepped aside and swung the door open wider. "Come inside. Sit with me for a while."

He was already moving inside the room before she could think of a reason to refuse.

Reluctantly, she trailed after him, eyes falling on his tall frame as he walked ahead.

No sooner had she sat down on the sofa than Wyatt poured a glass of mango juice for her.

The room still held traces of steam from his recent shower, and the air felt heavy, thick with warmth. Amelia felt that her breathing had grown shallow.

She accepted the glass from him, took a generous gulp, and let the cool juice chase away some of her unease.

Wyatt noticed her discomfort and said, "You've been on your feet all day. You must be exhausted. Maybe I should let you goback to rest now."

Hearing this, Amelia quickly set the bottle down and stood up, ready to leave.

Wyatt also rose to see her off. They both took a step in the same direction, bumping into each other, Amelia stumbled back, thrown off balance. Quick reflexes kicked in, and Wyatt's hand shot out, catching her as both of them landed in the armchair together.

Something landed on her lips, and Amella's eyes flew open wide in surprise.

Never had she been so close to Wyatt before. She could see her own surprised face reflected in his dark eyes.

With a sudden burst of panic, she tried to push him away, but he caught her hand before she could break free.

The sweet mango scent filled the air, and the unique fragrance of Amelia kept flooding into Wyatt's senses,quickly dissolving his self-control.

He kept a gentle but firm hold on her hand, unable to stop himself from deepening the kiss, drawn in by everything about her.

Wyatt's excitemnent sparked when Amelia didn't resist him. He wrapped his arms around her even tighter.

Amelia's mind went blank, and she felt dizzy.

This was her first kiss!

Back in college, she had never gone as far as holding hands with any boy. After graduation, she became engaged to Jaxton.

Even during harmonious times with Jaxton, they only held hands, rarely hugged,let alone kissed.

Wyatt found himself wanting to get closer to Amelia. His gaze, deep and intense, gave away the desire he could not hide.

When Amelia caught the look in his eyes, her heart started racing.

She didn't have any real experience with intimacy, but she understood what he was thinking right now.

Right when her panic reached its peak, a knock came from the other side of the door. She'd never been so thankful for an interruption like this. She wriggled free from Wyatt's hold and dashed from the room, leaving her slippers behind without a second thought.

"Mr. Stewart... I... Did I come at a bad time?"

At the doorway, Davin hesitated, eyeing Amelia's rushed escape and Wyatt's disheveled robe. His throat went dry as he tried to process the scene.

Why did he have to work so diligently? That report could have waited until morning.

"You can forget about your quarterly bonus. It's gone," Wyatt said coldly.

"Mr.Stewart,I-"

"One more word, and your next quarter's bonus disappears, too."

Davin clamped his mouth shut, closed the door for Wyatt, and quickly left.
###Chapter 64 | Will Make Sure To Treat You Well,Too


Back inside her room, Amelia pressed her back to the closed door, letting herself breathe and trying to steady her racing thoughts.

Sleep wouldn't come to her that night. Wyatt's scent that clung to her skin and the memory of his eyes came to her mind every time she closed her eyes.

Only when the faint blushof morning crept through her curtains did exhaustion finally pull her into a shallow slumber.

She blinked awake to a sky so clear it seemed unreal.

Her hand darted to the nightstand for her phone, and the time made her eyes widen-noon was just around the corner.

When she scrambled out of bed and was about to head downstairs, her mind replayed the scenes from the previous night.

It was just a kiss, she told herself. With her wedding to Wyatt on the horizon, it shouldn't have meant anything unusual.

Amelia repeatedly told herself not to mind that and to be composed before heading downstairs.

However, to her surprise, Wyatt was nowhere to be found. The empty house offered both a sense of relief and a twinge of disappointment.

Had he left early just to avoid her?

The thought crept in, making her feel uneasy again.

Just then, a sudden noise by the entrance startled her, and her heart skipped a beat until she realized it was only Davin.

Davin, still remembering last night's scene, felt slightly awkward, but he managed a courteous smile."Miss Flynn， Mr. Stewart was out in a meeting and would lke you to join him for lunch at Moonlit Restaurant. You＇目set off for the site inspection later this afternoon."

Hearing that Wyatt's absence was due to a meeting at one of his company's branches-not because of her -brought a small wave of comfort to Amelia.

The ride to the restaurant became a time to work. Amelia began typing out ideas for the resort proposal,only tucking her phone away when the car arrived at the destination.

Davin walked her to the private dining room before excusing himself.

As Wyatt's voice drifted from inside, Amelia's nerves threatened to undo her composure. She paused for a moment,telling herself to stay calm before finally stepping inside.

Seeing her, Wyatt rose and reached out to pull a chair out for her.. The moment she sat down, a server appeared with a bowl of soup. "You missed breakfast. Try some soup first; it'll settle your stomach," Wyatt said.

Nothing seemed out of place in Wyatt's manner, so Amelia fought to keep her own composure.

Barely touching her dinner last night, and now seeing a table filled with her favorite dishes, Amelia quickly began to eat as Wyatt joined her.

Moonlit Restaurant's flavors did not disappoint her.

By the end of the meal, Amelia finally felt relaxed. That was when Wyatt leaned in, voice low, and asked "Was last night's kiss really your first kiss?"

The words came out like a question, yet the certainty.in his voice left little room for doubt.

A sudden cough wracked Amelia as the juice went down the wrong way, making her eyes water.

Wyatt stepped in immediately. He moved behind her, steady hand patting her back with gentle reassurance.

It took a minute before Amelia finally managed to draw a steady breath.

She shot him a fierce look that could have pierced armor, silently wishing he would let the matter drop. Her mind was filled with silent complaints, but Wyatt's deep voice interrupted her thoughts. "That was my first kiss,too."

At first, the meaning slipped past her. Once it registered, she was shocked.

Although Wyatt was only twenty-five, Amelia knew that many wealthy men, like Jaxton, had lived recklessly during their university years, messing around with women.

But Wyatt was clearly different.

Learning that last night's kiss had been his first kiss sent a jolt of joy through her.

"You'll have to be good to me from now on, Amelia," Wyatt said.

"What?" Amelia found herself grinning. Shouldn't she be the one who said that?

"I'll make sure to treat you well, too,"Wyatt answered in a serious tone, almost as if he could hear her thoughts.

Relaxing, Amelia found herself chatting effortlessly with Wyatt. The atmosphere stayed light until a sudden knock came. Davin's voice echoed from outside. "Mr. Stewart, it's about time."

Stepping outside the restaurant, all three made their way directly to Prevda's bustling development district.

Once everyone settled into the car, Amelia turned her attention to her phone, making adjustments to her resort proposal.

Wyatt was about to ask her what she was doing when Amelia handed him her phone. "Here's a draft of my proposal. Take a look and tell me what you think."

Wyatt accepted the phone, his focus shifting entirely to the screen as he read the proposal.

Seeing his concentrated expression, Amelia felt a ripple of nervousness she hadn't expected.
###Chapter 65 | Stand By My Decision


Though Amelia had racked up glowing reviews for her business proposals back in college, the cutthroat world outside campus was a different beast altogether.

She was unsure if her abilities would be acknowledged by Wyatt, who had been navigating the business world for years.

Rather than handing Amelia's phone back after reading the proposal, Wyatt tapped it against the passenger seat.

Catching the signal, Davin glanced up in the rearview mirror, then turned around to take the phone from Wyatt's hand.

After Amelia nodded her approval, Davin read the proposal.

Surprise flashed across Davin's face as he skimmed through the opening pages of her proposal. By the time he finished, he was beginning to sweat a little.

Anxiety coiled in Amelia's chest as she saw their reactions. When the phone returned to her hands, she couldn't help but ask, "Is there something seriously wrong with my proposal?"

Wyatt answered with a faintly amused look toward the front seat, "There are a few tweaks needed, but it is leagues ahead of anything Davin's managed so far. Honestly, are you sure you deserve that million-dollar annual salary,Davin?"

After all his years with Wyatt, Davin found himself sweating for real for the first time.

He really wanted to ask Amelia how she had come up with such a great proposal so quickly, but he bit his tongue, not wanting to look foolish.

While Wyatt and Amelia began diving into the finer points, Davin quietly pulled out his own phone, intent on recording the conversation. Listening to Wyatt dissect each issue and pinpoint solutions, Amelia was struck by a wave of nostalgia,feeling as if she'd been dropped right back into a top-tier business lecture in college.

Honestly, she thought, if Wyatt ever went bankrupt, he'd still make an exceptional college professor.

That thought vanished as quickly as it came-nobody from the Stewart family wouId face bankruptcy easily.

As the car rolled to a stop in the construction zone, a swirl of grit swept over. After getting out of the car,Amelia reached into her bag and retrieved a baseball cap she had prepared.

Her usual bright style and long, loose hair often made her seem vibrant. With the black cap and the pale gray tracksuit, she looked every bit the diligent college student.

As soon as Amelia began working, every ounce of her energy went into carefully surveying the grounds,snapping pictures, and jotting down notes, completely unaware that Wyatt's eyes tracked her every move.

Suddenly, a familiar yet grating female voice interrupted them.

Striding onto the site in a crisp white suit and sky-high heels, Elena exuded a sense of competence.

However, after she had taken only a few steps, her confidence took a hit as her heels sank deep into the loose earth. She let out a frustrated curse, but upon spoting Wyatt and the others, she instantly pasted on a smile and walked over as if nothing had happened.

"Mr. Stewart, I'm the lead on this resort project. Let me know if you need anything-I'm happy to assist."Elena addressed Wyatt this way because of his words last night.

After returning to the Green family household the previous night, Elena couldn't contain her anger. Her parents were also furious upon learning about what had happened at the Moonlit Restaurant.

Kevin Green and Carlotta Green were dissatisfied with what Wyatt had done. Still, they were unwilling to give up on the idea of making him their son-in-law. After hours of debate, they decided to hand the reins of the resort project to Elena, hoping Wyatt would see their daughter's capabilties.

Carlotta's final advice rang in Elena's mind: a woman's competence outweighed her looks-a truth that had her wading through dust and mud despite her displeasure. When she learned that Wyatt intended to entrust the project to Amelia, her smile vanished instantly.

Annoyance flared, and as she eyed Amelia's youthful look, jealousy twisted inside her. She said mockingly,"Mr. Stewart, this project is huge. Miss Flynn is still new to the business world. I doubt she's ready for something of this scale."

Amelia replied, her tone steady but edged with steel, "Nobody is born a veteran-every expert started out with zero experience. You haven't even seen what I can do, so on what grounds are you doubting my ability to run this project?"

Secretly, Amelia had worried about whether she could pull off a project of this scale. Yet, Elena's thinly veiled contempt only fanned the flames of her determination to handle the project well.

Now, her mind was set-she would make this project a success, no matter what.

Wyatt stood firmly at Amelia's side, quietly impressed with the way she held her ground.

Those words landed like a challenge at Elena's feet, but she ignored Amelia and turned to Wyatt.Stewart, is it really wise to hand such a major project to a rookie? What if something goes wrong? Can she take responsibility?"

Wyatt's reply was cold. "I have full confidence in her. And if the project fails, that's fine-it'll just provide her with valuable experience. Either way, I stand by my decision."
###Chapter 66 The Morrison Family Has Won The Bid


Wyatt's words left Elena feeling complicated emotions-shock mixed with a stab of envy twisting inside her.

Once the resort project broke ground, the Stewart Group was set to pour in hundreds of millions, if not more.

And yet, Wyatt tossed out the idea of using it as"practice" for Amelia, as if money and risk were just afterthoughts.What had Amelia done to earn that kind of treatment?

Choosing to ignore the subtle hint from her own assistant, Elena focused her glare on Amelia, storm clouds brewing in her eyes. She was about to say something when Amelia extended a document toward her.

A scowl darkened Elena's features as she glanced at it. "What's this supposed to be?"

"Weren't you concerned about whether I could handle a project of this scale, Miss Green?" Amelia said, her tone even. "Here's the proposal I put together for the resort project. Feel free to have a look."

Instead of reviewing the document, Elena handed the document off to her assistant with a careless flick,refusing to so much as skim Amelia's work.

Wyatt's expression cooled at Elena's dismissiveness, but the quiet admiration in his eyes grew as he watched Amelia's unwavering confidence.

She really was something special.

Meanwhile, the assistant-who'd been appointed by Jeffery's parents to keep an eye on things-started flipping through the proposal. The more he read, the more his skepticism faded. He couldn't deny how thoroughly prepared and professional the proposal was.

Leaning in, he tried to share his findings with Elena, telling her the proposal was good, but she retorted,"You must be kidding. There's no way she put together anything worth reading-"

The words caught in her throat the moment her eyes landled on the contents of the proposal. The Green family placed great importance on training her in business, so Elena could recognize a good proposal when she saw one.

The only time she'd encountered a report of this caliber was in the company's main boardroom; it had been put together by senior executives with years in the game.

How on earth could someone so new to the business world, like Amelia, produce work of this caliber?

Without hesitation, Elena's mind snapped to the conclusion that the proposal wasn't Amelia's work.

Picking up on Elena's skepticism, Amelia met her gaze with a taunt. "Miss Green, just because you can't do something doesn't mean others can't."

Not stopping there, Amelia dove into the core concepts behind her proposal, expanding on each point with clarity and offering several strategic suggestions. Once she'd finished, she turned the tables with a string of questions about the resort's development, none of which Elena could answer.

Amelia turned to Wyatt and deliberately said,"Mr. Stewart, can you confirm that I'm in complete charge of the resort project?"

"Everything related to the project is yours to handle," Wyatt replied.

"Then my first order of business is a request-she needs to be replaced," Amelia said, gesturing toward Elena.

Red-faced and trembling with fury, Elena exclaimed, "This is my family's land! What right do you have to replace me?"

"The land belongs to your family, not to you personally!" A voice echoed just as Elena finished speaking.

Jordy appeared, striding toward the group with determination.

News had reached him that Kevin and Carlotta had handed the project to Elena, prompting him to head straight to the construction site.

Without wasting time, Jordy addressed Elena directly, saying,"I'm stepping in to oversee the resort project.You can go home now." "Why? How is that fair?" Elena snapped.

Jordy didn't bother arguing with her; he simply nodded to the nearby assistant and bodyguard. "Take her home.Now."

Within minutes, Elena was ushered into a waiting car and whisked away. Once she was gone, Jordy turned to Amelia with a friendly smile. "I'll be overseeing the resort project from here on out. Are you alright with that,Amelia?"

***


After touring the site and collecting data, Amelia realized this project had real potential.

Determined to keep things professional, she decided to forget about what had happened with Elena. She offered Jordy her hand, signaling her willingness to collaborate.

Prepared for the occasion, Jordy had even brought the contract.

He passed the document to Wyatt, who promptly handed it to Amelia with a reassuring nod. "As I promised,you're in charge."

His trust made Amelia laugh softly. "You're not worried I'll blow the whole thing?"

Wyatt only shrugged, his confidence unwavering.few hundred million is nothing. I can handle the risk."

His laid-back attitude melted Amelia's worries. With a few confident strokes of her pen, she signed the contract and replied, "You can relax. I'll make sure this project is a win."

With business settled, Jordy suggested having dinner together, but Wyatt declined the offer.

Fresh news from Kretol had reached Wyatt-the Morrison family had clinched the east side development bid.

Without a second thought, Wyatt wanted to return to Kretol with Amelia that very night.

Amelia said nothing in front of Jordy. But as soon as she and Wyatt boarded the plane, she couldn't hold it in any longer. "Did the Morrison family really get the bid?" Wyatt's answer was measured. "The official results are supposed to be announced in two days."

"Then..."

Wyatt caught the confusion flickering across Amelia's face and slid a tablet her way.

On the screen, she found the bidding results and qualification files for the Eastside Project.

Her eyes quickly landed on the Morrison Group's name at the very top.

It wasn't surprising since they were the successful bidder. But the bid and materials from the Morrison Group looked strikingly familiar to her.

Something about this set off alarms in her mind. A quick scan jogged her memory; every detail matched a set of documents she'd saved on her own laptop just days earlier.

She remembered working late, archiving the proposal and supporting paperwork herself.

Suddenly, a chill ran down her spine. Panic crept into her voice as she turned to Wyatt. "I never gave any of my work to the Morrison family. I swear, I didn't..."
###Chapter 67 Did You Really Win The Bid


"You don't need to worry-I know you weren't involved." Wyatt caught the flicker of anxiety in Amelia's eyes and quickly spoke up.

Amelia's nerves eased a little, and Wyatt continued, "Jaxton submitted the bid and files, but he got them straight from Dayna."

All the while, Davin had been monitoring Jaxton's every move, so he knew that Jaxton had submitted the bid and documents only after Dayna had visited him in the hospital.

The Morrison Group remained in the competition because, truthfully, Wyatt had planned for this exact outcome all along.

Dayna's name triggered Amelia to open her phone and launch the surveillanceapp.

The cozy apartment-once a birthday gift from Katrina-had always felt safe, but from day one,Amelia had installed a hidden camera for extra security.

Nobody else, not even Carlee, knew the camera existed.

A few taps, and Amelia wound the footage back to the previous night. She soon spotted a figure slipping into her place.

Dayna's disguise was thorough, but Amelia still recognized her in an instant.

Tempted to change the locks and alert the police, Amelia reached for her phone to call the police after landing,but Wyatt stopped her.

Catching her confused glance, Wyatt lowered his voice, an enigmatic smile on his lips."Let's wait.for a few days before involving the police."

Though not understanding why Wyatt was saying this, Amelia complied and put away her phone.

***
"Jaxton,the Morrison Group landed the bid! The project's officially ours. This is wonderful!"

Dayna couldn't hide her excitement, her eyes lighting up as she pointed at the notification on Jaxton's phone.

Pure joy took over Jaxton's expression, and remembering the documents Dayna had slipped him the night before, he grabbed her hand. "This win is all thanks to you, Dayna. You are a lot better than that cold-hearted woman Amelia."

Just the mention of Amelia sent a flicker of resentment through both Dayna and Jaxton.

For a second, unease pricked Dayna's conscience, but she quickly shrugged it off, reassured by how well she'd covered her tracks.

"Jaxton, is it really true? Did you really win the bid?"

Laura had rushed straight to the hospital as soon as she got wind of the news, so caught up in her excitement that she didn't even notice Dayna in the hospital room.

One look at the congratulatory message on Jaxton's phone screen, and Laura was finally convinced-he really had secured the bid.

Years of corporate experience kept Laura from celebrating too soon.

With so many eyes on the Stewart Group and every powerful family in Kretol fighting to claim the project, it felt a bit odd for the Morrison Group to walk away with such a lucrative deal so easily.

The more Laura thought about it, the more suspicious she became, prompting her to say to Jaxton, "Jaxton,don't signthe contract yet. I'll have someone investigate-"

"I've already asked Clayton to sign it," Jaxton interjected.

Worried that the Stewart Group might backtrack, he'd sent Clayton to seal the deal as soon as he won the bid. By now, he figured, the contract had already been signed.

Laura's face fell at the news, anger clouding her features. "Jaxton, this was a huge decision. Why didn't you check with me first? What if there's an issue with the project?"

Securing the project, Jaxton had been hoping for a few words of approval from Laura; her frustration now left him deflated and furious.

"Mom! You handed the matter over for me to manage.If I have to run every move past you, what's the point of giving me the project? And let's be real-have you ever seen a Stewart Group project go wrong in all these years?" Jaxton said.

Memories of the Stewart Group's spotless track record brought Laura a measure of comfort.

Still, a nagging doubt lingered about the legitimacy of their win. Sensing her suspicion, Jaxton reluctantly explained that Dayna had delivered the proposal documents to him.

Laura wasted no time turning her focus to Dayna. "How exactly did you get your hands on such sensitive materials?"

Under the watchful eyes of Jaxton and Laura, Dayna finally cracked and admitted to using a spare key to sneak into Amelia's apartment.

Finding out that Dayna had stolen the files right from Amelia's laptop, Laura scoffed, her gaze mocking.Yet,knowing her own company had profited, she didn't say anything about it.

Not long after, Clayton entered the hospital room, contract in hand, drawing Laura's and Jaxton's full attention.

Laura pored over the document-once, then a second time-and only when she found nothing out of place did shefinally look relieved, smiling.

Seeing her relax, Jaxton straightened up, a smug satisfaction in his tone. "See, Mom? Nothing's wrong.Now, you can breathe easy."
###Chapter 68 Fueling Internal Conflicts In The Flynn...
Upon returning home, Amelia conducted a thorough sweep of her apartment, checking every drawer and cabinet to make sure nothing else was missing before arranging for a locksmith to change the locks.


No sooner had she seen the locksmith out than her phone buzzed-Ricky's number flashing on the screen.


Without any preamble, Ricky launched into a rant,accusing Amelia of secretly helping the Morrison family get the project.


He instructed her to come back to the Flynn estate immediately.


Coincidentally, Amelia was also planning to go back,so she immediately agreed.



No sooner had Amelia entered the living room than a glass shot through the air in her direction. If her reflexes hadn't been so sharp, she'd have taken the blow right to the head.


Ice settled in her eyes as she fixed Ricky with a gaze that could freeze fire. "Go ahead, try to hit me again if you dare." 
The resemblance between Amelia and Katrina was uncanny. At that moment, Amelia's cold demeanor was exactly like Katrina's.



For a fleeting instant, Ricky felt like he was facing Katrina. The memory rattled him enough that his raised hand fell to his side.



Still,he was furious. He blurted out, "You haven't even married Jaxton, and already, you're betraying your own family for him! All those warnings for us to stay out of the bidding... So it was your plan all along to let the Morrison family win the bid?"



Amelia didn't bother justifying herself to a man she considered foolish. So, she crossed the room and dropped onto the sofa, pretending not to hear him at all.


Her relaxed posture only stoked Ricky's anger further.



Catching his furious glare, Amelia met it with a resigned sigh. "If all those top companies wanted the contract, how did the Morrison Group-an ordinary company-end up walking away with the win?"


Before Ricky could get a word in, Amelia continued,"I'm telling you, I never passed any inside information to the Morrison family."


She was certain that, even without Dayna meddling, Jaxton would have still landed the deal.



The bigger players weren't stupid-if she spotted the red flags, they definitely did, too. They just kept quiet,not wanting to risk crossing Wyatt



Jaxton, of course, was too clueless to see the problem.



As Amelia laid out her reasoning, the fury in Ricky's eyes started to fade.



Janessa,standing nearby, seized the opportunity to stoke the fire. "That's the Stewart Group we are talking about. Their projects have never had issues all these years."



Amelia didn't let it slide. "Maybe you should worry less about this and more about giving my father a son,"she said, changing the topic so suddenly that Ricky and Janessa both froze.



Catching a glimpse of Lainey lingering on the stairs,Amelia added, her tone sweet, "I'm just your daughter,Dad. Sooner or later, I'll get married and leave the family. What's going to happen to the Flynn family after that?"



Janessa's voice rose, sharp and panicked as she watched Ricky's face turn thoughtful. "Don't try to twist things, Amelia! Your mother made sure you got sixty percent of the shares before she died. Who are you trying to fool with these words now?" Calmly finishing her glass of water, Amelia answered with patience, "Ask yourself,Janessa-why would my mother insist on that? You know exactly why."



"Why would I know that?"



"It has something to do with you. If you hadn't been in the picture, my mother would never have felt the need to take precautions. She left those shares to me to guard against you."



"That's nonsense!"



Rarely did Janessa lose her composure, but now, her fury was impossible to miss.


Everybody in Kretol knew the truth: Katrina had protected those shares from Ricky, not Janessa.


"I think you're the one talking nonsense here, Janessa!"Lainey blurted out, unable to bite her tongue any longer.


As her grandmother drew near, Amelia hurried over to offer support. "Grandma, maybe you should have a word with Janessa. Look around Kretol-every prominent family ensures there's a son to inherit the family assets. If Janessa could give my father a son, I'd happily hand those shares over myself."



"Amelia, do you really mean that?" Lainey asked. Before Janessa or Ricky could say anything, Lainey's grip tightened around Amelia's arm.


Quietly, Amelia slipped her arm free, her eyes wide and earnest. "I mean every word."


Janessa, nearly fifty, had no chance of providing an heir-Amelia's remark was a calculated move to stir up trouble.



Lost in her own worries, Janessa could only sit with it as Lainey turned and fixed Ricky with a cold stare."Ricky, you should divorce Janessa soon!"
###Chapter 69 Stay Out Of It



The urge to leave faded as Amelia heard those words,so she dropped back onto the sofa.



Lainey's plan revealed a cruelty that surprised even Amelia. Lainey intended to break up Ricky and Janessa's marriage without a second thought.



Janessa's eyes burned red with anger. She raised her voice at Lainey,ignoring the fact that Ricky was still here."What kind of mother are you? Telling your son to get a divorce-you are out of line!"



Not a flicker of guilt appeared on Lainey's face. She met Janessa's outrage with calm self-assurance."Lower your voice. You were nothing but a mistress before getting married to my son. You don't have the right to yell at me."



The insult stung so badly that Janessa felt both furious and aggrieved.



She also wanted to have a son, but she just couldn't.



Decades of bitter remedies flashed through her mind,the taste of countless herbal concoctions rising up in her throat. She'd tried everything to have a son,but she hadn't succeeded. 
Doctors had given her a clean bill of health.Sometimes, she wondered if Ricky was the problem all along.


Still, one glance at Ricky's dark expression kept her silent. Janessa buried her face in her hands and wept quietly on the sofa.


Lainey,unwilling to relent, watched Janessa's tears fall with a frown. She scolded, "Why are you crying?You are the one who can't give the Flynn family a son."


Without missing a beat, she turned her focus to Ricky."Listen to me. Divorce this woman. Find someone younger,someone who can give you a son.l-"


Ricky hadn't felt so humiliated in years. Even though Lainey was his mother, he couldn't help but growl at her, "That's enough! Whether we divorce is between Janessa and me; stay out of it."


Lainey flinched at his sudden tone, but then,she flopped onto the carpet, shouting, "I raised you, and this is how you treat me? Ricky, have you no shame?"


Fists pounding the carpet, her cries echoed off the walls.





The room became a storm of Lainey's shrieks and Janessa's quiet sobs, while Ricky's face clouded with rage. Off to the side, Amelia watched the unfolding drama and tried hard to keep herself from bursting into laughter.


She then composed herself and walked over to help Lainey to her feet.


Lainey, realizing someone was there for her, let Amelia settle her onto the sofa but didn't pause her cries.



"Your father doesn't care about me at all. I raised him on my own, and now, he stands against me for a woman."



Siding with Lainey, Amelia said to Ricky, "Dad, how could you speak to Grandma like that? She's always got your best interests at heart. Maybe show some gratitude for once."


"Shut up!"



Ricky's temper threatened to erupt, prompting Amelia to fall silent immediately.


With her mission to unsettle the Flynn family accomplished,Amelia slipped away from the house,quietly pleased with her handiwork.


Stepping outside, she caught sight of Dayna, who wore a bright smile. Dayna had just returned from the hospital. Due to winning the project bid, Jaxton was in a great mood and treated her with exceptional kindness today.


Even Laura had started warming up to her. Dayna almost believed she could take Amelia's place entirely and become Jaxton's wife soon.


So,upon seeing Amelia, she was no longer fearful or cautious. Instead, she rushed forward to accuse her,"You're truly malicious, hurting Jaxton like that."


Dayna's smug expression told Amelia everything she needed to know. She said with a sneer,"Nothing can outshine your deep love for Jaxton, especially when you're willing to steal for him!"


Mention of the word "steal" jolted Dayna, and her eyes betrayed a quick surge of unease.


A moment later, she remembered there were no cameras in Amelia's apartment, and her self-assurance returned. "Steal? I have no idea what you are talking about."


Dayna felt convinced Amelia lacked proof, or she would have confronted her head-on. She believed there was nothing to worry about.


Straightening her posture, she continued, "It's wrong to accuse someone without proof. I could easily take you to court for slander,you know."



Amelia heard Dayna's threat and found it almost laughable



While thoughts of the project's hidden risks swirled in her mind, she locked eyes with Dayna. "I hope you won't come begging me soon."



The Morrison Group's finances might be stronger than the Flynn Group's, but they weren't enough to sustain the Eastside Project.



The ink wouldn't even dry on the contract before the Morrison Group's cash flow dried up, and no bank loan would save them.



Amelia, not wanting to waste another second on Dayna,shot Dayna a look and turned to leave.



Left behind, Dayna mulled over that glance, an uneasy feeling pricking at her heart.



However, the thought of marrying Jaxton quickly drowned out any hint of worry.
###Chapter 70 Call The Police To Arrest Dayna
The next morning, Amelia stepped into her office,barely having the chance to place her bag down before Wyatt summoned her to his office.



She walked into the office, half-expecting a conversation about the resort project. Instead, his words caught her off guard. "You can call the police now."



Blinking in confusion, she asked, "Weren't I supposed to wait for a few days?"



"You don't have to wait anymore," he said.


With a steady hand, Wyatt slid a contract toward her.


She reached for the document and opened it,discovering that it was the contract for the Eastside Project. She found Jaxton's signature and his official seal.



Even before this, Amelia had known Jaxton wasn't the sharpest in business. The Morrison Group stood strong because of Laura and her husband. Still, she hadn't realized he could be this reckless as to sign the contract so soon. It was common practice for companies to spend several days, sometimes longer, deliberating after winning a bid. Only after that would they sign contracts.



Yet Jaxton, in a rash move, had jumped at the chance to sign right after hearing the results of the bid-a risky decision by anyone's standards.


Since Jaxton's impatience had sealed the deal, there was nothing left to hold her back.


With Wyatt watching,Amelia dialed the police without a moment's hesitation.



The police, upon hearing that the Stewart Group was involved, promised to handle the matter immediately.


Once the call ended, Amelia turned to leave, but she paused when she caught an uncertain look on Wyatt's face.



She thought for a moment before asking, "Is there something else on your mind?"


Wyatt picked up a folder full of photographs, handed it to her, then touched his nose and cleared his throat."Go ahead and see for yourself."


Every photo showed Jaxton in the company of a different woman. Flipping through the photos, Amelia said, "You don't need to worry about my history with him. Just do what you need to do. No need to hold back."



Wyatt exhaled quietly, relieved by her calm expression.



He knew how deeply Amelia had once cared for Jaxton. Part of him had feared she might soften toward Jaxton.



***



At the Flynn family's estate.



Dayna had spent the previous day tending to Jaxton at the hospital, leaving her completely worn out.When the police arrived at her home, she was still curled up in bed, sleeping.



A servant woke her, and she trudged downstairs, still wearing her pajamas,irritation written all over her face.



The two officers immediately attempted to take her away. Faced with the stern expressions of the police officers, Dayna quickly shouted, "What right do you have to arrest me?"



One officer explained in a measured tone that Amelia had filed the report, and that the entire matter involved the Stewart Group. Dayna's confidence wavered for a moment, though she kept shouting, "I've done nothing wrong!"


Amelia's phone would not stop ringing the whole morning. Call after call from the Flynn family came in,and she ignored every single one. She could easily guess why they were calling her.


However, she hadn't expected Ricky and Janessa to come directly to the Stewart Group's entrance to confront her.



Their hostile energy was palpable. Seeing that, Amnelia quickly said, "You're standing on Stewart Group property. If you plan to stir up trouble here, you'd better consider whether you can afford to offend the Stewart family."



Janessa, who was about to hit Amelia, clenched her teeth in frustration and withdrew her hand.



Inside a small café across the Stewart Group, the three people took their seats. Amelia asked, "Why did you come here?"


Ricky retorted, "Don't act clueless. You know exactly why we're here. How could you report your own sister to the police? What kind of person turns against their family like that?"


Amelia replied, "Surely you don't believe I would  report Dayna without a valid reason, right?"


"It doesn't matter why you did it. Think about our family's name. If word gets out that the Flynn family's daughter was taken away by police, do you know how we'll be judged? Are you trying to embarrass the whole family?" Looking at the Stewart Group building through the window, Ricky tried hard to suppress his anger.



Seeing Ricky still concerned about the family's reputation at this moment, Amelia found it both ridiculous and pathetic.


She got straight to the point, saying, "Do you have any idea what Dayna stole from my computer?"



Without waiting for Ricky's response, Amelia continued, "She took confidential files of the Eastside Project. That's theft of trade secrets!"


The moment those words landed, Ricky's entire demeanor shifted. Amelia met his eyes with a mocking smile. "Honestly, I thought she'd pass those files to you. Never did I imagine she'd hand everything to the Morrison family instead."



Janessa rushed to defend Dayna, telling Ricky, "Honey,don't listen to her. She's twisting the facts."



Amelía said, "If you don't believe me, go ask Dayna at the police station. She did give the files to the  Morrison family. Otherwise, how did the Morrison Group win the bid so easily?"


"Look at the mess your daughter has caused!" Ricky snapped at Janessa. Rising abruptly, he slapped her,then stormed out of the café.
###Chapter 71 | Have One Condition
From her seat by the window, Amelia observed Ricky slip into the waiting car and give the word to drive off,abandoning Janessa where she sat-hunched and defeated on the pavement.



Janessa's glare followed the tail lights as they vanished, her eyes burning with pure hate.


Her hatred for Ricky's coldness was fierce, but her resentment toward Amelia ran even deeper.


Blaming Amelia for the matter, Janessa seethed-if only that call to the police had never been made by Amelia, none of this would have happened.



A moment later, Amelia strolled out of the cafe,unhurried, only to find Janessa's furious gaze locked on her. "Aren't you afraid that karma will catch up with you?" Janessa snapped.


Janessa's words struck Amelia as utterly ridiculous.She snorted, "If karma's real, you'd be the first to get what's coming to you."


After a pause, she added, her tone cold but even, "Did you already forget, Janessa? When you seduced Ricky  and gave birth to Dayna, you seemed to forget that my mother funded your studies. My mother paid your tuition, and you turned around and betrayed her trust.You used her money, then had an affair with her husband, and you even had a child out of wedlock.Your current problem is just your karma."



Amelia's words left Janessa scowling, her displeasure deepening with every sentence.



Unable to let Amelia have the last word, Janessa raised her voice, calling after her, "What do you know?You mother only gave me money to mock me! She's always acted so superior..."



Amelia did not bother to turn around. She simply kept walking, disappearing down the street.



After years of dealing with the Flynn family, Amelia had learned something crucial. People like them never admitted fault. They always blamed someone else.



After Amelia had left, Janessa immediately regretted her outburst. By provoking Amelia, she realized, Dayna had no hope of leaving the police station any time soon.



Desperation pushed Janessa to pull out her phone,searching for anyone who might be able to help Dayna. Yet, as she scrolled, not a single contact offered the slightest hope.


After thinking for a while,she flagged down a taxi.


***



At the Morrison famnily's residence.


Helping Jaxton ease onto the couch, Laura lingered at his side until a servant quietly appeared to announce a visitor-Janessa had come.



Laura looked down upon both Janessa and Dayna.


Back when Katrina had still been around, Laura had never missed an opportunity to give Janessa trouble.



Laura wanted the servant to turn Janessa away at the door, but Jaxton had already spoken, asking for Janessa to be let inside.



Janessa entered the living room,her desperation clear as she begged, "Jaxton, please help Dayna!"


"What happened to Dayna?" Jaxton asked.


Wasting no time, Janessa relayed what Amelia had said at the cafe, her words tumbling out in a rush.



The mention of Amelia's police report wiped the calm from Laura's and Jaxton's faces.



Worry gnawed at Laura. If Dayna's theft became  public, the Morrison family's cooperation with the Stewart Group could be put in jeopardy. Meanwhile,Jaxton stewed over Amelia's coldness.



Pain pressed against his ribs, but Jaxton still managed to reassure Janessa, saying, "Don't panic. I'll call Amelia right away and ask her to drop the charges."


Laura, her glare sharp and cold, kept quiet. Since Dayna's crime had been committed for her son, she didn't say anything and allowed Jaxton to make the call. Preventing trouble with the Stewart Group took priority in her mind.


Reaching for his phone, Jaxton discovered Amelia had already blocked his number. Left with no choice, he used Laura's phone to call Amelia.



After the call went through, Jaxton practically shouted into the phone, "Amelia, I'm telling you now, drop those charges this instant, or you'll regret it!"


On the other end, Amelia initially intended to hang up but suddenly had a new idea.



"I can withdraw the charges," she said.



Jaxton's entire demeanor shifted when he heard her comply so quickly, a self-satisfied grin spreading across his face. "That's more like it. You'd better-"



"I have one condition, though," Amelia interjected. Not giving Jaxton a moment to reply, she continued,"Here's my offer: end the engagement with me,and Dayna walks free. You care about Dayna, don't you?doubt you'd want her stuck in a cell."



Her words left Jaxton speechless. He had never expected Amelia to make the engagement her bargaining chip.


The idea that Amelia, who was supposed to love him deeply, would offer to break things off with him-it rattled him. What was she trying to achieve?



Laura snatched the phone from Jaxton's hand before he could reply. "Amelia, enough of this nonsense.Marriage isn't a game," she said.


Laura couldn't agree to cancel the engagement,especially given the sixty percent share involved.


Fearing that further conversation would jeopardize her plans, Laura hastily hung up the phone.


Sitting at her desk, Amelia glanced at the silent phone without a flicker of disappointment. She understood the Morrison family far too well to think they would agree to end the engagement so easily.


Still, she knew that even though she couldn't make that happen,Wyatt could.
###Chapter 72 Something's Wrong
Laura's anger at Amelia's choice to end the engagement simmered until it reached its boiling point. Once she hung up the phone, impatience twisted her features as she glared at Janessa. "You never managed to teach your daughter how to behave,and now, you show up in my house just to make a scene. Get out of here!"



Since Janessa already knew Dayna had stolen the files for Jaxton, Laura's venomous words stung like salt in a wound."If your son hadn't dragged her into this, do you think my daughter would have stolen anything?Amelia has already gone to the authorities,so how can you stand by and do nothing to help my daughter?"


"Did I ever tell your daughter to do that? Who knew she'd throw all sense out the window just for the sake of love? The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. You seduced Ricky behind Katrina's back before, and now,your daughter is trying to seduce my son. How shameless-"



Suddenly, Laura's tirade came to an abrupt stop.Janessa's palm landed hard against her cheek. Not stopping at the slap, Janessa yanked Laura by the hair. "What right do you have to judge me? Did you forget how desperate you were to win Katrina's approval before? Back then, you played the caring friend to Katrina,treating Amelia well, but now, you've stopped putting on a show."


Nothing in Janessa's life had been easy recently.Ricky's blows, Lainey's cruel taunts-she had endured enough. Laura's insult tipped her past her limit.



She let every ounce of her anger erupt. The room turned into a battleground, the women tumbling from sofa to floor, fists and hair flying



Laura's pampered life had not prepared her for this.She found herself losing ground, yelling at the house staff, "Don't just stand there! Get over here and help me!"



Startled by the spectacle, the staff stood frozen.Laura's shrill order finally jolted them into movement,but just as they stepped forward, a booming voice brought everything to a halt.



Santos Morrison, Laura's husband, arrived home. He had rushed back the moment he heard that the Morrison Group got the Eastside Project.



Stunned by the scene in front of him, Santos barked,"Will someone explain what's happening in here?" That booming voice caused Laura to freeze, and Janessa wasted no time in landing two more swift kicks to Laura.



Even though Santos's presence was enough to intimidate her,Janessa held her ground. "If you refuse to help my daughter, I'll make sure every reporter in town hears about this. Let's see if the Stewart Group will still want to work with you when the story breaks."


"Tell whoever you want. The Stewart Group has already signed the deal. They won't back out over gossip. But your daughter-let's see how she'll show her face in public when the news spreads," Laura said.


Janessa's breathing turned ragged at Laura's words.She turned to Jaxton. "After everything Dayna has done for you, is this how you repay her? Are you just going to stand by and do nothing?"



Jaxton wished the ground would swallow him up after seeing Santos. He pretended he hadn't heard what Janessa had said, remaining silent.



Jaxton's silence crushed whatever hope Janessa had left. She had been blind to his true nature before, and now, she wished she had never pushed Dayna towards him.



After the servants finally escorted Janessa out, Santos turned to Jaxton. "Explain to me what's going on. And tell me the truth about the Eastside Project."



Fear flickered across Jaxton's face, and Laura started to speak up for him. But Santos quickly silenced her with a single, unyielding glare. "Let him speak for himself."


A heavy silence hung in the air as Jaxton stared at the floor. That only stoked Santos' anger. "Look at me.Why are you always so afraid of looking me in the eye?"


With a shaky breath, Jaxton finally looked up and recounted everything that had happened in a low voice.


As soon as Santos realized Dayna had stolen documents to secure the bid and that Jaxton had signed the contract without consulting anyone at the company,he slapped Jaxton.


Seeing that, Laura jumped in front of Jaxton to protect him, her voice sharp as she said to Santos,"Have you lost your mind? Why did you hit him?"


Santos' scowl deepened when Laura instinctively shielded Jaxton. "This is exactly what happens when a mother spoils her son too much. Just look at the man he's become because of you."


"How is that my fault? You've spent your life thinking about another woman. If I hadn't stood by him, Jaxton would've grown up without any support at home." Turning his gaze toward her, Santos narrowed his eyes."Why would you say something like that while our son is right here?"



"I am just telling the truth! Haven't you always been thinking of Katrina? Even after her death, you still-"



"Mr. Morrison, something's wrong!"


Clayton dashed inside, drenched in sweat and clearly anxious.


Laura felt her heart sink as she met Clayton's anxious gaze."What happened?"



Clayton took a shaky breath and replied, "The company's money isn't enough. We're running out of funds."



"That's impossible. There's always been plenty in the accounts."



Lowering his voice, Clayton explained, "It's true. But the moment the Eastside Project kicked off, massive shipments of materials arrived all at once. In just ten hours, every last cent on the company's accounts was spent."


Laura's features tightened as she realized the Eastside Project was the cause of yet another disaster. Santos said, "Why didn't you apply for a loan from the bank?"





"We already tried. But the bank refused us."
###Chapter 73 The Crisis Of The Morrison Family
Santos said, "How can this be happening? Forget about the other banks for a second. Pinnacle Bank and our company have a long-standing relationship.Calvin Morley, the president of the bank, has always been on friendly terms with us. He-"



"Mrs. Morrison, Pinnacle Bank was the very first bank | applied for a loan, but they turned us down right away," Clayton said.


As soon as Laura heard that, she got worried. She hurriedly asked, "Didn't you make it clear to them that this project is in partnership with the Stewart Group?"



"| brought that up, but Pinnacle Bank still wouldn't budge."



After a pause, Clayton added, "Pinnacle Bank wasn't the only one. Every major bank refused our loan application."


Although Laura's nerves were on edge, she tried to keep her voice steady as she turned to Santos. "You know Calvin well. Why don't you call him and ask him what's going on?" Without wasting a second, Santos pulled out his phone and tried reaching Calvin. The call rang and rang,but nobody answered.


The only sound filling the living room was the phone's automated disconnect tone. After a few minutes,Santos gave it another try, but there was still no reply.


Something felt off. This sort of silence was a first,and Santos' face darkened.



Laura, determined not to give up, said, "Maybe he just missed your call, or he's caught up with something.Try ringing his office number."


This time, someone picked up the landline, but it wasn't Calvin; it was his assistant.


Santos was told by the assistant that Calvin was away on business.



Santos' brow furrowed when he heard that. He often used the same excuse to avoid meeting clients he didn't want to see.



After a moment of silence, Santos quietly asked, "Can you tell me when Mr. Morley will be back in Kretol?"


After glancing at Calvin, the assistant responded in a polite tone, "Mr. Morrison, I'm afraid I can't give you a specific time. Rest assured, the moment he returns,  I'll make sure that he gets your message and calls you back immediately."



If Santos could see inside Calvin's office right now,he would find Calvin lounging on the sofa.


The assistant, puzzled, ended the call and turned to Calvin. "The Morrison Group has always been a steady client. Why don't you want to approve their loan this time?"



"I wish I could help, especially since I know Santos,"said Calvin. "But they managed to anger the wrong person. Lending to them isn't an option. Not just for me. There isn't a single bank in Kretol willing to do that now."



The assistant's surprise flickered across his face,but he kept silent, aware that it wasn't his place to pry.


Once the call disconnected, Laura wasted no time.Her eyes sought out Santos. "So,what did Calvin say?"



A heavy tone carried Santos' reply as he relayed the assistant's message. Laura's face turned dark. She knew the business trip was merely an excuse.



Shifting his attention, Santos fixed his gaze on Jaxton,who sat silent. An exasperated sigh escaped him. "A project of this size, and you just put your name on it without a second thought? Have you considered what happens if the company takes a hit because of this? Do you think you can take responsibility?"


Although Jaxton bristled with the urge to protest,he caught sight of Santos' stern glare. Words died on his lips. He dug his nails into his palms, frustration swirling in his eyes.


Laura shook herself from her daze after Santos 'outburst. She instantly said, "Every Stewart Group project has run smoothly. There was no way for Jaxton to predict anything would go wrong this time."



Laura's defense of Jaxton only made Santos' mood worse. "You are still defending him? Jaxton might not have been able to see the problem with the project,but you should have!"



Tempers threatened to boil over. Clayton, his nerves stretched thin, quickly spoke up. "Mrs. Morrison,there's actually no flaw with this project. The real problem is funding. Our funding just can't keep up with something of this scale. That's the only reason we're in trouble."



Before Jaxton had signed the contract, Clayton had urged him to think carefully about the matter, but Jaxton had refused to listen to him.



Clayton continued, "Mr. Morrison, we're running out of time. If you can't get money into our accounts soon,the company's stock prices will take a hit." No one understood the gravity of such a financial crisis better than Santos, yet right now, he didn't knOw how to fix this. While he struggled to think, Laura broke the silence. "I can get us the money."


Heads turned in unison as every person in the room fixed their attention on her.



Knowing what Laura was thinking, Santos scoffed,"You expect Ricky to help us now?"



"There's every reason he should. Amelia is engaged to Jaxton, and our families are tied together. What's more, Dayna is at fault for all of this. So, Ricky should step up to help us."



Her words only made Santos more agitated. "Don't pin the blame on someone else. Jaxton signed that contract of his own accord."



"If Dayna hadn't stolen those files,Jaxton never would have won the bid. Without that win, he wouldn't have rushed to sign the contract. Dayna is the cause of this disaster. She always brings trouble," Laura said.


Seeing Laura still unwilling to blame Jaxton for this left Santos fuming. "You're impossible!"


With that, Santos left the house with cold eyes, and Clayton hurriedly followed.
###Chapter 74 Birthday Gifts



At the Stewart Group.


After receiving a call from Calvin, Davin went to Wyatt's office. "I've already contacted those banks as per your instructions. Unless you give the green light,the Morrison Group won't get a loan offer anywhere in Kretol."



He spent several minutes outlining the situation, but Wyatt just sat there in silence. Davin was just about to ask Wyatt when Wyatt broke his silence with a question. "What do you think women like for birthday presents?"



That caught Davin completely off guard.


Weren't they discussing the Morrison Group now? How did the topic suddenly shift to birthday gifts?



It wasn't until Davin glanced at Wyatt's computer screen that he noticed the date circled deliberately.



May 5th-Amelia's birthday.



The realization hit Davin square in the chest, and he awkwardly cleared his throat. "I'm probably not the right guy for that question." After all, he had been single for over twenty years.


Still, wanting to be helpful, he suggested,"If you want real advice, Dr. Chapman's your guy. He has dated many women before. Ask him how to win over a woman-he'll know."



Wyatt shot Davin a look of pure annoyance. "What use are you to me?" he muttered. But as soon as Davin left his office,he wasted no time calling Marc.


Marc,having just finished a tough surgery, still wearing his white coat, blinked in disbelief when he heard Wyatt's words on the phone.



Wyatt,of all people,was calling to talk about birthday gifts for women? This was so unexpected.


But remembering Wyatt's care for Amelia, Marc understood everything. While changing clothes, he said in a teasing tone, "Well, you couldn't have come to a better expert. Let me-"


Wyatt cut him off without missing a beat, saying,"If you keep rambling about useless things, don't expect a single penny of investment from me in the future.Just answer my question."


Marc,ready to boast, was cut short by Wyatt's words and quickly retorted, "You're no fun, always waving threats in my face-" Any further complaints died as the call ended with a click-Wyatt had already hung up.


Worried that Wyatt might actually stop his funding,Marc wasted no time. He quickly dialed Wyatt back,blurting out his advice the moment the line connected,"Jewelry, exclusive handbags,flowers-women always like those things."



Wyatt ended the call as soon as Marc finished speaking, the busy tone humming in Marc's ear. Marc sighed in resignation.



***



After a long day of chasing down leads, Santos finally pieced together a few promising clues.



His mind kept circling back to the name "Stewart" he had heard, a realization dawning with increasing gravity.


In all of Kretol, only a single family wielded the kind of influence attached to the Stewart name.


Laura couldn't fall asleep at all, and the moment she heard Santos' key in the lock, she pushed herself upright and got out of bed, hope flickering in her eyes.


She was about to ask Santos what he had discovered when he said in a serious tone, "Has Jaxton done anything lately to cross Wyatt?"


Santos had already investigated. The Eastside Project was personally proposed by Wyatt.


It was Jaxton who'd landed that contract,which now seemed less like a win and more like a trap set by Wyatt.



Knowing it might be a trap didn't make it any easier Challenging Wyatt head-on was unthinkable for the Morrisons. For now, Santos could only try to figure out Wyatt's motive for doing this.



Laura, even with her usual objections to Santos' stern approach with Jaxton, knew that this matter was serious. She racked her brain, replaying recent events,but nothing stood out-she couldn't remember Jaxton crossing Wyatt.



Just then, a sudden realization hit her-Amelia's name flashed through her mind.



She briefly recounted Amelia's recent changes to Santos and said coldly, "Do you think this might be Amelia's doing?"



"Not a chance. Amelia would never do something like this!" Santos' answer came without hesitation, his tone firm.



Hearing how firmly Santos defended Amelia, Laura couldn't help but let sarcasm slip into her words. "You trust her so much. I wonder if it's because you like Katrina or-"


A flash of frustration crossed Santos' face. "Laura,enough. Don't forget, if Katrina hadn't stepped in to help you back then, you wouldn't have what you have today."



His words brought a strange flicker of emotion to Laura's eyes, silencing her for the moment.


Santos continued, "Wyatt proposed this project himself. Do you really think a secretary like Amelia could pull strings at that level? Besides, i was Dayna who had stolen the files and handed them over to our son."



Laura dropped the subject of Amelia, turning her simmering frustration toward Dayna instead.


Once she'd gotten it out of her system,she brushed off Santos' objections and dialed Ricky's number.


Ricky had always assumed Amelia kept him from bidding just to let the Morrisons snag the deal. Only after Laura's urgent call did it finally dawn on him that there was something wrong with the project.


Laura's frantic tone actually brought him some relief -he was grateful now that he hadn't participated in the bidding at all. Still,he refused to lend money to Laura. He soon hung up the call. Janessa, awakened by the noise, had listened in with growing satisfaction as the Morrison family's misfortune became clear to her.



Yet, her thoughts lingered on Dayna,who remained locked up at the police station. She curled into Ricky's arms, her voice gentle and coaxing. "Don't get upset,dear. If Dayna had handed those files to us instead,wouldn't we be the ones in trouble now? Once she's out, I'll make sure she learns her lesson.You've always been good to her-please, help get her released."



Nearly fifty, Janessa looked a decade younger, her careful self-care lending her an almost ageless allure.



With practiced charm, she drew Ricky close,and after their intimate moment, his mood improved. Soon enough, he promised to do whatever he could to get Dayna released.



The only way to get Dayna out was for Amelia to withdraw the charges, so Ricky called her early the next morning.



Amelia was on her way to the office when her phone lit up with Ricky's name. She considered hanging up,but as soon as he brought up Laura's plea for a loan,her curiosity made her hesitate.


After learning that Jaxton had signed the contract,  she'd already suspected the Morrison Group was headed for disaster. She just hadn't expected their trouble to come so quickly.



Worried Ricky might end up dragged into the mess,Amelia warned, "Let me put it plainly-if you lend them anything now, you won't get it back."


For once, Ricky didn't argue, which felt odd to Amelia.



But Ricky's real motive came out soon: he wanted her to withdraw the case against Dayna. Amelia's answer was swift and sharp. "Absolutely not! Dayna knew exactly what she was doing. Theft is a crime. She's not a child anymore, and she needs to face the consequences of her actions-just like you always told me."



Years ago, when Dayna had schemed against her and made her shatter Ricky's prized bottle of wine, the punishment had been swift: an entire night kneeling.Ricky had told her to face the consequences of her actions.



A pause hung between them, then Ricky tried again,his voice softer. "She's still your sister, Amelia. You used to care-"



"I was blind before!" Amelia retorted,cutting Ricky off without a second thought.


She stopped at a red light, her thoughts drifting to old memories she couldn't quite shake.
###Chapter 75 Getting Shares From Ricky
Back then, no matter how much Katrina disliked Dayna,she would never make things difficult for her since she was a child.



Because of that, when Dayna began to hover around Amelia on purpose, Katrina simply instructed someone to keep a watchful eye, choosing not to interfere directly.



With her trusting heart, Amelia welcomed Dayna's company without suspicion. Excitement bubbled over the moment she discovered they were sisters.


That naive joy vanished when Amelia barely avoided being struck by aspeeding truck. Only then did she glimpse the darkness lurking beneath Dayna's charm.


The image of that truck barreling straight at her remained seared in Amelia's mind. She could never forget the twisted satisfaction on Dayna's face after she shoved her into harm's way.


Only Katrina's careful planning had saved Amelia's life.A bodyguard positioned nearby, thanks to Katrina's intuition, had intervened just in time. After the incident, Amelia hurried to tell Ricky what had happened, but he brushed off her fears and accused her of making up stories until Katrina produced undeniable surveillance footage.


That was why Katrina had sent Dayna abroad.


"Letting Dayna get locked up will only disgrace the Flynn name. The company's standing will crumble,and you wouldn't want your mother's effort to be ruined,would you?" Ricky said.


No one understood her father's selfish motives better than Amelia. She also knew he grasped exactly what she cared about the most.



While Amelia felt nothing for the Flynn Group itself,she cared about Katrina. As she started the car, she changed her mind. "I'll drop the charges, but only on one condition."



"And what might that be?"



After Amelia found a parking spot to park the car and made her way into the company building, she saw that the elevator doors were closing. She darted forward,phone pressed to her ear.



Inside the elevator, Davin and Wyatt spotted Amelia.Davin's quick thinking had him reaching for the open button before the doors could shut completely. Catching sight of Amelia still speaking on the phone,Davin offered a friendly smile and moved aside,letting her in.



After greeting Davin and Wyatt, Amelia returned to her call. "If you're ready to transfer all your ten percent shnares to me, then I'll drop the charges."


The revelation piqued Wyatt's curiosity. Although he usually didn't eavesdrop, he found himself glancing over at Amelia, surprised by what he'd overheard.


On the other end of the line, Ricky's anger spilled out in a stream of curses.



Without a hint of worry, Amelia simply held thedevice away from her ear, letting him shout until he ran out of steam. She brought it back to her ear and replied with steady resolve, "That's my deal. Accept it, and I'll Let the lawsuit go. Refuse, and Dayna faces prison.Take your time-think it over."



Their negotiation dragged on, and eventually, Ricky's patience wore thin. In the end, both settled for five percent of the shares for Amelia to drop the lawsuit.



The realization that she had acquired five percent of the company for nothing thrilled Amelia. She would gain control of the Flynn Group sooner or later.



As the elevator doors parted, Wyatt gestured, and Amelia followed him into his office.



Curiosity got the better of him, and Wyatt asked about her call. Amelia summed up her talk with Ricky,adding that Ricky would be arriving around noon to sign the share transfer.


There was something she had forgotten, though.With Dayna having stolen the files from the Stewart Group,she should have consulted Wyatt beforehand.


"If I pull the lawsuit now, does it put your company at risk?" she asked.



After Wyatt reassured her that the company would remain unaffected,she felt relieved.


Wyatt, knowing she would be handling legal paperwork at noon, offered to connect her with a lawyer. Although she had planned to approach Dalia,she accepted Wyatt's offer without hesitation.



Right after Amelia agreed, Wyatt's gaze grew intent as he asked, "Amelia, do you still remember our deal?"



Right then, her mind flashed to his mention of the one -month timeline.



While adding up the days in her head, she realized that the end of the one-month period coincided with the fifth day of May-her birthday."Amelia, I'd like us to register our marriage on your birthday. Would that be alright?" Wyatt said.


Amelia's heart hammered in her chest. She meant to protest that things were moving too fast, but all she managed to say was, "Jaxton still hasn't agreed to end the engagement yet."


Wyatt's face changed instantly at the mention of that name. His expression turned cold. "Give it three days,and he'll be begging for you to break off the engagement."
###Chapter 76 Share Transfer



Wyatt's words made delight rush through Amelia. This had unfolded with surprising speed.



Realizing she could finally end things with Jaxton in a matter of days brought a deep wave of satisfaction.



Thinking about the noon appointment for the stock transfer, along with the freedom that would soon arrive, Amelia carried a joyful energy as she strolled back to her office.



After Sally had left, Matias had moved to her desk. He noticed the smile on Amelia's face. Curious, he teased,"Amelia,why are you so happy today? Did you win the lottery or something?"



Landing five percent of the shares felt like she had won the lottery, and Amelia couldn't help but nod.



Matias believed her and wasted no time in asking her to buy him coffee.



Amelia found herself getting along with the Administrative Services Department's crew lately. She tossed Matias a playful jab about his coffee habits and then pulled out her phone to make a delivery order. She didn't just stop at Matias; she went ahead and ordered coffee for the three others in the department,too.



As the group waited for their drinks, Amelia told them all about the new resort project in Prevda.


Wyatt had handed this project over to her, wanting the Administrative Services Department to back her up however she needed.



With every new task, the team's respect for Amelia deepened. Matias, especially, had come to trust her lead without question.



The morning passed quickly.


By noon,Wyatt sent word for Amelia to come to his office.



When she arrived, she spotted a man on the sofa who seemed somewhat familiar.



Wyatt noticed her lingering look and explained, "This is Lucian Ford. He's the company's legal advisor. He'll be with you at the Flynn Group meeting today to finalize the share transfer agreement."


Lucian knew Wyatt well, and it didn't take him long to pick up on Wyatt's special regard for Amelia. Lucian greeted Amelia with an easy smile and offered a handshake. She quickly got to her feet and shook his hand.



Suddenly, it clicked for Amelia-she had seen Lucian from the legal talk shows on Kretol TV before. His reputation as a top lawyer preceded him.


She couldn't help but feel a little stunned. Was such a high-profile attorney really needed for something so minor?



The lunch break was only two hours, and Amnelia exchanged a few polite words with Lucian before they made their wvay out, only to find Wyatt stepping into the elevator with them.



A flicker of confusion crossed Amelia's face as she looked Wyatt's way.



"I am meeting a client at noon and will pass by the Morrison Group, so I can drop you off there," Wyatt said.



Nearby, Lucian couldn't hide his surprise, one eyebrow arching at Wyatt's words.



If memory served him right, he knew Davin had mentioned earlier that a client was supposed to come to the Stewart Group to meet Wyatt. Lucian had his own car, so he didn't ride with Amelia and Wyatt. After Amelia got into Wyatt's vehicle, the driver started the engine.


Soon enough, the car rolled to a stop outside the Flynn Group. The driver wasted no time, stepping out to open the door for Amelia.


With a bright wave and smile for Wyatt, she then joined Lucian, heading toward the building's entrance.


The incident before meant that everyone at the Flynn Group now recognized Amelia. The new receptionist greeted Amelia with a friendly smile. "Miss Flynn,are you here to see Mr. Flynn today?"


Amelia answered with an easy warmth, "I arranged a meeting with him. You can call him to confirm that."


"That won't be necessary. Mr. Flynn already let me know, so you may go to his office now."



The receptionist pressed the elevator button for her,and after Amelia offered her thanks, she and Lucian stepped inside the elevator.


Inside his office, Ricky had spent all morning pacing,impatience growing as he awaited Amelia's arrival.


When she finally entered, he moved as if to scold her.But his words died on his lips when he caught sight of  Lucian by her side.


An initial wave of caution came over Amelia until she saw that Ricky's attention was fixed on Lucian.


"Mr.Ford, what brings you here today? Has something come up?" Ricky asked.


Anyone running a business in Kretol understood the value of having a top lawyer in their corner to steer clear of trouble.



Since Lucian was on the roster of advisors for many of the city's most powerful companies, Ricky seized the chance to forge a connection.



Ricky, not realizing Lucian and Amelia had arrived together, assumed it was just a coincidence that they were both here at the same time. That changed when Lucian said, "I'm here today to go over the share transfer agreement for Miss Flynn."


That answer startled Ricky. His eyes brightened, and he edged closer. "You know my daughter, Mr. Ford?You two..."
###Chapter 77 It's Your Cousin



Catching that glint in Ricky's eyes, Amelia instantly understood what was running through his mind. He never missed a chance to network with powerful people.


"Are you going to get this share agreement signed or what? My shift starts soon, and I don't have all day to hang around here with you," she said to Ricky.


Ricky had already prepared the contract and was tempted to toss it Amelia's way. However, in the presence of Lucian, he restrained his anger and handed it to her.



Amelia's thoughts went straight to the shares,blocking out everything else. Taking the contract, she turned to Lucian. "Would you mind reviewing this for me,Mr.Ford?"



While she could have managed a review herself,putting faith in a professional felt like the wiser route.Lucian, after all, had more experience.


Lucian read through the pages with painstaking care,turning each one methodically. When he finished,he returned the contract to Amelia and offered a nod."Everything checks out. You cansign it." Trusting Lucian's judgment didn't keep Amelia from feeling a twinge of doubt. Could Ricky really be letting go of the shares this easily?



Ricky's sour mood went unnoticed by her as she scribbled her name.



Ricky had actually prepared two different contracts-one as a trap if Amelia didn't catch the tricks, the other one without any issues.



Never in his wildest dreams had he expected Amelia to show up with a legal powerhouse like Lucian. So, he had had no choice but to hand her the one without issues.


Amelia tucked the signed contract away with a triumphant look,leaving Ricky simmering in frustration.


Before she could head for the door, Ricky called out,"Now that the share transfer is finished, drop the lawsuit immediately!"


Winning the contract left Amelia in high spirits. Still,she couldn't help but say in a mocking tone, "Your care for Dayna is impressive. Rest easy-she'll walk free before sunset."



For a moment,Amelia thought about calling Dalia to share the news, but she soon reconsidered, knowing all too well what Ricky was like. As Amelia and Lucian stepped out of the Morrison Group, a familiar vehicle rolled up and stopped before them.



"I thought you had a client to meet. What are you still doing here?" Amelia said when she saw Wyatt in the car.



Wyatt caught the joy in her eyes and replied with warmth, "It wrapped up sooner than expected."



The driver couldn't help but feel resigned at that,knowing the car hadn't even left the Flynn Group.Wyatt had only instructed him to drive over when he saw Amelia.


Amelia marveled at Wyatt's undeniable business savvy.Once in the car, she beamed at him and said, "I've signed the contract. Let's celebrate over lunch. It's on me!"



As soon as the words left her lips, she remembered Lucian was still here. She glanced out the window and asked, "Do you have time for lunch, Mr.Ford?" got other plans."


Lucian barely had time to speak before Wyatt cut him off with a quick response. A puzzled look crossed Lucian's face. He didn't have anything planned.



But then, catching the hint in Wyatt's sharp gaze,Lucian quickly said, "That's right. I do have something urgent to handle."


"I'll treat you to a meal another time, Mr. Ford,"Amelia said.



The moment she finished speaking, Wyatt rolled up the window and signaled for the driver to get moving.



"This all feels too easy. I didn't expect my father to hand over the shares so quickly..."



With the city rolling by outside, Amelia launched into her thoughts about the morning's events. Her voice,lively and bright, filled the car as Wyatt listened, his gaze gentle on her.


He was about to reply, but a sharp screech of tires shattered the moment.



Jolted by the sudden stop, Amelia was thrown forward in her seat.



She braced for pain but instead landed safely in a warm embrace.


Wyatt held her close and checked her over at once, his voice edged with worry. "Did you get hurt anywhere?"



He scanned her for scrapes or bruises and, seeing she was unharmed, turned to assess the situation.



Ahead, a black sports car sat crushed against the barrier nearby, its nose smashed like a kicked can.



Just before the impact, Amelia had caught a glimpse of the car swerving toward them with intent.


Had the driver not reacted as fast as he did, Wyatt's car would have crashed headfirst into the barrier.



"Mr. Stewart, let me take a look," the driver said,already reaching for the door handle.



That plan was cut short. The black car's engine suddenly roared back to life. It jerked into reverse,then shot forward, slamming toward their vehicle a second timne.



With barely any time to react, the driver froze as the oncoming car barreled toward them.



Again, Wyatt wrapped Amelia tightly in his arms,shielding her from the jolt.



Thanks to top-tier modifications, the car held up-only the front end was bent slightly, while everything else stayed intact. By contrast, smoke began to pour from the black sports car.



Amid the haze, a figure pushed open the battered door and strode toward them.



Recognition dawned on the driver's face as he said,"Mr. Stewart, it's your cousin!"
###Chapter 78 Learning More About The Stewart Family
Hearing the word "cousin" left Amelia momentarily stunned. She straightened from Wyatt's arms, eyes instinctively tracking the figure coming their way.


Striding over, Jaycob Stewart cut an imposing figure in his jet-black leather jacket, radiating danger.


His steps aimed directly for the rear passenger door.The driver scrambled out,attempting to block his path,but before he could do that,Jaycob's sudden, piercing scream echoed.



Amelia caught sight of him crumpled on the ground,pain twisting his features.



She remembered how she had once slammed a car door on Jaxton-she hadn't even hit him with all her might, yet he had broken three ribs.


Wyatt's force just now was far greater than hers had been.



"Stay in the car," Wyatt said to Amelia, voice gentle as he got out of the car.

 
Jaycob was still on the floor, sweat soaking his brow.  Still, he tried to haul himself upright when he spotted Wyatt leaving the vehicle.


Wyatt didn't let him recover. A swift kick caught Jaycob in the stomach, hurling him across the pavement. Blood spilled from his lips.


Witnessing the brutal scene, Amelia got out of the car and rushed over. She grabbed Wyatt's hand and said,"Don't do anything you'll regret!"


Wyatt's face was expressionless, but his eyes burned with killing intent.


Seeing that, Jaycob hesitated for a moment. He had provoked Wyatt many times before, but this was the first time Wyatt had reacted so strongly.


Could it be because this woman had been in the car earlier? That made things interesting.



When Amelia pulled him back,Wyatt stopped himself from going any further. He turned to the driver and ordered, "Call the police."



Jaycob,nearly losing consciousness from the pain,heard Wyatt's words and let out a sneer. "How dare you call the cops? You're the real murderer!"


Wyatt answered not with words, but with a slow,crushing step onto Jaycob's chest. Blood sprayed from Jaycob's mouth, darkening his collar in seconds.



Looking at Jaycob without a shred of pity,Wyatt spoke as if dismissing a nuisance. "People like you only know how to do dirty tricks."


Police sirens howled closer, prompting Amelia to move forward and pull gently at Wyatt's sleeve.Without hesitation, he removed his foot.



Davin arrived with the police and stayed behind to handle the matter, while Wyatt took Amelia to another car.



After about ten minutes, the car stopped in front of Harvest Moon Restaurant.



Sitting down in the private room, Wyatt seemed to have slipped right back into his usual, unreadable calm.


Amelia's gaze lingered on him, curiosity dancing in her eyes. In a steady voice, Wyatt broke the silence. "My uncle's hand was behind the brake failure on my car two years ago. After you rescued me, I retaliated in the same way against him. Only, his fate turned out far worse. He has been lying in a hospital bed ever since, and there's little hope he'll ever recover."


Wyatt's uncle, Hamlin Stewart, was spared from death,but he had become a complete vegetable and was  unlikely to ever awaken.


Jaycob knew full well the wrongs his father had done to Wyatt, but blame and bitterness still ran deep.Wyatt's life went on, while Hamlin was trapped in a hospital bed, which made Jaycob resent Wyatt


Although Wyatt spoke as if relaying nothing more than the weather,Amelia felt for him.



She set her fork down and said, "Haven't your father or grandfather ever stepped in?"



A chill slipped into Wyatt's expression at the mention of his father.



Through Wyatt's account, Amelia learned of the sordid details within the Stewart family.



Jewell Stewart, Wyatt's father, chased pleasure and luxury on the Stewart fortune, shunning any burden of responsibility. Forced to wed Della and father Wyatt,Jewell soon drifted away,building another family with a different woman, Kamila Wallace.



So,Wyatt grew up knowing he had two half-siblings -children Jewell shared with Kamila.



"So why does everyone in Kretol think you're the only child?" Amelia asked.


Had Wyatt not trusted her with these secrets, she  never would have guessed Jewell had two illegitimate children.



Wyatt noticed her confusion, and a shadow flickered across his expression. "My grandfather forbade them from carrying the Stewart name. That's why."


Those two had their mother's last name-Rory Wallace and Pattie Wallace.


For a moment, Amelia almost praised Wyatt's grandfather for showing some sense. But Wyatt continued, "Even though they're not allowed to have the Stewart surname, my grandfather didn't refuse them to become part of the family."
###Chapter 79 | Don't Want To See You Anymore
At the Morrison family's estate.


Anxiety gnawed at Laura as she sat restlessly on the couch. For days, Santos had thrown himself into desperate attempts to untangle the crisis looming over the Morrison Group, but each effort had fallen flat.



The Morrison Group had a complete funding chain breakdown.



Staring out at the evening sky as it darkened,Laura reached for her phone, wanting to call Santos. The sound of rapid footsteps halted her movement.


Drawing closer to the entryway, Laura discovered that Dayna had arrived.


Earlier that day, Janessa had picked Dayna up from the police station.Back at the Flynn house, Ricky had punished her severely, leaving red handprints on her face.



Instructions from Janessa had been sharp and final-Dayna was to end things with Jaxton. Janessa made it clear that Jaxton could not be trusted, and she didn't  hide what she'd learned about both Jaxton and the Morrisons after Dayna's recent troubles.


Believing Janessa but unable to accept the truth,Dayna found herself drawn to the Morrison family estate.



Hope had burned bright for Dayna when the police took her in. She'd longed to see Jaxton come for her.However,he had never showed.


Longing for answers, Dayna had walked straight into the Morrison home, determined to see Jaxton and ask if Janessa's words were true. But before she managed a word, Laura's palm whipped across her face.


The slap sent Dayna crashing to the floor.


"What gives you the nerve to show up here?"


Hatred blazed in Laura's eyes, as though she'd tear Dayna apart right then. Even as her cheek stung,Dayna pressed a hand to her face and said, voice trembling, "Please, I need to talk to Jaxton. I have something important to ask him."



"Shut your mouth! You've made Jaxton's life miserable enough, and now, you want to cause him more pain? Haven't you done enough damage?"


"But Laura, I would never hurt Jaxton. I care about him deeply-" "Have you no shame?" Before Dayna could finish,Laura interrupted with a scornful taunt. "Jaxton is your sister's fiancé, and yet you constantly try to seduce him. You're just like your mother, chasing after men who aren't yours!"


Tears spilled down Dayna's cheeks, Laura's words cutting deeper than any slap.


All the noise downstairs drew Jaxton from his room.His face was dark as he came downstairs.



Dayna spotted him, and hope flickered in her eyes.She rushed over, hand outstretched for his.



But he shoved her aside before she could reach him.She toppled to the floor, stunned, her gaze locked on Jaxton, searching for any sign of warmth.



"You have no idea what you've done to my family.Dayna, you're nothing but trouble," Jaxton said.


Shock drained all color from Dayna's face.



Panic pushed her to her feet, and she edged closer to Jaxton, though she didn't dare try to touch him again."Jaxton, why are you saying these things? I don't understand."



"You went behind everyone's back and stole files from Amelia's computer. Because of that, I ended up stuck with that project. My family's finances are in ruins now,and it's all your fault, Dayna!" Frustration flashed in Jaxton's eyes as he looked at her.


Tears slipped down Dayna's face as she stared at him,her body shaking.


He hadn't been like this when she had handed him the files that day.


"Get out of here. I don't want to see you anymore,"Jaxton said.



As he made for the stairs, Dayna rushed to block him,desperation plain in her voice."Jaxton, that's not true!Amelia set this up. She left the files on the computer on purpose. She deliberately went to the Stewart Group to-"



"What nonsense are you spouting?"


A stern voice suddenly came from the doorway, and the three in the living room instinctively looked towards it.



Santos shot Dayna a cold glare. He did not bother to mask the contempt flickering in his eyes. "You made a mistake. Instead of owning up to it, you want to blame someone else. Dayna, is this really what your parents taught you?"


Once Santos stepped inside, Laura wasted no time. She ordered the servants to throw Dayna out.


After Dayna was gone, Santos turned to Jaxton, his gaze filled with disappointment. "So, you really hurt Amelia over and over for a woman like that? Jaxton,you've truly let me down!"


Laura winced at how cutting Santos' words sounded,but after weighing the damage Jaxton had caused,she met Santos' gaze, holding back her frustration."Pointing fingers won't fix anything now. Did you come up with a solution?"



"We only have one solution. Talk to the Stewart Group and ask<them to call off the partnership."


"But if we pull out now, won't we lose all the capital we invested?" Laura could not hold back the disapproval in her eyes. That sum represented all the Morrison Group had in available funds.


Santos knew he would not choose this path unless he had to. Yet, if the deal stayed in place, the Morrison Group would face certain ruin.


"Ending things now gives the company a fighting chance. If we hesitate, the Morrison Group will go bankrupt soon," he said.


As for breaching the contract directly, Santos didn't dare to even consider it. 
In all of Kretol, no one dared to breach a contract with the Stewart Group.
###Chapter 80 I Want Jaxton To Break Off His...
The resort project in Prevda was now under Amelia's leadership, and she threw herself into the challenge with single-minded resolve. So, early in the morning,she arrived at the Stewart Group with enthusiasm.


Just as she reached the lobby, an unwelcome and unmistakable vvoice drifted to her ears.



Drawing closer to the marble counter, Amelia spotted Jaxton alongside Santos.



Their visit had one purpose: to persuade Wyatt to end their partnership. The receptionist, however, stopped them from going to Wyatt's office because neither man had made an appointment in advance.


Jaxton wasted no time launching into complaints,his words bouncing off the receptionist's practiced calm.Meanwhile,SantosspottedAmeliaandsmiled."Amelia?"


If Amelia felt any gratitude towards the Morrison family,it was solely because of Santos.


He had always treated her well.


With her name spoken in such a friendly tone, Amelia  walked over and said in a gentle voice, "Santos."


Amelia's eyes didn't so much as flicker in Jaxton's direction. She was ignoring him completely.


Anticipating a greeting that never came, Jaxton grew angry. He blurted out his demand, "Amelia, since you're Wyatt's secretary, you can bring us to him,right?"


Before Amelia could respond, Santos reprimanded him,"Shut up!"


"But Dad, she's the secretary. She could help us get in   _"



Before Jaxton could finish speaking, the receptionist's respectful greeting sliced through the tension. "Mr.Stewart!"



All eyes swung toward the elevator at once.



Wyatt strode out of the elevator with Davin following closely behind.


He surveyed the group and asked, his tone low and unwavering, "What's happening here?"


Jaxton wasted no time and rushed forward, saying,"Mr.Stewart, I'm Jaxton Morrison from the Morrison Group. I wanted to-" "I wasn't talking to you."


Wyatt's attention moved to Amelia, his eyes settling on her with an unreadable look.



Something in Wyatt's expression suggested to Amelia that he might be in a foul mood, though she couldn't be certain.


As curious onlookers gathered, Amelia wasted no time.She quickly explained Santos' purpose for visiting.


Wyatt noticed her respect toward Santos and nodded,agreeing to discuss the matter in his office.


Neither he nor Amelia so much as glanced at Jaxton.



Trailing after them, Jaxton stared at their backs as they entered Wyatt's office, his mood darkening with every step.


Once inside, Santos felt a sense of pressure.



He found himself almost shrinking under Wyatt's stern gaze. With a heavy sigh, he said, "Mr. Stewart, the Morrison Group simply can't muster the funds to see the Eastside Project through. My son overreached, and I'm hoping you'll agree to cancel the partnership."


"So, Mr. Morrison, are you intending to breach the contract?" Wyatt asked. That accusation made Santos stammer,"N-No,it isn't a breach!"



Unease growing, Santos lowered his head and said,"If you agree to let the Morrison Group out of this,whatever you require of us, we'll do it without delay."


With an unreadable look in his eyes, Wyatt gestured toward the sofa. "Sit down first."


Settling nervously into the polished leather, Santos watched Wyatt take his seat. Wyatt then gave a glance at the empty space beside him and turned to Amelia.



Without a word, Amelia understood Wyatt's silent invitation and sat down next to him.



She had a hunch Wyatt wanted to reveal their relationship to everyone in the room.


Her instincts turned out to be right.


Once Amelia sat,Wyatt casually rested his arm behind her. It looked like she was in his arms.


Now, Jaxton was the only one standing in the room.


Wyatt's actions seemed to shock Jaxton for a moment. Then, he glared at Amelia with cold eyes.


A frown creased Santos' brow, and he thought of  requesting to speak with Wyatt alone. But before he could say anything, Wyatt said, "I'll agree to end the partnership-on one condition."



Santos and Jaxton immediately turned their attention to him after hearing that.


Amelia's eyes flickered toward Wyatt; she had a hunch about what was coming next.



Wyatt caught Amelia's gaze and offered her a reassuring glance. When he turned to the others,his expression turned cold. "To end our contract, I want Jaxton to break off his engagement with Amelia."



"What did you say?"


Jaxton, who had been standing nearby, couldn't help but lunge at Wyatt, only to be stopped by Davin.



Irritation burned in Jaxton's eyes, but Davin said with a sly grin, "Having trouble understanding Mr. Stewart's words, Mr. Morrison?"



Davin, in Jaxton's eyes, was merely an assistant.Hearing his taunt, Jaxton seethed with anger but dared not retort due to Wyatt's presence.



He could only shoot daggers at Amelia.



He was convinced that Wyatt's sudden interference with the engagement was Amelia's doing. Jaxton felt an urge to rush forward and slap Amelia,but Wyatt's presence forced him to restrain himself,unable to act.



With displeasure in his eyes, Santos said, "Mr. Stewart,Amelia is free to make her own choices. She may work for the Stewart Group, but her personal life is her own and not subject to employer interference."



Wyatt turned to Amelia. "Why don't you explain to Mr.Morrison whether I have any say in this, Amelia?"
###Chapter 81 | Don't Agree


Amelia didn't answer Wyatt, choosing instead to face Santos. She said, "I'm the one who wants to call off my engagement to Jaxton."


Wyatt's influence could push the Morrison family into agreeing, but they would never forgive him for it.


Amelia had no intention of letting Wyatt shoulder that kind of blame.



Standing nearby, Jaxton rushed over, his voice loud with anger. "You've been seeing all sorts of men behind my back. How dare you even talk about ending our engagement, Amelia? You are so-"



"Watch your mouth!"


Amelia struck Jaxton across the face before he could finish speaking, disgust twisting her features. "Not everyone is as shameless as you."


Without waiting for his reply, she reached into her bag and pulled out a brown envelope.


Back when Wyatt handed her those photos, her first instinct had been to throw them away. But she had forgotten to do that, and now, they came in handy. Pulling the photos from the envelope, Amelia tossed them at Jaxton. "Before you go accusing me,maybe you should take a look at your own actions."


Photographs landed all over Jaxton, some sliding across the table, others hitting the carpet.


When his eyes caught sight of the images, Jaxton's face twisted with shock. "How did you get these photos?"


A sudden realization flashed across his face. Fury burned in his eyes as he asked, "Amelia,did you send someone to follow me? How could you-"



Another sharp slap rang out across the office,slicing through the tense air.



With disappointment etched into his face, Santos had slapped Jaxton hard after seeing the photos. He looked disappointed, his voice weary. "I know you don't have any skills in business, but I never imagined you'd be someone who would stoop so low."



With Santos' harsh words hanging in the air, Jaxton kept his head down. Resentment simmered in his eyes,but he didn't dare say anything. He kept sneaking glances at the office door.


Once he finished reprimanding Jaxton, Santos turned to Amelia. His expression was a mix of guilt and sorrow. "It's the Morrison family who has wronged you."


"Please don't say that, Santos," Amelia quickly said.


Even though the Morrisons had plotted against her,she knew Santos' care for her was real.


Seeing her attitude to him unchanged, Santos managed a faint smile. But the smile faded almost instantly when his gaze shifted to Wyatt.


Wyatt already had the documents ready-a contract and an agreement ending the engagement.


Staring at the paperwork on the table, Santos kept quiet for a few seconds. Then, turning to Amelia, he said, "Jaxton is not the right match for you. If this is what you want, I will honor your decision and agree-"


"I don't agree!"



Before Santos could finish speaking, Laura charged into Wyatt's office, Ricky right behind her.


As soon as Jaxton's message reached Laura, she wasted no time in calling Ricky.


The security personnel from the Stewart Group had followed them here, afraid they would cause a scene.They left after Davin waved them away.


Flames of anger danced in Laura's eyes as she stared at Amelia. "This engagement isn't just about you and Jaxton, Amelia. Our families' partnership is at stake.How can you only think about yourself?"


Displeasure already simmering after signing a share transfer the previous day, Ricky now shot a cold glance at Amelia. "What are you trying to pull? Do you want to ruin the Flynn family's reputation-"


"Having Amelia break off the engagement with the Morrison family was my condition. Does anyone have a problem with that?" Wyatt suddenly said.


That put an end to Ricky's tirade. He clamped his mouth shut imnmediately.


An uneasy glimmer flashed in Laura's eyes. She wouldn't dare challenge Wyatt, so her tone softened as she addressed Amelia, saying, "After your mother was gone, I raised you as if you were my own. Isn't it cruel of you to end things with Jaxton like this? Even if you won't consider my feelings, you should at least think about what this means for our families?"



Tired of Laura's manipulations, Amelia turned to look at her with a mocking gaze. "Are you truly worried about the two families, or are you just thinking of that sixty percent stake?"


Laura's composure crumbled beneath Amelia's words.Her face twisted with anger. "After everything I've done, this is how you think of me?"


The accusation in Laura's voice rang out, but no one in the room missed the unease in her tone.



Mention of the sixty percent stake drew Ricky's suspicion. He shot Laura a confused glance,but before he could speak, Santos' phone began to ring.


Every head turned in his direction.


Clayton's anxious voice soon came through the line."Mr. Morrison, someone's suddenly buying our stock,and our stock price is falling fast-"



Hearing this, Santos immediately turned to look at Wyatt.





On the sofa,Wyatt sat poised and unbothered, though his words were colder than his calm appearance suggested.


Locking eyes with Santos, he said, "Mr. Morrison, my patience is running thin. You have one minute to decide."



A heavy silence fell after he finished speaking.


Watching the Morrison Group's shares tumble, Jaxton,filled with resentment, could only pick up the pen Davin handed him. He moved to sign the contract cancellation agreement, but Davin reached out to stop him,pushing over the engagement annulment agreement instead. "Start with this one."



Once the signatures were on both documents, Jaxton tossed the pen aside, seething. He was almost about to leave when a voice called him back. "Hold on a second."
###Chapter 82 So You're Saying Yes
Jaxton paused abruptly, his gaze blazing with barely restrained fury. He lashed out at Wyatt, "Mr. Stewart,I've already put my signature on those documents.What else do you want?"



"You're going to host a press conference using the Morrison Group's name. You'll publicly break off your engagement with Amelia and apologize to her openly.Admit to the media how wrong you've been. Jaxton,we both know it's the least you can do for her. Of course, you're welcome to decline, but don't be surprised when the Morrison Group vanishes overnight from Kretol if you do that," Wyatt said calmly.



Jaxton's fury could not be contained after he heard that. His fingers curled with rage as he glared at Wyatt lounging on the sofa. He struggled to steady his breath. "Mr. Stewart, don't you think what you are asking is a bit too much?"


"So what if it is?" Wyatt said. "Just remember, I want this to happen today. If you let me down, I'll make sure my threat becomes reality."


Jaxton's body still ached with the pain of three  cracked ribs, and rage stabbed through his chest so sharply that it drained the color from his face.


Though his disappointment toward Jaxton gnawed at him, Santos still defended him, saying to Wyatt, "Mr.Stewart, there's wisdom in leaving the past behind.You-"



"When Amelia suffered at the hands of your family you didn't do anything. So now, you don't have the right to ask me to change my mind. Mr. Morrison,instead of wasting time talking, you might want to get ready for the press conference," Wyatt said.


As soon as Wyatt locked eyes with Davin, Davin understood him and moved forward. "Mr. Morrison,allow me to show you out," he said, motioning toward the door.



Once the Morrisons had disappeared from view,Wyatt fixed Ricky with a steady stare. "Mr. Flynn, is there anything you want to say about all this?"


Instead of answering right away, Ricky mulled over Wyatt's motives for standing up for Amelia. His first guess was that Wyatt was simply smitten with her because of her beauty.


In Kretol, almost no one from wealthy families could rival Amelia'slooks.


Ricky believed that Wyatt was not serious about  Amelia and only wanted to play with her for a while.For a moment, he weighed the shame that might cling to the Flynn name if Amelia did this. Still,he believed being linked to Wyatt was not a bad thing for the family.


"No complaints from me," said Ricky in a flattering tone.



Suddenly aware of how sycophantic he sounded,Ricky coughed, then glanced at Amelia with a gentleness he'd never shown her before. "Since you've already made up your mind about this, I'll respect that decision as your father."


Watching Ricky put on an act like this, Amelia couldn't help but feel a wave of nausea. But with Wyatt standing right there, she swallowed her revulsion and said,"I have to get back to work. Please go."


Ricky didn't seem offended at all. Instead,he flashed a polite smile and promised not to bother her any further.



As soon as he stepped out, Amelia lost her composure.She rushed to the nearest trash bin and began retching.


Wyatt didn't hesitate when he noticed her distress. He moved in close, placed a gentle hand on her back, and offered her a glass of water. "Is something wrong? Do  you want me to drive you to the hospital?" His concern was clear.


Amelia gulped the water down and managed to quell the nausea.


Instead of accepting his offer, she brushed it off with a wave of her hand. "No need for that. Really, I'm okay."


Catching the way his eyebrows drew together, she couldn't resist a bitter laugh. "I just feel sick seeing my father like that."



Amelia's fingers found the annulment papers on the table. A spark of happiness flickered in her eyes at the thought of finally breaking away from the Morrison family for good.


She was about to put the document into her bag, only to hear Wyatt's voice break through the silence."Amelia, what do you say to getting our marriage registered today?"



His cool voice carried a mysterious allure, causing Amelia to drop the document onto the carpet.


Amelia's wide eyes drifted to Wyatt, searching his face for any sign that he was joking.


No hint of teasing appeared in those dark eyes of his.Instead, she found unwavering seriousness, and her heart began to pound. "Didn't we decide to wait until May 5th? That's my birthday."


"I know, but your birthday is still five days away. I can't wait that long."



When he noticed that she had fallen silent, a flicker of disappointment crossed his face. "Unless you've changed your mind about getting married to me?"


Amelia opened her mouth, but before she could speak,Wyatt continued, "If you're having second thoughts,I understand. After all, the Morrison family is out of the picture now."


At that moment, Amelia suddenly felt like she was a heartless woman.



Wyatt's somber expression made her words tumble out. "No, I haven't changed my mind about that. It's just-"



"So you're saying yes?" Wyatt interjected.



The question left her speechless, completely caught off guard.


At that instant, Davin appeared at the office door.Wyatt instructed him, "Get everything ready. Amelia and I are going to get our marriage registered now."


Davin was shocked by the suddenness of the matter. Seeing Davin's hesitation, Wyatt fixed him with a pointed look. "Why are you still standing there? Hurry up!"
###Chapter 83 Getting Married



Davin decided not to arrange for another driver and instead took the wheel himself.


He could hardly sit still, eager to be part of the moment as it happened.


The moment Amelia slid into the passenger seat,Wyatt held her hand tightly.



With every mile, Amelia's nerves grew more tangled at the thought of getting married to Wyatt.


Even so, the steady warmth of his grip and the gentle reassurance in his touch calmed her racing thoughts.When she caught the hurried beat of his heart, she felt a glimmer of relief.



It turned out Wyatt was just as nervous as she was.


Since it was a weekday, not many people are at the courthouse.



Davin's connections made things smooth, so when they walked in, staff greeted them right away.



Only one signature was needed from Amelia, and just a handful of minutes later, her marriage to Wyatt was registered. "Congratulations, Mr. and Mrs. Stewart! Wishing you a lifetime filledwith happiness and love!"


Davin spoke first, offering his heartfelt wishes. The sound of her new title made Amelia feel like she was in a daze.


Reality finally settled in for her when court staff came forward with their own congratulations.


She realized it was true-she and Wyatt were really husband and wife now.


Following Wyatt's request, Davin had gifts for everyone who helped that day.


Everyone who received a gift beamed with gratitude and showered Amelia and Wyatt with warm wishes.


Amelia thanked them all, unable to hide her own happiness.


Even as she slipped back into the car, a bright smile stayed on her face.


"Mr. Stewart, I've prepared all the gifts for the company's employees. Would you like me to give them out now?" Davin said.



Wyatt nearly agreed, but Amelia caught his sleeve to stop him. "Do you think we could keep our marriage between us at the office, at least for now?" she said.



Wyatt's cheerful expression faltered for a moment.Picking up on his reaction, Amelia rushed to explain,"I don't mean anything bad. I only want to do my job without everyone treating me differently because of my relationship with you."


The moment she finished speaking,Wyatt's soft laugh filled the car. "Whatever you want, I'll go along with it.We'll keep it between us for the time being."



Glancing at the stack of gifts, Amelia said with a smile,"We can hand those out once I'm no longer working in your company."


"Mrs. Stewart, is it all right if I get my present first?Maybe your happiness will rub off on me and help me find someone special," Davin said.


With a lighthearted laugh,Amelia agreed but reminded him to call her by her first name.


Only then did Amelia realize their car wasn't taking the usual route toward the Stewart Group. Instinctively,she glanced at the man beside her for answers.


Catching the sparkle in her gaze, Wyatt couldn't resist reaching over to touch her cheek. The softness delighted him, and he playfully gave it a gentle pinch before letting go. That unexpected touch made Amelia stunned, her body going completely still.


She quickly turned her head and shot Wyatt a warning look, earning a low, amused chuckle from him.



"We're not working today. Since we just got our marriage registered, let's have a day off together,"Wyatt said.


Joy seemed to radiate from Wyatt, and it wasn't long before Amelia felt happiness rise in her chest.



Although she hoped to keep their marriage a secret from Wyatt's company, she couldn't help but spill the news to Carlee and Monroe in their group chat.


"I got married!" She sent a message.


Barely a second passed before Carlee's call appeared on Amelia's phone screen.


"Amelia, this is amazing! You and Wyatt together-no one will dare mess with you now! My best friend,married to the powerful Wyatt Stewart...I could shout it from the rooftops. Just imagine how jealous Dayna will be.I-"



Carlee's enthusiasm poured from the speaker, so loud that Amelia had to hold the phone away from her ear.She quickly flashed Wyatt an apologetic smile. "Carlee, please keep quiet about the matter for now."Hearing Carlee mention Dayna, Amelia gave a gentle reminder.


Tempting as it was to share the news with the Flynn and Morrison families, Carlee respected Amelia's wishes and promised not to reveal a thing to them.


Amelia didn't have a large friend circle-Carlee and Monroe were her closest friends.



Once the call ended, Amelia looked for Monroe's reply but saw her message had gone unanswered by him.



Just as she began to wonder if Monroe had missed the news,Wyatt handed her his phone.



On the screen was a message from Monroe, and reading it brought tears to her eyes.


"Look after Amelia, please. If you ever grow tired of her, I'm begging you, let her go gently!" His words were followed by three pleading emojis.


Wyatt hadn't typed a reply yet, so Amelia took his phone and placed a video call.


On Monroe's end, he had been looking at his phone,waiting for Wyatt's answer. He immediately picked up when the video call appeared. Seeing Amelia on the screen instead of Wyatt, he blinked in surprise. "Why are you the one calling?"
###Chapter 84 I'll Treasure Amelia For The Rest Of...
No sooner had Monroe spoken than he realized how foolish he sounded. Since Amelia and Wyatt had just registered their marriage, of course they were still together.


A warm grin spread across his face as he offered his best wishes. "Amelia, congratulations! I hope your marriage brings you nothing but joy!"


His tone shifted from celebratory to earnest, a note of worry entering his voice. "You'remarried to Wyatt now, and there will be rough patches ahead since you've become a member of the Stewart family. Just promise me you won't let yourself be pushed around like you were with the Morrison family."



Amelia almost explained that her years of compromise in the Morrison household had been for her grandmother's sake. But the genuine concern etched on Monroe's face had her nodding. "You know me better than anyone. I won't let anyone take advantage of me from now on."



Reassured, Monroe said, "The Flynn family might not be much help for you, but you've always got Carlee and me. If things ever get tough, reach out to us. Even if Carlee bails, I'll always have your back. You-"


A sharp voice chimed in before he could finish."What's with the shade, Monroe?" Carlee's voice came as she entered Monroe's room.



Monroe's house had a keypad lock, and both Amelia and Carlee knew the code.



Monroe caught Carlee's glare and shot her a sheepish smile, shifting to playful defense. "Did I say anything wrong? You really are unreliable. Did you forget what happened at the bar last time?"


Though Carlee had no comeback for that, she didn't hesitate to land a quick kick on his shin.



After getting kicked, Monroe said, "Remind me again why I ever gave you my house code?"


Watching her friends bicker through the phone,Amelia burst out laughing. "Should I leave you two to it? Maybe I should hang up and let you settle things first."



Carlee wasted no time grabbing the phone from Monroe."Amelia, is Wyatt with you right now?"


Wyatt had been quietly listening to Amelia and Monroe's conversation. When Carlee mentioned him,he moved closer to Amelia, bringing both their faces  into the frame.



As Wyatt approached, the scent of him enveloped Amelia, making her face feel warm.


For all her boldness earlier, Carlee shrank a little under Wyatt's steady stare. The warning she'd planned for him quickly dissolved into something much softer."Um-Mr. Stewart, congratulations to you and Amelia!"


Monroe, left phone-less for the moment, rolled his eyes at Carlee's sudden backpedaling.


Seeing that,Carlee blurted, "Amelia is the best woman on earth, Mr. Stewart-you'd better treasure her!"


Her confidence soon wavered after she said that,and she was about to hand the phone back to Monroe when Wyatt's cool, unhurried voice echoed. "No need to worry. I promise you both-I'll treasure Amelia for the rest of my life."



Worried that Wyatt might misunderstand her friends,Amelia softly explained after hanging up the call,"They didn't mean anything by that. They just care about me so much.You-"



Wyatt's hand closed softly around hers, his tone sincere. "You don't need to be so formal with me anymore, Amelia. We're married now, remember? And I meant what I just said." The graveness in his eyes startled her, prompting her to shift away from him.


Though the back seat was spacious, Amelia nearly pressed herself against the car door to put some space between Wyatt and herself.


Wyatt let out a resigned chuckle, unable to hide his amusement. "If you go any farther,you'll end up out on the road."



Heat crept up her cheeks at that, and she meant to move back, but a sudden swerve sent her tumbling toward him.



She immediately tried to move away, and her hand accidentally landed on his abdomen. Just then,his arm slipped around her waist, anchoring her in place as he spoke in a low and rough voice near her ear. "Don't move."



While driving, Davin picked up on the commotion behind him and shot a worried glance at the rearview mirror. A startled pause overtook him when he caught a glimpse of what was happening in the backseat, but he quickly snapped out of it and lowered the partition,giving Amelia and Wyatt some privacy.


The spacious area suddenly felt cramped, and Amelia's senses sharpened. She could distinctly feel the changes in Wyatt's body. Warmth from his body pressed hard against her,making her pause. A sudden memory of Carlee's teasing words raced through her mind, and before she could stop herself, she blurted, "Wait a second-aren't you supposed to be...incompetent?"


Instant regret crashed over her as soon as the question escaped her lips. She wished she could vanish now.



Why had she said that?


Desperate to save face, she triedto pass the blame."I wasn't the one who said that, it was..." Yet, her loyalty to her friend kept her from selling Carlee out,so she let her sentence hang and snapped her mouth shut.



Seeing Amelia like this amused Wyatt. Laughter rumbled from him. "Well, do you still need proof about my skills in that department?"



Amelia couldn't possibly answer that question. She could only vow to give Carlee an earful the next time they met.



Clearly,Carlee had been wrong!


With Wyatt's intense gaze fixed on her, Amelia found it impossible to breathe. Just as the tension grew unbearable, the car finally rolled to a halt.
###Chapter 85 | Want To Show You Something Else
After parking, Davin quietly exited the vehicle bt left the rear doors closed. With a hushed tone, he called back, "We've arrived."



Heat flooded Amelia's cheeks as she realized others were nearby, making her lower her voice. "Let go of me."



Wyatt's arm still circled her waist with a firm grip-without his cooperation,getting up was impossible for her.



Sensing her unease and not wanting to push his luck,Wyatt finally relented, carefully guiding her upright.


They took a moment in their seats to fix their clothes and steady themselves. When they were about to get out of the car, Wyatt reached out, offering his hand to Amelia. They stepped out together.


What lay before them was a breathtaking tapestry of color-flower fields unfurled across the hillsides, so strikingly beautiful that it made tears prick Amelia's eyes.


Memories tugged at her. She'd visited this spot before.  Back then, blossoms had also carpeted the land,though nothing as expansive as now.


When she turned sixteen, Katrina had gifted her this very hillside, buying the land and filling it with flowers for her birthday.


Yet, three years ago, after Katrina's illness, flames had swept through and destroyed every last bloom. Since that day, Amelia had never returned.


She had never imagined anyone could recreate the past from the ashes.



Could all of this truly be for her?



Wyatt never took his gaze off Amelia after getting out of the car, tracking every flicker of emotion on her face.



He'd wanted to bring her here on May 5th,but patience had deserted him-this surprise couldn't wait.



For most of his life, he never bothered with elaborate gifts. Marc's ideas about what women liked had seemed useless, except the part about flowers-there was something about them that lingered with him.


His own quiet investigation had uncovered the truth about the fire-the Flynn family was to blame for the destruction three years ago. Wyatt's voice was gentle as he asked, "Do you like the flowers,Amelia?"



His nerves were clear in the way his gaze flickered, as if he was worried he'd gotten everything wrong.


This land, once reduced to blackened earth by the fire three years ago, had been painstakingly brought back to life. Wyatt had overseen every detail, flying in rare blossoms from distant countries.



Carried on a gentle wind, the fragrance of thousands of flowers swept over them. Without warning,Amelia turned and threw her arms around Wyatt in a grateful,silent embrace.



That simple gesture lit up Wyatt's whole face.He Laced his fingers through hers and guided her down a path between the blooms. "Come with me-I want to show you something else."


A short stroll brought them to a rustic little cabin tucked at the edge of the field.



Floor-to-ceiling windows framed the colorful landscape outside, letting them soak in the view even from the comfort of a warm couch. The cabin was well-equipped, and the fridge in the kitchen was stocked with various ingredients.



Seeing this haven, Amelia felt a sense of peace she  hadn't known in years. Old hurts faded into the background, leaving only the serenity of this quiet escape with Wyatt.


Their private bubble lasted until Davin arrived,ushering in Sanford in his spotless chef's whites.At the sight of the celebrated chef, Amelia stood up to greet him with a bright smile.


Sanford greeted them warmly and said,"Congratulations to both of you. Wishing you a marriage full of joy and laughter."


Even after all the well-wishes she'd received, Amelia still offered Sanford her sincere gratitude.


Turning from Amelia to Wyatt, Sanford grinned."I won't charge you for cooking today. Think of this Lunch as my little wedding present to you both."



Wyatt,not missing a beat,played at being dissatisfied."Only lunch? That's it for such an important day?"



Sanford just shrugged off his words, not wanting to argue with Wyatt on such a joyous day. His culinary skills were among the best in the country, and not everyone could invite him to prepare a meal.


Sanford put his talents to work, filling the table with beautiful dishes from Wyatt's carefully chosen menu -every one of them a favorite of Amelia's. Once the meal was set, Sanford made his exit with a cheerful farewell, wanting to give the couple privacy Davin trailed after him, also leaving.


Quiet settled back over the cabin, leaving Wyatt and Amelia alone.


"You sit here. I'lI go get something," Wyatt said,drawing out a chair for Amelia before disappearing into the kitchen. He returned moments later, carrying a bottle of wine.



The sight of it sent Amelia's mind spinning with thoughts.





Why bring out wine now? Was he expecting her to drink with him? Should she? What if she ended up tipsy or worse?



Her train of thought broke when Wyatt set a glass of wine in front of her.


The red liquid caught the light, and a gentle aroma rose from the glass, making it hard for Amelia to resist.



Wyatt noticed her expression and smiled. "Today's special-we just got our marriage registered. It calls for a little celebration. It's only low-alcohol wine, so you don't have to worry about it being too strong." Relief flooded through Amelia as she realized she had overthought everything.


He simply wanted to share a toast with her to mark the day.


Lifting his glass in invitation, Wyatt waited for her to do the same. Amelia quickly clinked her glass with his,the crisp sound filling the room.


Joy sparkled in Wyatt's eyes, their depth reflecting just how much this moment meant to him.



He alone understood how long he'd dreamed of this day. Now, at last,she was truly his.



Moved by the happiness in his gaze, Amelia broke into a bright smnile.
###Chapter 86 Michelle Fainted
Amelia and Wyatt traded a glance brimming with quiet understanding, each lifting their glass for a toast before taking a sip.


Amelia felt her worries slip away, finding it easy to open up to Wyatt as their conversation drifted.


She told him about the pain the Flynn family had caused her, the Morrison family's two-faced ways, and all the silent frustrations that had weighed her down for years.


Sunlight spilled across a sea of golden flowers outside,painting the cabin in warmth and color, but Wyatt's attention never strayed from Amelia. With every soft confession, his heart ached for her.


Unable to hold back, he reached over, wrapping her gently in his arms, offering silent comfort.


Amelia froze for an instant, unsure, until his words soothed her nerves. "You're not alone anymore,Amelia. You've got me from now on."



Simple as it was, that promise settled into her heart,grounding her with the certainty of real support. Hours slipped by until, around three, Davin returned carrying a tablet.


"Mr. Stewart, the Morrison Group's press conference just began."


As he spoke, Davin passed the device to Wyatt, and Amelia scooted closer, watching the screen intently at his side.



***



At the Morrison Group.



Jaxton stood at the podium, blinded by camera flashes and pressured by  the weight of so many expectant eyes.


Every instinct screamed for him to escape, but Wyatt's warning from earlier replayed in his mind,keeping him rooted in place. Eventually, he mustered the nerve to speak into the microphone. "This press conference has a single purpose-to announce the cancellation of my engagement to Amelia Flynn publicly."


A wave of surprise rippled through the crowd,reporters erupting into a flurry of murmurs and frantic note-taking.


Over the last two years, Jaxton's name had been  splashed across headlines many times because of one scandal after another-each time, Amelia had been the one quietly cleaning up the mess behind the scenes.


With that history, reporters invited by the Morrison Group today had fully expected another round of PR spin,not a bombshell about a broken engagement.


Some journalists wasted no time firing off questions "Mr. Morrison, the public knows you and Miss Flynn have a long history together. And your engagement was arranged a long time ago. What caused this sudden split?"


"We noticed Miss Flynn isn't present. Does her absence signal trouble between you two?"



"Who decided to end things first-was it the Morrison family, or Miss Flynn herself?"


Every question landed with the force of an accusation,a dozen microphones thrust toward Jaxton's pale face.



Were it not for Wyatt's relentless pressure, Jaxton would have refused to break off the engagement.


Bitterness simmered in his chest as he remembered how Amelia had used her new alliance with Wyatt to force his hand. Still, he didn't dare blame her, not with the Morrison Group's stock tanking because of Wyatt. He clung to Laura's last-minute advice: since he couldn't change anything, he should at least spin the situation in his favor.



By shouldering all the blame, he might salvage some public sympathy.


The moment Jaxton owned up to the split, the tone in the room softened, exactly as Laura had predicted.


Eyes shining with carefully summoned tears,Jaxton exclaimed, "It's all on me. I want to offer a public apology to Amelia-I'm truly sorry."


Back in the cabin, Amelia glanced away from the screen, repulsed by the performance. Wyatt saw her reaction and put the tablet aside. Silence settled between them.



Just then, a shrill ringtone cut through the hush of the cabin.



Seeing the hospital's number flash across the screen,Amelia nearly dropped her phone. Panic drained the color from her cheeks after she answered the call.


Wyatt's concern was immediate. "Amelia, what's wrong?"





Words tumbled out as she caught her breath. "Please -take me to the hospital right now. My grandmother  has fainted."



Without wasting a moment, she rushed for the door.Wyatt wasted no time, barking orders for Davin to bring the car around quickly.


As soon as they hit the road, Wyatt reached for Amelia's cold hand, his voice gentle. "Marc is on call tonight. He'll take care of your grandmother. She's in good hands, so try not to worry too much."


Guilt shadowed Amelia's features. "This is my fault. I should have told Grandma about this before the news went public."


News from the hospital had left her reeling: Michelle's fainting spell struck right after the televised press conference announcing the called-off engagement.


A knot of regret twisted inside Amelia. Failing to prepare Michelle for the shock now felt inexcusable,and if anything happened to her, Amelia didn't know how she could ever forgive herself.


"Davin, step on it!" Wyatt, sensing Amelia's growing anxiety, leaned forward and urged Davin to speed up.
###Chapter 87 It's Been A Long Time
Davin slammed his foot on the gas, racing through the city with purpose. Before the car fully rolled to a stop at Kretol City Hospital, Amelia had already thrown open the door, hurrying out with Wyatt right behind her.



They had just reached the surgery wing when the operating room doors swung open and Michelle was wheeled out.



Marc met them with steady eyes and reassuring words."Mrs. Davis is stable now."



Relief swept through Amelia, loosening the fear that had gripped her chest. She rushed to her grandmother's side, holding her hand with trembling fingers.



Back in the hospital room, Amelia felt her emotions had settled down.



Still, she couldn't leave her grandmother's side until she woke up, insisting Wyatt return home to rest. But he refused to leave.



He believed that after his marriage to Amelia, as her  husband, he should stay with her through anything.


Two long hours crept by before Michelle's lashes fluttered and her eyes finally opened.


Amelia's hand never left her grandmother's, and the moment she felt movement, her face lit up. "Grandma,you're awake!"


Confusion flickered across Michelle's face at first, but her memory returned fast. As the news she'd seen came rushing back to her mind, anger flushed her cheeks. "So the Morrison family has broken off the engagement? Did Jaxton mistreat you? Tell me the truth."


Her words tumbled out, voice quivering with outrage.


Quickly, Amelia tried to calm her down. "Please,Grandma, don't get upset. Let me explain everything."


Only after repeated reassurance did Michelle's breathing slow. Amelia gently shared the full story behind the split.


"It was my decision, Grandma. I was the one who wanted to end things with Jaxton. I should have told you earlier, and I'm so sorry you had to hear it that way. I never meant for this to happen..."


Michelle barely absorbed Amelia's explanation, only catching the part that mattered most. "You mean to  say it was your choice to end things?"


Amelia's small nod brought a flicker of complex emotions to Michelle's gaze.


Had the Morrison family wronged her granddaughter,she would have been ready to confront them. But if this was Amelia's decision, the situation demanded a different response.


Once her breathing settled, Michelle's attention drifted toward the sofa.


At first, she mistook the man sitting there for Monroe,but a closer look startled her. Seeing Wyatt's striking face,she was shocked."It's you?"



Wyatt offered a gentle greeting. "It's been a long time,Michelle."



Amelia was momentarily thrown by his words.



Amelia's mind raced to make sense of Wyatt's words.Had Wyatt and her grandmother met before?


Confusion clouded Amelia's eyes as she glanced from Wyatt to her grandmother.


Michelle asked Wyatt, "Why are you here?"


Wyatt spoke with quiet confidence. "Since Amelia and I are husband and wife now, it's only right I accompany her here."



For a second,Michelle lay in shock, speechless on her hospital bed. Worried the surprise might be too much,Amelia watched her anxiously, bracing for another fainting spell.


After a while, Michelle managed to find her voice. "Is it true? You actually married him, Amelia?"


With the truth out, Amelia knew there was no turning back. She met Michelle's eyes and told her everything.



Amelia finished her confession and waited, half-expecting Michelle to scold her, but not a single harsh word came.Instead,Michelle simply shifted in bed and said, "Amelia, I'm feeling a bit hungry. Would you mind getting me something to eat?"


The gentle request surprised Amelia, who almost protested, but Wyatt quietly said, "Go ahead. I'll stay with her here."



Uncertainty flickered in Amelia's eyes, but with both of them urging her, she stepped out into the hallway.


No sooner had Amelia left the room than Michelle's gaze fixed on Wyatt, her expression a storm of mixed emotions."I never thought, after everything, that Amelia would marry you in the end."


Wyatt met her look with a steady calm. "You  remember-it was me who first asked to marry her.Jaxton was never the right man for her."


Michelle didn't let the topic slide. "And what about you? Are you sure you're the man for her?"


The question made Wyatt pause. For a moment, he considered it, lost in thought.


Eventually, he answered with quiet honesty, "The Stewarts are a complicated bunch, and I'm far from flawless. But I'll do whatever it takes to keep her safe."



That assurance seemed to ease Michelle's worries.She'd always admired Wyatt's character; she just didn't want Amelia swept up in the chaos of his world.


She opened her mouth to speak, but Wyatt continued before she could, "You might wonder if | married Amelia to settle the score for being rejected before."


Before she could answer, Wyatt smiled gently."That's not the case. If I didn't want this, no one could make it happen. The truth is, I married Amelia because I love her."



That final line drifted through the hallway just as Amelia reached the doorway, stopping her in her tracks.


Wyatt loved her? Amelia had believed he married her out of obligation -a debt from years past, an old promise hanging between them.



Now, it felt as if her heart had been struck by lightning


She slipped quietly back into the hospital room, both Michelle and Wyatt watching her with gentle expressions. She kept her eyes down, setting the food on the bedside table, not daring to meet Wyatt's gaze


To her surprise, Michelle said with a smile, "I think I am not hungry anymore."


Amelia wanted to urge her grandmother to eat, but Michelle simply squeezed her hand and said, "You made a wiser choice than your mother ever did.You're married now, so cherish the life you're building together."



The meaning behind those words left Amelia puzzled.When she finally stepped into the hallway with Wyatt,she couldn't help but ask him, "What did you say to my grandmother while I was out?"



Wyatt met her question with quiet deliberation,choosing each word with care. "There's something you should know, Amelia. Years ago,I actually went to your mother and asked her for your hand."
###Chapter 88 Secret



Amelia stood rooted in place, her mind spinning in disbelief. Why did she not know about this?


Wyatt patiently recounted everything that had happened two years ago.


It turned out that after surviving his injuries, Wyatt had hired people to dig into Amelia's background, piecing together clues until he finally figured out that she was the very woman he'd been searching for all along. He had wasted no time and headed straight for the Flynn family,wanting to marry her.



Back then, Amelia's mother's illness had taken a serious turn. She had admired Wyatt's character but still turned him down.



Katrina felt that the Stewart family was too complicated for Amelia and preferred her to marry Jaxton.



Wyatt had been frustrated when he found out that Amelia had already been engaged to Jaxton, but there had been nothing he could do to change that.


According to the original agreement, Amelia was supposed to marry Jaxton after her birthday this year. Therefore, Wyatt had made his promise to her valid for two years.



"My mom never breathed a word of this to me,"Amelia muttered, shaking her head.



Suddenly,a memory surfaced-a question Katrina had once asked her. What if a better man came along;would Amelia still choose Jaxton?



At the time, Amelia had replied with certainty, saying whatever was truly hers would eventually find its way to her.



Now, as she recalled her answer, she let out a quiet laugh, marveling at her fate.


Wyatt caught the sound of her laughter and let a small smile tug at his lips.


Michelle's stable condition gave Amelia some much-needed relief, and she walked beside Wyatt,happy again as they left the hospital. But her mood soon soured when she saw Jaxton at the hospital entrance.



Jaxton, clutching his aching ribs that had not yet healed,struggled to stand upright. The pain gnawed at him, worsened by the ordeal of the press conference. He'd rushed to the hospital straight after,unable to bear it any longer.


Catching sight of Amelia and Wyatt sharing a laugh, Jaxton felt a surge of bitterness twist inside him.


He might have been powerless against the Stewart family, but seeing Amelia with another man was more than he could stand.



A sly glint flashed across Jaxton's eyes as he suddenly came up with an idea.


Without so much as a glance at Amelia, he strode right up to Wyatt. "Mr. Stewart, I'd like a private word with you. Do you have a moment?"


"No," Wyatt replied coldly.



Jaxton's face tightened, frustration simmering under the surface. He swallowed it down and said, "You might want to reconsider. What I want to say concerns Amelia."



At the sound of her name, Amelia felt her guard shoot up. She tugged Wyatt's sleeve, ready to leave without a backward glance.



But Jaxton stepped in front of them, blocking their path. "What's got you running off, Amelia? Worried I'll spill your secret in front of him?"


Amelia hadn't planned to entertain his drama, but with Wyatt beside her, she refused to let doubts fester.Her tone sharpened, eyes cold and clear. "Why don't you go ahead and enlighten me about the so-called secret? I'd love to know what it is."



A smirk twisted Jaxton's lips. "If you insist."


His voice dripped with sarcasm as he turned toward Wyatt. "Mr. Stewart, are you aware that Amelia has been involved with an old man. That man not only helped her get Marc to treat her grandmother but also brought her along to the VIP floor at Pearl Bay Auction House..."



No sooner had the words left his mouth than both Amelia and Wyatt showed odd expressions.



Wyatt, especially, shot Jaxton a glare that could have frozen him in place.



Jaxton stood there, confusion etched on his face.He thought he'd just delivered the final blow-surely,after he had exposed Amelia, Wyatt would want nothing to do with her.



Feeling triumphant, Jaxton waited for Wyatt to turn on Amelia, convinced he'd ruined their relationship.



Just then, a blaring horn shattered the moment.Jaxton,about to lash out at the interruption, caught sight of the approaching car. His demeanor changed instantly, excitement sparking in his eyes. He quickly turned to Wyatt, saying, "Mr. Stewart, that's the old man's car! He's-" As Davin emerged from the car, Jaxton froze, struck silent as if someone had squeezed the air from his lungs.


With a practiced sweep, Davin opened the door for Wyatt and Amelia, then threw a pointed glance at Jaxton. "Mr. Morrison, you planning to take root there?"


Lost in a fog, Jaxton didn't even register the jab. His eyes stayed glued to the car as Wyatt and Amelia slid inside.



The truth hit him with a jolt. All this time, Wyatt was the very "old man" he had been investigating. No wonder Wyatt had glared at him earlier.


A moment later, Davin pulled away from the curb,leaving Jaxton in the haze of the car's exhaust.


Catching a glimpse of Jaxton's slack<-jawed stare in the mirror, Davin couldn't help but remark, "Mr.Stewart, the guy looks like he's lost his mind."


Wyatt paid him no mind. He turned to Amelia, a hint of hurt in his gaze. "Tell me, do I look like an old man to you?"


Amelia blinked at him, taking in his handsome features.She let out a quiet laugh. "No. If you ask me, Jaxton's not only out of his mind; there's something wrong with his eyes, too."
###Chapter 89 Living Together


About thirty minutes later, te car pulled up in front of Amelia's apartment building. Davin hopped out to open the car door for her.


She offered her thanks and stepped onto the curb,wanting to say her farewells to Wyatt. But then, she caught sight of him following her out of the vehicle.


Confusion flickered across her face as she turned to face him.



Wyatt met her eyes with a calm expression. He said,"I'll be spending the night here."


Amelia's eyes widened in disbelief when she heard that.





What did he mean by that?


Was he thinking what she thought he was suggesting?


Amelia kept silent. Wyatt stepped closer and added,"Sweetheart,we got married today. Surely you don't expect us to spend our wedding night apart?"


He was already standing right beside her as he finished.


For a split second, she wanted to protest. But no solid  reason came to mind.



The two of them were officially married. Living together made perfect sense.


Still,Amelia felt she wasn't quite ready for that.


After some anxious thought, she could only say,"You don't have any of your things here, so maybe you should stay at your own place tonight-"



"Mr.Stewart."



Before Amelia could finish speaking, headlights flooded the curb as another car stopped nearby. Kurt then hopped out.



He nodded first to Wyatt, then broke into a wide grin when he looked at Amelia. "Mrs. Stewart,congratulations. May you both have the happiest life together!"



Amelia blushed at his heartfelt wishes. She managed a warm thank you. But then, she saw Kurt give instructions for a suitcase to be brought over from the trunk.



"I made sure to pack your usual clothes in here. If anything's missing, just let me know, and I'll bring it over," he said to Wyatt.


He then slipped back into his car, but before leaving, he tossed a look at Davin, who still lingered at the curb. "What are you waiting for? Get inside your car and leave."



As Davin left, Kurt's face lit up with genuine happiness.He nudged the driver to pull away as well, already imagining the newlyweds having children soon.



With the others gone, only Amelia and Wyatt remained.




The sight of Wyatt's suitcase left Amelia speechless.With nothing left to say, she gave in and unlocked the door.



Her nerves got the better of her. The key fumbled in her hand, refusing to cooperate. On her third try,her fingers trembled, and she nearly gave up. Wyatt's steady hand intervened. He quietly took the key from her and slipped it into the lock.


With a smooth turn, the door opened.



Wyatt paused at the open doorway and let Amelia step inside first before trailing after her, suitcase in hand.



A click from behind made Amelia freeze. The locked door signaled she was alone with him, and her heart pounded nervously


The apartment, modest and neat, only held a master bedroom and a tiny study. Anxiety crept in as Amelia wondered whether sharing a bed with Wyatt was unavoidable.



While she wrestled with her thoughts, Wyatt's voice drifted over. "Could you lend me a bit of space in your closet?"


She wanted to refuse, but after some thought, she silently led Wyatt to the closet.


Inside the bedroom, the wardrobe barely had any room to spare. With some effort, she shuffled her own clothes aside to make a sliver of space for his things.


Wyatt began to settle his shirts and jackets on the rack. Watching him, she fidgeted awkwardly,uncertain if she ought to lend a hand.



Wyatt must have caught on to her unease, because he glanced over and said, "I can do this on my own. Just go do whatever you usually do. Don't mind me."


"Alright then, I'll take a shower first. Take your time."


Without looking back, she slipped out of the room,finally feeling her nerves start to unwind as she entered the living room.


Earlier, all her thoughts had revolved around whether she would have to sleep beside Wyatt. Now, seeing the living room, she realized the space was a bit  messy.


She subconsciously began tidying up. Once the living room looked presentable, she headed to the bathroom.



Inside, Amelia could not resist sending Carlee a message, telling her that Wyatt would be staying the night at her place.


At that very moment, Carlee was throwing back drinks at a rowdy bar. Her phone vibrated just as the noise peaked, and she dropped her glass to read the message.



Seeking a quieter corner, Carlee called Amelia without hesitation.



None of Amelia's friends were married, and Carlee-the self-proclaimed queen of nightlife-was her only confidant for this kind of thing.


"You and Wyatt tied the knot. Living together is completely ordinary," Carlee remarked as soon as Amelia picked up the call.


Deep down,Amelia understood it was natural, but the idea of sharing a bed with Wyatt made her nervous.


She actually liked Wyatt, though her mind had yet to catch up with her new role as a wife.


Carlee, noticing the silence on the other end of the  line, figured Amelia must be nervous. She offered comfort in her usual playful way. "You're making this a bigger deal than it is. Just pretend he's nothing more than a stuffed toy lying next to you!"



"He's a real person, not a stuffed toy. That's hardly the same," Amelia retorted.



"Well, there's hardly a difference. Besides, Wyatt is unable to perform in bed," Carlee said.
###Chapter 90 Sharing A Bed



Carlee's words sent Amelia's thoughts racing back to what had happened in the car. A huff slipped out as she snapped back, "Stop it! Where'd you even hear that? He-"



"Amelia?"



A knock at the bathroom door cut her off. Wyatt's voice filtered through, gentle and laced with concern.



The interruption made Amelia freeze, feeling as if she'd just been caught saying bad things behind someone's back. Lowering her voice, she said, "I'll call you later," then quickly ended the call.


Staring at her screen, Carlee blinked in disbelief.



If Wyatt had no such problem, then that meant...



Putting her phone away, Amelia finally replied to Wyatt,unease in her tone, "Did you need something?"



"I just noticed you hadn't come out for a long time,"Wyatt said.


Realizing she'd been in there a while, Amelia had a quick shower. Only after drying off did it dawn on her -she had forgotten to bring her pajamas. Having the place to herself would've made things easy.Now,with Wyatt present, everything felt awkward.


Several moments ticked by before she dared crack the bathroom door. Through the narrow opening,she saw Wyatt lounging on the sofa.


The sound caught his attention. He turned, and for a heartbeat, he glimpsed the curve of her bare shoulder.Something flickered behind his eyes. He forced himself to look away, though his gaze kept drifting back.



"Wyatt, I left my pajamas in the closet. Would you mind grabbing them for me?" While asking, Amelia clung tightly to the bathroom door and hugged her towel close, her words dripping with awkwardness.


A gentle answer left Wyatt's lips, and he got up without a second thought, making his way to the master bedroom.



She watched him disappear down the hall, then pressed her palm to her forehead, mortified by the situation.



Meanwhile,Wyatt reached the closet. Neatly arranged pajamas, almost all in gentle creams and whites,greeted him.


He thought to himself that her closet could use a little more color. He would buy some colorful pajamas for her in the future.



That was a promise for another day, once she was more comfortable with having him around.


That thought lingered as he plucked a beige set from the hangers. He paused, hand hovering over a drawer,his expression troubled by an unfamiliar indecision.


A narrow gap in the doorway allowed Amelia to accept the beige pajamas before she swiftly shut herself inside.



She hurried to put on the pajamas. But her gaze soon landed on a pair of matching underwear. That small discovery left her completely stunned.



Stepping out of the bathroom, she kept her eyes glued to the floor, avoiding the man on the sofa until he finally broke the silence. "It's late. I'll take a shower. You need to get some rest."


With those words, she wasted no time and marched straight to the master bedroom.


Within the safety of the room, she dove beneath the covers, hiding her face and wishing the world would swallow her up.


Amelia punched the pillow repeatedly in frustration before emerging from under the covers. Seeing the mess she'd made of the sheets, she quickly tidied up.


Thinking for a moment, she decided that the bedding needed a complete change and set about doing so at lightning speed.


Earlier, the idea of waiting for Wyatt on the sofa crossed her mind. That plan soon felt awkward,so after wrestling with her thoughts, she simply curled up on the bed.



If sleep claimed her, maybe Wyatt would not wake her. Besides, once morning arrived, tonight's humiliation would fade.



With those thoughts, Amelia coaxed herself to drift off as quickly as possible.


Rest,however,refused to come. The harder she tried to sleep, the more alert she became. After a while,the door creaked open, and she shut her eyes tight,feigning sleep.


Wyatt entered, glancing toward the bed without hesitation.When he saw Amelia bundle up tightly,almost like a caterpillar in a cocoon, a smile tugged at his lips.


Though Amelia's eyes were closed, Wyatt could tell from her uneven breathing that she was wide awake.


Lying there, Amelia felt Wyatt's gaze on her. The thudding of her heart filled her ears.


The mattress dipped beside her, and a crisp, clean scent drifted over. Wyatt had lain down beside her.


Realizing this, she stayed as still as a statue. Numbness soon crept through her limbs, yet she couldn't find the courage to shift.


Regret gnawed at her for pretending to be asleep.



Before she could decide whether to turn over,Wyatt let out a low laugh. "Amelia, don't you find this position awfully uncomfortable?"
###Chapter 91 Amelia, May I Kiss You Now
May in Kretol brought a sultry edge to the air, even if summer had yet to fully arrive.


Tucked beneath a heavy blanket, Amelia battled the dampness of sweat on her skin. At the sound of Wyatt's voice, her eyelids sprang open.



Soft lamplight bathed the room, revealing Wyatt lounging against the headboard in jet-black silk pajamas.


A couple of undone buttons at the collar made his collarbone show.



He was smiling, and for a second, Amelia found herself momentarily entranced.



At that moment, the sight of him seemed almost unreal,her astonishment written plainly in her wide eyes.


Wyatt had always known he had a striking appearance,but it never meant much to him until he saw the look in Amelia's eyes, which somehow pleased him.


Their eyes met, and he arched a brow, his tone  playful. "Does my face meet your approval?"


Those words jolted Amelia from her daze. The sly curve of his smile made her cheeks burn. Instinctively,she loosened her grip on the blanket, feeling his fingers graze her cheek in a feather-light touch.


She remembered his hand on her face before-once in the car. This time, though, it felt different.



Desire settled in his gaze, as though he couldn't help wanting to close the space between them.


"Amelia, may I kiss you now?"


As he spoke, his thumb swept over her lips, a shiver darting down her spine.



"If you don't answer, I'll take that as a yes."



Caught off guard by the question, Amelia could not find the words she needed. Wyatt did not wait for a reply and pressed his lips to hers.



He reached for the switch as he leaned in, turning off the bedside lamp and letting darkness fill the room.


In the dark, his kiss grew bolder, wrapping Amelia in sensation until all she knew was the closeness of him.



Her breath came faster, her chest tight. She tried to push him away, barely thinking, but he caught her  hand and laced his fingers with hers.


He drew back and murmured, "Breathe through your nose,not your mouth."


His low voice lingered beside her ear. Another kiss followed.



Guided by his words, Amelia found her breath steadying.



Soft,tangled breaths echoed through the quiet room.When his hand rested gently at her waist, she instinctively grabbed his sleeve.



That simple reaction brought Wyatt to a sudden stop A hint of frustration at himself flickered in his eyes



Every bit of composure he prided himself on vanished the moment Amelia became involved.



Though Amelia wasn't entirely ready, she understood that Wyatt's actions were respectful and normal considering their relationship.



She was surprised by Wyatt's unexpected pause,searching his face for answers.



Though shadows kept his features hidden, Wyatt's gentle voice put her at ease. "That was my mistake.Take all the time you need to prepare yourself for this.I won't rush you." He eased down beside her and wrapped her in an embrace. "You have all the time you need to grow comfortable with me, with us. For now, just rest in my arms."



This brought Amelia comfort she had not anticipated.


Sleep seemed impossible while being held so close,but his cool scent soon eased her anxieties, pulling her toward slumber.



Eventually, her breathing settled into a peaceful rhythm. Wyatt, who had been pretending to sleep,quietly opened his eyes.



Her face was clear to him, even in the darkness. He pressed a soft kiss to her lips, then allowed himself to drift off.



Lying close together, neither moved. There was a rare kind of peace between them.







At the Morrison family's residence.



Although midnight had passed, lights blazed throughout the house.



The Morrison Group's partnership with the Stewart Group had been canceled. It had caused significant loss for the Morrison Group, sending shareholders into a panic.


Since Jaxton had taken on the Eastside Project without bringing other shareholders into the loop,their frustration found a target in him.


It wasn't until Santos intervened and promised to resolve the issue that the shareholders calmed down.



Shareholders made their demand clear: Santos must recover the lost investment, or they would call a meeting to strip Jaxton of his title as the CEO.



Tension seeped into every corner of the Morrison home. Jaxton, back from the hospital, considered bringing up the matter about Amelia and WVyatt,but the sight of Santos' cold expression made him bite his tongue.



Just then, Laura broke the silence, turning to both men. "There's only one thing left for us to do."
###Chapter 92 Let's Get Married
Laura's words drew immediate attention,both Santos and Jaxton fixing their eyes on her.


She continued, "Sixty percent of the Flynn Group belongs to Amelia. If she decides to-"


"Have you completely lost your mind? Amelia broke things off with Jaxton. Why would she help the Morrison Group now? Those shares are part of Katrina's legacy. You have no right even suggesting that," Santos interjected before Laura could finish speaking.


Disapproval burned in his eyes, and Laura bristled at the challenge. "And just who do you think I'm doing this for? Not for myself, that's for sure. I'm trying to save the Morrison Group," she said.



"You can stop pretending this is all for the company.What you really want is to help Jaxton," said Santos,his stare ice-cold. "I don't want to hear another word about this. Bring it up again, and you will need to stay at home and won't have any say in company matters."


Those words struck Laura silent at first. Then, her voice rang out, bitter and raw. "How can you say that?  My efforts built the Morrison Group into what it is now!You really expect me to sit at home, wasting my time doing nothing? Don't even think about it!"


"Weren't you the one who always insisted a lady should stay at home and not work? You told Amelia the same thing before she ended things with Jaxton.Funny how the rules only matter when they suit you."



"You..."



At a loss for words, Laura could only glare at Santos,her frustration evident.



The truth was, she wanted Amelia nowhere near the business world because she wanted Amelia to hand those sixty percent shares to Jaxton to manage.


But such motives could never be revealed.



While Laura and Santos were arguing,Jaxton remained silent. It was only after Santos left in a huff that Jaxton turned to Laura. "Mom, you really shouldn't always take this attitude with Dad. Didn't you always say that women should be gentle and considerate?You-"



"Enough!" Laura snapped. Arguing with her husband had set her off, but Jaxton's words seemed to hit her where it hurt the most.



Tears of frustration glistened in Laura's eyes, and Jaxton quickly stopped talking.


Memories of the shareholders' criticism fresh in his mind,he moved closer to her, gently taking her hand."I'm sorry, Mom. I shouldn't have said that. Please don't be upset."


Laura's first instinct was to push Jaxton aside, but she remembered his injured ribs and held back.



Jaxton was all she had left. Seeing how downcast he looked, she softened her tone. "Listen to me, Jaxton.You need to reconcile with Amelia. Only she has the power to save you now."


The mention of Amelia's name sent Jaxton's thoughts back to what he'd witnessed at the hospital.


He could not shake the bitterness he felt, knowing Amelia had managed to catch the attention of someone like Wyatt after she walked away from him.



Frustration toward both Amelia and Wyatt simmered.


Jaxton didn't love Amelia, but the sight of her with another man grated on him, as though an old possession he'd thrown away had suddenly become priceless in someone else's hands. The only solution was to reclaim that possession.



This idea took hold, and Jaxton said, "But Amelia already called off our engagement." "So what? You can get engaged to her again, or you can marry her straightaway. The original terms made it clear-once she's married, she's free to control those sixty percent of shares. Jaxton, I know Amelia was hurt by what you and Dayna did, but she used to love you so much. If you just put some effort into comforting her, she'll come back to you. I know she will."



***



Amelia's stomach rumbled when she woke up.Grogginess clung to her as she blinked. Thinking of something,she turned her gaze to the spot beside her.


It was empty.



Was last night just a dream?


While Amelia was doubting herself, a flash of white on the bedside table caught her eye.


Without hesitation, she shuffled closer and snatched up the piece of paper. Just one line greeted her."I went out to buy breakfast."


Amelia didn't need a second glance to recognize Wyatt's handwriting. It carried the same charm as he did.



After tidying up the bed, she went to the bathroom to  freshen up. Cool water splashed across her cheeks as a faint noise from the front door echoed.



Her first thought was that Wyatt had returned with breakfast, so she didn't check immediately and only went to the living room after finishing up her morning skincare routine.



Instead of Wyatt, she found herself staring directly at Jaxton.



Disgust flashed in her eyes. "What are you doing here?"


After being persuaded by Laura, Jaxton had come to Amelia's apartment early in the morning. Concerned Amelia might not let him in, he had even gone to Dayna for a spare key to Amelia's apartment. 2


Seeing how distant Amelia was put Jaxton on edge.Still, he tried hard to keep his frustration in check and said, "I want to talk to you about something important."


Amelia would have preferred not to deal with Jaxton,but out of respect for Santos, she asked, "What is it?"


"Let's get married," Jaxton said.
###Chapter 93 Help Me


"What nonsense are you talking about?" Amelia said.


Jaxton's proposal left Amelia questioning her own hearing, as though reality had taken a sudden turn for the absurd.



To Jaxton, the shock on Amelia's face looked suspiciously like hope, feeding his belief that she still had feelings for him.


Last night, he had already discussed marrying Amelia with Laura. After marriage, Laura would ask Amelia to stay at home, and he would manage her shares of the company.



His mouth opened to continue, but a sharp slap from Amelia stopped him cold. "If you're that crazy, book an appointment with a psychiatrist. Don't show up here just to disgust me. In case your memory's a bit blurry,let me jog it for you-we are finished. If you need proof, watch yesterday's press conference and listen to what you said after signing that agreement at the Stewart Group," she said.



Humiliation crashed over Jaxton all over again; he was a painful reminder of yesterday's events. Wyatt's support had made Amelia bold, or so Jaxton believed. He shot Amelia a stormy look,bitterness carved into every feature. "Amelia, you're nothing but Wyatt's favorite toy. He picks you up when he feels generous and tosses you aside whenever it suits him."


Amelia's face hardened in response. She had always suspected Jaxton was rotten at heart, but his shamelessness still left her stunned.



"You just can't stand the fact that I am with Wyatt now,who is leagues above you. That eats away at your pride. If I was dating an ordinary man, you wouldn't be this agitated, would you?"



Her retort struck deep, and Jaxton's anger flared instantly.



Ignoring Laura's advice for calm, he yelled at Amelia,"You're just as malicious as your mother was!"


"Get out right now!"



When Jaxton spat out that insult about Katrina,Amelia's eyes blazed with fury.


Watching her lose her composure, Jaxton found a twisted pleasure. "Look at you-so angry now. Did l finally hit a sore spot?"


Amelia refused to give him any more attention. Without a word, she grabbed her phone and dialed the police while he watched.


His mood soured as he realized what she was doing.



For Jaxton, another scandal was the last thing the Morrison Group could afford, and Amelia's call to the police was a direct shot at his already fragile reputation.


Just then, Jaxton moved without warning,ramming into her with such force that Amelia toppled over,landing hard on the carpet.



He wasted no time. Within a heartbeat, he straddled her,pressing her down. "Amelia,I should have known you had no shame. I should've claimed you two years ago, before Wyatt ever set his sights on you. Still,it's not too late to do that now."



Shock twisted her features. She slammed her fist into his stomach,trying to fight him.


The punch made him wince as pain shot through him,yet Jaxton refused to let her slip away. Instead,he held her wrists tightly.


Wearing only her pajamas, Amelia could barely defend herself, giving Jaxton an easy advantage.


Seeing Jaxton's wild stare, Amelia felt her heart hammer.She would rather die than sleep with Jaxton. Steadying her breath, she glared at him. "Jaxton, you know Wyatt is with me now. Lay a hand on me,and he'll crush everything you've built. Do you really want that?"



That threat made Jaxton pause, but just for a second.His lips twisted into a sneer. "You think you matter that much to him? Once I've had you, he'll drop you like garbage. You'll mnean nothing to him anymore."


Jaxton's twisted thinking left no room for reason. He believed that if he could not possess her, nobody else could. Blinded by this obsession, he yanked at her clothes, not caring about his own pain.


Amelia fought with everything she had, but his strength was so much stronger than hers.Her eyes darted around until she spotted a vase on the edge of the coffee table.


Acting on instinct, she snatched the vase and shattered it against Jaxton's skull.


The crash rang out, shards flying, and blood quickly streaked across his forehead. Instead of fainting,Jaxton only felt his fury intensify. He glared at her,eyes intense.



His palm lashed out, striking her face with a savage blow. He then tangled his fingers in her hair, forcing her cheek against the cold floor.



A wave of dizziness crashed over Amelia. She was trapped under his weight, powerless to escape, but her spirit burned with defiance. She refused to be touched by this jerk.



She didn't want Jaxton to get his way.



"Someone,please, help me..." she muttered.


Somewhere in the blur, she thought she heard a door creak open. Light spilled into the room...
###Chapter 94 He's Not Worth It
Wyatt stepped through the doorway, groceries in one hand and keys in the other, only for the entire scene before him to freeze him in his tracks.


When he spotted the fear twisting Amelia's face,the look he sent Jaxton was chilling enough to freeze the air. He didn't even bother glancing at the blood trickling from Jaxton's head and chest.



With Amelia pinned beneath him, Jaxton hardly had time to react before a hand clamped down on his collar.He was yanked away fast, and a blinding ache soon shot through his abdomen.



Jaxton's fractured ribs caught the brunt of Wyatt's savage kick,sending him reeling and sputtering blood across the floor.



Though Wyatt's features remained calm,the cold fury burning in his eyes was unmistakable. Hauling Jaxton upright by his shirt, he slammed his fist squarely into Jaxton's face.



Amelia snapped out of her daze when Jaxton's agonized howl echoed in the room. She scrambled upright, tugging her clothes into place as she staggered to Wyatt's side. Grabbing his sleeve,she said, "That's enough."



Afraid he might harm her in his rage, Wyatt halted instantly. He looked at her with something dark in his gaze. "You are still defending him?"


That accusation took her by surprise. Once his misunderstanding registered, she shook her head quickly. "I'm not defending him. I just don't want you to get yourself into trouble over him."


Wyatt's hard stare softened just a touch. Even then,his grip never loosened on Jaxton's shirt. "He laid a hand on you. He deserves every bit of this."


A shudder crept down his spine when he imagined what might have happened if he'd been a moment late. His glare at Jaxton grew even more lethal.


Amelia spotted that dangerous look and hurried to speak. "Don't do this. It'll only dirty your hands. He's not worth it."



By then, Jaxton was reduced to a trembling heap.When Wyatt finally released him,he crumpled to the floor like a broken doll.



"Get him out of here. Dump him back to the Morrison family." Wyatt's bodyguards had been listening from the hallway,but had they kept their distance since Jaxton posed no threat.



Once Wyatt issued his command, the two bodyguards moved without delay and hauled Jaxton away.


With Jaxton gone, Wyatt turned to Amelia, wanting to rush her to the hospital. She insisted, though, that a shower came first.



Haunted by what she had just endured, Amelia felt filthy all over. She even wanted to throw away the clothes she was wearing.



Wyatt stood sentry at the bathroom door after she went in. "I'm not going anywhere. Call out if you start feeling sick," he said.



Except for a mild dizziness, Amelia didn't notice any other discomfort. The shower passed without trouble.


When she emerged, her gaze landed on the mess of vegetables and fruit scattered near the entrance-a reminder of Wyatt's errand. She started to pick them up, only to have Wyatt intercept her hand."Leave it.Someone else will take care of it."



Once she settled into the passenger seat of Wyatt's car, he handed her some bread and a bottle of warm milk. Nothing about the food appealed to her,but Wyatt's worried glance tugged at her. Reluctantly, she accepted them.



Peeling back the wrapper of the bread, Amelia's mnind wandered. She remembered that Wyatt had skipped breakfast as well. Glancing at the bread, she turned to him with concern. "Do you want some,too?"



Wyatt gave a simple nod, and Amelia broke off a generous chunk, holding it out to him. Rather than take it, he just parted his lips, waiting expectantly.


Amelia's cheeks grew warm at his gesture.


"I can't juggle eating and driving at the same time.Would you feed me, Amelia?" His words left her uncertain for a moment, but she soon obliged, lifting the bread to his mouth.


The bread was sweet, and although Wyatt wasn't fond of such flavor, he surprisingly didn't mind this time.


Soon, the car rolled to a stop outside Kretol City Hospital.



Marc waited for them at the entrance, already tipped off by Wyatt's message. Watching Wyatt hop out,open the door for Amelia, and guide her gently, Marc raised his brows in disbelief. Was this really the same Wyatt he knew? Wyatt gave Marc a quick, annoyed look as he saw his teasing expression. "What are you waiting for? Get inside and do your job."


A single glance at Amelia told Marc that she wasn't badly hurt. Yet the sight of Wyatt's unease was enough to hurry him along as he led them through the doors.



Outside in the morning air, Amelia felt fine, but inside the elevator, dizziness hit her like a wave.



Wyatt,who watched her every move, wasted no time to act. As soon as she pressed her hand to her head,his arm circled her waist protectively, steadying her."Are you feeling all right?"


"Just a bit dizzy," she admitted softly.


Marc had meant to head to his office with them, but hearing that, he changed course and brought them straight to the neurology department.


Although a specialist was already inside,Marc joined the examination since he saw how worried Wyatt looked.



Wyatt paced outside, unable to peel his eyes away from the closed door. The instant it opened, he rushed forward. 
"Is she okay?"



Though Wyatt was asking Marc the question, the doctor responded first, his tone reassuring,"No need to worry. She's only got a mild concussion. A little rest, and she'll be back to normal."



"Are you sure it's nothing serious? Is it normal to feel dizzy all the time with just a mild concussion?Did you check everything?" Wyatt said,still concerned.
###Chapter 95 What Have You Done This Time
Wyatt's doubt made Marc let out a laugh tinged with annoyance.


He was an acclaimed doctor with a world-class reputation, yet here he was, getting second-guessed by his own friend. The whole exchange left him feeling humiliated.



With anyone else, Marc would have had no patience for such distrust. Security might have been called, but for Wyatt, he could only swallow his annoyance and say, "There's nothing more to check. If you're still not convinced, you're welcome to keep her here for observation.Professionally,though-"


"We'll stay for observation," Wyatt interjected, not giving Marc a chance to finish speaking.



Marc,ever the professional,hid his irritation at Wyatt's interruption behind an eye roll and got to work arranging Amelia's admission.



Once they reached the VIP ward on the top floor,Marc leaned closer and shot Wyatt a sly grin. "Just married, and you've already landed your bride in the hospital? That's one way to start the honeymoon!" Before the teasing could go any further, Marc caught the warning chill in Wyatt's glare. He straightened at once.


He quickly shifted gears. "Anyway, looks like I've got another patient waiting. I'll leave now."


He slipped away, not waiting for a reply, leaving Wyatt and Amelia alone in the room.



Wyatt wasted no time. He helped Amelia get settled on the bed, asking if she needed a drink or something to eat.



The care he showed her caught Amelia off guard.After a moment's pause, she murmured, "Wyatt, Dr.Chapman said I'm fine. I can handle things on my own.You don't have to stay here. Maybe you should head back to the company."


Having worked at Wyatt's side, Amelia was aware of how full his schedule always was. Watching him fuss over her filled her with guilt.



Wyatt noticed the look in her eyes and tilted his head."Is all this attention making you uneasy?"


She shook her head, hands waving in protest, and met his questioning gaze."It's not that. I just don't want to keep you from your work." Her words caught him off guard, but then, Wyatt let out a low chuckle. "There are tens of thousands of people working at the Stewart Group. If they really needed me for everything, I'd be running in circles.What would be the point of having all those employees then?"


Amelia couldn't hold back a laugh of her own at his words.



Seeing her finally relax, Wyatt added, "For the next few days, I'll stay by your side. Work can wait. You mean more to me than any work."


That gentle promise eased the knot of guilt inside her.


Having been tense all morning, Amelia finally relaxed and started feeling sleepy.



Wyatt caught her sleepy yawn and said, "Go ahead and get some rest if you're feeling tired."



"What about you?"



"Once you're asleep, I'll get some rest in the nearby room."



Sleep overtook Amelia soon. Wyatt waited for her breathing to steady before stepping out into the small living room. With his phone glowing in his hand,he quietly opened the suite door.



Waiting in the hallway, Davin was holding Wyatt's laptop, while the driver hauled in bags of essentials.


After unloading the supplies and departing, the driver left Davin to his report. "Every company you mentioned has been informed. The Morrison Group's stocks will begin tumbling in two hours."


"Keep an eye on things. I want the Morrison Group erased from Kretol within seventy-two hours."



A chill prickled Davin's skin at the command. He had expected Wyatt to teach the Morrisons a lesson, not ruin them entirely.


Still, he felt no sympathy, as Jaxton's actions had been out of line.



With business matters covered, Davin shifted his attention.He asked about Amelia. Once Wyatt assured him that she was safe, Davin let out a long breath of relief.



Amelia would recover, but others would not be as lucky.





Acting on Wyatt's orders, the bodyguards had dragged Jaxton straight to the front steps of the Morrison estate. The staff inside erupted in panic, scrambling for an ambulance and shouting for Laura.



When Laura and Santos finally rushed into the hospital, their eyes fell on Jaxton, battered and bloody. Laura nearly fainted at the sight. Relief only came once a doctor promised Jaxton's life was out of danger.



The worst had passed, but Jaxton was left with serious wounds. The ribs he had broken before were shattered again. A jagged piece of bone had torn into his lung Fresh wounds marked his head and chest. He looked beaten and frail.



Laura refused to leave her son's side, but Santos wasted no time. He dug into the backgrounds of the men who brought Jaxton in and discovered their connection to Wyatt. Anger boiling,he stormed into Jaxton's hospital room.



He fixed Laura with an accusing glare as she sat on the sofa."What have you done this time?"
###Chapter 96 Disgraceful


Laura's eyes flashed with fear for just a second before she managed to steady herself.


"What do you mean by that? Our son's been hurt,and instead of finding out who did this, you're confronting me?"



For more than two decades, Santos and Laura had shared a life together. He could read her in ways no one else could.



He only needed to meet her gaze to sense that something wasn't right. Cold suspicion tightened his features. "So you're still hiding the truth? Will you only admit it after Jaxton is completely ruined? Wyatt sent those two bodyguards."



Hearing Wyatt's name, Laura could no longer hide her panic.



Pressed by Santos' relentless questions, she finally broke down and confessed to sending Jaxton to propose to Amelia.



The confession made Santos feel the room spin.Before he could unleash his anger, a sharp groan echoed from the hospital bed. Immediately, both Santos and Laura turned their attention to Jaxton. "Jaxton, can you hear us? Are you alright?"



Pain radiated through Jaxton's entire body now that the anesthesia had faded. Recalling what had happened, he cried out, "Call the police! I want to press charges for what they did to me;l-"



Clayton burst into the room before Jaxton could finish speaking,his entrance drawing the focus of everyone inside.



Annoyance flashed in Laura's eyes. "Is there a reason you're barging in? Don't you know that Jaxton just got out of surgery?"


Clayton paid Laura no mind. He faced Santos instead."Mr. Morrison, our stock pice keeps dropping. Several of our oldest partners have just terminated their contracts with us."



Santos nearly collapsed from the shock, and Clayton rushed over to steady him.



Steadying himself, Santos stared across the room at Jaxton, who was sprawled on the bed. "Tell me what you did, and do not lie."


The storm in Jaxton's face vanished, replaced by a rigid calm. But then, fury soon crept into his gaze. "Wyatt is behind this. I know it is him!"


Despite barely knowing Wyatt, Santos recognized the man's reputation. Wyatt wouldn't seek revenge for no reason, so Santos pressed on for answers.



Jaxton had always managed to fool Laura, but his fear of Santos ran deep. So eventually, he told him what he had done.



As soon as he finished speaking, Santos struck him sharply across the face. "How did I end up with such a disgrace for a son?"


Laura started to step forward to intervene, but the fury burning in Santos' eyes made her pull back. In a low voice, she said, "Hitting him now won't fix anything. We need to focus on finding a wvay out of this mess."



"What can I do after what he's done? There's no excusing something so disgraceful."


"There's always a way to fix things! The only option left is to talk to Amelia. If she decides to let it slide,maybe we'll survive this."



"Can you honestly stand before Amelia after everything that's happened?" Santos interrupted, his voice laced with heavy sarcasm.



The comment left Laura momentarily stunned. Still, she clung to her argument and retorted, "Sure, Jaxton made mistakes, but they've already made him suffer enough. Why do they have to keep pushing?"



The mocking glint in Santos' eyes grew more intense,prompting Laura to play her strongest card. "You realize the Morrison Group isn't just a name, right?Hundreds rely on us for their livelihoods. If the business collapses, all those people will be out of work."



Just as Santos understood Laura, Laura also knew him well. She knew what to say to make him change his mind.



By the time the clock struck two, both of them had reached the entrance to Amelia's hospital room.Before they could even approach, Wyatt's bodyguards blocked their path.



Earlier that day, Amelia had gotten the rest she needed, and after lunch, Wyatt had insisted she lie down while he worked nearby.



While the two were talking, a bodyguard knocked to announce that Santos and Laura wanted to speak with Amelia and apologize.


Wyatt's face clouded over in an instant.Subconsciously,he wanted to have them thrown out,but remembering Amelia's previous attitude towards Santos, he asked her softly, "Do you want to see them?If not, I'll make them leave right now."


She thought it over for a heartbeat, then nodded. "Let them come in."



Amelia knew too well that Laura's stubborn streak would only grow stronger if she kept refusing to meet.Laura would probably drag the Stewart Group into the mess if she refused to see them.



When the bodyguards escorted Santos and Laura into the room, the pair spotted Amelia and Wyatt seated side by side on the sofa.



The sight sent Laura's temper rising.


Amelia, who had always treated her with nothing but courtesy, now acted as if she didn't owe her an ounce of respect since the engagement ended.


Resentment flashed in Laura's eyes, betraying her thoughts.



Wyatt noticed her sour look, and his stare sharpened."You said you came here to apologize. Is that really the attitude you should have?"
###Chapter 97 | Won't Allow Anyone To Harm You
Laura arrived with the intention of offering an apology to Amelia, but pride tied her tongue.



When the room grew quiet, Santos broke the silence and stepped forward. "Amelia, I am sorry. It's my fault for not raising my son well."



Amelia knew she could not simply forget what Jaxton had done, yet she knew she had also hurt him. Maybe,in their own way,they were even. 2



So,the moment Santos finished speaking, she met his gaze and answered him without hesitation, "Santos,this isn't on you. Jaxton made his own decisions. You shouldn't have to take the fall for his mistakes."



His cheeks grew hot at her words, but with the staff depending on him, he gathered his resolve and glanced over at the man settled on the sofa. "Mr.Stewart, I hope you'll show some mercy to the Morrison Group."



Unaware of Wyatt's quiet maneuvering against the Morrisons, Amelia instinctively looked over at Wyatt for answers. Picking up on her curiosity, Wyatt leaned closer and told her about his actions against the Morrison Group.


Suddenly,it dawned on Amelia why Santos and Laura had turned up at her door. The realization made her gaze turn mocking. Just then, a gentle heat blossomed in her palm.



"I won't allow anyone to harm you. Those who do will pay dearly." Wyatt clasped her hand, making it plain where his loyalties lay.



For the first time in ages, Amelia let herself bask in affection. Wyatt's promise settled around her heart like a soft blanket.


Even though marriage bound them together, their union was still a secret from the world. Without thinking, she tried to slip her hand free, but his grip only tightened.



Across the room, Laura and Santos watched them with conflicted feelings. The air between them grew thick with questions neither dared to ask aloud.


After weighing his words, Santos finally spoke up. "Mr.Stewart, the Flynn family might not have your influence, but they are still a respected family.Amelia is Mr. Flynn's daughter, and I'd ask you not to embarrass her like this in front of everyone." Both Santos and Ricky suspected that Wyatt's interest in Amelia was only due to her beauty, thinking he was not serious about being with her.



Something in his defense softened Amelia's stance towards Santos.When Wyatt noticed that, the frost in his eyes began to thaw, but he still said to Santos coldly, "Whatever happens between Amelia and me is none of your business. The Morrison Group situation stands as it is. Jaxton has made his choices, and as his family, it's up to you to clean up the mess he left behind."



"Mr. Stewart, I haven't come here to beg for myself or Jaxton," Santos said.



Wyatt was about to ask them to leave by raising his hand,but Santos' words stopped him short,making him withdraw his hand. The bodyguards standing at the entrance quietly stepped aside.



Wyatt's expression didn't go unnoticed, and Santos hurried to make his case. "There are thousands of people working for the Morrison Group, most with families to feed. If the company falIs apart, their lives will unravel in an instant."



Years spent navigating corporate battles had made Wyatt a master at reading people, and he recognized the sincerity in Santos' tone. Having studied business management at university,Amelia grasped the full weight of what Santos had said. She knew how quickly a company's downfall could ripple out to hurt countless employees.



A gentle touch from Amelia landed on Wyatt's hand,prompting him to meet her eyes. In a soft, measured tone, she said, "Let's end the matter here. Jaxton's mistakes shouldn't affect innocent people."



Worry crept in after she spoke. He had done everything for her sake, yet here she was, seeming to take the opposing side.


Her anxiousness didn't linger long before his reply broke the tension. "Since Amelia is saying that,I'll let this go. But Mr. Morrison, I want you to accept one term."



Relief flickered across Santos' face for just a moment before he asked, "What is it?"



"Jaxton needs to step down as the CEO. With someone like him running things, the Morrison Group will end up in ruins eventually," Wyatt replied.


Laura looked ready to protest, but Santos' sharp look kept her silent.


Santos didn't share Laura's frustration. Instead, he kept his composure because he understood Wyatt's  point. Jaxton had neither the temperament nor the talent to lead a company.


His mind made up, Santos nodded his agreement.


In a sudden gesture, Santos took out a card and set it gently on the table before Amelia. "This is ten million dollars, Amelia. Please accept it as my way of saying sorry."


Ten million was a generous offer, especially given how much strain the Morrison Group's finances were under.


Laura wanted to say something to protest, but she stayed quiet when she saw Amelia hand the card back.



"Santos, your kindness means a lot to me, but I'd rather you kept the money. I want nothing further to do with Jaxton," she said.



Accepting the money would only complicate things,and she had no intention of letting that happen.


Santos understood exactly what Amelia meant, so he let the matter drop and instead offered a quiet reassurance. "He won't trouble you again. That's my promise."
###Chapter 98 Leave Him Immediately
The thought of spending another whole day in a hospital room grated on Amelia. She insisted on leaving that night, but Wyatt's concern kept her there for a little longer. They compromised, agreeing she would stay under observation until morning



By sunrise, she was already urging Wyatt to head back to his company. Though hesitant to leave her side, he finally gave in when Davin called, mentioning an urgent meeting that required his presence.


Just before he stepped out, Wyatt promised Amelia he'd be back as soon as the meeting ended.



As soon as he was gone, Amelia reached for her phone and started going through her work messages.The peace shattered when raised voices filtered in from the corridor, signaling an argument outside her door.



Wyatt had specifically assigned two bodyguards to make sure Amelia had complete privacy during her recovery.


Curiosity got the better of Amelia, and she made her way to the door. "Barrie, this isn't my decision. Mr. Conroy Stewart himself ordered it. Even Mr. Wyatt Stewart couldn't countermand his wishes."



Barrie Welch was the leader of Wyatt's security detail.The man challenging him was Doug Lyons, Conroy Stewart's long-serving steward.


Although Doug's status carried weight, Barrie's resolve was unwavering."Mr. Wyatt Stewart is the only person I answer to. Without his go-ahead, no one's taking Mrs. Stewart anywhere."


Doug's eyes narrowed with disapproval, yet he didn't argue. Instead, he signaled to the guards who'd come with him.



With Doug's men stepping forward, Barrie shifted his weight,ready to fight.


Tension mounted, only to be broken by Amelia's clear command from inside. "Stop!"



"Mrs.Stewart?"



At the sound of Amelia's voice, Barrie and his men straightened and offered her a respectful greeting,while Doug studied her carefully.



Doug took a moment, then delivered his message to Amelia. "Mr. Conroy Stewart has requested your  presence.Please come with us to Stewart Mansion."


"Of course. I'll just get changed and join you."


Doug's eyebrows shot up, taken aback by her willingness to go. He had expected her to refuse.


Barrie,meanwhile, looked worried. "Mrs. Stewart, MMr.Wyatt Stewart said you were not to leave our protection. Are you sure-"


"It's alright. I trust Mr. Lyons and his men will keep me safe," Amelia said.



She then glanced at Doug, her expression seeming to say, "Isn't that right?"



Seeing her confident demeanor, Doug suddenly understood why Wyatt chose to marry Amelia.


He nodded and said, "Of course."


Their visit was all about escorting her to Stewart Mansion, not harming her. No one in the Steward household dared to hurt someone Wyatt cared about.


Once she finished changing, Amelia allowed Doug and his men to escort her to Stewart Mansion. As she walked away, Barrie wasted no time calling Wyatt with the news. Stewart Mansion.



Amelia always knew the Stewart family carried a legacy of power and wealth, but the grand estate towering before her exceeded all expectations. The place seemed almost like a castle pulled from a storybook.


Even though nerves stirred beneath the surface,Amelia carried herself with quiet composure.



Doug stayed by her side, quietly impressed by how well she handled herself in such a situation.



Years of loyal service to the Stewarts had exposed Doug to many women of wealth,but not one of them,in his mind, rivaled the quiet grace Amelia displayed.



Doug led Amelia to the garden, where Amelia spotted the elderly man seated in the pavilion from a distance.


Dressed in white, Conroy appeared almost plain at first glance, yet as Amelia drew closer, she felt a commanding force radiating from him.



"Mr.Stewart,Amelia is here," Doug announced before stepping aside.



Conroy's sharp gaze turned immediately to her,scanning Amelia from head to toe.  His scrutiny was far more intense than Doug's, causing Amelia to feel a twinge of nervousness.


"Are you any good at making coffee?" he questioned.


Amelia's attention drifted to the polished stone table,where a coffee set had already been arranged.


Michelle had given her plenty of tips about brewing coffee. While she couldn't call herself a master, she was confident the coffee she made was better than most professionals'.


Amelia flashed a quick smile at him and answered,"I've learned it before."



Without offering any more words, Conroy simply motioned for her to sit across from him.



Once she had washed her hands, Amelia settled into the seat and started preparing the coffee.


Both Conroy and Doug watched her, quickly realizing she knew what she was doing.


The scent of freshly brewed coffee soon drifted through the pavilion. Amelia placed a cup of coffee in front of Conroy and said, "Please have a taste."


Conroy picked up the cup and tasted her coffee, his eyes instantly lighting up. However,remembering why he had called Amelia here,he put the cup down without a word.


"So? How is it?"she asked.



Though he wanted to brush off her efforts, Conroy had to admit the taste was impressive. He replied flatly, "It's alright."


With Conroy falling silent, Amelia chose not to add anything else.


A moment passed before Conroy broke the silence."I've looked into who you are. You are not good enough for Wyatt. Leave him immediately."
###Chapter 99 | Know She's The One For Me
When Conroy spoke, Amelia chose silence, keeping her face unreadable.


She had braced herself for this, so his sharp words failed to catch her off guard.


After all, every bit he said rang with truth. She was nowhere near Wyatt's league-her situation and background couldn't even begin to measure up.


Conroy studied her with a hint of curiosity. He did not expect to find such poise. For someone of her standing, she carried herself with unusual grace. If only she came from a better family, he might have thought her worthy of Wyatt.


"Go ahead and divorce Wyatt. The Stewart family will see to it that you receive five hundred million as compensation," he said.


At first, he had planned to offer a much smaller sum,but Amelia's composure swayed him.



The mention of divorce made Amelia frown. After a moment, she answered, "I'm sorry, but I can't agree to your terms." Her marriage to Wyatt rested on an agreement. If she proposed a divorce now, it would be betraying a promise. Wyatt had done too much for her. She couldn't do something like this.


Disappointment flickered in Conroy's face, replacing his earlier patience.


"I thought you had a decent character, but it seems l was wrong. Clearly, half a billion is nothing to you when you know the value of Wyatt's assets far exceeds it. Why don't you just say your price? Unless it's something outlandish, I'm willing to agree."


"It's not about money, Mr. Stewart," she said. Amelia wanted him to understand that her reasons for marrying Wyatt were never about wealth, but she could see doubt clouding his eyes.


Without waiting, he pressed on, his voice cold."From what I gather,your family business isn't faring well. Are you prepared to watch the Flynn Group collapse just to hold onto Wyatt?"


The moment he realized she would not be bought,Conroy changed tactics, wielding the threat of ruin like a weapon. He knew the Flynn Group would never survive his attack.



Amelia's eyes grew sharp at that."Wyatt won't allow you to do something like that." "Oh,so you want to use Wyatt to pressure me?" Every trace of warmth left Conroy's voice. For a moment,Amelia felt resigned.


She wished to avoid offending Conroy, yet she could not let the company her mother built fall apart.


While she struggled to find the right words to say,she heard footsteps rush toward the pavilion from outside.


When she glanced up, Wyatt appeared, his eyes as cold as winter, striding straight toward them.


Wyatt walked into the pavilion with every bit of his attention locked on her. Amelia's calm demeanor caught his eye and gradually softened the steel in his gaze. "Did anything happen to you?"


Relief washed over her as soon as he appeared. She was ready to tell him everything was fine, but before she could speak, Conroy's fury boiled over. "Wyatt!You abandoned your responsibilities at the Stewart Group for her? How could you do that?"


"If you hadn't forced her here behind my back, I wouldn't have had to leave the meeting at all," Wyatt said coldly


Conroy had arranged for Doug to bring Amelia over at this time, knowing Wyatt had an important meeting at work. Never had Conroy imagined Wyatt would walk away from his responsibilities just to save Amelia.


This fed the anger burning in Conroy's chest. He stared at Wyatt. "Since you're both here now-go and get a divorce!"


"That's never going to happen. I won't divorce her,"Wyatt said.



"Are you really defying me on purpose?"


Conroy snatched a cup from the table and hurled it toward Wyatt. Wyatt did not budge, but Amelia reacted on instinct and yanked him out of harm's way.Because of this, the cup crashed into Jaycob,who had just hurried over.


After spending time in the hospital, Jaycob had only come to watch the drama after he had heard that Amelia had been summoned here. The last thing he expected was to get struck before he even had a chance to see what was happening.


Without wasting a moment, Doug signaled a servant and asked her to fetch some ice.



Watching Jaycob wince, Amelia felt a sting of guilt;she had not meant for him to get caught in the crossfire. Aware he had shielded Wyatt by accident, Jaycob shot Wyatt a resentful look. "I'm not here to lecture you,but do you think you can bear the consequences if you keep provoking Grandpa? He is old, and his health is at stake!"



He wore an expression that made it clear he took some pleasure in Wyatt's trouble, while Wyatt regarded his chest with a detached look. "It seems like your injuries healed fast."



"You..."



Conroy took in the heated exchange, unable to support one side over the other since they were both his family. He stayed silent, watching their squabble play out.



Once his temper had cooled, Conroy's voice dropped to a softer note. "Wyatt, I don't want to be harsh. But Amelia's family isn't well-off, and she's not a match for you."



"Nobody else gets to decide if Amelia is right for mne.I know she's the one for me," Wyatt said firmly.


"How could you..."


Before Conroy could finish speaking, he coughed.Doug reached for Marc's prescribed medicine in a hurry. Seeing this, Amelia gently tugged Wyatt's sleeve.When his eyes met hers, she quietly shook her head.


If Conroy fell ill from anger now, both she and Wyatt would be on the receiving end of the Stewart family's outrage.


She could endure the consequences herself, but she would never let Wyatt take the fall with her.
###Chapter 100 | Owe You An Apology After taking the medication,Conroy quickly recovered,yet the anger burning in his eyes stayed fixed on Wyatt. He snapped, "Were you planning to give me a heart attack just now?"



Wyatt felt Amelia's reassuring presence beside him.Standing his ground, he replied in a measured tone,"Grandpa, do you really want me to follow the same path as my father?"


A heavy silence fell. Regret flickered in Conroy's eyes,mingling with something unspoken.


Wyatt waited a beat. When Conroy said nothing,he reached for Amelia's hand and guided her toward the exit. "Let's go."



"Grandpa, you're really letting them walk away just like that?" Jaycob voiced his dissatisfaction as he watched the two figures retreating.



Conroy's sharp eyes caught every hint of Jaycob's intention. He barked in irritation, "Don't think I can't see straight through what you are thinking."


Without waiting for a reply, he waved Jacob away in  irritation. "Get out of my sight. I have no patience left for you today."



With no choice left, Jaycob strode out of the pavilion,fished his phone from his pocket, and dialed a number.


It took a while for the person on the other end of the line to pick up. A clear woman's voice answered,"Why are you calling me?"



"Wyatt got married."



"What did you just say?"


The woman's voice grew sharp with urgency. Jaycob's eyes flashed with cunning as he replied, "Just figured you ought to hear it from me first, since we've known each other so long. I am being good to you, right?Just don't-"



She ended the call before he could finish.



Staring at the disconnected phone, Jaycob wasn't upset; a smile even appeared on his face.


Meanwhile,Amelia followed Wyatt across the lot and caught sight of Barrie, who looked anxious.



"After today, you're fired. Don't bother coming back to work," Wyatt said to Barrie.


Barrie was about to open the car door for them and  froze when he heard that. His face fell. He looked like he wanted to defend himself, but before he could do that, Amelia spoke up. "Barrie's not at fault. I was the one who insisted on going with Doug."


Amelia met Wyatt's deep gaze. Though her nerves prickled,she held her head high. "We just got married,and your grandfather wanted to meet me. As your wife, it wouldn't be right for me to refuse him. That might affect your reputation."


"I couldn't care less about what people think of me,"Wyatt said.


"You might not care about that, but I do! I can't stand hearing people say bad things about you."



For Amelia, things were simple. Now that she was married to Wyatt, she believed she owed it to him to shield his reputation.



Usually, Wyatt rarely changed his mind once he made a decision, but he was willing to do it for Amelia.



Noticing her gentle resolve, he finally softened. He said to Barrie, "Don't let something like this happen again!"


Relief washed over Amelia as she realized Wyatt had decided not to fire Barrie. She tossed a look in Barrie's direction. "Well, what are you waiting for? Thank your boss now!" Smart as ever, Barrie picked up on the reason behind Wyatt's forgiveness. A bright grin spread across his face."Thank you,Mr. Stewart. And also thank you, Mrs.Stewart."



If Amelia hadn't spoken on his behalf, Barrie was certain his days with the Stewarts would have ended right then.


Soon, the car eased past the gates of the Stewart Mansion.



Inside the car, Wyatt brought up a new concern."Your apartment isn't secure enough. If you don't like Hillside Villa, we can get another place as our new home."



That suggestion left Amelia torn. Normally, she would have refused, but the incident earlier made her rethink.After weighing her options, she said, "There's no need to buy a different house. I'll move into Hillside Villa."



After a pause, she quickly added, "Barrie can go back with me to pack up my things. You should head straight to the company."


Wyatt felt a quiet thrill at her choice. The thought of her living at Hillside Villa made him happy, and he readily accept her arrangement.


Barrie first drove Wyatt to the office, then took Amelia back to her apartment.



During the drive to Amelia's apartment, Barrie's gratitude surfaced again. "Mrs. Stewart, thank you for speaking up for me earlier."



Embarrassment colored Amelia's cheeks. "You shouldn't be thanking me. My decision dragged you into this. Really, I owe you an apology. I'm sorry."



Years of working for Wyatt had shaped Barrie.When assigned to watch over Amelia, he hesitated at first,uncertain how it would go.


At first, he'd assumed working for a woman would only mean more trouble. But now, he was happy that he was working for her.


After the car pulled to a stop in front of the entrance,they both stepped out. Just then, a sudden movement caught their attention. Someone rushed toward Amelia, and Barrie didn't hesitate. He stepped in front of her, arms out to protect her.
