###Chapter 1
I never expected my usually quiet and reserved son to do such a thing with my intimate clothing.

It made me blush and tremble all over.

How did my son become so corrupted?

...

Late at night, I got up to use the bathroom and noticed the light was still on in my son's room.

With only a month left until his SAT exams, was he staying up late to study?

I felt a wave of relief. It was worth quitting my job to be a full-time mom, all for him to achieve good results.

I slowly approached his door, intending to remind him to rest early and not overwork himself.

But then I heard heavy breathing.

Through the crack in the door, I saw my son lying on his side, holding a dark object in his hand, sniffing it intensely.

His eyes were fixed on the iPad propped on his nightstand, playing an explicit adult film.

His intoxicated expression and suggestive look reminded me of the creeps from those adult movies.

My cheeks burned. As an adult, I knew exactly what he was doing.

A few seconds later, it sank in. My son was 18, a grown man, with increasingly strong desires.

That dark object looked more and more like the clothes I had just changed out of...

A deep sense of shame washed over me. I felt both angry and helpless.

I knew what he was doing was wrong, but with his SATs so close, exposing his privacy would humiliate him and affect his studies.

I stood frozen, torn between confronting him and walking away.

The next moment, my son weakly set aside the underwear, looking satisfied, and turned off the light.

My heart raced. I stumbled back to my bedroom in a daze.

Lying in bed, I tossed and turned, overwhelmed with worry about my son.

He had always been well-behaved and sensible. How did he suddenly develop such a bad habit?

I barely slept that night. The next morning, I went to my son's room and found he had already left for school.

I made up my mind to gently address the issue that evening.

Young people these days don't know moderation. If he stayed up late indulging in such filthy habits, it would harm his health and ruin his exam performance. I would be devastated.

But discussing such a private topic between mother and son was awkward, especially given our different genders.

I spent the whole day restless. After preparing dinner, I anxiously waited for my son to return.

Finally, evening came. I was nervous, rehearsing what to say in my head repeatedly, worried about miscommunicating with him.

I wanted my son to quit this bad habit no matter what, not just for his studies but for his health.

But by 7 PM, he still wasn't home. I grew more anxious and irritable.

He usually returned much earlier. Where could he be today?
###Chapter 2

I was lost in these thoughts when a sudden knock interrupted me.

Assuming it was Jacob returning home, I hurried to open the door. Instead, I found Ryan Evans, his friend, standing there.

Ryan carried himself with a maturity beyond his eighteen years. He was tall and broad-shouldered, wearing a white tank top that stretched over his well-defined chest muscles.

A faint scent of sweat clung to him, radiating a raw, hormonal energy.

My heart fluttered unexpectedly. My son's friend was certainly… robust.

Ryan’s gaze was fixed on my camisole, his Adam's apple bobbing as he swallowed hard.

The sound snapped me back to reality. I quickly adjusted my top. "Ryan, what brings you by?" I asked politely.

He scratched his head, appearing earnest. "Mrs. Lowell, I came to ask Jacob for help with a difficult problem."

I didn't doubt him. Jacob and Ryan often helped each other with schoolwork. I invited him in.

"Jacob isn't home yet. Please, have a seat. Let me get you some fruit," I said.

I walked into the kitchen, acutely aware of a heated gaze following my movements.

Just as I returned with the fruit, Jacob arrived home. He carried a black bag and, without a word, hurried straight to his bedroom.

I was about to scold him for his rudeness when Ryan stopped me. "Mrs. Lowell, doesn't Jacob seem… off to you?"

His thick fingers brushed against my waist as he spoke. The warm, accidental contact sent a shiver through me.

"R-Ryan… You think so too?" I asked, looking up at him.

His breathing seemed heavier. My own knees felt weak.

What was wrong with me? Reacting this way to a boy just out of high school.

Jacob emerged from his room, pulling me from my thoughts.

He looked pale and exhausted, but he forced a smile and greeted Ryan.

They launched into a conversation about schoolwork, video games, and anime.

Soon, Ryan brought up a new topic. "Jacob, I heard there's a well-known art teacher at school. Mr. Anderson. He has a few early admission spots to Ivy League schools. If you could get one, you wouldn't have to worry about the SATs at all."

Jacob's eyes lit up briefly, then dimmed. "I don't have any artistic talent. That kind of opportunity isn't for me."

I memorized every word of their exchange. I desperately wanted Jacob to succeed, to get into a top university. It would honor his late father.

After Ryan asked Jacob a few more questions about homework, he prepared to leave. I invited him to stay for dinner, but he firmly declined.

Such a shy young man.

At the dinner table, I studied Jacob closely. My heart ached. The dark circles under his eyes were pronounced, like a panda's. He clearly wasn't sleeping well.

I cautiously broached the subject of relationships.

His face immediately darkened. He pushed his food around his plate, then put his fork down. "I'm going to take a shower, Mom."

The sound of running water soon came from the bathroom. A sudden thought struck me, and I panicked. My freshly changed clothes were still in the laundry basket. Would he…?

Lately, Jacob's behavior had become increasingly strange. Where did he get that iPad he used to watch adult films last night?

Why was he home so late today? What was in that mysterious black bag he carried so secretively?

I glanced at the bathroom door. He would be a while. Driven by curiosity, I turned the knob to his bedroom door.

After some searching, I found the black bag hidden under his bed.

He hid it so well. It had to be something bad.

My heart pounded like a thief's, but I couldn't stop myself. I opened the bag.

Inside were brand new, unopened personal items. Among them was a uniquely shaped… adult toy.

Heat rushed to my face. My son bought this after school? Did he really need more?

If this continued, his… habits would only become more frequent. The SATs were in a month. Could his body handle this?
###Chapter 3

Suddenly I heard the bathroom door open.

I quickly put the toy away and shoved it under the bed.

I hurried out the door.

That's when I noticed my son Jacob looked uneasy.

He couldn't even meet my eyes.

I asked with concern, "Jacob, what's wrong?"

He didn't say a word.

He rushed back to his room and locked the door.

My suspicion grew stronger.

I froze for half a second.

Then I remembered something.

I hurried to the bathroom.

Sure enough, the clothes in the laundry basket were gone.

At that moment, I wanted to burst into his room and teach him a lesson.

But I recalled his uncooperative attitude at the dinner table.

I worried about hurting his self-esteem.

He might never be able to hold his head up in front of me again.

It could even leave psychological scars!

That night, I heard heavy breathing from Jacob's bedroom again.

It left a bitter taste in my mouth.

He must have been watching adult films to relieve himself.

If this continued, his grades would definitely suffer.

But scolding or hitting him wasn't the answer.

The more I thought about it, the more troubled I felt.

Half asleep, a sudden thought crossed my mind.

Ryan had mentioned an art teacher at school.

This teacher had several early admission spots to Ivy League schools.

If Jacob could get one of those spots...

This idea opened a new world for me.

My son must go to college.

He must attend an Ivy League school!

I had Ryan's number.

The next day I contacted him.

During his lunch break, I met him at a restaurant.

Ryan's heated gaze swept over my body.

I felt a flicker of pride.

I was almost forty, yet my charm remained undiminished.

Even young men were captivated by me.

But I hadn't forgotten my purpose today.

I said softly, "Ryan, yesterday you mentioned the art teacher has early admission spots. Is that true?"

Ryan's eyes burned with possessiveness.

He didn't even try to hide it.

Two shiny drops of saliva even dripped from the corner of his mouth.

He reached out with his rough hand and gripped my small one tightly.

"Aunt Sophia, you're so beautiful!"

Hearing this, my body trembled.

What was this kid trying to do?

Ryan suddenly stood up and hugged me from behind.

His chin rested on my shoulder.

He was breathing heavily, his hands roaming restlessly.

I felt goosebumps rising all over my skin.

The scent of this young man filled my nostrils.

It made my heart pound with temptation.

"What... what are you doing?" A strange thought crossed my mind.

Ryan was so tall and strong.

He was also my son's classmate.

A moment later, Ryan whispered, "Aunt Sophia, do you want the art teacher's contact information?"

His words snapped me back to reality.

A strange expression crossed my face.

Was this kid trying to blackmail me into being intimate with him?

He continued, "Aunt Sophia, you're truly gorgeous. I'll pursue you once I get into college."

"I've already sent the art teacher's number to your phone."

With that, he left.

My mind was in turmoil.

I had just been felt up by my son's classmate.

And he said he would pursue me.

But Ryan was a smart kid.

He had some boundaries.

He knew he shouldn't be distracted by such things before the SAT.

If he really did pursue me, should I accept?

The more I thought about it, the hotter I felt.

Eventually, my son would call Ryan Daddy...

Half an hour later, I finally calmed down.

Right now, whether Jacob could get into college was the top priority.
###Chapter 4
I dialed the art teacher's number. A rich baritone voice answered.

When he heard I was a student's mother, he fell silent for a few seconds.
"I know why you're calling," he said. "But you'll need to show sincerity. In this world, to gain something, you must give something in return."

I agreed immediately, assuming he wanted money.
My late husband had left me a few hundred thousand dollars in savings.
If it could secure Jacob's early admission to an Ivy League school, I was willing to spend every last cent.

He arranged to meet me at a country inn in the suburbs that evening.
He had been staying there for his plein air painting sessions.

Wanting to make a good impression, I rushed home to freshen up.

I changed into a tight bodycon dress that hugged my curves and accentuated my cleavage.
I didn't know if this would appeal to the art teacher, but for my son's sake, I had to try everything to secure that Ivy League spot.

At six sharp, I arrived at the inn.
It was quite remote, a good twenty miles from the city.

I knocked on the heavy iron gate.
Within seconds, a middle-aged man answered.

He had an ordinary face, but his gentle smile put me at ease.
"You must be Jacob's mother. Please, come in."

He handed me a black, lockable blindfold.
"I've been working on a series of blind contour drawings. Would you be willing to model for me?"

Since he was the art teacher, I agreed without hesitation.

He carefully fastened the blindfold over my eyes and locked it.
"Follow me, Mrs. Lowell."

I was nervous. The blindfold was specially designed—once it was on, I couldn't see a thing, just like being truly blind.

I knew how attractive I was.
If the teacher wanted something more from me, how could I refuse?

These thoughts made my face flush with heat.

His breathing grew heavier, and I felt his warm breath on my neck.
"Are you... feeling hot, sir?"

I heard him swallow hard.
"N-no, Mrs. Lowell. We're almost at the studio."

I hesitated for a moment. His voice sounded strange—almost familiar—though I was sure I'd never met him before.

He guided me to a stool and handed me a glass of water.
"Have a drink, Mrs. Lowell. It'll help you relax before we begin."

I took a small sip, trying to calm my nerves.

Almost instantly, a tingling sensation spread through my body.
The water had been drupped.

"Mrs. Lowell," he said, his voice husky. "Your skin is as smooth as a girl's, but you have the allure of a mature woman. You're exquisite."

I didn't understand what he meant. My head grew foggy, and I could only squirm helplessly.

His breathing became ragged.
"Mrs. Lowell, if you want Jacob to get that early admission, you'll need to..."

My rational mind said to refuse, but I was no longer in control.

I knew what was coming.

I hadn't been with a man since my husband died.
If this would secure Jacob's future, it would be worth it.

I convinced myself to stop resisting.

He seemed to sense my surrender and pressed me down.

But there was something familiar about him—a youthful energy.
Earlier, he had seemed like a middle-aged man.

I pushed the thought aside. Nothing else mattered in that moment.

Afterward, I blushed and asked, "When will you submit Jacob's early admission application?"

He held me close, stroking my hair.
"Mrs. Lowell, if you can satisfy me like this every time, that Ivy League spot will be Jacob's."
"This is a mutually beneficial arrangement."

My face burned even hotter. His implication was deeply embarrassing.

Truth be told, even without Jacob's future at stake, I would have wanted him.
He was a captivating man.

When I left the inn, my head was spinning and my legs felt weak.

But when I glanced back at the art teacher, he looked completely unaffected.
I had to admire his stamina.

Who would have thought such a lean man could possess such raw power?
###Chapter 5

It was already nine in the evening when I got home.

I saw my son Jacob slumped on the couch, his eyes glued to the iPad screen. He looked exhausted but unusually excited.

When he noticed me entering, he quickly turned off the iPad.

If I had to guess, Jacob was probably watching adult videos.

But I couldn’t bring it up directly, afraid of triggering his rebellious side.

I remembered that the results of his recent mock SAT should be out. I asked, "How did you do on the mock exam, Jacob?"

His face instantly darkened. "I messed up this time. Only scored a little over 400."

I wasn’t surprised. How could he do well when he stayed up every night obsessed with sexual fantasies?

His best scores usually hovered around 500, barely enough for a state university.

But now, an early admission to an Ivy League was within reach!

I didn’t scold him. Instead, I pulled him into a hug and comforted him gently. With the real exam approaching, his stress was mounting. I didn’t want him to feel discouraged.

"It’s okay, sweetie. This was just a practice test. As long as you perform well on the actual SAT, everything will be fine."

He breathed a sigh of relief when he saw I wasn’t angry and nodded.

Then I glanced at the iPad on the couch. "Jacob, where did you get this iPad?"

He said he borrowed it from a classmate for online courses.

If I hadn’t caught him watching those videos, I might have believed him.

Jacob had always been honest since he was little. He never used to lie. I never thought he would become like this.

But I held back from confronting him. As long as I kept trying, he could still get into an Ivy League.

That night, I noticed Jacob was again indulging himself with the iPad. But I had been cautious these past few days—I had hidden all my intimate wear where he couldn’t find it.

As I lay in bed, I had a vivid dream. In it, the art teacher intoxicated me, but when I woke up, all I could think about was Ryan Evans.

Why was I so fixated on my son’s friend? Was I inherently a cougar?

Early the next morning, the art teacher called me.

He asked me to come to the country inn earlier. He wanted to create another blindfolded art painting today.

I blushed instantly. How could he be thinking about such things in broad daylight?

The thrill sent hormones rushing through my body, making me feel like I was in my twenties again.

Jacob had just come out of the bathroom. He noticed my flushed face and asked with concern, "Mom, why is your face so red? Are you feeling unwell?"

I was mortified. My son had caught me fantasizing.

I brushed him off with some excuses, but he didn’t buy it. His eyes held an inexplicable gleam, as if he had seen right through me.

"Mom, are you trying to find me a dad?"

I froze. My usually reserved son was suddenly so perceptive. Of course, I denied it. "Don’t talk nonsense," I said with a forced laugh.

He didn’t press further, but he gave me a serious look and shook his head.

In that moment, my son felt both familiar and strange.

Eagerly, I put on a camisole and a miniskirt. I hadn’t worn such youthful clothes in years, but I dug them out to make a good impression on the art teacher.

Looking at myself in the mirror, I saw a woman with a curvaceous figure and skin as smooth as a peeled egg.

Time had left no trace on my face. Instead, it had made me more mature and alluring.

"Just you wait, Mr. Anderson. I’ll mesmerize you today!"

I arrived at the country inn at the agreed time. The art teacher was already waiting outside.

Today, I let go of my inhibitions. I convinced myself, "This is all for Jacob’s future. Any sacrifice is worth it."

I leaned in slightly toward the teacher.

"Mr. Anderson... I’m here."

As I spoke, I gave his hand a subtle squeeze.

To my surprise, my boldness made him blush. He stammered, "Mrs. Lowell, please put on the blindfold…"

I giggled. He hadn’t been shy yesterday. Why was he pretending to be innocent now?

I held him tightly and said, "Let’s go, then."

His hands trembled as he put the blindfold on me and guided me inside.

But then his true nature emerged. His hands roamed freely, expertly exploring my body like a seasoned lover.

A absurd thought crossed my mind. Mr. Anderson was different from other men. He only revealed his true self when the woman couldn’t see.

But none of that mattered. As long as he was satisfied, everything was fine.

That way, Jacob’s Ivy League admission would be secured.

During our intimacy, I once again caught the youthful scent on him. Though his movements were skilled, his impetuous energy was unmistakable.

A strange illusion took hold of me. This didn’t feel like the same man who had greeted me outside. But with the blindfold on, I couldn’t be sure.

The thought startled me.

But soon, I lost myself again, my mind going blank.

When we finished, my face was flushed. I studied the art teacher’s calm demeanor closely and finally noticed a clue.

The man I had been with had thick, coarse body hair that prickled my skin. But Mr. Anderson had very sparse body hair. They were not the same person!

I stood frozen, as if struck by lightning. Had I been tricked?

But I quickly collected myself. Now wasn’t the time to dwell on it. I needed to investigate and uncover the truth.

After leaving the country inn, I called Jacob’s homeroom teacher. I asked about the early admission policy to Ivy League schools through the art teacher. The teacher insisted the school had no such policy.

My emotions were in turmoil. Another suspicion grew in my mind.

When I got home, I found Jacob doing homework in his room. The iPad was still on the couch.

I glanced at his closed door, then quickly picked up the iPad and started browsing. It was filled with adult videos and selfies of Ryan Evans. The photos were dated months ago.

So, Ryan was the one who had lent the iPad to Jacob.

The more I thought about it, the more terrified I became. All of this…
###Chapter 6

He greeted me with a warm smile, radiating youthful energy.
His body was covered in thick hair, exactly like the art teacher I remembered.

"Aunt Sophia, what brings you here?"

His gaze was bolder than before, as if he already owned me.
This confirmed my suspicion—this young man was far too audacious!

Trembling, I asked, "Ryan, tell me the truth. Is Mr. Anderson’s early admission to the Ivy League real?"

He chuckled darkly, ignoring the public setting, and began touching me.
The warmth of his hands felt exactly as I remembered.

"Aunt Sophia, you figured it out already? I thought it would take you at least two weeks."

Humiliation and anger washed over me. It really was this little bastard!
I immediately pulled away and snapped, "Ryan Evans, this is a crime. I could send you to jail!"

He shrugged casually. "Aunt Sophia, I’m not afraid of jail. But if Jacob finds out about this…"
He pulled out his phone and showed me a video—of him and me together.

I nearly fainted. This vile creature didn’t just assault me—he recorded it for his own pleasure.

"Aunt Sophia, you’re so desperate to get Jacob into the Ivy League because he stole your underwear, right?"

Finally, everything clicked.
Ryan was behind it all. He corrupted my son, lent him the iPad, and encouraged him to steal my clothes.
Then he casually mentioned the art teacher’s early admission offer to lure me in.

I had been played by this little brat from the very beginning.

I felt drained and collapsed into a chair. "Ryan Evans, what do you want?"

He licked his lips greedily. "Aunt Sophia, you don’t want Jacob to know about us, do you?
If he finds out, he’ll never focus on his SAT. His future will be ruined."

I nodded weakly. This monster went to all this trouble just to have me.
I could endure this for a month. I would pretend it was a nightmare.

Ryan grinned triumphantly and took me to a motel.

I felt utterly humiliated. I had fallen for a child’s scheme, and there was no way out.
I had to play along for now.

I stumbled home in a daze and cried until my eyes were swollen shut.

There was no early admission offer. Jacob would have to rely on his own efforts.

I decided to have an honest conversation with my son.
I hoped he could maintain his current grades and at least get into a state university.

The SAT could determine his entire future.
I refused to let him throw it all away over vulgar distractions.
Even if he hated me forever, it would be worth it.
###Chapter 7
I collapsed onto the sofa, waiting for my son to return.

The memory of Ryan Evans' young, powerful body made my cheeks burn.

"What an audacious little brat!"

"Actually, this isn't so bad either..." I was startled by my own thought.

Soon, the phone rang. I answered—it was my best friend Emily, saying something terrible had happened.

She immediately sent me a video on WhatsApp. It was an explicit clip of Ryan and me, completely uncensored.

I was both furious and humiliated. Is Ryan an idiot? How could he post this online?

Emily told me the video had gone viral. It was in almost every group chat.

My eyes went dull with despair. I was completely shattered.

If Jacob saw this, I couldn't imagine the consequences.

Just as Emily said, the video was everywhere. People were leaving vile comments online.

Those who recognized me and Ryan called me a bitch. They said I was a cougar seducing my son's friend.

Then Ryan called. "Aunt Sophia, please believe me. I didn't leak that video online!"

I was seething. If he were here, I would slap him twice. "Are you stupid? How could you let this get online?"

He claimed it wasn't him. Then who was it?

I didn't believe a word he said. I hung up, wondering how to salvage my reputation.

Jacob came home. He screamed at me the moment he saw me. "You slut!"

My heart turned to ice. Two silent tears traced down my cheeks. He knew.

I felt utterly wronged. If it weren't for him, would I have fallen for Ryan's scheme?

He was like a madman, his eyes bloodshot. He smashed everything in sight. "Have some self-respect! I know you want a man, but not my friend!"

"What will my classmates think? What will my teachers think?"

I choked up, unable to speak. With his introverted personality, he couldn't handle the stares. The SAT was in a month. His future was ruined.

He banged his head against the wall. Each thud filled me with despair. His pain was my agony.

"Jacob, let me explain. It wasn't intentional."

I held him tightly from behind and told him everything.

He struggled wildly at first, but gradually stilled. He stared blankly at the wall, lost in thought.

After a long silence, he spoke hoarsely. "So you knew about all those things I did at night?"

I nodded shyly. There was no use hiding it now. I blamed everything on Ryan.

He corrupted Jacob with adult films. He stole and sniffed my private garments. He fabricated the persona of Mr. Anderson to deceive and humiliate me.

Jacob's expression was complex. "I want Ryan in jail. How dare he do this to you!"

"Okay, whatever you say. Please don't be angry with me, honey. Don't let this affect your SAT." I gently stroked his head, comforting him like when he was little.

But he pulled away with disgust. "Then sue him now!"

I called the police immediately. I had ample evidence that Ryan had deceived me. He would get at least three to five years.

I felt a pang of regret for Ryan. He was about to take the SAT too. This would ruin his life. But for my son, I had to do it. Jacob was my entire world.
###Chapter 8

These days, whenever I stepped out to buy groceries, I was met with strange looks.

The neighbors all recognized me from those viral videos, pointing and sneering.

Their mocking laughter made me wish I could vanish into the ground.

Some even got hold of my phone number, asking about overnight rates.

They treated me like a common prostitute.

I was too terrified to answer calls, wearing a mask to hide my face outside.

Fortunately, my son had recently broken his bad habits, no longer obsessed with intimacy.

His mental state seemed stable, unaffected by the school rumors, which relieved me.

With only two weeks until the SATs, maintaining this focus should secure him a spot at a decent university.

Just as life seemed to settle, the police arrived.

I was preparing dinner when officers knocked on my door.

Their presence shocked me—I hadn’t broken any laws. The leaked video wasn’t my fault.

Detective Miller spoke first. "Mrs. Lowell? Cybercrime units traced explicit content to Jacob’s IP address. The volume is significant."

"To minimize disruption, we’re handling this discreetly at home. Please cooperate."

My face drained of color. "That can’t be true. Jacob’s always been quiet and reserved. How could he do this?"

As I swayed, Officer Garcia steadied me. "Mrs. Lowell, do you truly understand your son’s inner world? The videos he distributed featured you and Ryan Evans."

Her tone was gentle, almost pitying.

I collapsed to the floor, muttering denials.

But logic insisted the police had evidence.

Footsteps echoed outside—Jacob was home.

He showed no surprise at the officers, calmly stating, "You’re here sooner than I expected."

Detective Miller presented the warrant. "Jacob Lowell, you’re under arrest for distributing explicit material."

Jacob offered his wrists for the handcuffs, indifferent.

I clung to him, frantic. "This is a mistake! Please, don’t take him!"

An arrest would ruin his future.

The officers warned me against obstructing justice.

As they led him away, Jacob leaned close, his expression icy. "Did you enjoy my gift, Mom? Jail is my next present to you."

Rage blurred my vision, and I fainted.

I woke to Officer Garcia’s concerned face.

I begged for news about Jacob’s SAT eligibility.

Despite his cruelty, he was still my son.

She explained he’d confessed, facing a six-month sentence.

Despair nearly swallowed me whole.

Officer Garcia revealed Jacob’s plan was always to punish me.

He’d resented Ryan’s possessiveness, manipulating him into the affair.

Every step—lending the iPad, sharing videos, discussing intimate items—was orchestrated by Jacob.

He’d unleashed Ryan’s desires, making me a pawn.

After obtaining the video, he spread it openly, wanting to be caught.

His goal was my utter humiliation, followed by his own imprisonment to break me completely.

I’d rather endure jail or death than see him become a convict.

Grief choked me. How could he do this?

After his father’s death, I’d sacrificed everything for him, only to be repaid with hatred.

Officer Garcia gently asked if there was unresolved conflict between us.

Her words sparked a memory—Jacob’s childhood diary.

Weakly, I rushed to my bedroom, rummaging until I found a locked box.

With Officer Garcia’s help, we opened it, revealing a thick journal.

Hours passed as I read, tears streaming down my face.

I’d only ever cared about surface things: meals, clothes, grades. I’d ignored his heart.

Three years ago, he’d confessed a crush on a classmate, Lily.

I’d scolded him harshly, even reporting it to the school.

Lily’s parents transferred her away after a public humiliation.

That day, Jacob planted seeds of hatred.

But he and Lily kept in secret contact, she urging him not to blame me, promising to reunite in college.

Their hidden love lasted over two years, until Lily died of colon cancer six months ago.

Grief consumed him, while I pursued romantic flings, planning to indulge once he left for university.

Jacob discovered my intentions, his gloomy personality festering without Lily’s comfort.

He blamed me for their separation, believing Lily might have lived with his support.

To him, I was a hypocritical, promiscuous woman.

So he plotted my ruin, ensuring my disgrace and his own incarceration.

Knowing the truth, I felt the despair.
