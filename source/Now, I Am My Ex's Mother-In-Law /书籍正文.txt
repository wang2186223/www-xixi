###Prologue

The moon hung low in the velvet sky, casting silver streaks over the dense forest. A lone figure darted between the towering trees, her breath ragged, her heart pounding like a drum. Lillian had never imagined her life would spiral into this—running for her life, hunted by the very man who had once sworn to protect her.

Her bare feet scraped against the rough earth, the sting of twigs and stones barely registering through the adrenaline coursing through her veins. Behind her, the growls of pursuing wolves grew louder, their snarls vibrating through the night air. She could almost feel Donovan’s rage, his betrayal still fresh like an open wound.

"You were never meant to be mine," his voice echoed in her mind, laced with venom.

A sharp pain shot through her side as she stumbled, her legs threatening to give out. She couldn’t stop. Not now. Not when she had finally found the truth—about herself, about the bond she had been forced into, about the lies that had shackled her for years.

Then, like a beacon in the dark, a new scent cut through the chaos—rich, commanding, powerful.

Sebastian Blackwood.

The Lycan Alpha who had unknowingly become her only hope.

Lillian didn’t know if she could trust him. But as the shadows of her pursuers closed in, she had no choice.

She ran toward the unknown.

Toward fate.

Toward him.

And the moment she crossed into his territory, the world as she knew it would shatter—for better or worse.
###Chapter 1 - Lillian's POV

Today was supposed to be the day Donovan and I sealed our fate. The day we promised forever. Instead, I stood frozen, watching as his lips met Evelyn’s—his new mate.

The daughter of Sebastian Blackwood.

The most powerful Lycan chairman in existence.

Marrying her would secure Donovan’s place as the next Alpha.

Two months ago, our pack’s Alpha fell in battle, leaving the position open. Every eligible warrior was clawing for power—including Donovan. And everyone knew the Lycans held the reins over the werewolf world.

Sebastian? He could decide who ruled.

So, Donovan made his choice.

Her.

Not me.

"A whiskey, neat. And a martini for the lady." A deep, velvety voice cut through my spiraling thoughts.

I turned, meeting the gaze of a man who looked like sin wrapped in a tailored suit. His eyes—sharp, calculating—studied me with unsettling intensity.

"Is it the future bride or groom that’s got you drowning in liquor?"

I forced a tight smile. "Not a fan of parties."

"Neither am I," he murmured, swirling his drink. "Obligation drags me here."

The bartender slid my martini forward, and I downed half in one go, relishing the burn. Maybe if I drank enough, I wouldn’t feel the phantom ache of the bond breaking—the one that had tied me to Donovan for two years.

The one he’d just shattered.

Every time his lips met Evelyn’s, another piece of me died.

"Thanks for the drink," I muttered, pushing off the stool—

Rip.

My blouse caught on the counter’s edge. I barely registered the tear before gravity yanked me backward.

I braced for impact—

Strong arms caught me mid-fall.

Warm. Solid. Unyielding.

I blinked up at the man holding me, and my breath hitched.

Goddess.

He was beautiful. Chiseled jaw, lips that promised wicked things, and a dimple that appeared when he smirked—which he was doing right now.

"Madam," he purred, "are you falling for me?"

I narrowed my eyes. "Cute."

His grin widened. Then his gaze dropped to my torn blouse, and his expression darkened.

"Let’s get you to my suite," he said, voice dropping to a growl.

My pulse spiked. "Excuse me?"

"Your shirt is ruined. I have spares upstairs."

Oh. Right.

I swallowed, nodding. He tossed orders at the bartender, then swept me into his arms like I weighed nothing. His scent—mint and something darker, primal—wrapped around me, and my wolf, who’d been mourning silently all night, perked up.

Purring.

"Take it off," he commanded the second we entered his suite.

I choked. "What?"

He gestured to my ruined blouse. "Unless you’d rather walk around half-dressed?"

Flushing, I yanked it over my head, leaving me in just my bra.

His gaze raked over me—slow, deliberate—and the air thickened. Then his shirt hit the floor, revealing sculpted abs and ink that made my mouth water.

I blinked.

Wait.

I knew him.

"You’re—"

"Sebastian Blackwood," he confirmed, prowling closer. "And you?"

My throat dried.

Shit.

Evelyn’s father. Donovan’s future father-in-law.

I should run.

But the way he looked at me—like he wanted to devour me—sent heat pooling low in my stomach.

If Donovan gets to move on, why can’t I?

"Your eyes," I breathed as he closed the distance. "They’re…"

"Mesmerizing?" He smirked.

"Dangerous."

His laugh was dark. "What else?"

"Your dimple." I reached up, brushing my thumb over it. "It’s unfair."

He caught my wrist, pinning me against the wall. "And my lips?"

I didn’t answer.

I kissed him.

His mouth crashed into mine, all hunger and possession. I melted into him, my legs wrapping around his waist as he lifted me effortlessly. His tongue swept in, claiming, consuming.

Then—

"Lillian!"

My mother’s panicked mindlink shattered the haze.

"Come home. Now."

I jerked back, gasping. "I have to go."

Sebastian’s grip tightened. "You’re not leaving."

"It’s an emergency." I shoved against his chest. "And you have plenty of willing women."

His glare could’ve frozen hell. But he released me, snatching a fresh shirt and thrusting it at me.

"Wear this."

I yanked it on, his scent enveloping me, and bolted.

The second I burst through my front door, my mother’s sobs gutted me.

"Lillian," she choked out, "the Gammas took your father."

###Chapter 2 - Lillian's POV

My stomach twisted into knots. "What?!" The word tore from my throat before I could stop it.

Our home was spacious, comfortable—my adoptive father, a prosperous businessman and Delta of the Redmoon pack, had never wanted for wealth.

"He was arrested," my mother explained, her voice hollow. "A failed investment. The company collapsed. He lost everything. Now, he owes the pack more than we could ever repay. Until the debt is settled, they’ve locked him away."

"They can’t just take him!" I shot to my feet, my pulse roaring in my ears. "No warning? No trial? That’s not justice!"

"The Beta answers to the Lycans. Their word is law." Her fingers trembled around her teacup. "Loan sharks don’t negotiate. They eliminate problems. And right now... your father is their problem."

Before I could argue, my phone buzzed violently in my bag. I fished it out, my stomach plummeting further at the name flashing on the screen.

Donovan.

"I heard about your father." His voice was velvet, smooth and calculated. My traitorous heart stuttered. Even now, after everything, my body still reacted to him—this cursed mate bond refusing to die. Rejection hadn’t severed it. Only his mark on another would.

"I might have a solution," he continued. "But I’d rather discuss it face-to-face. Come outside."

I didn’t hesitate.

Donovan leaned against his sleek black car, arms crossed, the moonlight carving shadows across his sharp jaw. Goddess, I hated how effortlessly beautiful he was.

Two years. Two years I’d loved him—my friend, my confidant, my fated. His rejection had shattered every dream I’d ever dared to have.

I hugged myself tighter, nails digging into my arms.

"Why are you here?" My voice was steadier than I felt.

"To talk."

"About what?"

His lips quirked, that infuriating half-smile that used to make my knees weak. Now, it just made me nauseous. I forced my gaze to the pavement.

"Your father’s debts," he said. "His assets are frozen. His business is ash. But I have the money."

My eyes snapped back to his. "You’d pay his debt?"

"Every cent."

"And what do you want in return?" I already knew I wouldn’t like the answer.

His smirk deepened, sending ice through my veins.

"There’s a condition." He stepped closer, his scent—spice and something darker—wrapping around me. "Once I’m married, I want you to leave school. Become my mistress."

The world tilted. "Excuse me?"

"A penthouse. Clothes. Jewels. Anything you desire." His fingers traced my arm, slow, possessive. "Your father walks free. Your family never struggles again. All you have to do is say yes."

My wolf whimpered inside me, wounded. How could our mate ask this of us?

I wrenched away, my body shaking. "No. Never."

His eyes darkened, the playful glint vanishing. "I’m about to be Alpha, Lillian. This is how the world works. Be smart. Don’t you want your father back?"

"I’ll find another way." The words tasted like steel.

He laughed, cold and sure. "Five million dollars. When you realize no one else will save him, you’ll come crawling back."

The car door slammed. Tires screeched.

I stood there long after his taillights vanished, fists clenched, tears burning behind my eyes.

I’ll figure it out.

Even if it destroyed me.

###Chapter 3 - Lillian's POV

"Shut up!" Beatrice gasped, her voice rising several octaves. "Are you serious?! You went to Sebastian Blackwood's VIP suite? As in the Sebastian Blackwood?!"

I nearly lunged at her, my pulse spiking at her volume. "Keep your voice down!" I hissed, swiping at her mouth, but she dodged with a dancer's grace.

"How am I supposed to stay calm when my best friend spent the night in Sebastian Blackwood's hotel room and waited hours to tell me?!" she whisper-yelled, eyes wide with scandalized delight.

Beatrice worked as a waitress at Carter Resorts, the luxurious hotel where Donovan’s engagement party had been held. The place was owned by Patrick Carter, Delta of the Silver Crescent pack—Sebastian’s pack.

Of course Sebastian had been there. His daughter, Victoria, was the bride-to-be. And of course he had a private suite.

I exhaled sharply.

"It all happened so fast, and I was... not entirely sober," I admitted, wrapping my arms around myself. "I barely remembered it until later, when—other things happened."

Beatrice’s playful expression darkened. "What other things?"

I swallowed hard. Then, in a rush, I told her everything—how Donovan had cornered me, how he’d offered to pay off my father’s debt... in exchange for becoming his mistress.

By the time I finished, Beatrice’s lips were pressed into a thin, furious line.

"That bastard," she spat. "He rejects you, humiliates you, and now he thinks he can buy you like some cheap fling? The audacity."

"I don’t know what to do," I whispered. "Five million dollars... there’s no way I can get that kind of money."

Silence stretched between us, thick with desperation. Then, slowly, a wicked grin curled Beatrice’s lips.

I knew that look. And it terrified me.

"You said Sebastian gave you his shirt?" she asked, eyes gleaming.

I nodded, wary.

She grabbed my wrist, triumphant. "Lillian, it’s obvious. Sebastian is into you. Why else would he give you his clothes? He wanted his scent on you. And trust me—he’s notoriously particular. In all my time working there, you’re the first woman he’s ever offered anything to."

I gaped at her. She’d lost her mind.

"Sebastian isn’t into me," I said flatly. "He gave me his shirt because mine was ruined. That’s it."

"Then why bother?" she countered, crossing her arms. "He’s Sebastian Blackwood. He doesn’t lift a finger for anyone unless he wants to. And don’t even get me started on that kiss. You were this close to sleeping with him—and we both know you were saving yourself for marriage. Something happened between you two."

I looked away, my cheeks burning.

"Or maybe I just wanted to hurt Donovan," I muttered. "And maybe I had too much champagne."

"Drunk actions are sober thoughts," she said dismissively. Then, with a sly smirk, she leaned in. "You could use this. Do you still have that lingerie you bought for your wedding night? Go see Sebastian. Make him an offer he can’t refuse."

The idea was reckless. Dangerous. But as the hours passed, her words looped in my mind, refusing to fade.

By morning, my decision was made.

I pulled the red lace from my closet—the set I’d only tried on once, the one meant for Donovan. My chest ached at the memory, but I shoved it down. No more tears.

I slipped into the lingerie, then covered it with a long trench coat. I left my hair loose, applied just enough makeup to highlight my features.

My mother had barely spoken to me since I told her Donovan wouldn’t help. The disappointment in her eyes haunted me. But maybe—maybe—this would fix everything.

Sebastian’s office wasn’t hard to find. The Blackwood Corporation was legendary.

The receptionist barely glanced up as I approached.

"Good morning," I said, forcing politeness. "I’m here to see Sebastian Blackwood."

She looked up, unimpressed. "Do you have an appointment?"

"No, but—"

"Let me stop you right there," she cut in, tone dripping with boredom. "Mr. Blackwood is extremely busy. He doesn’t have time for fan girls."

My fingers curled into fists.

"And what gives you the right to turn away those who come to see me?"

A deep, familiar voice rumbled behind me.

I turned—and there he was.

Sebastian Blackwood.

His golden eyes locked onto mine, and my breath caught.

###Chapter 4 - Lillian's POV

"Mr. Blackwood," the receptionist stammered, scrambling to her feet. Her composure shattered, and though satisfaction curled inside me, I kept my expression neutral.

Sebastian Blackwood’s piercing gaze locked onto her. "I asked you a question, Laura," he said, voice dangerously low. "Since when do you decide who I see? The protocol is clear—you call my office, and I decide who gets an audience. Not you."

She swallowed hard, eyes darting to the floor as if his presence alone burned her.

"Come with me."

It took me a second to realize he was speaking to me. When I caught the receptionist’s venomous glare and Sebastian’s retreating figure, I nearly tripped in my haste to follow. He led me through a lavish waiting area toward a sleek glass elevator.

The elevator was state-of-the-art, complete with a touchscreen panel. He keyed in a code, then pressed a button for the top floor.

Despite the spacious interior, his proximity made the air thick, suffocating. His scent—mint and something darker, richer—wrapped around me, making my pulse stutter.

He didn’t spare me a glance, and doubt crept in. Maybe I’d misread his interest. Maybe this plan was doomed from the start.

The elevator stopped, revealing an expansive office with marble floors and granite walls.

"Where’s your actual office?" I asked, taking in the grandeur.

He finally looked at me, expression unreadable. "This is my office."

My eyes widened. He strode forward, rounding a corner to reveal a massive desk positioned before floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the city. The view was breathtaking—and my stomach twisted with nerves.

Instead of sitting, he leaned against his desk, arms crossed. His white dress shirt, sleeves rolled up to reveal corded forearms, clung to his broad frame. Dark slacks accentuated his lean waist, and my wolf practically purred in approval.

I stared longer than I meant to.

He cleared his throat, jolting me back to reality. His smirk said it all—Caught you. Heat flooded my cheeks.

"So," he drawled, "why are you here?"

Right. The reason.

"I need your help," I blurted.

One dark brow arched. "With?"

"My father was arrested. His business collapsed—he owes five million."

Silence. He waited, expectant.

"I was hoping… you could pay his debt. Get him out."

Another beat of quiet. Then he dragged a hand down his face. "And what do I get in return?"

I lifted my chin, meeting his gaze—a direct challenge to an Alpha, a Lycan. But instead of anger, intrigue flickered in his eyes.

"Well," I murmured, stepping closer, voice dropping to a whisper. "At the party… there was something between us." My face burned. "I thought maybe…"

I undid my coat, revealing just enough lace to tease. His gaze darkened, raking over me, and confidence surged through me. I reached out, fingertips brushing his arm.

"I could… repay you," I murmured. "I’m clean. A virgin. On birth control—no risks."

His breath hitched. He straightened, closing the distance between us until his heat seared my skin. His scent enveloped me, dizzying.

Then—his fingers traced my cheek, sending shivers down my spine. His eyes were black as midnight, just like in the VIP suite.

I closed my eyes, leaning in—

But his hands adjusted my coat, covering me again.

My eyes flew open. His expression was stern.

"Do you really think I pay for sex?" His voice was ice. "You said it yourself—I have options."

Humiliation scorched me. "I just—"

"You thought you could trade your body for my help." He cut me off. "You’re young, Miss Dumont. You’ll regret shortcuts like this."

How does he know my name?

His next words were softer, almost pitying. "I have a daughter. I’d never teach her to use her body as currency. I expect better—for her, and for you."

His fingertips brushed my neck, and my breath caught.

"I expected better from you."

The words shattered me.

Before I could respond, footsteps echoed behind me. Security.

"My patience is spent," Sebastian said coolly. "Escort Miss Dumont out."

They flanked me, and I didn’t resist.

"Thank you for your time," I managed before turning away, shame burning my throat.

"I’m so glad we’re working together!" Beatrice beamed, adjusting my ridiculous uniform—a skimpy skirt and crop top that left little to the imagination.

The club was packed, wealthy men eyeing the staff like prey. But the tips were good, and I was desperate.

"That’s what friends are for," she chirped, nudging me.

Then she stiffened. "Incoming group. Good luck."

I turned—and froze.

Donovan.
###Chapter 5 - Lillian's POV

"You were right," one of Donovan's friends sneered, his voice dripping with amusement. "She does work here. This is going to be fun."

"Hey, sweetheart," another called, smirking as he leaned back in his chair. "You gonna seat us, or just stand there looking pretty?"

My fingers tightened around the menus as I forced a polite smile. "I'm not your sweetheart," I said through gritted teeth, placing the menus down. "Please, take your seats."

As I leaned over to set the beers in front of them, one of them—a broad-shouldered brute with a wolfish grin—grabbed my waist, his fingers digging in. My entire body locked up, a cold wave of disgust washing over me.

"Love this little outfit," he murmured, his breath hot against my ear. "Bet you'd look even better without it."

I jerked back, slapping his hand away. "Don't touch me," I snapped, my voice sharp enough to make a few nearby diners glance over.

One of the others laughed, swirling his drink lazily. "Oh, come on, Lillian. Isn’t this what you’re here for? To entertain us?" He patted his lap. "Sit. I’ll make it worth your while."

My jaw clenched. "I’m a waitress," I repeated, my nails biting into my palms. "Not your personal plaything."

Another one—tall, with a cruel twist to his lips—leaned forward. "Let’s be real. You got this job because of that face, not your skills." He tossed a wad of cash onto the table. "I’ll double your paycheck if you show us what’s under that uniform."

The room spun for a second, fury and humiliation burning through me.

I glanced at Donovan.

He was watching me, silent, his expression unreadable. Once, he would’ve torn these men apart for speaking to me like this. Now? He just sat there, as if I were nothing.

"Ten grand," one of them announced suddenly, sliding a full beer toward me. "Drink this, and it’s yours."

I blinked. "What?"

"You heard him," another chimed in. "All of us will give you ten grand each if you finish all our drinks."

My gaze flicked between the beers and their smirking faces. Then, against my better judgment, I looked at Donovan again.

His brow arched, waiting.

Fine.

Swallowing my pride, I grabbed the first glass.

I hated beer—the bitter taste, the way it made my stomach churn—but money was money. And I needed it. For my father. For his debts.

I tipped the glass back, forcing the liquid down as they cheered. The second one went down easier, though my head was already swimming.

By the third, my vision blurred.

Then—

A hand clamped around my wrist, yanking me away from the table.

Donovan’s friends booed, calling him a killjoy as he dragged me outside. The cold night air hit my face, sobering me just enough to glare up at him.

"Take my offer," he growled, his grip bruising. "Stop humiliating yourself."

"I won’t be your mistress," I spat, my words slightly slurred. "Not for any price."

His eyes darkened. "You’d rather act like a cheap whore instead?"

"Why do you care?" I shot back, shoving against his chest. "You have your fiancée. I’m not your problem anymore."

His fingers dug into my arms. "You’ll always be mine, Lillian."

I laughed, the sound hollow. "I’m not."

His expression twisted, something vicious flashing in his eyes. "Fine. Be a slut, then. Open your legs for cash—it’s all you’re good for—"

My hand cracked across his face before I could stop myself.

He didn’t flinch. Just stared at me, his jaw tightening. Then—

His gaze dropped to my neck.

His face paled.

"What the hell," he hissed, grabbing my chin and forcing my head to the side. "Is that a hickey?"

I’d forgotten about it—the fading mark Sebastian had left two nights ago.

I yanked free. "So what if it is?"

His voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "Who. Was. It."

"None of your business."

I turned to leave, but he grabbed me again, spinning me around. His fingers bit into my skin.

"Answer me!"

I met his gaze, my own burning with defiance. "Sebastian Blackwood. Your future father-in-law. Happy now?"

For a second, he just stared.

Then—

He let go, laughing—a harsh, broken sound.

###Chapter 6 - Lillian's POV

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains, stirring Lillian from her restless sleep. She groaned, rubbing her temples as the remnants of last night’s confrontation with Donovan replayed in her mind. His betrayal still stung like a fresh wound, raw and unrelenting.

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Lillian? Are you awake?" Beatrice’s voice was muffled but laced with concern.

Lillian sat up, wincing at the dull ache in her muscles. "Yeah, come in."

Beatrice pushed the door open, balancing a tray of steaming coffee and toast. "You look like you wrestled a bear," she teased, though her eyes were sympathetic.

"Feels like it," Lillian muttered, accepting the coffee gratefully. The rich aroma soothed her frayed nerves.

Beatrice perched on the edge of the bed. "So… what happened last night? You stormed out of the party like the place was on fire."

Lillian hesitated. She hadn’t told anyone about Donovan’s sudden reappearance—or his new mate, Evelyn. The words stuck in her throat, bitter and heavy.

Before she could respond, her phone buzzed. A message from an unknown number lit up the screen:

"We need to talk. It’s urgent. —D."

Lillian’s grip tightened around her phone. Donovan. Of course.

Beatrice frowned. "Who’s that?"

Lillian exhaled sharply. "No one important." She tossed the phone aside, but the message gnawed at her. What could he possibly want now?

A second buzz. Another message, this time from Sebastian Blackwood:

"Meet me at the pack house in an hour. We have matters to discuss."

Lillian’s pulse quickened. Sebastian never summoned her without reason. Was this about Donovan? Or something worse?

Beatrice raised an eyebrow. "Trouble in paradise?"

Lillian forced a smile. "Just pack business." She stood, ignoring the lingering exhaustion. "I should get ready."

As she dressed, her mind raced. Last night had been a disaster—Donovan’s smug face, Evelyn’s possessive grip on his arm, the way they’d flaunted their bond like a trophy. And now, Sebastian wanted to see her.

Something was coming. She could feel it in her bones.

The question was: was she ready for it?

My breath hitched as I turned to Sebastian, stunned that he knew Donovan was my ex-fiancé. He had clearly dug deep into my past. At first, I assumed he had only looked up basic details, but he had uncovered far more than I ever expected.

"How did you know he was my ex-fiancé?" I demanded, my voice sharper than intended.

Sebastian smirked, his tone smooth and unbothered. "There's very little I don't know. Like the fact that Donovan—who is now my daughter’s fiancé—was once your fated mate."

A sharp inhale escaped me at his bold declaration, heat flooding my cheeks.

"Am I wrong?" he challenged, though his tone made it clear he already knew the answer.

I shook my head, unable to meet his gaze, my fingers tightening in my lap. This was the one secret I had hoped to keep buried.

"Whatever happened in the past," he continued, his voice dropping lower, "Victoria and Donovan are set to marry soon. For her sake, I expect everything to go smoothly."

I bit my lip, unwilling to engage further. Maybe my silence would make him drop the subject.

Turning my attention to the window, my stomach twisted as the car crossed into my pack’s territory. I hadn’t told him where I lived, yet the driver navigated the roads effortlessly, heading straight for my parents’ estate.

My pulse thundered in my ears. Was there anything this man hadn’t uncovered?

Against my better judgment, I stole a glance at him. His sharp profile was outlined by the passing scenery, his strong jaw set, lips pressed into a firm line. The memory of our heated encounter surged forward—his mouth claiming mine, the intoxicating mix of tenderness and raw hunger.

My fingers drifted unconsciously to the mark he’d left on my neck, the one Donovan had seen—the one that had sent him into a rage.

A flush crept up my skin at the reminder.

"If you’re done staring," Sebastian’s deep voice cut through my thoughts, "you can get out now."

Blinking, I snapped back to reality. The car had stopped.

We were already at my doorstep.

"Oh," I exhaled sharply, caught red-handed staring at him. Heat rushed to my cheeks, and all I wanted was to escape his presence immediately.

Fumbling with the seatbelt, I unhooked it in haste and grabbed my purse, swinging it over my shoulder before pushing the car door open.

"Uh, thanks for the ride," I muttered awkwardly, my voice barely above a whisper.

Sebastian gave a stiff nod, his expression unreadable. Just as I was about to slide out, his fingers curled around my wrist, stopping me in my tracks.

"Lillian," he said, his tone commanding. The way my name rolled off his tongue sent an unexpected shiver down my spine. I froze, meeting his piercing gaze, my breath hitching in my throat.

"Yes?" My reply came out breathless, betraying the nerves I tried so hard to conceal.

His grip loosened slightly as he spoke, his words sharp and final. "We won't be seeing each other again. Understood?"

It felt like a blade had been driven straight through my chest. His words left me stunned, a sharp ache spreading through me. Swallowing the lump in my throat, I forced myself to nod.

"Understood," I whispered, my voice barely audible.

The moment he released my wrist, a strange emptiness settled over me, as if I'd stepped out into the cold without a coat. It made no sense—we'd only shared one reckless moment, barely even a conversation—yet the absence of his touch left me hollow.

Without another word, I stepped out of the car. The door clicked shut behind me, sealing me off from the tinted windows that hid him from view. Still, I could feel his eyes on me, watching as I hurried toward the house, digging through my purse for my keys.

The house was dark, the lights off. Either my mother was already asleep, or she wasn't home at all.

###Chapter 7 I’m in

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the lavish bedroom as Lillian stirred beneath the silk sheets. Her body ached from the previous night’s events—Donovan’s betrayal, the humiliating rejection, and the way Evelyn had smirked at her like she’d already won.

Lillian clenched her fists.

She wouldn’t let them break her.

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Miss Lillian?" Harper’s gentle voice called from the other side. "Mr. Blackwood has requested your presence in the study."

Lillian exhaled sharply. Sebastian Blackwood—the enigmatic Lycan chairman who had swooped in like some dark knight when she’d been at her lowest. She still didn’t understand why he’d intervened, why he’d brought her to his estate instead of letting her drown in her misery.

"Tell him I’ll be there in ten minutes," she replied, forcing her voice steady.

She dragged herself out of bed, wincing as her muscles protested. The full-length mirror in the corner reflected her disheveled state—tangled hair, shadows beneath her eyes, the faint bruises on her wrists from Donovan’s grip.

Pathetic.

She turned away, refusing to let the sight weaken her further.

After a quick shower, she dressed in the clothes Harper had left for her—a simple but elegant blouse and tailored slacks. No frills, no fuss. Just like Sebastian himself.

The Blackwood estate was a maze of opulence, all dark wood and gilded accents. Lillian followed the scent of coffee and the low murmur of voices to the study.

Sebastian stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, his broad shoulders silhouetted against the morning light. He turned as she entered, his piercing gaze sweeping over her in one swift assessment.

"You look better," he remarked.

Lillian arched a brow. "High praise."

A ghost of a smirk tugged at his lips before he gestured to the chair across from his desk. "Sit."

She did, though every instinct screamed at her to remain standing, to keep her guard up.

Sebastian leaned against his desk, arms crossed. "I have a proposition for you."

Lillian’s pulse spiked. "What kind of proposition?"

"One that benefits us both." His voice was smooth, calculated. "You need protection. I need leverage against Donovan."

Her stomach twisted. "You want to use me."

"I want to help you," he corrected. "But yes, your connection to Donovan makes you valuable."

Lillian swallowed hard. She hated the idea of being anyone’s pawn—but what choice did she have? Alone, she was vulnerable. With Sebastian, she at least had a fighting chance.

"What exactly are you proposing?" she asked.

Sebastian’s eyes gleamed. "A temporary alliance. You stay under my protection, and in return, you help me expose Donovan’s dealings with the Winslow family."

Lillian’s breath caught. The Winslows—Donovan’s powerful, ruthless relatives. If they were involved, this went deeper than she’d realized.

She met Sebastian’s gaze. "And if I refuse?"

His expression darkened. "Then you walk out that door and face whatever comes next alone."

The unspoken threat hung between them.

Lillian clenched her jaw. She wasn’t naive enough to think Sebastian was doing this out of kindness. But right now, he was her best option.

"Fine," she said. "I’m in."

Sebastian’s lips curved into a satisfied smile. "Good." He pushed off the desk and strode toward the door. "We leave for the city in an hour. Be ready."

As he disappeared into the hallway, Lillian exhaled shakily.

She’d just made a deal with the devil.

And she had no idea what it would cost her.
Just as my fingers hovered over Beatrice's contact, my screen lit up with an incoming message. My stomach twisted when Donovan's name flashed at the top. A heavy sigh escaped me as I read his venomous words.

Donovan: How dare you leave with another man? You truly are a disgrace!

My breath hitched as I opened the full message.

Donovan: You’d open your legs for anyone with money. Was I just another paycheck to you all along?

Donovan: Maybe if I paid you enough, you’d finally remember who your real mate is. Two years wasted on a whore like you.

I recoiled as if struck. Two years wasted? My wolf whimpered inside me, the pain of our mate’s cruelty slicing deep. Tears blurred my vision, spilling over as I sank onto the edge of my bed.

Then, another notification.

Donovan: He’ll never care about you! Sebastian Blackwood hasn’t had a real relationship in decades. You’re nothing but a desperate distraction. When you crawl back, I’ll be waiting. Your father could walk free tomorrow if you stop playing games.

I bit my lip hard, tasting copper as tears streaked down my face. My grip on the phone tightened—I was seconds from hurling it across the room—when a new message chimed. Relief flooded me when I saw it wasn’t from Donovan.

Beatrice: Are you okay? You left so suddenly.

I wiped my cheeks with the back of my hand before typing.

Me: Sorry, I can’t do this job anymore. It’s too much. I feel disgusting. Please don’t hate me.

Beatrice: I could never hate you. Honestly, I knew today would be your last shift. You’re too good for that place. Did Donovan take you home?

Me: No. Someone else gave me a ride.

I hesitated, unsure if I should admit it was Sebastian. Before I could decide, Beatrice replied.

Beatrice: Who? Wait—tell me later. We just got slammed.

I exhaled shakily and typed back.

Me: Okay. Talk soon.

Tossing my phone onto the bed, I collapsed against the pillows. Sleep wouldn’t come tonight—not with my mind racing like this.

Third Person POV

Donovan stood frozen, staring at the spot where the sleek black car had disappeared. Sebastian Blackwood. The Lycan chairman. The man Donovan had spent years trying to impress. And his mate had just climbed into that car without a second glance.

"Did that really just happen?" His friend gaped beside him, equally stunned.

None of them had believed Lillian would actually go through with it—running off with the man whose daughter Donovan was supposed to marry. But the proof was undeniable. She’d chosen Sebastian.

And Donovan’s pride wouldn’t let that stand.

This wasn’t how things were supposed to go. Lillian was supposed to accept Donovan’s offer—that had been the entire point of his carefully crafted scheme. When he married Victoria, he knew he’d lose Lillian forever. The only way to keep her close was to exploit the one thing she couldn’t ignore—her family.

Bankrupting her father’s company had been laughably easy. The Winslow name carried weight, and now that Donovan was the leading candidate for Alpha of the Redmoon pack, his influence stretched even further. He’d expected Lillian to crumble, to beg for his help. But she was stubborn.

When Donovan discovered Lillian worked at the restaurant, he’d brought his packmates along to intimidate her into quitting. Yet again, his plan had failed.

Frustration simmered beneath his skin as he pulled out his phone and dialed.

"Shut down every job opportunity Lillian Montague has applied for," he commanded, his voice sharp. "I don’t care how impressive her applications are—she doesn’t get hired. Anywhere."

The man on the other end hesitated. "Sir, Miss Montague has several high-profile applications pending. Her qualifications are impeccable—"

"Are you questioning me?" Donovan’s voice dropped dangerously. "If you don’t comply, I’ll withdraw my family’s investments from your firm and ensure you never work in this city again."

A tense silence stretched before the man finally relented. "Understood, Alpha."

The call ended, and Donovan’s lips curled into a slow, predatory smile. Soon enough, desperation would drive Lillian straight into his arms. She’d have no choice but to crawl back to him, pleading to be his mistress.

Meanwhile, Marcus Grayson glanced into the rearview mirror as he drove away from Lillian’s house. Sebastian Blackwood sat in the backseat, his jaw clenched, his stormy gaze fixed on the passing scenery. He hadn’t spoken a word since dropping Lillian off.

But Marcus had seen the way Sebastian’s entire body had tensed when they spotted Lillian arguing with Donovan outside the restaurant. The Lycan Alpha had ordered him to stop the car immediately—an unusual reaction for someone who claimed indifference.

Marcus smirked. "Why don’t you just pursue her?"

Sebastian’s head snapped toward him, his brows furrowing. "What?"

"I’ve seen the way you look at her," Marcus pressed, keeping his eyes on the road. "You’re more interested in her than you’ve ever been with anyone else. So why hold back?"

Sebastian’s silence was answer enough.
###Chapter 8 Third Person POV


The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting golden streaks across Lillian’s bedroom. She stretched lazily, her muscles still sore from yesterday’s combat training. The scent of freshly brewed coffee wafted up from the kitchen, making her stomach growl.

Downstairs, the mansion was already alive with activity. Giselle Beaumont, the head maid, was directing the staff with her usual efficiency, while Lucien Dubois, the flirtatious head chef, hummed a tune as he prepared breakfast.

Lillian padded into the dining room, where Sebastian Blackwood sat at the head of the table, reading the morning papers. His sharp eyes flicked up as she entered, and a faint smile tugged at his lips. "Sleep well?" he asked, his voice deep and smooth.

"Like a log," she replied, sliding into her seat. Oliver, Sebastian’s seven-year-old son, grinned at her from across the table, his cheeks stuffed with pancakes.

"You’re late," Victoria announced, her tone dripping with disdain. She was already dressed impeccably, her engagement ring glinting under the chandelier.

Lillian ignored her, reaching for the coffee pot. "Some of us actually need sleep," she muttered under her breath.

Theodore Whitmore, the butler, appeared at her side with a fresh plate of eggs and toast. "You’ll need your strength today, Miss Lillian," he said quietly. "Professor Montgomery has scheduled another sparring session."

Lillian groaned. "Great. Just what I need—more bruises."

Sebastian folded his newspaper. "You’re improving," he said, his gaze steady. "But you still hesitate too much."

Before she could retort, Beatrice burst into the room, her hair a wild mess. "You won’t believe what just happened!" she exclaimed, waving her phone.

Lillian raised an eyebrow. "What now?"

Beatrice plopped into the chair beside her. "Cassandra posted this ridiculous rumor about you on campus forums. Says you cheated on your last exam."

Lillian rolled her eyes. "Of course she did."

Sebastian’s expression darkened. "Do you want me to handle it?"

"No," Lillian said quickly. "I’ll deal with her myself."

Victoria smirked. "Good luck with that."

The tension in the room thickened, but before it could escalate, Marcus Grayson, Sebastian’s beta, strode in. "Alpha, we have a problem."

Sebastian stood immediately. "What is it?"

Marcus hesitated, glancing at Lillian. "It’s about Donovan. He’s been spotted near the eastern border."

Lillian’s stomach twisted. Donovan, her ex-fated mate, was the last person she wanted to think about.

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "Gather the gammas. We’ll meet in my office."

As he and Marcus left, Beatrice squeezed Lillian’s hand. "You okay?"

Lillian forced a smile. "Peachy."

But inside, her mind raced. Why was Donovan back? And what did he want?

The day had barely begun, and already, trouble was brewing.


"I don't mix personal relationships with business," Sebastian replied coolly, leaning back in his seat, his gaze fixed on the passing scenery outside the window. He had no intention of continuing this conversation. His mind was made up—he wouldn’t be seeing Lillian Montague again.

"Or is it that you're just scared?" Marcus teased, a smirk tugging at the corner of his lips.

Sebastian shot his Beta a sharp glare.

"Marcus, you're fired," he muttered.

Marcus only laughed, shaking his head in amusement.

"How many times have you fired me this month?" he asked, still chuckling.

"This week alone? More than I can count. One of these days, I’ll mean it," Sebastian retorted, rolling his eyes.

"And you think that’s going to stop me from speaking my mind? We’ve known each other for years, Alpha. What makes you think I’ll stay quiet now?"

"Just focus on driving, Beta," Sebastian growled through clenched teeth.

Marcus opened his mouth to retort, but his phone rang, cutting him off mid-sentence. He pulled it out and answered, the call connecting through the car’s Bluetooth system. A familiar voice filled the cabin.

"Butler Theodore, you’re on speaker. Alpha Sebastian is with me," Marcus announced.

Theodore had served the Blackwood family for decades, a trusted confidant. Sebastian had personally entrusted him with the care of his seven-year-old son, Oliver, while he was away. Theodore rarely called unless it was about Oliver, so the moment Sebastian heard his voice, his instincts sharpened.

"Ah, good, Alpha. I must speak with you regarding your son. Another tutor resigned this evening," Theodore said, frustration lacing his tone.

"Another one?" Sebastian pressed his lips into a thin line.

That made forty-nine. No tutor lasted more than a few days. Oliver wasn’t a bad child, but Sebastian knew he had his struggles.

"Yes, sir. Young Master Oliver frightened her off, just like the others. I’ve tried reasoning with him, but he only lashes out at me, Alpha."

"Expand the search and double the salary offer," Sebastian commanded. "Perhaps higher pay will make them stay longer."

Theodore sighed.

"Very well, Alpha. I’ll see what I can do," he murmured before the line went dead.

Marcus remained silent for a moment, stealing occasional glances at Sebastian through the rearview mirror.

"Do you think he’s acting out because of his mother?" Marcus finally ventured.

Sebastian’s glare burned through the reflection.

"He doesn’t speak to his mother," Sebastian said bitterly. "And he won’t for a long time, if I have any say in it."

The past few days had been utterly discouraging. Every single job application I submitted was met with rejection.

I couldn't understand why. My résumé was impeccable—years of experience from previous jobs, a solid education from college, and I was young, fit, and capable. Yet, rejection after rejection piled up, leaving me frustrated.

Pulling out my phone, I scrolled through the job listings again. Most of the positions I had applied to hadn’t even bothered to respond. Then, something new caught my eye.

A tutoring position for a seven-year-old boy. Multiple subjects, including basic combat and defense. Must be knowledgeable and experienced.

The ad had been posted just over an hour ago.

I bit my lip, hesitating only for a second before submitting my résumé. Tutoring would be perfect—it would fit around my own class schedule at the academy. The job was listed on a werewolf-exclusive board, and the location was in the Silver Crescent pack, not far from Redmoon.

Instead of waiting for a callback, I dialed the number listed in the ad.

A deep, authoritative voice answered. "Theodore Whitmore speaking."

"Hello, Mr. Whitmore," I said, keeping my tone professional. "My name is Lillian Dumont. I just came across your ad for a tutor. I’ve submitted my résumé, but I wanted to express my interest directly."

Silence stretched on the other end, making my stomach twist with nerves.

"This isn’t an easy job, Miss Dumont," he finally said. "Have you tutored before?"

"I tutored peers in high school," I answered smoothly. "I’m currently a student at Royal Academy, specializing in combat and shifting. I excel in most subjects—graduated top of my class, and I intend to do the same in college."

"I see," he mused. "Impressive. However, Master Oliver can be... challenging. He needs someone firm."

I didn’t miss a beat. "My goal is to become a Gamma warrior, Mr. Whitmore. If I can’t handle a seven-year-old, then I have bigger problems than this job."

A low chuckle rumbled through the phone. "I admire your confidence, Miss Dumont."

"Please, call me Lillian."

"Very well, Lillian," he conceded. "I’ve just reviewed your résumé—it is impressive. But I must ask—why would someone with your ambitions want to tutor a child?"


###Chapter 9 The Interview at Midnight Crest

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains, stirring Lillian from her restless sleep. She groaned, rubbing her temples as the remnants of last night’s humiliation burned fresh in her mind. Donovan’s cruel laughter echoed in her ears, his betrayal cutting deeper than any wound.

She rolled onto her side, her fingers curling into the sheets. How could he?

A soft knock at the door interrupted her spiraling thoughts.

"Lillian?" Beatrice’s voice was muffled through the wood. "Are you awake?"

Lillian exhaled sharply, forcing herself to sit up. "Yeah. Come in."

The door creaked open, revealing Beatrice’s concerned face. She carried a tray of steaming coffee and toast, her brows furrowed. "You look like hell."

"Feel like it too," Lillian muttered, accepting the coffee gratefully. The bitter warmth grounded her, if only slightly.

Beatrice perched on the edge of the bed, studying her. "So. What’s the plan?"

Lillian hesitated. Last night, she had been too drunk, too humiliated to think clearly. But now, sober and seething, clarity sharpened her resolve. "I’m done letting him control me."

Beatrice smirked. "That’s the spirit. But how?"

Lillian took a slow sip of coffee, her mind racing. "First, I need to talk to Sebastian."

Beatrice’s eyes widened. "The Lycan chairman? That Sebastian?"

Lillian nodded. "He’s the only one who can help me break this bond."

Beatrice whistled low. "Bold move. But are you sure? He’s not exactly known for his kindness."

Lillian set her jaw. "I don’t need kindness. I need power."

A beat of silence passed between them before Beatrice grinned. "Well, damn. When did you get so fierce?"

Lillian managed a small smile. "When I realized I had nothing left to lose."

The Blackwood estate loomed before her, its towering gates a stark reminder of the world she was stepping into. Lillian squared her shoulders, ignoring the way her pulse thundered in her ears.

The guard at the gate eyed her skeptically. "State your business."

Lillian lifted her chin. "I need to speak with Sebastian Blackwood."

The guard’s lips curled. "Do you have an appointment?"

"No. But he’ll want to see me."

The guard scoffed, but before he could dismiss her, a smooth voice cut through the tension.

"Let her in."

Lillian turned to see Marcus Grayson, Sebastian’s beta, watching her with sharp, assessing eyes.

The guard stiffened. "Sir—"

Marcus waved him off. "She’s expected."

Lillian blinked. Expected?

Marcus gestured for her to follow. "Come. He’s waiting."

Her stomach twisted as she stepped into the lion’s den.

Sebastian Blackwood sat behind his desk, his presence dominating the room. His piercing gaze locked onto her the moment she entered, sending a shiver down her spine.

"You’re braver than I thought," he mused, his voice a low rumble.

Lillian forced herself to meet his eyes. "I need your help."

Sebastian leaned back, steepling his fingers. "And why should I help you?"

"Because Donovan is a threat to you too," she said, her voice steady despite the tremor in her hands. "And I can give you what you need to destroy him."

Sebastian’s lips curved into a slow, dangerous smile. "Now that is interesting."

Lillian held her breath as the game began.

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains, stirring Lillian from her restless sleep. She groaned, rubbing her temples as the remnants of last night’s humiliation burned fresh in her mind. Donovan. His betrayal still stung like an open wound, and the memory of Evelyn’s smug smirk twisted her stomach.

Rolling out of bed, she forced herself to face the day. The Blackwood estate was eerily quiet, save for the distant clatter of dishes from the kitchen. Lucien, the flirtatious head chef, was likely already preparing breakfast. The thought of food made her nauseous.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Lillian?" Beatrice’s voice was muffled through the door. "Are you awake?"

Lillian sighed, dragging herself to open it. Beatrice stood there, her usual bubbly demeanor replaced with concern. "You look like hell," she said bluntly.

"Thanks," Lillian muttered, running a hand through her tangled hair.

Beatrice stepped inside, shutting the door behind her. "I heard what happened. That bastard Donovan—"

"Don’t," Lillian cut her off sharply. "I don’t want to talk about it."

Beatrice hesitated before nodding. "Fine. But you can’t hide in here forever. Sebastian’s hosting a pack meeting tonight. You have to show your face."

Lillian stiffened. The last thing she wanted was to face the pack—especially not after the spectacle Donovan had made of her. But Beatrice was right. Hiding would only make her look weaker.

"Fine," she relented. "But if anyone so much as looks at me with pity, I’m walking out."

Beatrice grinned. "That’s the spirit. Now, let’s get you cleaned up. You reek of misery."

Lillian rolled her eyes but allowed herself to be dragged toward the shower. As the hot water cascaded over her, she tried to wash away the lingering shame.

She wouldn’t let Donovan break her.

Not again.

The pack meeting was held in the grand hall of the Blackwood estate, its high ceilings and ornate chandeliers a stark contrast to the tension in the air. Lillian kept her chin up as she entered, ignoring the whispers that followed her.

Sebastian stood at the front, his commanding presence silencing the room. His piercing gaze swept over the gathered wolves before settling briefly on Lillian. She held her breath, but he said nothing, turning instead to address the pack.

"We have a situation," he began, his voice low but carrying. "Alpha Harrison has been making moves on our territory. He thinks we’re vulnerable."

A murmur rippled through the crowd. Lillian clenched her fists. Harrison was the same Alpha who had tried to take advantage of her when she was drunk. The thought of him slithering closer to their borders made her blood boil.

Sebastian’s eyes darkened. "We will retaliate. But we do it smart. Marcus, I want patrols doubled. Julian, tighten security around the estate."

Marcus Grayson, Sebastian’s Beta, nodded sharply. Julian Mercer, the head Gamma, gave a silent salute.

Lillian swallowed hard. This wasn’t just about territory—it was about power. And if Harrison thought she was weak, she’d prove him wrong.

Sebastian’s gaze flicked to her again, this time lingering. "Lillian," he said, his tone unreadable. "You’re with me."

Her pulse spiked. Why?

But she didn’t dare question him in front of the pack. Nodding, she stepped forward, ignoring the curious stares.

Whatever Sebastian had planned, she was ready.

Even if it killed her.

My fingers trembled slightly as I gripped my phone. Honesty was my only option now.

"My family has hit some financial difficulties recently. The tutoring salary you're offering could really help us. It's also something I can manage after my classes without falling behind," I explained, keeping my voice steady.

There was a brief pause before the deep voice responded, "Are you available this afternoon? I'll send you the address. You can meet Master Oliver first before making any decisions."

Relief washed over me. This was a chance—small, but better than nothing. "That works for me," I agreed.

The call ended, and within minutes, my phone buzzed with Theodore Whitmore's text. The address led to the Midnight Crest pack—the wealthiest and most powerful Lycan territory in the country.

Glancing at the time, I realized I had just two hours to prepare. I showered quickly, dressed in comfortable yet presentable clothes—something that wouldn’t restrict movement—and left a note for my mother beside the extra meal I’d prepared.

The Uber arrived promptly. As we drove through the city, the scenery shifted from urban sprawl to sprawling estates, each more extravagant than the last.

Midnight Crest wasn’t just a pack—it was a kingdom. Towering gates marked the entrance, guarded by stone-faced Gammas who meticulously checked IDs. Even the Uber driver had to present his.

When the car finally stopped, I nearly gasped.

Before me stood a sprawling château, its grand façade framed by manicured gardens and a marble fountain glistening under the afternoon sun. It looked like something out of a European travel magazine.

"Are you sure this is the right place?" I asked the driver, unable to hide my disbelief.

"Yes, miss," he confirmed, unfazed.

Stepping out, I took a deep breath and approached the towering double doors. Before I could knock, one swung open, revealing a tall man with silver-streaked hair and piercing blue eyes. His smile was warm as he bowed slightly.

"Good afternoon. You must be Lillian Montague," he said in that familiar baritone—Theodore.

"Yes, sir," I replied, returning his smile.

"Theodore Whitmore, at your service. I oversee the estate and personally attend to Master Oliver when his father is away."

Curiosity got the better of me. "And his mother?"

His expression darkened briefly. "A... complicated matter. She isn’t involved." He cleared his throat. "Master Oliver is currently in the gardens with another tutor candidate."

My stomach twisted. Another candidate?

This wasn’t just an interview—it was a competition.

I trailed behind Theodore across the sprawling emerald lawn, my gaze drawn to the makeshift archery range in the distance. A young woman—perhaps a few years older than me—was attempting to instruct Oliver, but the boy was clearly giving her a hard time. His sharp tone made her flinch, and by the time we reached them, she was already in tears.

"I can't do this anymore," she choked out, backing away with trembling hands. "I'm so sorry." Without another word, she turned and fled, her sobs lingering in the air like a fading echo.

Theodore exhaled heavily, his shoulders sagging as if the weight of the world had settled upon them. Oliver, however, remained unfazed. His thick brows knitted together in frustration as he struggled to nock an arrow, his small fingers fumbling with the bowstring. Each attempt ended the same way—the arrow thudding into the grass mere feet away, its flight cut short.

"Mind if I take a look?" I asked, stepping forward.

Oliver shot me a skeptical glance over his shoulder, his piercing gaze sweeping from my boots to the top of my head. Never in my life had I felt so thoroughly assessed by a seven-year-old. But I kept my expression neutral, offering only a small, patient smile. After a tense moment, he relented, thrusting the bow and arrow into my hands with a huff.

Without hesitation, I drew the string back smoothly and released. The arrow whistled through the air before striking the bullseye with a satisfying thunk.

Oliver's jaw dropped.

"Whoa..." he breathed, eyes wide as saucers.

Grinning, I plucked another arrow from the quiver and repeated the motion—this time faster, my movements fluid. The second arrow landed right beside the first, dead center.

Both Oliver and Theodore gaped at me, their expressions identical in their astonishment.

Oliver tugged at Theodore's sleeve urgently.

"What's her name?" he demanded, his voice filled with newfound awe.

###Chapter 10 Problem here?

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains of Lillian's dorm room, stirring her awake. She stretched lazily, her muscles still sore from yesterday's intense combat training. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted in from the shared kitchen, making her stomach growl.

Rolling out of bed, she grabbed her phone and saw a message from Beatrice: "Meet me at the café in 20. Big news!"

Lillian frowned. Beatrice wasn’t usually this cryptic.

After a quick shower, she threw on a casual outfit—jeans and a loose sweater—and headed out. The campus was alive with students rushing to classes, their laughter filling the crisp autumn air.

When she arrived at Moonlight Brew, Gabrielle greeted her with a warm smile. "The usual?"

"Please," Lillian nodded, scanning the café for Beatrice.

Her best friend sat in their usual corner booth, bouncing with excitement. "You won’t believe what happened!"

Lillian slid into the seat across from her. "Spill."

Beatrice leaned in, lowering her voice. "I saw Donovan last night—with Evelyn."

Lillian’s grip tightened around her coffee cup. She had moved on, or so she told herself, but the mention of her ex-fated mate still stung. "And?"

"They were arguing. Loudly." Beatrice smirked. "Something about him still being hung up on you."

Lillian scoffed. "Doubtful."

But Beatrice wasn’t done. "Then guess who showed up? Sebastian Blackwood."

Lillian nearly choked on her coffee. "What?"

"Yeah. He just… stood there, watching them like some brooding shadow. Then he walked away without a word."

Lillian’s pulse quickened. Why would Sebastian care about Donovan’s drama? Unless…

Her thoughts were interrupted by a sharp voice. "Well, if it isn’t the reject and her sidekick."

Cassandra stood by their table, arms crossed, her usual sneer in place.

Beatrice rolled her eyes. "Get lost, Cass."

Cassandra ignored her, focusing on Lillian. "Heard you’ve been cozying up to the Lycan Chairman. Pathetic, really. First Donovan, now him? You really can’t stand being alone, can you?"

Lillian’s fingers twitched, her wolf itching to put the girl in her place. But before she could respond, a deep voice cut through the tension.

"Problem here?"

Sebastian stood behind Cassandra, his presence commanding immediate silence. His icy gaze flicked to her, and she paled.

"N-no, Alpha Blackwood," she stammered, backing away.

Sebastian watched her leave before turning to Lillian. "We need to talk."

Beatrice raised a brow but wisely kept quiet.

Lillian exhaled. "About?"

"Not here." His tone left no room for argument.

She hesitated, then nodded. "Fine."

As she followed him out, Beatrice mouthed, "Tell me everything later!"

Outside, Sebastian led her to a secluded spot near the campus gardens. The scent of blooming roses mixed with his rich, woodsy aroma, making her head spin.

"What’s going on?" she asked.

He turned to face her, his expression unreadable. "Donovan’s been asking questions about you."

Lillian stiffened. "So?"

"So," he stepped closer, his voice dropping to a growl, "he’s planning something. And I won’t let him near you again."

Her breath hitched. The intensity in his eyes sent a shiver down her spine.

Before she could respond, his phone buzzed. He glanced at it, his jaw tightening. "We’ll continue this later."

And just like that, he was gone, leaving Lillian standing there, heart racing.

What the hell had just happened?

And why did the thought of Sebastian protecting her make her stomach flutter?

"Are you frightened of me?" I inquired, tilting my head as I studied the boy before me. My gaze sharpened. "Or perhaps you lack the courage to demand what you truly want?"

Oliver appeared utterly taken aback by my bluntness. Unlike his previous tutors—who likely coddled him—I had no intention of softening my words. His cheeks flushed crimson as he dropped his gaze to the ground, while Theodore merely smirked in amusement.

"I'm Oliver," the boy declared, lifting his chin. "And you are?"

I crouched down to meet his eye level, offering a small smile. "You may address me as Lillian."

His posture stiffened, shoulders squaring as if preparing for battle.

"You're decent with a bow," he admitted, though his tone turned challenging. "But that doesn’t mean you’re skilled at everything." His piercing stare sent an unexpected pang through my chest. "All my tutors have been useless. You don’t look particularly strong or clever. I need someone who’s actually capable." He planted his hands on his hips, defiance radiating from his small frame.

"Quite the bold words for a seven-year-old," I remarked, impressed despite myself. "And how, precisely, do you expect me to prove myself, Master Oliver?"

A sly grin curled his lips before he marched toward a wooden bucket I hadn’t noticed earlier. My brows furrowed as I glimpsed its contents—daggers, glinting ominously in the sunlight. Nearby, training dummies stood at attention, clearly meant for target practice.

Then, without warning, Oliver snatched up two blades, gripping them with unsettling precision.

My eyes flicked to Theodore, whose face had drained of color. He tensed, ready to intervene—but it was already too late.

A dagger hurtled toward me with startling speed.

I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t impressed. The boy had strength and accuracy beyond his years.

Thankfully, my reflexes were sharper.

In one fluid motion, I twisted midair, narrowly avoiding the first blade—only for another to whistle past my ear. I landed on my palms, arching backward just as a third dagger grazed the space where my head had been.

Oliver didn’t relent. A fourth blade spun toward me, but this throw was sloppy—his focus wavering. Seizing the opening, I pivoted and delivered a swift kick to the dagger’s hilt, sending it ricocheting back toward him.

Horror spiked through me.

"Oliver—!"

He dropped to the ground just in time, the blade embedding itself in the dirt mere inches away.

I exhaled sharply, relief flooding my veins.

"How did you do that?" Oliver demanded, scrambling to his feet and dusting off his trousers.

Brushing dirt from my sleeves, I shrugged. "Years of training," I replied simply. "If I’m to be a Gamma warrior, I can’t afford to be careless."

His eyes gleamed with something akin to respect—and perhaps the barest hint of admiration.

Theodore, however, looked ready to faint.

"Always be prepared for every attack." When Oliver stared at me, dumbfounded, I arched a brow at him.

"You didn't know I was training to be a warrior?" I asked, tilting my head. "Do you usually throw daggers at people who haven’t trained?" His cheeks flushed pink again, and that was answer enough. I glanced at Theodore, who looked thoroughly chastised, his gaze fixed firmly on the ground, shame written all over his face.

Everything was starting to make sense now. Oliver truly was a little menace.

A deep, booming bark yanked me from my thoughts. I turned just in time to see a massive black wolfhound barreling toward us, tongue lolling, its thick tail wagging furiously as it bounded straight for Oliver.

Oliver grinned, wrapping his arms around the beast’s thick neck—though the dog was nearly as big as he was. "Shadow, what are you doing out here, boy? I thought you were inside," he cooed as the dog enthusiastically licked his face, making him laugh.

Smiling, I crouched down to meet the dog at eye level. He hadn’t noticed me yet, but the moment I moved, his head snapped toward me, golden eyes narrowing into slits.

"Shadow doesn’t take to strangers," Theodore warned, his voice tight with unease. "He bit the last tutor. She had to get stitches at the pack clinic."

I raised a brow. "Her wolf didn’t heal her?"

"She was an Omega. No wolf," Theodore explained.

I hummed thoughtfully, turning my attention back to Oliver and Shadow. The dog was now glaring at me, lips curled back to reveal sharp canines, a low growl rumbling in his chest.

But I didn’t flinch. Instead, I held out my hand, palm up, steady. Shadow took a step closer, and I could practically feel Theodore’s tension radiating behind me.

Still, I kept my breathing even, my gaze locked with the dog’s.

###Chapter 11 Want to try escaping from me?

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting a golden glow over Lillian’s room. She stretched lazily, her muscles still sore from yesterday’s training session with Professor Montclair. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted in from the hallway, making her stomach growl.

She barely had time to grab a quick breakfast before rushing to campus. Beatrice had texted her earlier, insisting they meet before class.

"Lillian! Over here!" Beatrice waved from their usual spot near the oak tree, her dark curls bouncing with every movement.

Lillian jogged over, slightly out of breath. "What’s so urgent?"

Beatrice leaned in, her voice dropping to a whisper. "You won’t believe what I just heard. Cassandra and Professor Sinclair are planning something. I overheard them talking in the library."

Lillian’s pulse quickened. "What kind of something?"

"I don’t know exactly, but it sounded like they’re targeting you. Again." Beatrice’s eyes darkened with concern. "You need to be careful."

Lillian clenched her fists. "I’m tired of this. If they want a fight, they’ll get one."

Beatrice grabbed her arm. "No, Lil. That’s exactly what they want. You can’t let them provoke you."

Before Lillian could respond, her phone buzzed. A message from Sebastian Blackwood.

"Meet me at the pack house after your last class. We need to talk."

Her stomach twisted. What now?

The pack house loomed before her, its grand architecture a stark reminder of Sebastian’s power. Lillian hesitated at the door, her fingers trembling slightly as she reached for the handle.

Inside, the air was thick with tension. Sebastian stood by the fireplace, his broad shoulders rigid. Oliver sat on the couch, his small frame dwarfed by the massive furniture.

"You wanted to see me?" Lillian’s voice was steadier than she felt.

Sebastian turned, his piercing gaze locking onto hers. "We have a problem."

Oliver looked up, his big eyes filled with worry. "Someone’s been spreading rumors about you, Lillian."

Lillian’s heart sank. "What kind of rumors?"

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "That you’re using me to climb the social ladder. That you’re not fit to be near my son."

Anger flared in her chest. "Who would—?"

"Cassandra," Sebastian cut in. "And she’s not working alone."

Lillian exhaled sharply. Of course.

Sebastian stepped closer, his voice low. "I won’t tolerate this. But I need to know—are you prepared for what comes next?"

Lillian met his gaze without flinching. "Try me."

A flicker of approval crossed his face. "Good. Because this isn’t just about rumors anymore. It’s war."

The door creaked open, and Marcus Grayson strode in, his expression grim. "Alpha, we have another issue. Donovan’s been spotted near the border."

Sebastian’s eyes darkened. "Perfect timing."

Lillian’s stomach churned. Donovan. Her past was catching up to her faster than she’d anticipated.

And this time, running wasn’t an option.

I’m not threatening, I repeated silently in my mind. I’m here as a friend.

Shadow sniffed my fingers cautiously, and I slowly lowered my hand to the ground. Then, to everyone’s astonishment, the massive wolf licked my fingertips before trotting the rest of the way toward me, allowing me to stroke his thick fur. A smile tugged at my lips as I ran my fingers through his soft coat. His tail thumped excitedly against the ground, nearly knocking me off balance as the earth trembled beneath his weight.

"H—how did you do that?" Oliver blurted, his eyes wide with disbelief. "Shadow never likes strangers."

I shrugged casually. "Animals have always trusted me," I admitted. "When I was little, I had a dog named Caramel—she was the exact color of melted caramel." Oliver snorted at the name, and I grinned. Shadow nuzzled against me affectionately before padding back to his young master’s side. "My parents got her for me because they were never home. Caramel kept me company," I finished softly.

Something flickered in Oliver’s gaze—something that looked suspiciously like sadness—before he turned his attention back to Shadow. "My dad’s never home either," he muttered. "That’s why Shadow stays with me. He protects me from bad people. Like the last tutor—she only pretended to care about teaching me so she could get close to my father."

My stomach twisted. What kind of woman would use a child like that? Who was his father to her?

Theodore cleared his throat. "Why don’t I take Shadow back inside so you two can get better acquainted?" He stepped forward, but Shadow immediately bared his teeth in warning.

Oliver smirked. "Careful, Theodore. You might end up as his next snack."

Theodore muttered something under his breath—something I didn’t catch—but he managed to coax Shadow away, leaving me alone with Oliver.

The boy crossed his arms, studying me with sharp, assessing eyes. "You’ve got good reflexes," he conceded. "But that doesn’t mean you’re strong. Or smart."

I arched a brow. "If it’s my intelligence you’re questioning, I graduated top of my class in high school, and I’m currently a college student with honors." It felt ridiculous boasting to a seven-year-old, but Oliver wasn’t an ordinary child. He was sizing me up, testing me. "As for strength," I continued, "I’m training to be a Gamma warrior. How would you like me to prove myself?"

His lips curled into that mischievous smirk I was already learning to recognize. Trouble. I took a cautious step back.

"Let’s play a game," he announced suddenly.

I narrowed my eyes. "What kind of game?"

"Escape. Ever played it?"

Escape was a game where the opponent tried to break free from the other's hold. I'd only ever played it with people around my age—never with someone much younger. This was going to be interesting.

"Want to try escaping from me?" I asked him.

Oliver nodded eagerly, puffing out his chest. "I might be seven, but I'm really strong," he declared, hands planted firmly on his hips.

A grin tugged at my lips. "I don’t doubt that," I said, ruffling his hair. "Alright, let’s see what you’ve got."

Before he could even brace himself, I had him pinned to the ground. To his credit, he put up a decent fight—stronger than I expected. The way he strained against me made me wonder why a kid his age trained so hard. It took me a moment to adjust, but soon enough, I had him completely immobilized.

He wriggled beneath me, cheeks flushing pink with frustration. "I thought you were stronger than this?" I teased, unable to resist.

His pout deepened, and I laughed, the sound bright and unrestrained. "If I’m your tutor, we can work on it," I promised.

Just as he made another valiant attempt to break free, footsteps echoed nearby. At first, I assumed it was Theodore returning, but then another set joined—lighter, quicker. Oliver went still, his head snapping toward the sound.

His face lit up like the sun breaking through storm clouds, a radiant smile I hadn’t seen from him before. "Dad!" he shouted, pure joy in his voice.

I turned my head—and my stomach dropped straight to the floor.

Standing there, watching us with an unreadable expression, was none other than Sebastian Blackwood.

###Chapter 12 Lillian's POV

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting golden streaks across the room. Lillian stretched lazily, her body still humming with the remnants of last night’s adrenaline. The scent of freshly brewed coffee wafted in from the hallway, signaling that Sebastian was already awake.

She rolled out of bed, her bare feet sinking into the plush carpet. The events of the previous evening replayed in her mind—Donovan’s unexpected appearance, the tension in the air, the way Sebastian’s grip had tightened around her waist possessively. A shiver ran down her spine.

Padding into the bathroom, she splashed cold water on her face, trying to shake off the lingering unease. The reflection staring back at her was a mix of exhaustion and defiance. I won’t let him get to me, she thought, gripping the edge of the sink.

Downstairs, the mansion was alive with quiet activity. Giselle, the head maid, was directing the staff with her usual efficiency, while Lucien, the flirtatious head chef, winked at her from the kitchen doorway. "Morning, ma chérie," he called, his French accent thick. "Hungry?"

Lillian smirked. "Starving."

She found Sebastian in the dining room, his broad frame hunched over a stack of documents. His dark hair was slightly tousled, as if he’d been running his fingers through it in frustration. Oliver sat beside him, swinging his legs and chattering excitedly about his upcoming school project.

"Morning," Lillian said, sliding into the seat across from them.

Sebastian’s gaze flicked up, his stormy eyes softening as they met hers. "Sleep well?"

"Like the dead," she lied, reaching for the coffee pot.

Oliver grinned. "Dad said we’re going horseback riding today! You’re coming, right?"

Lillian hesitated, glancing at Sebastian. His expression was unreadable, but there was a silent plea in his eyes. He wants me there.

"Of course," she said, ruffling Oliver’s hair. "Wouldn’t miss it."

The moment was shattered by the sharp ring of Sebastian’s phone. He scowled at the screen before answering. "Blackwood."

Lillian watched as his jaw clenched, the muscles tightening. Whatever was being said on the other end wasn’t good.

"We’ll handle it," he growled before hanging up.

"What’s wrong?" she asked.

Sebastian exhaled sharply. "Donovan’s making moves. He’s trying to rally support against me."

Lillian’s stomach twisted. "Because of me."

Sebastian’s gaze hardened. "Because he’s a fool who doesn’t know when to walk away."

Oliver, sensing the tension, poked at his pancakes nervously. Lillian forced a smile. "Hey, how about we get ready for that ride? I bet I can beat you to the stables."

Oliver perked up immediately, his worries forgotten. "No way! I’m faster!"

As he dashed off, Sebastian caught Lillian’s wrist. "We’ll deal with Donovan," he murmured, his voice low and dangerous. "But today—today is for Oliver."

She nodded, her pulse quickening at the intensity in his eyes.

Because she knew one thing for certain: when Sebastian Blackwood made a promise, he kept it.

And Donovan had just made the biggest mistake of his life.

"Sebastian, how could you allow just anyone to walk into my home?" My voice trembled with barely contained fury. "Is there no longer any order in this household? And you left her alone with my son—what were you thinking?"

Oliver had already rushed to his father’s side, leaving me standing frozen, my gaze locked onto Sebastian Blackwood’s piercing eyes. My stomach twisted in disbelief. Him. Of all people, why did it have to be him? The universe seemed determined to play a cruel joke on me. Why couldn’t I escape this man?

Sebastian ran a hand through Oliver’s hair before stepping around him, closing the distance between us. His dark eyes simmered with irritation, clearly displeased by my presence in his villa.

"I thought I made myself clear, Miss Dumont," he said, his voice a low, dangerous growl. "We weren’t meant to cross paths again. Showing up at my home is… excessive, don’t you think?"

Heat flooded my cheeks. The implication was clear—he thought I had come here for him. But nothing could be further from the truth. I was here because of the tutoring job posted on the werewolf employment board.

When I didn’t respond immediately, his jaw tightened. "Nothing to say?"

I was still reeling. Of course, I knew this was Sebastian’s pack territory, but I hadn’t connected the dots—this grand villa belonged to the Alpha. And worse, I had no idea he had a son. The media only ever spoke of his daughter, Victoria. Why was Oliver kept a secret?

Sebastian turned to Theodore Whitmore, his butler, who looked just as stunned as I felt. The poor man was clearly scrambling to piece together what was happening.

"Remove Miss Dumont from my property immediately," Sebastian commanded, his gaze snapping back to me.

His eyes darkened, nearly black, and for a heartbeat, they raked over me with an intensity that made my skin prickle. I had dressed casually—workout shorts and a fitted crop top—for ease of movement, but under his scrutiny, I suddenly felt exposed. Vulnerable.

His attention lingered on my bare stomach, then trailed down to my legs. A slow, unwelcome warmth spread through me, my pulse hammering in my throat. When his eyes finally met mine again, they burned with something unreadable.

I couldn’t look away. It was as if he had me under a spell, my breath hitching under the weight of his stare.

"Alpha, there’s been a misunderstanding," Theodore interjected, snapping me out of my trance. "I apologize for not speaking sooner."

I swallowed hard, forcing steel into my voice. "I’m not here for you, Alpha Blackwood. I’m here because you posted a tutoring position. I have the qualifications, and I was invited by your butler. Had I known you were the master of this house, I wouldn’t have come."

I snatched my bag from the floor, pulling out my résumé as Sebastian stared at me, momentarily speechless. Theodore quickly added, "I did inform you that candidates were coming today, Alpha. Miss Dumont was among them. I never disclosed your name in the listing—for confidentiality reasons."

Sebastian’s expression shifted, the anger fading into something almost… sheepish. I bit back a smirk as I extended my résumé toward him.

After a brief hesitation, he took it, scanning the page. His brows furrowed. "You’ve had warrior training?"

I nodded. "I’m currently studying combat. Top of my class in every discipline. This tutoring position would be an excellent addition to my credentials."

His gaze flicked back to me, assessing. The air between us crackled with tension—unresolved, electric.

And just like that, the game had changed.
###Chapter 13 The Moonlight Confession

The night air was crisp as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s mansion, her fingers gripping the railing. The full moon cast an ethereal glow over the estate, painting everything in silver. She exhaled, watching her breath form a mist in the chilly air.

Inside, the party continued—laughter, clinking glasses, the hum of conversation. But out here, it was just her and the quiet.

Until footsteps approached.

She didn’t need to turn to know who it was. The scent of sandalwood and something distinctly alpha gave him away.

"Escaping the festivities?" Sebastian’s voice was low, smooth, like dark chocolate.

Lillian smirked. "Just needed some air. Your guests are… enthusiastic."

He chuckled, stepping beside her. "They always are when free alcohol is involved."

Silence settled between them, comfortable yet charged. She could feel his gaze on her, studying her profile.

"You’re different tonight," he murmured.

She raised a brow. "Different how?"

"Less guarded."

Lillian hesitated. It was true. Something about tonight—the moon, the way he’d subtly shielded her from prying eyes all evening—made her defenses waver.

Before she could respond, a burst of laughter echoed from inside. Evelyn’s voice, sharp and mocking, cut through the noise.

"Honestly, Donovan, she’s practically feral. What did you ever see in her?"

Lillian stiffened.

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "Ignore them."

She forced a laugh. "Oh, I do. Every damn day."

But the words stung. Because no matter how much she pretended, the rejection still ached.

Sebastian turned to face her fully, his golden eyes intense. "You’re worth ten of her."

The sincerity in his voice made her breath catch.

Lillian swallowed. "You don’t have to say that."

"I don’t say things I don’t mean." His hand brushed hers, sending a jolt of warmth up her arm. "You’re strong. Clever. Loyal. And you have no idea how rare that is."

Her pulse raced. This was dangerous. He was dangerous. Not because he was an alpha, not because he was powerful—but because when he looked at her like that, she wanted to believe him.

She opened her mouth to reply—

A crash from inside shattered the moment.

Sebastian’s head snapped toward the sound, his body tensing. "Stay here."

But Lillian was already moving. "Not a chance."

They pushed through the crowd to find Oliver standing amidst shattered glass, his small frame trembling. Evelyn loomed over him, her face twisted in fury.

"You little brat! Do you know how expensive that was?"

Sebastian was at his son’s side in an instant. "What happened?"

Oliver’s lower lip wobbled. "I—I didn’t mean to—"

Evelyn scoffed. "He knocked over the champagne tower. Obviously."

Lillian’s blood boiled. She stepped forward. "He’s seven."

Evelyn’s eyes narrowed. "Stay out of this, mutt."

Sebastian’s growl silenced the room. "Enough."

The air thickened with tension.

Then—

A slow clap echoed from the doorway.

Donovan leaned against the frame, smirking. "Dramatic as always, Blackwood."

Sebastian’s gaze turned glacial. "You’re not welcome here."

Donovan shrugged. "Just came to collect my mate." He shot Lillian a mocking glance. "Though it seems you’ve found a replacement."

Lillian’s fists clenched.

Sebastian stepped between them, his voice deadly quiet. "Leave."

For a heartbeat, no one moved.

Then Donovan chuckled, grabbing Evelyn’s arm. "Come on, darling. Let’s not ruin the happy couple’s night."

As they disappeared into the crowd, Oliver sniffled. Sebastian knelt, brushing glass from his son’s shoes. "You okay, champ?"

Oliver nodded, but his eyes were wide with unshed tears.

Lillian crouched beside them. "Hey, accidents happen. Want to help me sneak some dessert from the kitchen?"

A small smile tugged at Oliver’s lips.

Sebastian met her gaze over his son’s head, something unreadable in his expression.

And in that moment, Lillian realized—

She was in deep trouble.

Because the longer she stayed, the harder it would be to leave.

And part of her didn’t want to.

Sebastian handed back the results without a word, his piercing gaze briefly scanning the document before shifting to his son. The air between us grew thick with tension, almost unbearably awkward. Oliver kept glancing between me and his father, his young eyes brimming with unspoken questions.

"And what do you want, Oliver?" Sebastian asked, his deep voice cutting through the silence.

The boy hesitated, his eyes flickering toward me. A part of me braced for rejection—for him to declare he never wanted to see me again. Had I even made an impression? Or was I just another tutor destined to be replaced? But then, Oliver's face lit up with a bright smile as he turned back to his father.

"I want Lillian," he declared, stunning all of us.

Sebastian and Theodore exchanged shocked glances, though Theodore's surprise quickly melted into amusement. Sebastian arched a brow, studying his son.

"You're sure?" he asked.

Oliver nodded eagerly.

"I thought she was just another tutor, but she's different, Dad. She actually listens. She makes learning fun. I want her to train me—to help me be the best," he said proudly, casting me a quick glance before looking back at his father.

Warmth swelled in my chest, and I had to bite back a smile. Even Sebastian's stern expression softened slightly as he regarded his son.

Then his gaze landed on me, and my pulse stuttered.

"My son doesn't usually take to tutors. The fact that he likes you speaks volumes," he said, his voice low and measured.

Heat rushed to my cheeks. Was that… a compliment? I cleared my throat, scrambling to regain my composure.

"You're the man of the house," I said, lifting my chin. "If you'd prefer, I can leave. I didn’t mean to intrude."

"Dad?" Oliver tugged at Sebastian's sleeve, his small face pinched with worry.

Sebastian ruffled his son's hair gently.

"Go with Theodore inside. I need to speak with Lillian for a moment," he murmured.

Oliver hesitated, glancing between us before nodding. He followed Theodore into the villa, leaving me alone with Sebastian.

I crossed my arms, bracing myself for whatever came next.

"I'll go," I said before he could dismiss me. "I honestly had no idea you were his father."

For a fleeting second, something unreadable flickered in his eyes.

"I'm not sending you away," he surprised me by saying. "Oliver likes you, and that’s rare. I won’t take that from him. You can stay as his tutor."

Relief washed over me. "Oh. Well… thank you," I said, extending my hand.

He didn’t take it. Instead, he folded his arms across his broad chest, his gaze locking onto mine with an intensity that made my breath hitch. The silence stretched, thick and heavy, until I slowly lowered my hand, my nerves prickling under his scrutiny.

"There are conditions," Sebastian finally spoke after what felt like an eternity.

I arched a brow—of course it wouldn’t be that simple. Nothing with him ever was.

"What kind of conditions?" I asked, tilting my head slightly.

His gaze flickered over me, lingering just a second too long on my bare midriff before snapping back to my eyes. "For starters, you can’t wear clothes like that again."

I blinked, glancing down at my cropped tank top and denim shorts. The outfit was hardly scandalous, but the way his jaw tightened told me he disagreed.

A slow smirk curled my lips as I remembered earlier—how his eyes had darkened when he first saw me, how they had trailed down my body with something far more primal than disapproval.

Taking a deliberate step closer, I dropped my voice to a husky whisper. "Why is that, Alpha Blackwood?" My fingers toyed with the hem of my top, lifting it just a fraction higher. "Afraid you won’t be able to resist?"

His nostrils flared, and for a heartbeat, I swore I saw a flicker of hunger in those storm-gray eyes. But then his expression shuttered, his voice turning to steel.

"Because I won’t have my future Luna parading around like some careless pup."

I scoffed, rolling my eyes. "Oh, please. You’re not my Alpha yet."

His hand shot out, gripping my wrist before I could retreat. The contact sent a jolt of heat up my arm. "Aren’t I?"

The challenge in his tone made my pulse stutter.

I leaned in, close enough that my breath ghosted over his lips. "Prove it."

A muscle ticked in his jaw. "Careful, Lillian. You’re playing with fire."

I grinned. "Good thing I don’t burn easily."

His grip tightened, and for one dizzying moment, I thought he might actually kiss me.

Then his phone buzzed, shattering the tension.

He released me with a growl, stepping back to check the message. His expression darkened further.

"We’ll finish this later," he muttered, already turning away.

I crossed my arms, watching him go. "Promises, promises."

He paused at the door, glancing over his shoulder. "Wear something decent tomorrow. We have guests."

I opened my mouth to retort, but he was already gone.

Sighing, I flopped onto the bed, staring at the ceiling.

This was going to be so much harder than I thought.

And yet…

I couldn’t help the thrill that shot through me at the thought of our next encounter.

Sebastian Blackwood had no idea what he’d just signed up for.

And I couldn’t wait to show him.

###Chapter 14 Lillian's POV

The moment the words left Donovan's lips, Lillian felt her entire world tilt on its axis. Her breath hitched, her pulse roaring in her ears like a storm.

"You're my fated mate?"

The words tasted bitter, unreal. She had spent months convincing herself that the bond between them was nothing more than a cruel trick of fate—something to be ignored, something she had to ignore.

But now, standing in the dimly lit hallway of Sebastian Blackwood’s estate, Donovan’s dark eyes bore into hers with an intensity that made her knees weak. His scent—spiced cedar and something distinctly him—wrapped around her, pulling at instincts she had fought so hard to suppress.

She took a step back, her fingers curling into fists at her sides. "That's impossible," she whispered.

Donovan’s lips twisted into a humorless smile. "Is it?" He took a slow step forward, his voice dropping to a low, dangerous murmur. "You felt it too, didn’t you? That pull. That need."

Lillian’s throat tightened. She had felt it. Every time he was near, every time their eyes met, her wolf had stirred restlessly beneath her skin, yearning for something she refused to acknowledge.

But she couldn’t—wouldn’t—give in. Not after everything.

"You left me," she said, her voice trembling. "You chose Evelyn. You rejected me."

His jaw clenched, shadows flickering across his expression. "I was a fool."

A bitter laugh escaped her. "And now what? You think you can just waltz back into my life and claim me?"

Donovan’s gaze darkened. "I don’t think anything, Lillian. I know." He closed the distance between them in one swift stride, his hand catching hers before she could retreat further. "Fate doesn’t make mistakes."

Her breath came in short, sharp gasps as his fingers intertwined with hers, sending a jolt of electricity up her arm. The bond between them flared to life, undeniable, inescapable.

And for the first time, she was terrified—not of him, but of the part of her that wanted this.

A door creaked open down the hall, and suddenly, Sebastian’s deep voice cut through the tension like a blade.

"Lillian?"

She flinched, yanking her hand free as if burned.

Donovan’s lips curled into a smirk, his eyes never leaving hers. "This isn’t over."

And as Sebastian’s imposing figure rounded the corner, Lillian realized with dawning horror that the game had just become infinitely more complicated.

Because now, she had two wolves vying for her heart.

And one of them was her fated mate.

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the lavish bedroom, rousing Lillian from her restless sleep. She blinked against the light, her body still humming with the remnants of last night’s adrenaline. The scent of pine and musk clung to the sheets—Sebastian’s scent. A shiver ran down her spine as fragmented memories of their heated argument resurfaced.

"You don’t get to decide what’s best for me!"

Her fists clenched. She hated how easily he could unravel her composure.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Miss Lillian?" Sophia, the head maid, peeked in, balancing a silver tray. "Breakfast is ready. Alpha Blackwood requested you join him in the dining room."

Lillian groaned inwardly. Of course he did.

She dragged herself out of bed, her muscles protesting from yesterday’s training session with Professor Montgomery. The bruises on her arms were already fading, thanks to her werewolf healing, but the sting of humiliation lingered.

Downstairs, the dining hall was bathed in sunlight, the long mahogany table set with delicate china. Sebastian sat at the head, impeccably dressed in a tailored navy suit, his dark eyes scanning documents. Oliver, his son, was animatedly recounting his latest adventure to Theodore, the butler.

Sebastian glanced up as she entered, his gaze sharp. "Sleep well?"

Lillian ignored the sarcasm dripping from his tone. "Like a baby."

Oliver beamed. "Lillian! Did you know Uncle Nathaniel is visiting from Paris next week? He promised to bring me macarons!"

She forced a smile. "That’s exciting."

Sebastian set his papers aside. "We have a situation."

Lillian stiffened. "What now?"

"Donovan’s pack is challenging our territory rights near the northern border. They’re claiming it was part of Evelyn’s dowry."

Her blood ran cold. Evelyn. The mere mention of Donovan’s new mate made her stomach twist.

Sebastian leaned forward, his voice low. "I need you to come with me to the council meeting tonight."

"Why?" She crossed her arms. "So you can use me as leverage?"

His jaw tightened. "So you can finally stop running from your past."

The air between them crackled with tension.

Oliver, oblivious, piped up, "Can I come too?"

Theodore chuckled. "I’m afraid not, young master. But how about we visit the stables after breakfast?"

As the conversation shifted, Lillian’s mind raced. She had avoided facing Donovan since their bond shattered. But Sebastian was right—she couldn’t hide forever.

And if Donovan thought he could manipulate her through pack politics, he had another thing coming.

My gaze lingered on Sebastian's throat as his Adam's apple bobbed slightly.

Only when he straightened his posture and tilted his head toward me did I realize how close I was standing. My breath hitched, and I swallowed hard, fighting the inexplicable urge to reach out and trace the strong line of his jaw.

What is wrong with me lately?

It had to be the aftermath of Donovan’s betrayal. The wound was still fresh, my wolf subdued in grief. Yet whenever Sebastian was near, she stirred—awakening just a little more each time.

She liked him.

But the pain of our broken mate bond still throbbed beneath my skin. The mark Donovan had left on my neck burned whenever he so much as glanced at Victoria. The agony of rejection was relentless.

No wonder I was clinging to the first attractive man who crossed my path.

The corners of Sebastian’s lips curved into a smirk.

"I keep my professional and personal lives separate," he said, his voice a deep rumble that sent warmth spiraling through me. My cheeks burned. "I don’t want my staff thinking I harass my subordinates. Dress appropriately—nothing suggestive."

My jaw nearly dropped. I crossed my arms over my chest and glared, uncaring that he was a Lycan Alpha and that defiance was dangerous. Most Alphas would take direct eye contact as a challenge.

"This is normal college attire," I snapped. "Are you really that archaic?"

His brows lifted.

"Are you seriously questioning me?" His tone sharpened. "Or have you forgotten who signs your paychecks now?"

I opened my mouth to retort—then snapped it shut.

Right.

Sebastian Blackwood was my employer. His rules dictated my paycheck. And my parents desperately needed the money. This job was too good to risk over something as petty as wardrobe choices.

Better to comply.

"I apologize," I forced out. "That was disrespectful. I’ll dress more conservatively next time."

He studied me for a long moment before giving a single nod.

"Inside. We’ll discuss your schedule, and my Beta will draft your contract."

He turned toward the mansion. I followed—

Then froze.

A rustling sound came from the bushes. Before I could react, Oliver sprang out, water gun in hand.

No.

My white crop top would turn transparent if soaked. I barely had time to gasp before a stream of water shot toward me—

Sebastian moved faster than I thought possible.

In an instant, he was in front of me, his arms wrapping protectively around my body. The warmth of his embrace cocooned me, shielding me from the spray. Water drenched his shirt instead.

Oliver’s laughter rang out.

A low, warning growl rumbled from Sebastian’s chest.

His Wrath Was Palpable


Sebastian's intoxicating cologne enveloped me, sending my pulse into overdrive as his towering frame pressed against mine. Before I could stop myself, I melted into his embrace, hyperaware of every sculpted ridge of his torso molding against my back. His powerful arms cinched around my waist like steel bands, igniting a wildfire across my skin that pooled low in my belly.

A feral growl rumbled from his chest, his heated breath skating across my nape. My breath hitched as goosebumps erupted everywhere his lips nearly grazed. The air thickened with the scent of my traitorous desire—could he detect how shamelessly my body responded to him?

Then he was gone. The sudden absence of his touch left me shivering as he whirled toward his snickering son. "Oliver Blackwood," Sebastian snarled, voice dripping with lethal calm. "Explain this disobedience."

The boy's laughter died instantly. When I glimpsed his ashen face, even his freckles seemed to pale under his father's glacial stare. Oliver's small fingers twisted together—a rare show of nerves from the usually bold child.

###Chapter 15 what happened?
The morning sun cast golden rays through the tall windows of the Blackwood estate, painting the grand halls in warm hues. Lillian stretched beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming from the intensity of last night’s full moon run with Sebastian. His presence lingered in the room—his scent, his warmth—even though he had already left for an early meeting.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Miss Lillian?" Harper’s voice was gentle but firm. "Breakfast is ready. Alpha Blackwood requested that you join him in the dining hall."

Lillian sighed, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. "Tell him I’ll be down in ten."

She dressed quickly, opting for a simple yet elegant navy-blue dress that hugged her curves. The Blackwood mansion was a labyrinth of luxury, but she had memorized the path to the dining hall by now.

Sebastian sat at the head of the long mahogany table, his sharp features softened slightly by the morning light. His dark eyes flicked up as she entered, a smirk playing on his lips. "Sleep well?"

"Like a log," she lied, sliding into the seat beside him. The truth was, she had spent half the night replaying the way his fingers had brushed against hers under the moonlight.

Theodore, the ever-efficient butler, placed a plate of fresh fruit and pastries in front of her. "Coffee, Miss?"

"Yes, please. Black."

Sebastian raised a brow. "No cream or sugar?"

"I like my coffee like I like my men," she quipped before she could stop herself. "Strong and bitter."

A slow grin spread across his face. "Is that so?"

Heat crept up her neck. She busied herself with her food, avoiding his gaze.

The moment was shattered when Oliver burst into the room, his small face alight with excitement. "Lillian! You’re awake!"

She grinned, ruffling his hair. "Good morning, trouble. What’s got you so hyper?"

"Dad said we’re going to the lake today! You’re coming, right?"

Sebastian cleared his throat. "If she wants to."

Oliver pouted. "She has to."

Lillian laughed. "Well, if it’s an order from the future Alpha, how can I refuse?"

Sebastian’s phone buzzed, his expression darkening as he read the message. "Victoria’s back."

The air in the room shifted. Lillian’s fork stilled. "And?"

"She’s bringing Donovan with her."

Her stomach twisted. The man who had once been her fated mate—now engaged to Sebastian’s daughter. The irony was almost laughable.

Oliver, oblivious to the tension, tugged at her sleeve. "You’ll still come to the lake, right?"

She forced a smile. "Of course."

But as Sebastian’s gaze locked onto hers, she knew—today was going to be anything but simple.

"I just wanted to see how she'd react," Oliver said with a careless shrug.

Sebastian's jaw tightened, his voice a low growl. "That's enough. You're grounded until further notice."

"W-what?" Oliver's eyes widened, tears welling up instantly. "But... it was just a joke!"

I couldn't help but feel a pang of sympathy for the boy. It was just water—a harmless prank. But I wasn’t about to interfere with Sebastian’s discipline.

Theodore rushed out of the villa, towel in hand, having witnessed the scene.

"Go to your room, Oliver," Sebastian commanded, then turned his sharp gaze to Theodore. "Take him."

"Yes, Alpha," Theodore murmured, bowing his head before guiding Oliver inside.

I took the towel from Theodore and moved toward Sebastian, pressing it against his soaked back. His shirt clung to him, nearly transparent, revealing the sculpted muscles beneath. My mind flashed back to that night in the VIP suite—my fingers tracing the same ridges, the same powerful contours. A shiver ran through me.

Without thinking, my free hand slipped beneath his shirt, fingertips grazing his skin. His muscles tensed under my touch, his breathing growing heavier, matching the quickening rhythm of mine. The air between us thickened, charged with something unspoken.

I bit my lip as my fingers trailed lower, skimming the dip of his spine.

"Ollie, what happened?" A soft, feminine voice shattered the moment.

I jerked my hand away, cheeks burning. What was I doing? And why hadn’t he stopped me?

Sebastian adjusted his shirt with a sharp tug, clearing his throat before snatching the towel from my grasp. I dropped my hands to my sides, staring at the ground, willing the heat in my face to fade.

"Dad grounded me," Oliver mumbled.

Victoria—because of course it was her—arched a delicate brow. "And what did you do this time?"

"I just wanted to have fun," Oliver admitted, scuffing his shoe against the ground. "I sprayed them with water."

Theodore gave a polite nod. "I was just escorting him to his room. Excuse us, Madam Victoria."

At the sound of her name, I finally looked up.

Victoria stood before us, flawless as ever in a soft pink sundress that hugged her curves. Her golden hair was woven into an elegant braid, her makeup minimal—because she didn’t need it. The sight of her twisted something sharp in my chest.

She watched Theodore lead Oliver away before turning to her father with a frown.

"What was that about?" Victoria asked, her voice laced with curiosity as she studied her father’s tense expression.

"Your brother and his endless games," Sebastian muttered under his breath, his jaw tightening. "That boy needs to learn some respect."

As if the universe itself was mocking me, Donovan rounded the corner at that exact moment, completely unaware of the thick tension hanging in the air. Victoria’s sharp eyes flickered toward me, her brow furrowing in confusion before she turned back to her father with a silent question. But my attention was locked onto Donovan—his presence alone was enough to drown out everything else.

The second his gaze landed on me standing beside Sebastian, his entire body stiffened. His eyes darkened, a storm of irritation brewing in their depths.

I bit down on my lower lip, refusing to look away. A low, almost imperceptible growl rumbled from his chest, sending a shiver down my spine.

Victoria’s head snapped toward him, her arms crossing over her chest as she frowned. "Who is this woman?" she demanded, her voice sharp. "Do you know her?"

The air between us crackled with unspoken tension, and I could practically see the gears turning in Donovan’s mind—weighing his next words carefully.

But before he could answer, Victoria’s piercing gaze shifted back to me, suspicion and something else—something like worry—flashing in her eyes.

And in that moment, I knew.

This wasn’t over. Not even close.
###Chapter 16 - Lillian's POV

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the lavish bedroom, rousing Lillian from her restless sleep. She blinked against the light, her mind still tangled in the remnants of a dream—one where Donovan’s cold laughter echoed in her ears.

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Miss Lillian?" Harper’s gentle voice filtered through. "Breakfast is ready. Mr. Blackwood is waiting."

Lillian groaned, rubbing her temples. The events of last night still weighed heavily on her—Sebastian’s unexpected protectiveness, the way his fingers had lingered against her wrist when he pulled her away from Donovan.

She dressed quickly, opting for a simple blouse and jeans, then made her way downstairs.

The dining room was bathed in sunlight, the scent of freshly brewed coffee and warm pastries filling the air. Sebastian sat at the head of the table, impeccably dressed in a tailored suit, his sharp gaze flicking up as she entered.

"You’re late," he remarked, though there was no real irritation in his tone.

Lillian resisted the urge to roll her eyes. "I didn’t realize I had a curfew."

A smirk tugged at his lips. "You don’t. But punctuality is a virtue."

She took her seat beside Oliver, who grinned at her around a mouthful of pancakes. "Morning, Lillian!"

"Morning, kiddo," she replied, ruffling his hair.

Sebastian’s phone buzzed, and his expression darkened as he read the message. "We have a problem."

Lillian tensed. "What is it?"

"Donovan’s pack is making moves against us," he said, setting the phone down. "He’s rallying allies, spreading rumors."

Her stomach twisted. "Because of me."

Sebastian’s gaze locked onto hers, intense and unreadable. "Because he’s a fool who doesn’t know when to let go."

Oliver frowned. "Is Uncle Donovan being mean again?"

Lillian forced a smile. "It’s grown-up stuff, sweetheart. Don’t worry about it."

But Sebastian wasn’t finished. "We need to act first. I won’t let him threaten what’s mine."

The possessiveness in his voice sent a shiver down her spine.

Before she could respond, Marcus entered, his expression grim. "Alpha, we’ve got company. The Winslows are here."

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "Of course they are."

Lillian’s pulse spiked. The Winslows—Donovan’s family.

Sebastian stood, his presence commanding. "Stay here," he ordered, though his eyes softened slightly when they met hers. "I’ll handle this."

But as he strode out, Lillian knew one thing for certain—this wasn’t just his fight anymore.

It was hers too.

My breath hitched as Donovan stood before me, his arm linked with Victoria's. My wolf recoiled instantly, retreating to the deepest corners of my mind, shutting me out completely.

"Donovan?" Victoria repeated, her fingers brushing his sleeve. He was too busy glaring at me with those stormy eyes to notice. But the moment she touched him, he blinked, as if snapping back to reality. His gaze flickered to her, softening at the concern etched on her face.

"Do you know her?" she asked again.

His jaw tightened before he forced a dismissive shake of his head. "No. Must’ve been mistaken." His voice was cold, detached. "Never seen her before."

The words sliced through me like a blade. Two years together—and now, we were nothing but strangers?

Victoria still looked uncertain, her blue eyes flickering between us. I was too numb to speak, my heart bleeding as Donovan pulled her closer, murmuring something reassuring.

"Donovan was probably just surprised I brought a woman home," Sebastian interjected smoothly, his deep voice cutting through the tension.

The sound snapped me back to the present. I tore my gaze from Donovan and looked up at Sebastian. His expression was calm, but his eyes—sharp, assessing—locked onto Donovan like a silent warning.

Understanding dawned in Victoria’s eyes, and she turned to me with unexpected warmth. "Father never brings anyone here," she admitted with a light laugh. "You must be special. I’m sorry for the awkward introduction. I’m Victoria Blackwood, and this is my fiancé, Donovan Winslow."

I forced a smile, refusing to let my pain show. None of this was her fault. She seemed kind—genuine. The least I could do was play along, especially since I’d be tutoring Oliver here.

"Nice to meet you," I said carefully. "I’m Lillian Dumont."

"Dumont?" Her brows knitted together. "That name sounds familiar. Where have I heard it?"

"My father is Reginald Dumont," I answered. "The Delta of the Silvercrest Pack."

Recognition flashed in her eyes, followed by sympathy. "Oh… I heard about what happened with his company. I’m so sorry."

I nodded stiffly. The last thing I wanted was to discuss my family’s downfall with the woman my mate had chosen over me.

Victoria, perceptive, cleared her throat and turned to Sebastian with playful accusation. "Father, where did you find this stunning woman? You never told me you were seeing someone!"

Sebastian’s jaw twitched. "I’m not seeing Miss Dumont," he corrected sharply. "She’s Oliver’s new tutor."

Victoria’s eyes widened.

"Another tutor?" Victoria arched a perfectly sculpted eyebrow, her lips curling into a smirk. "What number is that? Forty?"

"Forty-nine," Sebastian murmured, his deep voice carrying an edge of finality. "But this one is different. Oliver seems to have taken a liking to Lillian. I'm hoping she'll stay."

"A tutor, huh?" Donovan's gaze locked onto mine, something unsettling flickering in his dark eyes. He looked almost... relieved. Excited, even. As if the revelation that I wasn't here as Sebastian's lover but merely as Oliver's tutor had sparked something in him.

Sebastian cleared his throat, his expression darkening as he leveled Donovan with a glare that could freeze fire.

"You should start considering your wedding date," Sebastian said, his voice dangerously smooth. "Make sure neither of you has any... lingering attachments. Devotion is key in a mating bond, after all."

Donovan paled, his fingers twitching at his sides. The unspoken threat hung heavy in the air—Sebastian knew. He knew about my past with Donovan, about the bond that had once tied us together. And this was his warning.

Victoria, oblivious to the tension, merely giggled and looped her arm through Donovan's, pressing herself against him. "Oh, we are devoted," she purred, flashing me a triumphant smile. "Donovan is the best mate I've ever had."

She pulled away just enough to reach into the neckline of her dress, withdrawing a stunning golden necklace—a delicate V pendant encrusted with tiny diamonds. My breath caught.

It was the same necklace I had admired in the boutique window last year. The one I had begged Donovan for, only for him to dismiss it with a laugh and buy me something cheaper instead.

And now, it hung around her neck.

Victoria beamed, twirling the pendant between her fingers. "Did I show you what he got me?"

The words were a knife to the chest.

And Donovan?

He couldn't even meet my eyes.

###Chapter 17 Cursed Academy

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting a golden glow over the room. Lillian stretched lazily, her muscles still sore from yesterday’s training session. She had barely slept, her mind racing with thoughts of Donovan’s sudden reappearance and the way his presence had unsettled her.

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, sitting up.

The door creaked open, and Beatrice poked her head in, her dark curls bouncing. "You’re finally awake! I was starting to think you’d sleep through the entire day."

Lillian rubbed her eyes. "What time is it?"

"Almost noon," Beatrice said, stepping inside. She carried a tray with a steaming cup of coffee and a plate of pastries. "I figured you’d need this after last night."

Lillian took the coffee gratefully, inhaling the rich aroma. "You’re a lifesaver."

Beatrice flopped onto the bed beside her. "So, are we going to talk about what happened?"

Lillian sighed. "What’s there to talk about? Donovan showed up uninvited, made a scene, and left. Typical."

Beatrice arched a brow. "Typical? He practically declared war on Sebastian in front of everyone. And the way he looked at you—"

"I don’t want to think about it," Lillian cut in sharply.

Beatrice hesitated, then nodded. "Fine. But you can’t avoid this forever. He’s still your fated mate, whether you like it or not."

Lillian’s grip tightened around the cup. "Not anymore. He chose Evelyn. That bond is broken."

"Biologically, maybe. But emotionally?" Beatrice gave her a pointed look.

Lillian set the coffee down, her appetite gone. "I need to get ready. Sebastian said he’d meet me for lunch."

Beatrice smirked. "Ah, yes. The mysterious Lycan chairman who’s suddenly taken such an interest in you."

Lillian rolled her eyes. "It’s not like that. He’s just… helping me."

"Right. Because powerful Lycan chairmen always go out of their way to help random werewolf college students."

Lillian ignored her, heading to the closet. She pulled out a simple sundress, something light and comfortable.

Beatrice watched her for a moment before sighing. "Just be careful, okay? I don’t trust Donovan, but Sebastian isn’t exactly harmless either."

Lillian paused, meeting her friend’s gaze. "I know."

The restaurant Sebastian had chosen was elegant but understated, tucked away in a quiet corner of the city. Lillian hesitated at the entrance, suddenly self-conscious.

A deep voice spoke behind her. "You look beautiful."

She turned to find Sebastian standing there, his dark eyes warm. He wore a tailored suit, the fabric hugging his broad shoulders perfectly.

"Thank you," she murmured, suddenly aware of how close he was.

He offered his arm. "Shall we?"

Lillian took it, letting him guide her inside. The hostess led them to a private table by the window, where sunlight streamed in, casting patterns on the white tablecloth.

Sebastian pulled out her chair, his fingers brushing lightly against her shoulders as she sat. The touch sent a shiver down her spine.

"You’re nervous," he observed, taking his seat across from her.

Lillian fiddled with her napkin. "A little."

He leaned forward slightly. "You don’t need to be. This is just lunch."

She exhaled, forcing herself to relax. "Right. Just lunch."

The waiter arrived, presenting them with menus. Lillian scanned hers quickly, though her mind was elsewhere.

Sebastian set his menu down. "Have you decided?"

She blinked. "Oh. Um, the salmon, please."

He nodded to the waiter, who took their orders and disappeared.

Silence settled between them. Lillian traced the rim of her water glass, searching for something to say.

Sebastian broke the quiet first. "Donovan won’t bother you again."

Her head snapped up. "What did you do?"

His expression was unreadable. "Nothing drastic. Just made it clear that harassing you is… unwise."

Lillian swallowed. "I can handle Donovan."

"I know you can. But you shouldn’t have to."

The intensity in his gaze made her breath catch. There was something possessive in it, something primal.

The waiter returned with their food, breaking the moment. Lillian focused on her meal, though her appetite had vanished again.

Sebastian watched her for a long moment before speaking again. "There’s something I need to tell you."

She set her fork down. "What is it?"

He hesitated, then reached into his jacket pocket. "This arrived for you this morning."

He placed a small, sealed envelope on the table. Lillian recognized the handwriting immediately.

Donovan’s.

Her stomach twisted. "What does it say?"

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "I don’t know. But whatever it is, you don’t have to face it alone."

Lillian stared at the envelope, dread pooling in her chest. Whatever Donovan wanted, it couldn’t be good.

And yet, she couldn’t ignore it.

She reached for the letter, her fingers trembling slightly.

This wasn’t over. Not even close.

He always claimed that surprises were his specialty—that the best gifts were the ones I never saw coming. So I stopped mentioning the moonstone necklace, hoping he'd remember on his own. But he never did. Or so I thought.

Watching Donovan fasten that very necklace around Victoria's slender throat felt like a blade twisting in my gut. The world tilted, bile rising in my throat.

"Isn't it exquisite?" Victoria preened, fingers brushing the gemstone. "He's absolutely perfect." Donovan's arm encircled her waist, pulling her flush against him as he pressed a kiss to her temple. My vision blurred.

"Quite the statement piece," Sebastian remarked, though his piercing gaze never left Donovan. "I'm relieved to see your loyalties are... properly aligned."

"Without question, sir." Donovan's smirk was a knife in the dark as he locked eyes with me. "My priorities have never been clearer."

Third Person POV

The revelation that Lillian wasn't Sebastian's lover should've been a relief. Instead, Donovan's fury simmered beneath his polished facade. He'd ensured she was unemployable—yet here she stood, in the Landry estate, wearing Blackwood colors.

Her proximity to Sebastian was a provocation. But with Victoria scrutinizing his every reaction, Donovan schooled his features into adoration. Victoria was a masterpiece—flawless, pedigreed, and utterly oblivious to being a pawn in his ascension to Redmoon Alpha.

"We have so many wedding details left," Victoria sighed, nuzzling his shoulder. "I can't wait to be yours forever."

"A striking match," Sebastian said, though his attention lingered on Donovan's rigid posture. "See that you treat my daughter as she deserves."

"Always." Donovan's smile didn't reach his eyes. He felt Lillian's glare like physical heat, reveling in her anguish. That necklace had been her obsession—a trinket she'd admired for months. He'd denied her deliberately, savoring the power of withholding.

But now? Her tutoring position for Oliver Landry was a defiance he couldn't stomach. Sebastian operated outside pack hierarchies, paying handsomely for discretion. Worse, the boy—notoriously difficult—had apparently taken to Lillian.

The way she fidgeted beside Sebastian fed Donovan's spite. She might wear another man's insignia, but her trembling hands betrayed the truth: she was still his. Every stolen glance, every flinch at his touch—proof he owned her heartache.

Their eyes met across the room. Her pain was a vintage he drank deeply, lips curving as she looked away first.

Let her enjoy this petty victory. His fingers tightened around Victoria's waist. By week's end, Lillian would be jobless—and he'd make sure she never forgot who held her leash.

The game was far from over.

A girl like Lillian was only fit for one purpose—lying on her back.

Donovan had connections. Powerful ones. The kind that could make Lillian vanish from Royal Academy without a trace. No job. No education. No future.

He smirked, imagining her desperation. She had two choices now—either submit to him willingly or lose everything she'd ever worked for.

The game was his to play. And he intended to win.

###Chapter 18 Lillian's POV

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, painting the polished marble floors in warm hues. Lillian stretched beneath the silk sheets, the events of last night replaying in her mind like a forbidden dream.

She had expected to wake up alone, but the weight of an arm draped possessively over her waist told her otherwise. Sebastian was still there, his breathing deep and even, his scent—rich cedar and something distinctly his—wrapped around her like an invisible embrace.

A shiver ran down her spine.

This shouldn’t feel so right.

Carefully, she shifted, trying to slip out of bed without waking him. But the moment she moved, his grip tightened, pulling her back against his chest.

"Running away already?" His voice was rough with sleep, sending a thrill through her.

Lillian swallowed. "I have class."

Sebastian chuckled, the sound vibrating against her back. "Skip it."

She turned to face him, her breath hitching at the intensity in his dark eyes. "You can’t just tell me to skip my responsibilities."

His thumb traced her lower lip, sending sparks through her. "I can when I’m your mate."

Her heart stuttered. Mate. The word still felt surreal.

Before she could respond, a sharp knock echoed through the room.

"Alpha Blackwood," Marcus Grayson’s voice came through the door, tense. "We have a situation."

Sebastian’s expression darkened. "What now?"

"It’s Donovan."

Lillian stiffened.

Sebastian sat up, the sheets pooling around his waist. "What about him?"

"He’s at the university gates. Demanding to see Lillian."

Her stomach twisted. Why now?

Sebastian’s jaw clenched. "Tell him to leave before I make him."

Lillian grabbed his arm. "No. I’ll handle this."

His gaze burned into hers. "Like hell you will."

She met his glare without flinching. "He was my problem before he was yours. Let me deal with it."

For a long moment, they stared each other down—two alphas in their own right. Finally, Sebastian exhaled sharply. "Fine. But I’m coming with you."

Lillian didn’t argue.

As they dressed, her mind raced. Donovan had no right to show up like this, not after everything. Not after he’d chosen Evelyn.

But something told her this wasn’t about reconciliation.

This was a challenge.

And she was ready to meet it.

The university gates loomed ahead, the iron bars gleaming under the midday sun. Donovan stood just beyond them, his posture rigid, his golden eyes burning with something Lillian couldn’t quite place.

Evelyn hovered at his side, her expression smug.

Lillian squared her shoulders. "What do you want?"

Donovan’s gaze flickered to Sebastian before settling on her. "We need to talk."

"About what?"

"About you throwing your life away for him."

Sebastian growled low in his throat, but Lillian held up a hand.

"My life is my choice," she said coldly. "You lost the right to have an opinion when you walked away."

Donovan’s jaw tightened. "You don’t know what you’re getting into, Lillian. The Blackwood pack isn’t what it seems."

Sebastian stepped forward, his voice lethal. "Careful, Cash. You’re treading on dangerous ground."

Evelyn smirked. "Or what? You’ll have your betas silence him like you did with the others?"

Lillian’s blood ran cold. What others?

Before she could ask, Donovan’s phone buzzed. He glanced at it, his face paling.

"Dad’s been arrested."

Evelyn gasped. "What? Why?"

Donovan’s eyes locked onto Sebastian. "For embezzlement. From the Blackwood accounts."

Lillian turned to Sebastian, searching his face for answers. But his expression was unreadable.

"Coincidence?" Donovan spat. "I don’t think so."

Sebastian’s voice was ice. "Get off my property before I have you removed."

Donovan didn’t move. "This isn’t over."

Lillian’s heart pounded.

No. It was only beginning.

"I should probably leave now," I said abruptly, tearing my gaze away from Donovan. My fingers twisted nervously around the strap of my bag. "Thank you for the opportunity, Alpha. Maybe we can exchange numbers to finalize my schedule? I can sign the contract when I return."

Sebastian Blackwood studied me for a long moment, his expression unreadable. The intensity of his golden eyes made my pulse stutter.

"Theodore has your number. I'll contact you," he replied, his voice smooth but firm.

I nodded and moved to step around him, but Victoria's voice stopped me mid-motion.

"Father, why don't you take Lillian home? I didn’t see her car here," Victoria suggested, glancing between us with a knowing smile.

"That’s not necessary," I said quickly, already pulling out my phone. "I can just call a ride—"

"I'll have my driver take you," Sebastian interrupted, his tone leaving no room for argument. His gaze locked onto mine, challenging. "I’ll accompany you. We can discuss your role further on the way."

I swallowed hard, my protest dying on my lips. His presence was overwhelming, and the way he looked at me—like he could see right through me—left me flustered. Reluctantly, I nodded. "Thank you."

"Perfect!" Victoria clasped her hands together, beaming. "It was lovely meeting you, Lillian. I hope we can get to know each other better soon. I could use more female friends around here."

I forced a polite smile, though the idea of befriending her twisted my stomach. Still, I couldn’t afford to be rude—especially not in front of my new employer.

Turning away, I followed Sebastian through the grand villa. As we passed the sweeping spiral staircase, Theodore descended, his face tight with frustration. No doubt Oliver’s tantrum had something to do with it.

Theodore paused when he spotted us.

"Is the car still out front?" Sebastian asked without sparing him a glance.

"Yes, Alpha," Theodore answered.

"I’ll be escorting Lillian home. I’ll return later tonight," Sebastian informed him.

Just as we reached the front door, another voice cut in.

"Alpha."

Marcus Grayson, the pack’s Beta, rounded the corner, a stack of papers in hand. His sharp eyes flicked to me briefly before he addressed Sebastian.

"The contract you requested," he said, handing over the documents. Then, with a polite nod in my direction, he added, "Good evening, Miss. I’m Beta Marcus."

Recognition dawned on me—his commanding presence and the way he carried himself screamed Beta. I dipped my head respectfully. "It’s an honor to meet you, Beta Marcus."

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "We’re leaving."

I barely suppressed a glare. There was no need for his rudeness.

But I kept my mouth shut as we stepped outside, the weight of his presence beside me making my skin prickle with awareness.

The car ride was going to be very long.

The thought lingered in my mind, but I kept silent, not wanting to stir any trouble. I didn’t say another word to Marcus, and he didn’t press further. He simply stood there, watching as Sebastian pulled away from his villa and toward the sleek black car waiting at the curb.

The driver—Leroy—immediately jumped out, bowing his head respectfully before opening the rear door. Sebastian gestured for me to enter first. I flashed Leroy a grateful smile before sliding into the plush leather seat. Sebastian followed, settling beside me as the door shut with a soft click.

"Where to, Alpha?" Leroy asked, adjusting the rearview mirror.

"The Blackwood Resort," Sebastian replied smoothly.

My eyes widened. "I thought you were taking me home," I said, my brows knitting together in confusion.

"I need to speak with you privately," he murmured, his gaze steady. "And I heard your stomach growling earlier. I assumed you might be hungry."

The drive was short, the city lights blurring past the tinted windows. When we arrived, I followed Sebastian into the grand restaurant, its opulent chandeliers casting a warm glow over the polished marble floors. The hostess—a woman I recognized from my brief stint working here—greeted us with a dazzling smile.

"Good evening, Mr. Blackwood," she cooed, her voice dripping with admiration. "A table for two? Your usual booth is available."

Sebastian nodded. "Thank you."

We were led to a secluded booth near the back, nestled beside a floor-to-ceiling window that overlooked the glittering harbor. The view was breathtaking—the city’s skyline shimmered against the dark water, dotted with yachts and distant ferry lights.

The hostess handed us menus before gliding away. I expected Sebastian to dive straight into whatever urgent matter had brought us here, but instead, he remained silent, his eyes scanning the menu with deliberate focus.

A few minutes later, a waitress appeared—a slender blonde who barely spared me a glance. Her attention was entirely fixed on Sebastian, her lashes fluttering as she leaned in just a little too close.

"And what would you like, sir?" she purred, ignoring me completely.

Sebastian’s gaze flicked to me. "Lillian?"

The waitress finally turned, her lips tightening when she realized I existed.

"I’ll have the grilled salmon salad," I said, handing her the menu.

Sebastian added, "And bring us a bottle of your best red."

"Of course," she murmured, though her tone had lost its earlier sweetness. She stalked off, her heels clicking against the floor.

Sebastian exhaled, leaning back in his seat as his piercing gaze settled on me.

"Now," he said, his voice low and measured, "we should discuss what happened earlier."

I swallowed. "You mean the incident with Donovan."
###Chapter 19 This isn’t over

The morning sun cast golden rays through the grand windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s estate, painting the marble floors in warm hues. Lillian stirred beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming with the remnants of last night’s passion. The scent of sandalwood and musk clung to her skin—Sebastian’s signature fragrance, now irrevocably intertwined with her own.

She stretched lazily, her muscles pleasantly sore, before her fingers brushed against something cold and metallic on the nightstand. A silver pendant, intricately carved with the Blackwood crest, rested beside a handwritten note in elegant script:

"For the woman who owns my heart. Wear this, and let the world know you’re mine."

Lillian’s breath hitched. The weight of the pendant in her palm felt like a promise—one that both thrilled and terrified her.

Downstairs, the mansion buzzed with activity. The clatter of fine china and the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee drifted from the dining hall. Sebastian sat at the head of the table, his piercing gaze lifting the moment she entered. Oliver, his son, grinned around a mouthful of pancakes.

"Morning, Lillian!" the boy chirped. "Dad said you’d sleep in forever if he didn’t wake you."

Sebastian smirked, the dimple in his cheek deepening. "I considered it. You looked too peaceful to disturb."

Heat flooded her cheeks as she slid into the seat beside him. The pendant around her neck caught the light, drawing Sebastian’s attention. His fingers brushed against it possessively, sending a shiver down her spine.

"Good. You’re wearing it." His voice was low, meant only for her.

Before she could respond, Marcus Grayson, Sebastian’s beta, strode in, his expression grim. "Alpha, we have a problem."

Sebastian’s demeanor shifted instantly. "Report."

"Donovan’s pack has been spotted near the eastern border. They’re testing our defenses."

Lillian’s stomach twisted. Donovan—her ex-fated mate, the man who had betrayed her without hesitation. The thought of him lurking near Sebastian’s territory made her blood boil.

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "Double the patrols. If he so much as steps a foot onto Blackwood land, I want him detained."

Marcus nodded and turned to leave, but not before casting a sympathetic glance at Lillian.

Oliver, sensing the tension, poked at his food. "Is Uncle Donovan being mean again?"

Sebastian ruffled his son’s hair. "Nothing for you to worry about, champ."

But Lillian knew better. Donovan wasn’t just testing borders—he was sending a message. And if there was one thing she had learned about Sebastian Blackwood, it was that he didn’t tolerate threats.

Especially when it came to her.

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains, stirring Lillian from her restless sleep. She groaned, rubbing her temples as the remnants of last night’s confrontation with Donovan replayed in her mind. His betrayal still stung, but she refused to let it break her.

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Lillian? Are you awake?" Beatrice’s voice was muffled but concerned.

Lillian sat up, smoothing her tangled hair. "Yeah, come in."

Beatrice slipped inside, her expression tight with worry. "You look awful. Did you sleep at all?"

"Not really," Lillian admitted, swinging her legs over the edge of the bed. "Too much on my mind."

Beatrice sighed, perching on the edge of the mattress. "I heard what happened with Donovan. That bastard."

Lillian clenched her fists. "I should’ve seen it coming. He was never really mine."

Before Beatrice could respond, another knock echoed through the room—this one sharper, more authoritative.

"Lillian?" Sebastian’s deep voice sent an unexpected shiver down her spine.

Beatrice raised an eyebrow, smirking. "Well, well. Looks like someone’s got a visitor."

Lillian shot her a glare before calling out, "Just a minute!"

She quickly threw on a robe and opened the door. Sebastian stood there, dressed impeccably in a tailored suit, his dark eyes scanning her disheveled state.

"Good morning," he said, his tone unreadable. "We need to talk."

Lillian swallowed. "About?"

"Your safety," he replied, stepping inside without waiting for an invitation. "Donovan’s actions last night have consequences. He won’t stop until he gets what he wants."

Beatrice whistled low under her breath. "Drama."

Lillian ignored her. "What are you suggesting?"

Sebastian’s gaze locked onto hers. "You’re moving into my estate. Today."

Lillian’s breath hitched. "Excuse me?"

"It’s not up for debate," he said coolly. "Pack your things. I’ll send Marcus to escort you."

Before she could protest, he turned and strode out, leaving her stunned.

Beatrice grinned. "Well, that escalated quickly."

Lillian groaned, pressing her palms to her eyes. "This is a nightmare."

Or was it?

A tiny, traitorous part of her thrilled at the idea of being under Sebastian’s protection. But she couldn’t afford to let her guard down—not when Donovan was still out there, waiting to strike.

And not when Sebastian Blackwood was just as dangerous, in his own way.

"I swear, whatever happened between Donovan and me is in the past. My only focus now is tutoring Oliver. Professionalism matters to me, and I’ll uphold it without fail," I blurted out, my words tumbling faster than I intended. Sebastian Blackwood had that effect on me—his presence alone made my nerves fray.

He studied me for a long, silent moment, his piercing gaze making my pulse stutter.

"I won’t cross any boundaries," I added hastily.

His lips quirked slightly. "And what about me?" His tone wasn’t mocking—just curious, almost boyish. The softness in his eyes sent warmth flooding through me, my cheeks burning in response.

"No boundaries crossed with you either," I promised, my voice steadier than I felt.

Sebastian considered me for another heartbeat before giving a curt nod. "See that you keep that promise." His words held a quiet challenge.

Before I could respond, the waitress returned with our wine, and the tension eased—slightly.

He shifted the conversation to my schedule, and we settled on days that worked for both of us. Then, he slid a contract across the table, explaining it was standard—employment terms, salary, confidentiality.

"You’re not to disclose who you work for," he added, his voice firm. "Safety precaution—for both of us. All my staff agree to it."

I nodded. It made sense, so I didn’t argue.

He handed me a pen, and after scanning the document, I filled in my details and signed where he indicated. Moments later, our food arrived.

"This looks amazing," I said, taking my first bite of the crisp, fresh salad.

Sebastian had ordered a rare steak with roasted vegetables and mashed potatoes. We ate in comfortable silence, sipping wine between bites. By the time I finished, the wine had gone straight to my head.

"I need to use the restroom," I murmured, sliding out of the booth. "Be right back."

He gave a brief nod, and I made my way toward the bathroom. As I passed a striking woman with auburn hair and emerald-green eyes, she deliberately brushed her shoulder against mine—hard enough to make me stumble.

No apology. Just a cold, assessing glance.

I pushed the encounter from my mind and hurried to the restroom. When I returned, Sebastian was standing, arms crossed, speaking to the same woman in low, clipped tones. She looked furious.

As I approached, her words sliced through the air.

"So this is why you’ve been ignoring me? You’re with some little nobody now?" Her voice dripped with venom.

"That’s enough, Penelope," Sebastian warned, his tone dangerously calm.

"Answer me, Sebastian. Are you seeing her?" Hurt laced her demand.

His gaze flicked to me, sensing my presence. Without a word, he closed the distance between us and pulled me against his side, his arm possessive around my shoulders.

Heat and the intoxicating scent of him enveloped me, sending sparks skittering across my skin. His face was unreadable, but his grip was firm—a silent declaration.

And just like that, I was caught in the middle of a storm I hadn’t seen coming.

Sebastian’s lips brushed against the nape of my neck, sending shivers down my spine. Penelope’s eyes burned with fury as she watched him, her expression twisted in barely contained rage.

"And if I am?" Sebastian murmured, his breath warm against my cheek. My heart pounded so hard I feared it might burst from my chest.

"You’ll get bored of her soon enough," Penelope sneered, crossing her arms tightly. "You always do. And then you’ll come crawling back to me."

Sebastian arched a brow, unfazed. "How long do you plan on intruding on our date?"

My breath caught at his words. Penelope’s scowl deepened, her fingers curling into fists.

"This isn’t over," she spat before shooting me a venomous glare and storming off.

The moment she disappeared from sight, Sebastian released me. My legs trembled so violently I nearly collapsed, my knees buckling beneath me. I barely managed to steady myself as Sebastian casually returned to the table, resuming his meal as if nothing had happened.

"W-what was that?" I stammered, my voice embarrassingly breathless.

Sebastian glanced up, his expression unreadable. "That was Penelope," he said simply. "A noble Lycan. And my late wife’s sister."

The revelation stunned me into silence. "Oh," I managed weakly.

"My mother has been pushing for us to be together—a second chance, she calls it," he continued, his tone indifferent. "I didn’t want to reject her too harshly. I apologize for using you like that."

Heat still burned in my cheeks, and though I was certain he noticed, he said nothing about it. I nodded mutely, too flustered to form a coherent response.

We finished our meal in silence. Sebastian paid the bill, then had the driver take us back to my house. As I stepped out of the car, I murmured a quick thanks for the meal and the job before hurrying to the door. The car didn’t leave until I was safely inside, the engine fading into the distance.

I exhaled sharply, unaware I’d been holding my breath.

But the brief moment of relief shattered when I heard voices in the living room. My mother was speaking animatedly to someone. The second I stepped into the entryway, my entire body locked in place at the sight of the person lounging on the couch, chatting with her as if they were old friends.

My blood ran cold.

Because sitting there, with a smirk that sent dread coiling in my stomach, was—

###Chapter 20 Lillian's POV

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s estate. The sun had barely risen, casting a golden hue over the sprawling gardens below. She tightened the silk robe around her, the fabric whispering against her skin.

Last night’s events replayed in her mind—Donovan’s sudden reappearance, the venom in his words, the way Evelyn had clung to him like a trophy. A bitter taste lingered in her mouth. She had thought she was over him, but seeing them together had stirred something dark inside her.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Lillian?" Beatrice’s voice was muffled through the door. "Are you awake?"

Lillian sighed, turning away from the view. "Come in."

The door creaked open, revealing Beatrice in a rumpled T-shirt and pajama bottoms, her hair a wild mess. "You look like you didn’t sleep at all."

"I didn’t," Lillian admitted, running a hand through her tangled curls.

Beatrice flopped onto the bed, bouncing slightly. "So. Donovan’s back."

Lillian’s jaw clenched. "And he brought Evelyn with him."

"Ugh." Beatrice wrinkled her nose. "That girl has the personality of a wet sock."

Despite herself, Lillian snorted. "She’s his mate now. Officially."

"Officially boring," Beatrice muttered. Then, her expression softened. "You know he’s only doing this to get under your skin, right? He’s still bitter you rejected him."

Lillian crossed her arms. "Well, it’s working."

Beatrice sat up, suddenly serious. "You can’t let him win, Lil. You’ve got Sebastian now. And Oliver adores you. You’re building something real here."

Lillian’s chest tightened at the mention of Sebastian. The way he had looked at her last night—protective, possessive—had sent shivers down her spine. But doubt gnawed at her.

"What if I’m just a rebound for him too?" she whispered.

Beatrice scoffed. "Please. The man looks at you like you hung the moon. Donovan wishes he could inspire half that devotion."

Before Lillian could respond, her phone buzzed. A message from Sebastian:

"Meet me in the study. We need to talk."

Her stomach flipped.

Beatrice raised an eyebrow. "Trouble in paradise?"

Lillian swallowed hard. "Or the opposite."

Sebastian’s study was bathed in warm lamplight when Lillian entered. He stood by the window, his broad shoulders silhouetted against the dawn. The sight of him—so powerful, so untouchable—made her pulse quicken.

"You wanted to see me?" she asked, her voice steadier than she felt.

He turned, his golden eyes locking onto hers. "Donovan’s presence complicates things."

Lillian stiffened. "I can handle him."

Sebastian stepped closer, his scent—cedar and something uniquely him—wrapping around her. "It’s not just him. Evelyn’s family has ties to the council. They could cause problems for us."

Lillian’s fingers curled into fists. "So what? You’re saying we should back down?"

A slow, dangerous smile curved his lips. "No. I’m saying we play their game—and win."

Her breath caught. "How?"

Sebastian cupped her face, his thumb brushing her cheek. "By making it clear to everyone that you’re mine."

Her heart hammered. "And how do we do that?"

His voice dropped to a growl. "We give them a show they won’t forget."

Before she could ask what he meant, his lips crashed onto hers, hot and demanding. The world narrowed to the feel of him, the heat of his body pressed against hers.

And just like that, Lillian forgot all about Donovan.

For the first time since my father was taken by the pack Gammas, my mother was smiling.

"Oh, Lillian! You're home. Look who came to visit us," she said, her face glowing as she glanced at Donovan. "He told me he might be able to help us—if you cooperate with him." Her gaze flickered back to me, questioning.

I had told her Donovan refused to help. Yet here he was, twisting the truth, making it seem like I was the problem—like my unwillingness to bend to his demands was the reason he wouldn’t lift a finger. He hadn’t told her what those demands were, and I sure as hell wasn’t going to.

It would shatter her. And right now, I didn’t have the strength to pick up the pieces.

I was exhausted. All I wanted was to collapse into bed and forget this nightmare of a day. The last thing I needed was to deal with Donovan’s games.

Crossing my arms, I glared at him, my lips pressed into a thin line. That smug smirk of his made my skin crawl.

"What’s he doing here, Mom?" I asked, my voice sharp.

She frowned. "Is that any way to speak? I raised you better than that, Lillian. Donovan has been a friend to this family for years. He’s your mate, and he’s offering to help us in our time of need. Show some respect."

I clenched my jaw.

"Do I need to remind you we broke up?" I snapped, my eyes locked on Donovan, though my words were meant for both of them.

I needed them to understand—there was no going back. If my mother was hoping for some fairytale reconciliation, she was wasting her time.

"That doesn’t mean you can’t be civil," she countered. "He’s in the running to be our next Alpha. Regardless of your past, he deserves respect."

Donovan stood, and I instinctively stepped back, putting as much space between us as possible. My wolf had been eerily silent since we saw him at Sebastian’s villa with Victoria. I worried something was wrong—she hadn’t spoken since the day he rejected us.

"I apologize for intruding," Donovan said smoothly, that practiced smile still in place. But I heard the venom beneath his words. "I was hoping for a moment alone with you."

"In your dreams, Donovan," I spat. Then I turned on my heel and stormed out of the living room.

I wasn’t giving him another second of my time.

Wrapping my arms around myself, I hurried up the stairs. Just as I reached my door and pushed it open, a hand pressed against my lower back, shoving me forward. The door slammed shut behind me.

I whirled around.

Donovan stood there, arms crossed, his expression dark.

"What the hell are you doing in here?" I hissed.

His lips curled. "I should be the one asking you the questions," he shot back, voice dripping with bitterness. "What do you think you’re doing, parading around Sebastian Blackwood like that?"

My brows shot up.

"Excuse me?" I snapped, my voice laced with disbelief. "Since when is that any of your concern? Aren’t you engaged to his daughter?"

His smirk was infuriating. "Do you honestly believe throwing yourself at Sebastian will help free your father from prison?" Donovan scoffed, his tone dripping with condescension. "You’re deluding yourself if you think for a second a man like him would ever look twice at you."

A bitter laugh escaped me. "You do remember the marks on my neck not too long ago, don’t you?" I challenged, crossing my arms tightly over my chest.

His expression darkened instantly at the reminder, and he took a threatening step forward. I retreated just as quickly, my pulse spiking.

"I made some inquiries," he murmured, his voice dangerously low. "Turns out Sebastian was heavily intoxicated that night. Hardly in his right mind." His gaze sharpened. "You must’ve seized the opportunity."

"Are you insane?" I hissed, my nails digging into my palms. "I did nothing of the sort!"

His cold laugh sent a shiver down my spine. "Who exactly are you trying to fool, Lillian? Because it’s not working on me. I know what you’re capable of—how far you’d go for your family. Even if it means selling yourself for a quick payout." He tilted his head, feigning sympathy. "Why not just accept my offer and end this pathetic charade?"

"Because I refuse to be your mistress, Donovan," I spat, my voice trembling with fury. "It’s degrading—to me, to you, and especially to Victoria. How can you even suggest something like this when you know it would destroy her?"

He rolled his eyes, unfazed. "Spare me the righteous act. You don’t give a damn about her."

"Someone has to," I growled.

Before I could react, his hands shot out, gripping my waist and yanking me against him. My breath hitched as my body collided with his hard chest, his scent—dark and intoxicating—flooding my senses.

"Just shut up," he muttered, and then his lips crashed into mine.

Rage burned through me as his mouth moved roughly against mine, his tongue demanding entry. I clenched my jaw shut, refusing to surrender. Once, his touch would’ve melted me. Now? All I felt was disgust.

The spark was gone.

And so was I.
###Chapter 21 Stop fighting

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains, stirring Lillian awake. She stretched lazily, her muscles still sore from yesterday’s training session with Professor Montclair. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted from downstairs, making her stomach growl.

She dressed quickly, opting for a simple sweater and jeans before heading to the kitchen. There, she found Sebastian Blackwood already seated at the table, reading the morning papers while Oliver chattered excitedly about his upcoming school project.

"Morning," Lillian murmured, pouring herself a cup of coffee.

Sebastian glanced up, his piercing blue eyes softening as they met hers. "Sleep well?"

"Better than expected," she admitted, taking a sip. The rich, bitter warmth spread through her, chasing away the last remnants of drowsiness.

Oliver grinned. "Dad says we’re going to the lake house this weekend! You’re coming too, right?"

Lillian hesitated, her fingers tightening around the mug. She hadn’t spent much time alone with Sebastian outside of training or pack duties. The idea of a weekend getaway with him and his son sent an unexpected flutter through her chest.

Before she could respond, Marcus Grayson strode in, his expression grim. "Alpha, we have a problem."

Sebastian set down his paper. "What is it?"

"Donovan Winslow was spotted near the northern border last night. He wasn’t alone."

Lillian’s grip on her mug faltered, nearly spilling the coffee. Donovan. Just the mention of his name sent a cold shiver down her spine.

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "Any signs of aggression?"

"Not yet. But he’s been gathering allies—rogues, mostly. It’s only a matter of time before he makes a move."

Oliver, sensing the tension, tugged at Lillian’s sleeve. "Who’s Donovan?"

She forced a smile. "No one important, sweetheart."

But the lie tasted bitter on her tongue. Donovan was far from unimportant. He was her past, her mistake—one that refused to stay buried.

Sebastian stood, his commanding presence filling the room. "Double the patrols. I want every inch of our territory watched."

Marcus nodded and left, leaving behind a heavy silence.

Lillian exhaled shakily. "You think he’s coming for me?"

Sebastian’s gaze darkened. "If he is, he’ll regret it."

The certainty in his voice should have comforted her. Instead, it only made her heart race faster. Because if Donovan was bold enough to return, he wasn’t just coming for her.

He was coming for war.

His touch seared my skin like molten iron.

A wave of nausea crashed over me, mingling with the fury boiling in my veins. I thrashed against his grip, but Donovan only tightened his hold, his fingers digging into my flesh like claws.

Of course he was stronger.

The realization burned worse than his touch.

My breath came in sharp, ragged gasps as I twisted, desperate to break free. But his arms were steel bands, unyielding, trapping me against him.

"Stop fighting," he growled, his voice low and rough.

I snarled in response, my wolf bristling beneath my skin.

The scent of him—once comforting, now repulsive—filled my lungs. His dominance pressed down on me, suffocating, but I refused to submit.

Not again.

Never again.

His grip shifted, one hand tangling in my hair, forcing my head back. His dark eyes bore into mine, searching for something—remorse, fear, surrender.

He wouldn't find it.

I bared my teeth.

"Let. Me. Go."

His jaw clenched, but he didn't release me.

And that was all the answer I needed.
###Chapter 22 Lillian's POV

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting golden streaks across the bedroom. Lillian stretched lazily, her body still humming with the lingering warmth of Donovan's presence. But as her fingers brushed the empty space beside her, reality crashed down like a tidal wave.

He was gone.

Again.

A bitter taste filled her mouth as she sat up, clutching the sheets to her chest. The scent of him—spicy and masculine—still clung to the pillows, mocking her. She had let herself believe, even for a moment, that things could be different this time. That maybe, just maybe, he would stay.

But Donovan had never been one for promises.

A sharp knock at the door startled her. "Lillian? Are you awake?" Beatrice's voice carried through the wood, laced with concern.

Lillian swallowed hard, forcing her voice to sound steady. "Yeah, come in."

The door creaked open, and Beatrice stepped inside, her dark eyes scanning the room before landing on Lillian. "You look like hell," she said bluntly, crossing her arms.

"Thanks," Lillian muttered, running a hand through her tangled hair.

Beatrice sighed, dropping onto the edge of the bed. "Donovan left, didn't he?"

Lillian didn't answer. She didn't have to.

"Damn it, Lillian." Beatrice's voice softened. "How many times are you going to let him do this to you?"

Lillian clenched her fists in the sheets. "It's not that simple."

"It never is with him." Beatrice shook her head. "You deserve better."

The words stung, mostly because they were true. But Lillian had spent too long chasing after Donovan to just walk away now.

A sudden vibration from her phone cut through the tension. Lillian snatched it up, her pulse quickening when she saw the name on the screen.

Sebastian Blackwood.

Her breath hitched. The Lycan chairman had been a distant figure in her life, a man of power and mystery who had always watched her from the shadows. Why was he texting her now?

With trembling fingers, she opened the message.

"We need to talk. Meet me at the Blackwood Estate. Noon."

No greeting. No explanation. Just a command.

Lillian's heart pounded against her ribs. What could Sebastian possibly want with her?

Beatrice frowned. "What is it?"

Lillian hesitated before showing her the message. Beatrice's eyes widened. "Holy shit. You're not actually going, are you?"

Lillian bit her lip. "I don't think I have a choice."

Because if there was one thing she knew about Sebastian Blackwood, it was that he never asked twice.

And when a Lycan Alpha summoned you, you answered.

The Blackwood Estate loomed before her, an imposing structure of dark stone and ivy-covered walls. Lillian stood at the gates, her stomach twisting into knots. She had dressed carefully—a simple black dress, knee-high boots, her hair loose around her shoulders. She wanted to look strong. Unbreakable.

But inside, she was shaking.

The gates swung open without a sound, as if they had been expecting her. Lillian took a deep breath and stepped forward, her heels clicking against the cobblestone path.

Sebastian was waiting for her on the terrace, his broad frame silhouetted against the afternoon sun. He turned as she approached, his golden eyes locking onto hers with an intensity that made her skin prickle.

"Lillian," he said, his voice deep and smooth. "I was beginning to think you wouldn't come."

She lifted her chin. "You didn't give me much of an option."

A faint smirk tugged at his lips. "No, I suppose I didn't."

Silence stretched between them, thick and heavy. Lillian forced herself to hold his gaze, refusing to back down.

Finally, Sebastian spoke again. "I have a proposition for you."

Her pulse spiked. "What kind of proposition?"

He stepped closer, close enough that she could smell the rich, earthy scent of him. "One that could change everything."

Lillian's breath caught.

And just like that, the game had begun.

The agony tearing through my body was unbearable. A scream tore from my throat, raw and desperate, as I prayed my mother would hear and come to my aid. But the hallway outside remained eerily silent, save for the sounds of my own suffering. My wolf whimpered in distress, her pain amplifying mine until coherent thought was impossible.

I had endured minor discomfort before—when Donovan kissed Victoria—but this? This was torture.

This was the bond punishing me for him being with her.

Every pant, every moan, every sinful sound echoed in my skull as if I were right there in the room with them. My nails dug into the sheets, my body trembling as tears streaked down my face. I begged the Moon Goddess for mercy, for the torment to end.

What did I do to deserve this?

My gaze landed on the crumpled shirt draped over my laundry basket—Sebastian’s shirt. The one I’d borrowed and never returned. If I were honest, I’d forgotten about it entirely.

But now, drowning in pain, I wondered—did it still carry his scent?

Gritting my teeth, I forced myself to reach for it, my muscles screaming in protest. The moment my fingers brushed the fabric, his rich, woodsy aroma enveloped me like a warm embrace. My wolf quieted, soothed by his presence, even if only through scent.

I clutched the shirt to my chest, inhaling deeply as the pain dulled to a bearable throb. The phantom sounds of Donovan and Victoria faded, replaced by the steady rhythm of my own breathing.

And then, exhaustion pulled me under.

Sebastian filled my dreams.

Not as the composed, intimidating Lycan chairman, but as the man who had kissed me with reckless abandon in his penthouse suite. His lips crashed against mine, hot and demanding, while his hands roamed my body with possessive hunger.

I wasn’t wearing a stitch of clothing, but I didn’t care. This was my fantasy, and here, I had no reason to hide.

He lifted me effortlessly, pinning me against the wall as his mouth trailed down my throat. His teeth grazed the spot where Donovan’s mark should have been—but in this world, it was gone.

A low growl rumbled in his chest before he whispered, "Mine."

I jolted awake, gasping, my skin slick with sweat. My heart hammered against my ribs as I scanned my room, disoriented.

Holy Moon Goddess.

I’d just had a dream about Sebastian Blackwood. A very explicit one.

My cheeks burned as I pressed my palms to my face. This was not the mindset I needed before tutoring Oliver later.

I had to get my head straight.

Because if I showed up at his mansion like this?

Sebastian would see right through me.

I jolted awake with a gasp, the remnants of my unsettling dream still clinging to my consciousness like cobwebs. Shaking my head to clear the disturbing images, I threw off the covers and practically leapt from bed. My bare feet hit the cold tiles as I rushed into the adjoining bathroom, desperate to wash away the lingering unease.

Pausing before the mirror, I barely recognized the reflection staring back at me. My usually vibrant auburn hair resembled a bird's nest, wild strands sticking out in every direction. Dark purple shadows marred the pale skin beneath my bloodshot eyes, evidence of yet another restless night. But none of that compared to the shocking sight that made my breath catch.

There, prominently displayed on the delicate skin of my neck, was an unmistakable hickey - Donovan's mark. The purplish bruise stood out starkly against my fair complexion, a vivid reminder of last night's humiliating encounter. My fingers trembled as they hovered over the damning evidence, the memory of his cruel laughter echoing in my ears.

"Damn it," I whispered, my voice rough with sleep and emotion. The mark pulsed slightly when I pressed against it, sending an unwelcome shiver down my spine. I needed to cover this before anyone saw - especially Sebastian. The thought of the powerful Lycan chairman seeing Donovan's claim on me made my stomach churn.

Turning on the faucet with more force than necessary, I splashed icy water on my face, hoping to shock myself into full alertness. As the water dripped down my chin, I met my own gaze in the mirror again, steeling my resolve. Today would be different. Today, I would start taking control of my life back from Donovan's toxic influence.

But first, I needed serious concealer. 

The morning sunlight streaming through the window seemed almost mocking in its cheerfulness as I began my damage control routine, determined to erase all visible traces of my ex-mate's latest attempt to humiliate me. Little did I know, this was just the beginning of a day that would test every ounce of my strength and resilience.

The morning sun filtered through the heavy drapes of Lillian's bedroom at the Blackwood estate. She stretched beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming from last night's passionate encounter with Sebastian. A delicious shiver ran down her spine as she recalled how he'd pinned her against the wall, his growls vibrating through her entire being.

"Good morning, beautiful," came Sebastian's deep voice from the doorway. He leaned against the frame, shirtless, his muscular torso on full display. Lillian's breath hitched at the sight of fresh scratch marks across his chest - her marks.

"Someone's up early," she teased, pulling the sheets higher. "Don't you have a company to run?"

Sebastian prowled toward the bed with that predatory grace only Lycans possessed. "I cleared my schedule," he murmured, bending to nip at her exposed shoulder. "Thought we could spend the day together."

Before Lillian could respond, her phone buzzed violently on the nightstand. Beatrice's name flashed across the screen with a string of panicked emojis. Lillian's stomach dropped.

"What is it?" Sebastian asked, instantly alert.

Lillian swallowed hard as she read the message. "It's Donovan. He's at the university. He's... he's telling everyone we're still fated mates."

Sebastian's golden eyes darkened to molten amber. The air around them crackled with barely restrained fury. "That bastard doesn't know when to quit."

Lillian scrambled from bed, her mind racing. "I need to get there before this spirals. Evelyn must be furious."

Sebastian caught her wrist as she tried to rush past. "You're not going alone." His tone brooked no argument. "I'll have Marcus prepare the car."

As they dressed hurriedly, Lillian's phone buzzed again - this time with a photo from Beatrice. The image showed Donovan standing on the university steps, surrounded by gawking students, holding what appeared to be... a mating certificate?

"That's impossible," Lillian whispered, her blood running cold. "We never completed the ceremony."

Sebastian snatched the phone from her trembling hands. His growl shook the walls. "That's a forgery." He crushed the device in his grip. "Let's go remind Donovan what happens to wolves who play with fire."

The drive to campus passed in tense silence. Lillian's mind reeled with possible scenarios. Why would Donovan do this now? Unless... unless Evelyn had rejected him? The thought sent a chill down her spine.

As their black SUV pulled up to the main quad, chaos greeted them. A crowd had gathered around the administration building where Donovan stood on the steps, flanked by university security. Evelyn was nowhere in sight.

Sebastian exited the vehicle first, his imposing presence immediately parting the crowd. Lillian followed, her heart pounding. The moment Donovan spotted them, his smug expression faltered.

"Ah, just in time," he called, recovering quickly. "Come to confirm our bond, darling?"

Lillian opened her mouth to respond, but Sebastian beat her to it. "Enough games, Donovan." His voice carried across the quad, silencing the murmuring students. "Present your so-called proof."

Donovan's grin turned predatory as he held up the document. "See for yourself, Blackwood. Signed and sealed by the Moon Goddess herself."

A collective gasp rose from the crowd. Lillian's vision swam. This couldn't be happening. She reached for Sebastian's arm, needing his steady presence.

Before anyone could react, a shrill voice cut through the tension. "That's a lie!"

All heads turned as Evelyn pushed through the crowd, her face streaked with tears. She pointed an accusing finger at Donovan. "He forged that last night after I rejected him! The council already approved our separation!"

The revelation sent shockwaves through the gathering. Donovan's face twisted in rage. "You stupid bitch," he snarled, lunging toward Evelyn.

Sebastian moved like lightning, intercepting Donovan mid-leap and slamming him into the concrete steps. The sickening crack of bone echoed across the suddenly silent quad.

"Anyone else want to question my mate's status?" Sebastian growled, his canines fully extended as he loomed over Donovan's crumpled form.

Lillian rushed to Evelyn's side as the younger woman collapsed into sobs. "It's okay," she murmured, rubbing Evelyn's back. "You're safe now."

But as she looked up at Sebastian standing victorious over Donovan, a new worry took root. If Donovan was desperate enough to forge mating documents, what else might he try? And more importantly - who was helping him?

###Chapter 23 We need to talk.

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting golden streaks across the lavish bedroom. Lillian stirred beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming with the remnants of last night’s passion. Beside her, Sebastian Blackwood lay sprawled, his muscular frame taking up most of the bed. His dark lashes fluttered slightly as he slept, the sharp angles of his face softened in slumber.

A soft knock at the door interrupted the quiet.

"Come in," Lillian murmured, pulling the sheets higher.

The door creaked open, revealing Beatrice, her best friend, holding a tray of coffee and pastries. "Morning, sleepyhead," she chirped, setting the tray on the bedside table. "Thought you might need this after last night."

Lillian’s cheeks warmed. "Bea!"

Beatrice smirked, plopping onto the edge of the bed. "Oh, please. The whole pack heard you two. Walls are thin in this mansion."

Sebastian groaned, rolling onto his side. "If you’re here to gossip, do it elsewhere."

Beatrice rolled her eyes. "Fine, fine. But Lillian, you’re needed downstairs. There’s a… situation."

Lillian frowned. "What kind of situation?"

"The kind involving Donovan and Evelyn."

Sebastian sat up abruptly, his golden eyes sharpening. "What did that bastard do now?"

Beatrice hesitated. "He’s here. At the gates. Demanding to see Lillian."

Lillian’s stomach twisted. She hadn’t seen Donovan since he’d rejected her, choosing Evelyn instead. The memory still stung.

Sebastian’s jaw clenched. "He has no right."

Lillian placed a hand on his arm. "I should talk to him. If only to make him leave."

Sebastian studied her for a long moment before nodding. "Fine. But I’m coming with you."

Downstairs, the grand foyer buzzed with tension. Marcus Grayson, Sebastian’s beta, stood near the entrance, arms crossed. Outside, Donovan paced, his expression stormy. Evelyn hovered behind him, looking uneasy.

Lillian took a deep breath and stepped forward. "Donovan."

He whirled around, his gaze locking onto hers. "Lillian. We need to talk."

Sebastian growled low in his throat. "Make it quick."

Donovan ignored him, stepping closer. "I made a mistake. I see that now."

Lillian blinked. "What?"

Evelyn’s face paled. "Donovan—"

He cut her off. "I was wrong to reject you. I want you back."

The words hit like a slap. Lillian staggered back, her pulse roaring in her ears.

Sebastian moved between them, his voice a lethal whisper. "You lost your chance. She’s mine now."

Donovan’s eyes flashed. "She was mine first."

The air crackled with hostility. Lillian’s wolf stirred, agitated.

Then—

A sharp cry pierced the tension. Oliver, Sebastian’s son, stood at the top of the stairs, his small face crumpled in fear. "Daddy?"

Sebastian’s expression softened instantly. "Oliver. Go back to your room."

But Oliver didn’t move. His wide eyes darted between the adults. "Are you fighting?"

Lillian’s heart ached. She couldn’t let this escalate. Not here. Not now.

She stepped forward, her voice steady. "Donovan, leave. There’s nothing left to say."

His face twisted. "You don’t mean that."

"I do." She met his gaze, unflinching. "It’s over."

For a moment, silence stretched between them. Then Donovan snarled, turning on his heel. "This isn’t finished."

Evelyn cast one last, conflicted look at Lillian before following him out.

The door slammed shut.

Lillian exhaled shakily.

Sebastian pulled her close, his warmth seeping into her bones. "You okay?"

She nodded, leaning into him. "Yeah. Just… tired."

Beatrice cleared her throat. "Well, that was dramatic."

Sebastian shot her a glare.

She held up her hands. "Right. I’ll just… go check on Oliver."

As Beatrice hurried upstairs, Lillian sighed. "Do you think he’ll really give up?"

Sebastian’s grip tightened. "Not a chance. But he’ll regret it if he tries anything."

Lillian believed him.

But as she glanced out the window, watching Donovan’s retreating figure, a cold dread settled in her chest.

This wasn’t over.

Not by a long shot.

I glared at my reflection in the mirror, my fingers brushing over the mark on my neck. This can't be visible to anyone. I needed to hide it—fast.

A scarf would have to do.

After a quick shower, I slipped into a fitted blouse and dark jeans, then grabbed a silk scarf that matched the outfit. Wrapping it carefully around my neck, I took a steadying breath before stepping out of my room.

My mother intercepted me in the hallway, her expression tight with disapproval. "Lillian," she began, her voice strained, "you can't keep defying Donovan like this. He’s our future Alpha. Your father’s life depends on this alliance."

I clenched my jaw, refusing to engage. "We’ll find another way," I said firmly, turning away before she could see the frustration in my eyes.

Later that afternoon, I called an Uber to Sebastian Blackwood’s estate. Relief washed over me when only Theodore and Oliver were home—no awkward run-ins with Sebastian himself.

Theodore gave me a brief tour, pointing out which rooms I was allowed in and which were strictly off-limits—Sebastian’s study and the entire upper floor included.

"The interview was just the beginning," Theodore said, crossing his arms as he studied me. "Master Oliver isn’t an easy child to handle. None of his previous tutors lasted long. Your job is to make sure he completes his assignments. Understood?"

"I’ll do my best," I replied, forcing confidence into my voice.

Theodore smirked, skepticism clear in his gaze. "No offense, Miss Lillian, but I doubt you’re cut out for this. Even the tutors who passed the interview failed miserably. Oliver is… complicated. It’ll take more than a pretty face and combat skills to get through to him."

His words stung, but I refused to let it show.

Third Person POV

Lillian masked her reaction, but Theodore’s blunt assessment had hit its mark. Earlier that morning, Donovan had been speaking with Theodore while Victoria prepared for the day.

"She’s never been around children," Donovan had said, his tone dismissive. "I’ve known Lillian for years. She doesn’t have the patience for this."

He’d even revealed Lillian’s condition—something she’d confided in him about long ago. A condition she claimed to have under control, but one that made certain subjects difficult for her.

Theodore had felt deceived. Now, he made a mental note to watch her closely and report anything unusual back to Donovan.

Oddly enough, Donovan had also been unusually interested in Oliver’s habits.

"I noticed he doesn’t do much around here," Donovan had mused. "His birthday isn’t for months, but since I’ll be marrying Victoria, I’d like to get him something meaningful. Any suggestions?"

Theodore hadn’t thought much of it. "He’s into video games," he answered. "There’s one in particular he loves, but he’s not allowed to play it right now."

Donovan had simply nodded, his expression unreadable.

Donovan arched a brow, his piercing gaze fixed on the woman before him.

"And why is that?" His voice was smooth, laced with curiosity.

"Because it consumes all his attention," she huffed, crossing her arms. "He locks himself in his room for hours, completely absorbed in that ridiculous game. Getting him to focus on anything else is like pulling teeth."

A slow smirk curved Donovan’s lips. "Let me take a look at the tablet."

She hesitated, then sighed. "Fine. But if you’re going to indulge him, at least make it something educational."

Donovan chuckled, already scrolling through the device. "Maybe I’ll surprise him with a new game—one that actually teaches him something."

###Chapter 24 Get Out.

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains, rousing Lillian from her restless sleep. She groaned, rubbing her temples as the remnants of last night’s argument with Donovan echoed in her mind. His accusations, his betrayal—it all felt like a jagged wound that refused to heal.

She rolled out of bed, her bare feet sinking into the plush carpet. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted up from downstairs, a small comfort in the storm of her emotions. Pulling on a loose sweater, she padded toward the door, only to freeze when she heard voices below.

Sebastian’s deep, commanding tone was unmistakable. But who was he speaking to?

Curiosity gnawed at her. She crept down the stairs, careful to stay silent. The moment she reached the landing, she caught sight of him—tall, imposing, his dark hair slightly tousled as if he’d been running his hands through it in frustration. Across from him stood Evelyn, Donovan’s new mate, her expression smug.

Lillian’s breath hitched. What was she doing here?

Evelyn smirked, flipping her hair over one shoulder. "You can’t keep protecting her forever, Sebastian. The pack is talking. They know she’s weak."

Sebastian’s jaw tightened, his eyes flashing with restrained fury. "Leave."

Evelyn scoffed. "Or what? You’ll throw me out? I’m not afraid of you."

Before Sebastian could respond, Lillian stepped forward, her voice steady despite the tremor in her hands. "You should be."

Both heads snapped toward her. Evelyn’s smirk faltered, replaced by a flicker of unease.

Sebastian’s gaze softened slightly when he saw her, but his tone remained firm. "Lillian, go back upstairs."

She shook her head. "No. I won’t hide while she spews poison in your home."

Evelyn recovered quickly, crossing her arms. "Oh, look who finally grew a spine. Too bad it’s too late."

Lillian clenched her fists. "Get. Out."

For a moment, silence stretched between them, thick with tension. Then, with a huff, Evelyn turned on her heel and stalked toward the door. Before she left, she shot Lillian one last venomous look. "This isn’t over."

The door slammed shut behind her.

Sebastian exhaled sharply, running a hand over his face. "You shouldn’t have done that."

Lillian lifted her chin. "I’m tired of running."

His dark eyes searched hers, something unreadable flickering in their depths. Then, without warning, he closed the distance between them, his fingers brushing her cheek. "Neither am I."

Her pulse stuttered.

A knock at the door shattered the moment.

Sebastian stepped back, his expression hardening. "Expecting someone?"

Lillian shook her head.

When he opened the door, Beatrice stood there, her face pale. "Lillian, you need to come quick. It’s Oliver—he’s missing."

Lillian’s blood ran cold.

Sebastian was already moving, grabbing his coat. "Where was he last seen?"

Beatrice swallowed hard. "The woods near the pack border."

Lillian didn’t hesitate. She bolted for the door, her heart pounding.

Because if anything happened to that little boy…

She’d burn the world down to get him back.

Theodore nodded and picked up the tablet, passing it to Donovan.

"I'll bring this back later. Thanks for your help, Theodore," Donovan said with a polite smile before exiting the kitchen.

"Appreciate the heads-up about Miss Lillian. I'll be watching her closely," Theodore countered. "Perhaps we should consider someone more qualified for the role."

Donovan smirked slightly before leaving.

Theodore nearly forgot about their exchange until hours later, when he scoured the entire estate for Oliver but couldn’t locate him. The boy wasn’t usually in his room at this time, but it was the only place left unchecked. With Sebastian and Victoria gone for the day, the mansion was eerily quiet, save for the occasional staff member hurrying past.

Knocking on Oliver’s door, Theodore heard frustrated grumbling from inside. Frowning, he pushed the door open and found the boy sprawled on his bed, gripping his tablet tightly.

"Master Oliver, how did you get that?" Theodore demanded, stepping inside.

"Get out! I'm busy!" Oliver snapped, not tearing his eyes from the screen.

"Master Oliver, hand it over immediately. You know you’re not permitted to have that right now. Your tutor will arrive shortly, and you need to be ready."

"I said LEAVE!" Oliver shrieked, snatching a framed photo with sharp edges and hurling it straight at Theodore’s face.

Theodore barely dodged in time as the frame shattered against the wall behind him. He turned back to Oliver, who remained fixated on his game, seething.

"Oliver—" he tried again, but the boy grabbed more objects—books, figurines—and launched them at him, screaming for him to get out.

Realizing he had no choice, Theodore retreated. When Oliver spiraled like this, he was volatile, and only Sebastian’s Alpha presence could rein him in. But Sebastian was in a meeting all afternoon.

Perhaps this was the perfect opportunity to expose Lillian’s incompetence. If she failed today, it would prove she wasn’t cut out for the job.

Lillian arrived soon after for her first tutoring session, and Theodore attempted to dissuade her.

"He somehow got his tablet and is glued to his game," Theodore explained. "He’s barricaded himself in his room and refuses to cooperate. Honestly, it’s not worth the effort."

Lillian arched a brow. "Is that so?"

Before Theodore could reply, she did something unexpected. She strode past him and headed straight for the stairs, radiating unshakable confidence. Stunned, he hurried after her, protesting that the family’s private quarters were off-limits.

But Lillian didn’t falter. Her determination was electrifying—and Theodore couldn’t help but wonder if she might actually succeed where others had failed.

Lillian paid him no mind as she ascended to the second floor, her steps deliberate. Pausing at the landing, she scanned the hallway, her gaze lingering on each door until she spotted the one adorned with colorful stickers. Without hesitation, she strode toward it.

"Miss Lillian!" Theodore called after her, his voice laced with urgency.

Ignoring his protests, she rapped sharply on the bedroom door. When silence greeted her, she didn’t wait. Instead, she did something that left Theodore utterly stunned—she reared back and kicked the door open with a resounding crack!

The wood splintered under the force, swinging inward to reveal the dimly lit room beyond. Lillian stepped inside, her expression unreadable, while Theodore could only gape in disbelief.

No one had ever dared to defy Oliver’s sanctuary like this before.
###Chapter 25 The Unexpected Confession

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, illuminating the sleek modern furniture in a warm glow. Lillian stretched beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming from the intensity of last night.

She turned her head, expecting to see Sebastian beside her—only to find the space empty.

A flicker of disappointment curled in her chest before she shook it off. Of course he’s gone. He’s the Lycan Chairman. He doesn’t have time for lazy mornings.

The scent of coffee and freshly baked croissants drifted from the kitchen, pulling her out of bed. She wrapped herself in one of Sebastian’s discarded shirts—far too large on her—and padded barefoot toward the aroma.

Lucien Dubois, the head chef, was already at work, his back turned as he whisked something in a bowl. He glanced over his shoulder, a smirk playing on his lips.

"Ah, mademoiselle," he purred, his French accent thick. "You look positively ravished. Did our Alpha keep you up all night?"

Lillian’s cheeks burned, but she refused to let him rattle her. "Coffee, please," she said instead, sliding onto a barstool.

Lucien chuckled but obliged, sliding a steaming cup toward her. "As you wish."

Before she could take a sip, the penthouse doors swung open, and Sebastian strode in, his tailored suit immaculate, his expression unreadable. His golden eyes locked onto her, and for a moment, the air between them crackled.

Then his phone rang.

He answered without breaking eye contact. "Blackwood."

A pause. His jaw tightened. "I’ll be there in twenty."

He hung up and exhaled sharply. "We have a problem."

Lillian’s fingers tightened around her cup. "What kind of problem?"

Sebastian’s gaze darkened. "Donovan’s making his move."

Her stomach dropped.

Evelyn must have told him.

Sebastian stepped closer, his voice low. "Pack your things. You’re coming with me."

Lillian blinked. "Where?"

His lips curved into a dangerous smile.

"To war."

The evening air was crisp as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s mansion, her fingers gripping the railing tightly. The moon hung low in the sky, casting silvery light over the sprawling estate. She had come here seeking solitude, but her thoughts were anything but peaceful.

Behind her, the door creaked open. She didn’t need to turn around to know who it was—Sebastian’s presence was unmistakable, his scent wrapping around her like a familiar embrace.

“You’ve been avoiding me,” he said, his voice deep and measured.

Lillian exhaled slowly. “I’ve been busy.”

“Too busy to even look at me?”

She turned then, meeting his piercing gaze. The intensity in his eyes made her pulse quicken. “What do you want from me, Sebastian?”

He took a step closer, closing the distance between them. “The truth.”

Her breath hitched. “About what?”

“About us.”

Lillian’s heart pounded. She had spent weeks convincing herself that whatever was between them was temporary—just a fleeting attraction. But the way he was looking at her now made it impossible to deny.

“There is no ‘us,’” she whispered, though the words tasted like a lie.

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. “Don’t.”

“Don’t what?”

“Don’t pretend you don’t feel this.” His hand brushed against hers, sending a jolt of electricity through her. “I see it in your eyes every time you look at me.”

Lillian swallowed hard. She wanted to pull away, but her body betrayed her, leaning into his touch instead.

“You’re engaged to Victoria,” she reminded him, though the reminder felt hollow.

Sebastian’s expression darkened. “An arrangement, nothing more.”

“That doesn’t change anything.”

“It changes everything.” His voice dropped to a growl. “Because I don’t want her. I want you.”

The confession hung between them, raw and undeniable. Lillian’s mind raced. This was dangerous. If anyone found out—

Before she could respond, the sound of footsteps echoed from inside the house. Sebastian’s grip on her hand tightened briefly before he stepped back, his expression shuttering into its usual unreadable mask.

“We’ll talk later,” he murmured, just as Beatrice’s voice called out from the doorway.

“Lillian? There you are! I’ve been looking everywhere for you.”

Lillian forced a smile, her heart still hammering. “Just needed some air.”

Beatrice glanced between them, her eyes narrowing slightly. “Right. Well, Donovan’s downstairs. He says it’s urgent.”

Lillian’s stomach twisted. Donovan. What could he possibly want now?

Sebastian’s gaze flickered to hers, unspoken words lingering in the air.

This wasn’t over.

Not even close.

"Miss Lillian!" Theodore's voice boomed the moment I stepped into Oliver's bedroom. "This is entirely improper. First, you have no business being in their private quarters, and second, you've damaged Sebastian's property!" The door hung precariously from its hinges, barely clinging on. I spared it a fleeting glance before meeting Theodore's furious gaze. His expression darkened, but I merely shrugged.

"I'll cover the repairs," I said coolly. "Sebastian can deduct it from my salary." He opened his mouth to argue, but I ignored him, turning my attention to Oliver instead. The boy sat hunched on his bed, eyes glued to his tablet as if the world around him had ceased to exist. Dark circles shadowed his eyes, and the strain of staring at the screen for hours was evident.

I strode toward him.

"Oliver," I called, trying to catch his attention. When he didn’t respond, I raised my voice. "Oliver Blackwood!" Still nothing. His face was set in deep concentration, lips moving faintly as he muttered under his breath.

"Stupid level..." he grumbled.

The familiar sound of a player dying repeatedly reached my ears, and my brows knitted together. I knew this game. I’d played it. I’d conquered it.

A smirk tugged at my lips as I snatched the tablet from his hands.

"Hey!" he protested, scrambling to grab it back. I held it just out of reach while my fingers flew across the screen. Within moments, I leveled up his character, equipped him with the necessary gear, and breezed through the mission Oliver had been struggling with. His desperate attempts to reclaim the tablet faded into stunned silence as he watched me effortlessly dismantle every enemy on screen.

"Whoa!" he gasped, eyes wide. "That was insane! How did you do that?"

I shrugged. "I’ve played before."

Then, without hesitation, I deleted all my progress from the save file.

"Why would you do that?!" he cried, horrified.

I arched a brow. "I assumed you’d prefer to beat it yourself. You know, like a real gamer."

His face twisted into a scowl. "I’ve been stuck on that level all day!"

Another shrug. "I could teach you," I offered. "But first—homework. Theodore mentioned you have a mountain of it."

It hit me then—Theodore had slipped out of the room unnoticed. Not that it mattered. His presence wasn’t necessary for what came next.

Oliver glared at me, his little face scrunched in defiance. I merely leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed, refusing to back down.

"That’s my offer," I said, my tone leaving no room for negotiation.

His gaze flickered to the tablet still clutched in my hands.

"You swear you’ll help me?"

I gave a firm nod. "I don’t make promises I can’t keep. Especially when gaming’s involved."

A heavy sigh escaped him before he finally relented. "Fine. Let’s get this homework over with."

I gestured to his backpack slumped in the corner. "Grab that and meet me downstairs in the sunroom." Without waiting for a response, I turned on my heel and strode out.

The sunroom was nothing short of breathtaking—floor-to-ceiling windows framed the sprawling gardens outside, bathing the space in golden afternoon light. Plush couches and delicate side tables gave it the air of a high-end resort lounge.

I settled onto one of the couches, tapping my fingers idly against the armrest. Oliver trudged in moments later, dumping his bag onto the coffee table with a dramatic thud. Papers, textbooks, and a handful of pencils spilled out.

I smirked. "Ready to conquer this mountain of work?"

For the next few hours, we plowed through assignments—math problems, reading comprehension, even a bafflingly advanced science worksheet for a seven-year-old. Then again, werewolf education clearly didn’t mess around.

As dusk painted the sky in hues of violet and gold, one of the maids—Sophia, if I remembered correctly—glided into the room. "Master Oliver," she said softly, "dinner is served in the dining hall whenever you’re ready."

Oliver’s lower lip jutted out as he turned pleading eyes my way. "Will you eat with me?"

The hopefulness in his voice was impossible to ignore.

###Chapter 26 what is going on in here?

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains, stirring Lillian from her restless sleep. She groaned, rubbing her temples as the remnants of last night’s confrontation with Donovan replayed in her mind. His betrayal still stung, but what hurt more was the smug satisfaction in Evelyn’s eyes when she had clung to his arm.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Lillian? Are you awake?" Beatrice’s voice was gentle but laced with concern.

Lillian sat up, forcing a smile as her best friend entered. Beatrice took one look at her and sighed. "You look like you wrestled a bear and lost."

"Close enough," Lillian muttered, swinging her legs over the edge of the bed. "Just another night in the life of a werewolf with terrible taste in men."

Beatrice tossed her a bottle of water. "Drink. Then tell me everything."

Lillian recounted the disastrous encounter—Donovan’s cold dismissal, Evelyn’s gloating, and the way her own wolf had howled in silent agony.

Beatrice’s grip tightened around her own water bottle. "That snake. I swear, if I see him again—"

"You’ll what? Challenge him to a duel?" Lillian snorted. "Not worth it. He made his choice."

A knock at the door interrupted them again. This time, it was Sebastian’s deep voice that called out. "Lillian, we need to talk."

Her pulse spiked. The Lycan chairman had been distant since their last argument, and she wasn’t sure she was ready for another confrontation.

Beatrice shot her a questioning look, but Lillian squared her shoulders. "Come in."

Sebastian stepped inside, his towering frame filling the doorway. His dark eyes flicked to Beatrice. "A moment alone?"

Beatrice hesitated, but Lillian nodded. "It’s fine."

Once the door clicked shut, Sebastian exhaled sharply. "I heard about last night."

"News travels fast," Lillian muttered.

"Donovan’s an idiot." The blunt statement caught her off guard. Sebastian rarely wasted words on insults.

She blinked. "Yeah, well, tell that to his new mate."

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "I don’t care about Evelyn. What I care about is you."

The sincerity in his voice made her chest ache. She looked away. "I’ll be fine."

"You don’t have to be." He stepped closer, his presence overwhelming yet comforting. "You’re not alone in this."

Lillian swallowed hard. "Why are you doing this?"

"Because someone should." His gaze held hers, unyielding. "And because I want to."

A knock at the door shattered the moment. Marcus’s voice was urgent. "Sebastian, we have a problem."

Sebastian’s expression darkened. "What is it?"

"Alpha Harrison’s pack is at the border. They’re demanding to speak with you."

Lillian’s stomach dropped. Alpha Harrison—the same wolf who had tried to take advantage of her when she was vulnerable.

Sebastian’s eyes flashed with fury. "Tell them I’ll be there in five." He turned back to Lillian. "Stay here. Don’t leave the house."

She bristled. "I’m not a child—"

"This isn’t a request." His tone left no room for argument.

As he strode out, Lillian clenched her fists. She wasn’t about to sit idle while others fought her battles.

Beatrice burst back in, eyes wide. "Did you hear? Harrison’s here!"

Lillian grabbed her jacket. "Then let’s give him a proper welcome."

Beatrice grinned. "Now you’re talking."

The two slipped out the back, their wolves humming beneath their skin. Whatever Harrison wanted, he was about to learn one thing—Lillian wasn’t backing down. Not anymore.

My eyebrows nearly disappeared into my hairline at the unexpected dinner invitation.

"You want me to join you for dinner?" I asked, caught off guard.

"There's more than enough for you as well, Madam," the maid chimed in, her grin stretching ear to ear. I glanced back at Oliver for confirmation, and the way he fidgeted nervously tugged at my heart. What was he so anxious about?

"My father is never home for dinner, and my sister hasn't been around since she started seeing that Donovan guy," Oliver admitted, his voice small. "Sometimes Butler Theodore eats with me, but not always. It gets... lonely."

A pang of sympathy shot through me, and I rested a reassuring hand on his shoulder.

"I'd be happy to have dinner with you, Oliver," I told him warmly. "And afterward, we can play that game—I'll show you how to beat that impossible level."

His face lit up like fireworks, and he sprang to his feet.

"Come on!" He grabbed my wrist and practically dragged me toward the kitchen.

The dining table was set for one—just Oliver. The sight of that single place setting made my chest tighten. The maid hurried in behind us, swiftly laying out another setting for me with an apologetic smile. I took my seat beside Oliver as she poured us fresh juice before serving the meal.

The rich aroma of beef stew filled the air, and I hadn't realized how ravenous I was until the first spoonful touched my lips. My stomach growled in appreciation. As we ate, Oliver chattered excitedly about school, his favorite subjects, and the friends he'd made.

I had to admit—I was enjoying this. The little boy was bright and full of energy, and seeing him so happy just from having company made something warm settle in my chest.

After we finished, I offered to help clear the table, but the maids waved me off.

"It's their job," Oliver explained with a shrug.

"That doesn’t mean we can’t be kind," I countered.

He just blinked at me before bouncing in his seat.

"Can we play the game now?"

I laughed. "I did promise, didn’t I?"

He bolted from his chair and dashed into the parlor where I’d left his tablet. I followed at a more leisurely pace.

Settling onto the couch beside him, I walked him through every trick I knew. He followed my instructions perfectly, his small fingers moving with surprising precision. When he finally conquered the level, he leapt up with a triumphant shout, clapping his hands. I laughed—right before he threw his arms around me in an impulsive hug.

"Can we keep playing?" he begged, eyes sparkling.

I pretended to consider it. "Well... you did finish your homework. I suppose you’ve earned a little more time."

His grin was worth it.

But tomorrow, we were going to—

"Work extra hard on studying your letters and math before we do any defense training. Understood?" I said with a soft smile.

Oliver beamed, nodding eagerly. "Can you teach me how to shoot the bow and arrow too?" he asked, his voice tinged with hopeful excitement. "I always miss my target."

"I'd be happy to teach you everything I know," I assured him, ruffling his hair lightly.

He settled back down and handed me the tablet, eager to tackle the next level. For the next half hour, we passed it back and forth, laughing at the silly mishaps in the game. The time flew by, and I barely noticed the absence of Theodore Whitmore—until his voice cut through the quiet from outside the parlor.

"She let him play on that tablet the entire time! They’ve done nothing productive, Alpha!" Theodore’s voice was sharp with disapproval. "I told you she wasn’t fit to be his tutor."

My head snapped up just as the door burst open. Sebastian Blackwood strode in, his presence commanding and intense. Oliver nearly dropped the tablet in surprise, but I caught it just in time before it hit the floor.

"Dad! You're home," Oliver said, his smile sheepish, as if he’d been caught sneaking sweets before dinner.

Sebastian’s arms were crossed over his broad chest, his piercing gaze locked onto me. "Miss Dumont," he said, his voice dangerously calm. "Care to explain what exactly is going on in here?"

The air thickened with tension, and I swallowed hard. This wasn’t just about a game anymore—it was about trust. And I had just lost it.
###Chapter 27 Lillian's POV

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains, stirring Lillian from her restless sleep. She groaned, rubbing her temples as the remnants of last night’s argument with Donovan replayed in her mind. His accusations, his cold dismissal—it still stung like a fresh wound.

Rolling out of bed, she padded barefoot to the window, pushing the curtains aside to gaze at the sprawling estate grounds. The sight of Sebastian Blackwood’s mansion, with its manicured gardens and towering oak trees, should have been comforting. Instead, it only reminded her of how out of place she felt here.

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, forcing a lightness into her voice she didn’t feel.

The door creaked open, and Beatrice poked her head in, her usual bubbly demeanor subdued. "Hey, you okay? You look like you barely slept."

Lillian sighed, running a hand through her tangled hair. "Just another night of overthinking."

Beatrice stepped inside, shutting the door behind her. "Donovan again?"

Lillian nodded, sinking onto the edge of her bed. "He’s convinced I betrayed him. That I chose Sebastian over him."

Beatrice scoffed, plopping down beside her. "Please. That man’s ego is bigger than this mansion. You don’t owe him anything."

Lillian managed a small smile. "I know. It’s just… complicated."

"Everything’s complicated with fated mates," Beatrice muttered, then winced. "Sorry. I didn’t mean to bring that up."

Lillian shook her head. "It’s fine. I’m trying not to dwell on it."

Beatrice nudged her shoulder. "Good. Because we have bigger problems."

Lillian frowned. "What now?"

"Cassandra," Beatrice said, rolling her eyes. "She’s been spreading rumors about you again. Something about you cheating on Donovan with Sebastian."

Lillian groaned. "Of course she is."

Beatrice smirked. "Don’t worry. I already set the record straight. But you might want to brace yourself for some nasty looks at school today."

Lillian exhaled sharply. "Great. Just what I needed."

A knock at the door startled them both. This time, it was Sebastian’s deep voice that called through the wood. "Lillian? Are you awake?"

Beatrice shot her a knowing look, waggling her eyebrows. "Speaking of complications…"

Lillian swatted her arm before calling back, "Yes, come in."

Sebastian stepped inside, his imposing frame filling the doorway. His dark eyes flicked to Beatrice briefly before settling on Lillian. "Good. You’re both here. We need to talk."

Lillian’s stomach twisted. "About what?"

Sebastian’s expression was unreadable. "Evelyn."

Beatrice stiffened beside her. "What about her?"

Sebastian crossed his arms. "She’s been seen meeting with Alpha Harrison. I don’t trust it."

Lillian’s pulse quickened. Alpha Harrison was the same man who had tried to take advantage of her when she was drunk. If Evelyn was working with him…

Beatrice cursed under her breath. "This can’t be good."

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "No. It’s not. Which is why I need you both to be careful. Especially you, Lillian."

Lillian met his gaze, the intensity in his eyes sending a shiver down her spine. "I will."

Sebastian nodded once, then turned to leave. But at the door, he paused. "Oh, and Lillian?"

She looked up. "Yes?"

His lips curved into a faint, almost imperceptible smile. "Wear the necklace I gave you. Just in case."

Then he was gone, leaving Lillian with a racing heart and a thousand unanswered questions.

Beatrice whistled low. "Well. That was… intense."

Lillian touched the delicate silver chain around her neck, the pendant cool against her skin. "Yeah. It was."

And as she prepared for the day ahead, she couldn’t shake the feeling that things were about to get a whole lot worse.

"I warned you," Theodore said, crossing his arms over his chest. Not only had I failed to get Oliver to complete his assignments, but I had also encouraged his distractions. According to him, I should be fired immediately, and the position reposted on the Lycan job board.

My stomach twisted at his words. When I first met Theodore, I thought he was reasonable—perhaps even kind. But now, it was clear he was determined to get me dismissed. I had no idea what I’d done to earn such hostility, but I’d be lying if I said it didn’t sting.

"Is this true?" Sebastian asked, his piercing gaze locking onto mine.

I lifted my chin, pressing my lips together. My cheeks burned, but I refused to let my embarrassment show. Instead, I turned to the table where Oliver’s completed work lay.

"See for yourself," I said, gathering the papers and thrusting them toward Sebastian.

He took them, scanning each page with a frown that slowly shifted into surprise.

"This is Oliver’s handwriting," he murmured, flipping through the assignments. "He finished all of this?"

I nodded, crossing my arms as I shot Theodore a sharp look. His face paled slightly under my glare.

"Yes," I answered, keeping my voice steady. "Oliver completed every assignment and even managed some extra studying. But balance is important for a child. Constant work without breaks leads to exhaustion and loss of focus. He kept his word, so I kept mine—he finished his tasks, and I let him play afterward."

I turned back to Sebastian, who was watching me with an unreadable expression.

"Oliver lacks companionship, Alpha Sebastian. That’s why he acts out. When you spend time with him, you’d see he’s actually thoughtful and kind."

Sebastian’s brows lifted as he set the papers down. "Are you telling me how to raise my son?"

"Of course not," I said quickly. "But punishing him without understanding why he behaves a certain way isn’t effective. Even for you, Alpha."

His jaw tightened, but before he could respond, the silk scarf around my neck slipped, exposing the mark Donovan had left. I scrambled to fix it, but it was too late—Sebastian’s eyes darkened, his nostrils flaring as he took in the bruise.

"It’s not what you think," I whispered, hastily covering it again.

I wanted to explain, but how could I? If I told Sebastian that Donovan had forced himself on me, he’d never believe I hadn’t encouraged it. He’d assume I had pursued Donovan, despite knowing he was engaged to Victoria.

"It doesn’t matter," Sebastian muttered, though his tone was laced with irritation. "Just keep your personal affairs away from my son. Understood?"

I swallowed hard and nodded, biting my lower lip.


"Understood," I murmured, my voice barely above a whisper.

Sebastian's piercing gaze shifted to Theodore, his expression darkening with barely contained fury.

"You claimed Lillian failed to complete her duties today, yet I see she has not only fulfilled them but exceeded expectations. How dare you spread such lies, Theodore?" Sebastian's voice was a low growl, the authority in his tone making the butler flinch.

"I—I—" Theodore stammered, his face paling as he struggled to form a coherent response.

"Silence," Sebastian commanded, his tone leaving no room for argument. "You are forbidden from speaking in my presence for the next month. Now, get out of my sight."

"Y-yes, Alpha," Theodore choked out, bowing his head in submission before hastily retreating from the room, his shoulders slumped in defeat.

I adjusted the scarf around my neck, ensuring it wouldn’t slip again, then straightened my posture to meet Sebastian’s intense stare. The weight of his presence was almost suffocating, but I refused to cower.

"I should leave," I said, breaking the heavy silence. "It’s getting late, and my mother will be wondering where I am."

Sebastian studied me for a long moment before giving a curt nod. "Very well."

As I turned to go, I felt his eyes still on me, burning into my back like a brand.

###Chapter 28 He Nodded

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the lavish bedroom as Lillian stirred beneath the silk sheets. Her body ached from the previous night’s training session with Donovan, but the pain was nothing compared to the storm brewing in her heart. She had spent hours replaying their last encounter—his cold dismissal, the way his new mate, Evelyn, had smirked at her from the sidelines.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Miss Lillian?" Harper’s voice floated through the door. "Alpha Sebastian requests your presence in his study."

Lillian’s pulse quickened. Sebastian. Just the thought of the Lycan chairman sent an unexpected warmth through her. She had tried to suppress it, but every time their paths crossed, the magnetic pull between them grew stronger.

"Tell him I’ll be there shortly," she replied, forcing her voice to remain steady.

She dressed quickly, opting for a simple yet elegant navy-blue dress that accentuated her curves. As she descended the grand staircase, the scent of freshly brewed coffee and Lucien’s famous croissants filled the air. The mansion was alive with activity—maids bustling about, guards stationed at every corner.

Sebastian’s study door was slightly ajar when she arrived. She hesitated, then knocked lightly.

"Come in." His deep voice sent a shiver down her spine.

She pushed the door open to find him seated behind his mahogany desk, his piercing gaze locked onto a stack of documents. The morning light highlighted the sharp angles of his jaw, the faint scar running along his temple—a reminder of battles fought and won.

"You wanted to see me?" she asked, clasping her hands behind her back to hide their slight tremble.

Sebastian looked up, his expression unreadable. "Sit."

She obeyed, perching on the edge of the plush chair opposite him. The silence stretched, thick with tension.

"I’ve received word that Donovan is planning something," he finally said, his voice low. "He’s been seen meeting with Alpha Harrison."

Lillian’s breath hitched. Harrison was the same Alpha who had tried to take advantage of her when she was vulnerable. "What does he want?"

Sebastian leaned forward, his eyes darkening. "That’s what I intend to find out. But I need you to be careful. If Donovan is desperate enough to ally with Harrison, he won’t hesitate to use you as leverage."

The weight of his words settled over her. She had known Donovan was ruthless, but this—this was a new low.

"I won’t let him," she said firmly, lifting her chin. "I’m not the same weak girl I was before."

A flicker of admiration crossed Sebastian’s face. "No, you’re not."

Their eyes locked, and for a moment, the world outside faded. The air between them crackled with unspoken emotions—desire, protectiveness, something deeper neither dared to name.

Then, abruptly, Sebastian stood, breaking the spell. "Marcus will accompany you to campus today. Don’t go anywhere alone."

Lillian nodded, though disappointment curled in her chest. She had hoped for… what, exactly? A confession? A kiss?

Get a grip, she scolded herself. He’s your protector, nothing more.

But as she turned to leave, his voice stopped her.

"Lillian."

She glanced back.

His expression softened, just slightly. "Be safe."

Her heart skipped a beat. "I will."

Outside the study, she exhaled shakily. The day had barely begun, and already, the stakes felt higher than ever. Donovan’s schemes, Sebastian’s protectiveness, the unspoken tension between them—it was all a powder keg waiting to explode.

And she was standing right in the middle of it.

"My driver, Frederick, is waiting outside. Let him take you home," Sebastian offered, his deep voice smooth yet commanding.

I shook my head, already reaching into my bag for my phone. "It's fine, I'll just call an Uber."

Before I could unlock the screen, his large hand covered mine, warm and unyielding. "Don't waste your money when I'm offering you a free ride," he said, his tone firm but calm. "Frederick remembers your address from yesterday. Let him take you."

I swallowed hard, then nodded reluctantly. "Alright. Thank you."

Turning to Oliver, I found him staring between us with wide, curious eyes. I wondered what was going through his young mind, but he quickly snapped out of it when he noticed my gaze.

"I'm leaving now," I told him, softening my voice. "But I'll be back tomorrow afternoon. You have school, and I have morning classes."

Oliver nodded, though his pout made it clear he didn’t want me to go. "Clean up your mess and get some rest tonight," I instructed, ruffling his hair lightly. "You'll need your energy for training."

"Okay," he mumbled. "Bye, Lillian."

"Bye, Oliver," I replied with a small wave before glancing back at Sebastian.

He was still watching me, his piercing gaze intense. I gave him a brief nod, unsure what else to say, then stepped around him and headed out of the villa.

Third Person POV

Sebastian watched as Lillian walked away, his jaw tightening when his eyes landed on the faint mark on her neck. It irritated him in a way he couldn’t explain—an unfamiliar, unwelcome heat simmering beneath his skin.

He remembered the marks he had once left on her, the possessive satisfaction that had curled in his chest. But those had faded, replaced by someone else’s claim.

Who had dared to leave that mark on her?

Then again, maybe it was better he didn’t know.

"Why are you so mean sometimes?" Oliver’s voice pulled him from his thoughts.

Sebastian blinked, looking down at his son. "I wasn’t mean," he denied, though his frown betrayed his irritation.

Oliver rolled his eyes dramatically and flopped onto the couch. "Yes, you were," he muttered. "We were having a good day, and now she left upset."

Sebastian exhaled sharply, running a hand through his hair. He hadn’t meant to ruin anything—but the sight of that mark had unsettled him more than he cared to admit.

And that, more than anything, was what truly bothered him.

Sebastian arched a brow as he studied his son. For a moment, he was at a loss for words. He exhaled deeply and sank onto the couch beside Oliver. It had been too long since he’d spent real time with the boy—Lillian’s words echoed in his mind, sharp and insistent. Oliver needs companionship. Was she right?

"Good day?" Sebastian asked, his voice softer than intended.

Oliver nodded, his gaze fixed on the floor.

"Yeah," he murmured.

Sebastian hesitated before pressing further. "You like your new tutor?"

At that, Oliver’s face lit up, his eyes bright as he finally met his father’s.

"She’s awesome, Dad! Lillian’s so cool—she knows all about combat training, she’s crazy smart, and she plays video games with me. We even had dinner together tonight. I wish she could stay forever." He grinned, then added with startling boldness, "She’d make a great mom!"

Sebastian stiffened, his pulse skipping. What the hell?

"Don’t be ridiculous," he muttered, turning away.

But Oliver clung to his arm, undeterred. "I mean it! If Lillian were my mom, I’d be the happiest kid ever. Tomorrow, she’s teaching me archery and self-defense!"

Sebastian blinked. The kid wasn’t just rambling—he genuinely admired Lillian. That realization hit harder than expected. Oliver’s smile faded as he slumped back, scuffing his shoe against the carpet.

"My other tutors never did stuff like this," he mumbled. "They just wanted to impress you."

A pang of guilt twisted in Sebastian’s chest. It was true. Most tutors had seen Oliver as an obstacle, a stepping stone to the Lycan Alpha’s attention. No wonder the boy had acted out—he’d been fighting for scraps of care.

Lillian’s words returned, sharper now: "Oliver isn’t rebellious, Sebastian. He’s lonely. Spend time with him, and you’ll see—he’s just a sweet kid who needs someone."

Sebastian exhaled, rubbing his temple. Maybe she was right.

###Chapter 29 Lillian's POV

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting golden streaks across the plush carpet of Lillian's bedroom. She stretched lazily, her muscles still sore from yesterday's intense combat training. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted up from the kitchen, mingling with the crisp autumn air.

Lillian padded downstairs, her bare feet sinking into the soft rug. The mansion was unusually quiet, save for the distant clinking of silverware. In the dining room, Sebastian sat at the head of the table, his sharp gaze fixed on a stack of documents. Oliver, his son, was absent—likely still asleep.

"Good morning," Lillian murmured, sliding into her usual seat.

Sebastian barely glanced up. "Morning." His voice was clipped, his posture rigid.

She frowned. Something was off.

Before she could ask, Theodore, the butler, appeared with a tray of steaming coffee and pastries. "Miss Lillian," he greeted warmly, setting a cup in front of her. "You have a meeting with Professor Sinclair at noon."

Lillian nodded absently, her attention still on Sebastian. His jaw was clenched, his fingers tapping impatiently against the table.

"Everything alright?" she ventured.

Sebastian exhaled sharply. "Just business."

But she knew better. The tension in the room was thick enough to cut with a knife.

Just then, Marcus, Sebastian's beta, strode in, his expression grim. "We have a problem."

Sebastian's eyes darkened. "What now?"

Marcus hesitated, glancing at Lillian before continuing. "Donovan's pack is making moves near the eastern border. They’ve been spotted trespassing."

Lillian's stomach twisted. Donovan—her ex-fated mate—was stirring trouble again.

Sebastian pushed back his chair, his voice low and dangerous. "Gather the gammas. We’ll handle this."

Lillian stood abruptly. "I’m coming with you."

Sebastian turned, his gaze piercing. "No. It’s too dangerous."

She crossed her arms. "I can handle myself."

For a moment, they locked eyes—a silent battle of wills. Then, Sebastian sighed. "Fine. But you stay close to me."

As they prepared to leave, Lillian’s phone buzzed. A message from Beatrice: "Heard about Donovan. Be careful."

Lillian pocketed her phone, her pulse quickening. Whatever Donovan was planning, she wouldn’t let him win. Not again.

The morning exam had drained me completely. As soon as my last class ended, I dragged myself to the student lounge, desperate for a moment of peace. The sight of Beatrice sitting by the window, nibbling on a pop tart while flipping through her textbook, was a welcome relief.

I slumped into the chair across from her, and she slid an iced coffee toward me with a knowing smile.

"Got you some caffeine," she said, her eyes twinkling.

"You're an absolute angel," I groaned, taking a long sip. The cool sweetness washed over me, and I sighed in bliss.

Beatrice closed her book, tilting her head. "So? What happened last night? You were supposed to call me."

I winced, rubbing my temple. "Sorry, I got… held up. By the time I got home, I just collapsed."

Her eyebrows shot up. "Held up doing what exactly?"

I hesitated. The contract Sebastian Blackwood had made me sign was crystal clear—no mentioning him, no revealing who I was tutoring. The Blackwoods were practically royalty in the werewolf world, and if word got out that I was working for him, it could spell disaster. I trusted Beatrice with my life, but I couldn’t risk this job. The money was too good, and my family needed it.

"I got a tutoring gig," I admitted.

Her eyes widened. "Seriously? For who?"

"A kid from a neighboring pack. Pays well—really well."

Beatrice grinned, nudging my foot under the table. "That’s amazing, Lillian! Tutoring is so you. Honestly, is there anything you can’t do?"

I snorted. "You’re ridiculous."

She rolled her eyes playfully. "Name one thing."

I pretended to think. "Knitting."

She burst out laughing, shaking her head. "Okay, fine, but you could still try."

I laughed with her, the tension melting away. For a moment, it was just us—two best friends joking around like everything was normal.

But of course, it didn’t last.

Because in walked Cassandra and her usual entourage.

I’d known Cassandra since middle school. We’d even been friends once—until I beat her in the spelling bee. And just like that, the peaceful moment shattered.

Her sharp gaze locked onto me, and her lips curled into a smirk.

"Well, well," she drawled. "If it isn’t the tutor."

My stomach dropped.

How the hell did she know?

She had become venomous. My lifelong nemesis. Since our school days, we'd been locked in a relentless battle for supremacy, and now in college, nothing had changed.

Cassandra was breathtaking—a supermodel's physique paired with a genius intellect. Her golden curls cascaded down her back, framing ocean-blue eyes lined with thick, dark lashes. Her lips, always glossed in soft pink, contrasted against the subtle blush dusting her high cheekbones. Every outfit she wore was a custom design from her mother, Isabella Fontaine, a legendary fashion icon.

To men, she was perfection. Too bad perfection came with a poisonous personality.

"Well, well, if it isn’t Lillian," she drawled, halting in front of our table. Her entourage flanked her, their gazes dripping with disdain, as if we were nothing more than dirt beneath their designer heels.

"Cassandra," I replied flatly.

"Word is your fated mate rejected you. What did you do to scare him off?" She planted her hands on her hips, smirking.

Her friends tittered.

"Werewolves never reject their mates unless something disastrous happens," one of them sneered.

"Lillian must’ve done something unforgivable to make Donovan run," another chimed in, giggling.

"That’s none of your concern, Cassandra," I bit out.

"Don’t you have anything better to do?" Beatrice crossed her arms, raising a brow. "Aren’t we a little too old for petty high school drama?"

"And if it isn’t Beatrice, the ever-loyal shadow," Cassandra shot back before refocusing on me. "Oh, and I also heard your father’s in prison for massive debts. How embarrassing for your family. How will you even afford next semester’s tuition now that you’re practically bankrupt?"

"Are you really trying to compensate for the fact that I beat you for top student again by attacking my personal life?" I narrowed my eyes.

Her face paled. The smugness in her expression flickered, replaced by shock. Her friends fell silent.

Beatrice leaned back, grinning triumphantly.

"This isn’t over," Cassandra hissed. "I will knock you off that pedestal. Let’s go, girls."

She spun on her heel, her golden hair whipping dramatically, and stormed off with her minions trailing behind. The moment she disappeared, I exhaled sharply, unaware I’d been holding my breath.

"That was legendary," Beatrice laughed. "Did you see her face?"

###Chapter 30 The Moon's Whisper

The crisp night air carried the scent of pine and damp earth as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s sprawling estate. The moon hung low, casting silver light over the forest beyond. She shivered, though not from the cold.

Inside, the party continued—laughter, clinking glasses, the hum of conversation. But out here, she was alone with her thoughts. And with him.

Sebastian leaned against the railing beside her, his broad shoulders outlined by moonlight. "Escaping already?" His voice was deep, laced with amusement.

Lillian exhaled. "Just needed air."

He studied her, golden eyes flickering with something unreadable. "You don’t belong in there, do you?"

She stiffened. "What’s that supposed to mean?"

"You’re not like them." He gestured toward the ballroom. "You don’t care about status or power plays. You never did."

Her pulse quickened. He saw too much. "And you do?"

A smirk tugged at his lips. "I have to."

Silence settled between them, thick with tension. The wind rustled the trees, carrying the distant howl of a wolf.

Then—footsteps.

Evelyn appeared in the doorway, her crimson dress clinging to her curves. "There you are." Her gaze darted between them, sharp as a blade. "Donovan’s looking for you, Lillian."

Lillian’s stomach twisted. Donovan. Her ex-fated mate, now bound to Evelyn. The betrayal still burned.

Sebastian straightened. "She’ll be along."

Evelyn’s smile didn’t reach her eyes. "Of course." She lingered, then turned on her heel and vanished into the crowd.

Lillian gripped the railing. "I should go."

Sebastian caught her wrist. "Stay."

Her breath hitched. His touch was warm, electric. "Why?"

"Because I’m asking." His thumb brushed her pulse point. "Because you want to."

She swallowed hard. He wasn’t wrong.

But then—a crash from inside. Shouts. A woman’s scream.

They exchanged a glance and sprinted back into chaos.

The ballroom was in disarray. Glass shattered. Guests scrambled. And in the center—

Oliver, Sebastian’s seven-year-old son, stood frozen, tears streaking his face. At his feet lay Victoria, Sebastian’s daughter, her gown torn, her arm bleeding.

And looming over them—

Donovan.

His eyes glowed feral. "You lied to me," he snarled at Lillian.

Her blood turned to ice.

Sebastian stepped forward, a growl rumbling in his chest. "Touch my family again, and I’ll rip your throat out."

The room held its breath.

Then—Oliver lunged, tiny fists swinging. "Leave my sister alone!"

Donovan backhanded him.

The world snapped.

Lillian’s vision tinted red. Her claws unsheathed. She launched—

But Sebastian was faster.

He seized Donovan by the throat and slammed him into the wall. "You’re dead."

Evelyn screamed. "Stop!"

Too late.

The first bone cracked.

And Lillian realized—

This wasn’t just a fight.

It was war.

"I have a feeling she's going to get back at me somehow," I murmured under my breath.

"Speaking of top students, are you going to the award ceremony tomorrow?" Beatrice asked, flipping through her notebook. "The winner gets a full scholarship for next year."

I blinked. "Oh, right. I completely forgot about that." The invitation had arrived weeks ago, but with everything happening—Donovan, Sebastian, the tutoring—it had slipped my mind entirely. "Yeah, I should probably go. That scholarship would be a lifesaver."

Glancing at the clock on the wall, I sighed. "I have to get to my next class. See you later, Bea."

"Bye!" she called after me.

After class, I stood in the parking lot, pulling out my phone to call an Uber. I needed to change before heading to Sebastian’s mansion for our tutoring session. But before I could even open the app, a sleek black car glided to a stop in front of me.

I startled as the window rolled down, revealing Frederick, Sebastian’s ever-polite chauffeur.

"Good afternoon, Miss Dumont," he said smoothly, unlocking the back door. "Mr. Blackwood sent me to collect you."

I hesitated, my fingers tightening around my bag. It was one thing to be picked up at home—but at school? Still, I forced a smile. "Thanks."

Sliding into the plush leather seat, I couldn’t shake the prickling sensation at the back of my neck. Like I was being watched.

I dismissed it as paranoia as the car pulled away.

Third Person POV

Cassandra’s blood boiled.

How dare Lillian speak to her like that? The audacity of that nobody, acting like she was better than everyone else.

Her friends trailed behind her as she stormed out of the student lounge, but the moment they stepped outside, Cassandra whipped around, raising a hand to silence them.

"Leave me," she ordered, her voice sharp as ice.

One of them blinked. "W-what? Why?"

"I need to be alone," Cassandra snapped, crossing her arms. "Go."

They hesitated, but they knew better than to argue. With reluctant nods, they scattered, leaving Cassandra standing alone in the fading sunlight.

She stalked across campus, her mind racing. She had no more classes today, and the thought of retreating to her dorm for a long, hot bath was tempting. Anything to scrub Lillian’s smug face from her thoughts.

But then—she stopped.

There, sitting on a bench in the quad, was a familiar figure. Hood pulled low, face shadowed.

Cassandra’s lips curled into a slow, knowing smile.

This person was no stranger to her. They had been friends—allies—for a long time. And more importantly, they hated Lillian just as much as she did.

Straightening her shoulders, Cassandra strode forward, her heels clicking against the pavement.

"Lillian is insufferable," she muttered as she dropped onto the bench beside them. "You won’t believe what she said to me. She actually had the nerve to imply she was smarter than me."

Her companion chuckled darkly. "What did you expect? She’s always been arrogant."

Cassandra smirked. "True. But she won’t be for long."

Her friend turned slightly, the hood shifting just enough to reveal a glint of cold amusement. "Oh? Do tell."

Cassandra leaned in, her voice dropping to a whisper. "I have a plan."

"I can't stand her."

Cassandra crossed her arms, eyeing her friend with suspicion. "What are you even doing out here?" she asked, her tone sharp. "You never hang around the quad. Isn’t this beneath you? Or so you always claim."

Her friend rolled their eyes dramatically, exhaling in exasperation.

"Actually, I was waiting for you."

Cassandra arched a brow. "For what?"

"Because I need your help," they said, stepping closer, their voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "I need whatever dirt you can dig up on Lillian. Think you can handle that?"

Cassandra smirked. "And how exactly do you expect me to do that? Everyone knows she got rejected and her family went broke."

Her friend tapped their chin thoughtfully. "There has to be more. Something we’re missing. No way she’s this perfect at everything. She’s hiding something, and I need you to find out what it is."

Cassandra tilted her head, intrigued. "And what’s in it for me?"

A slow, knowing grin spread across her friend’s face.

"Because if we play this right, we can get rid of Lillian for good." They leaned in. "Then you become the top student."

Cassandra’s eyes gleamed with ambition.

"I like the way you think," she purred, flashing a sly wink. "Consider me in. I’ll tail her after school and see what she’s really up to."

As they parted ways, Cassandra spotted Lillian stepping out of the academic center, engrossed in her phone. Just then, a sleek, black luxury car rolled up in front of her. Cassandra ducked behind a pillar, her pulse quickening as she watched Lillian exchange words with someone inside.

Her breath hitched when Lillian opened the back door—and slid into the plush leather seat like she owned it.

Cassandra’s jaw nearly dropped.

That was a Rolls-Royce Phantom—discreet but unmistakably elite.

How the hell does she have access to a car like that when her family’s supposed to be broke?!

No wonder she walked around with that infuriating confidence.

Something wasn’t adding up.

And Cassandra was determined to find out what.

###Chapter 31 The School Award Ceremony

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains, stirring Lillian from her restless sleep. She groaned, rubbing her temples as the remnants of last night’s confrontation with Donovan replayed in her mind. His betrayal still stung like a fresh wound, but she refused to let it break her.

Downstairs, the scent of freshly brewed coffee and warm pastries filled the air. Lucien, the flirtatious head chef, had outdone himself again. Lillian forced a smile as she entered the dining room, where Sebastian sat with Oliver, who was enthusiastically recounting his latest school adventure.

"Morning," Lillian murmured, sliding into her seat.

Sebastian’s piercing gaze flicked to her, assessing. "You look exhausted."

She shrugged. "Didn’t sleep well."

Oliver, oblivious to the tension, grinned. "Papa says we’re going to the lake house this weekend! Can you come too, Lillian?"

Before she could answer, Sebastian spoke. "She has training."

Lillian stiffened. "Actually, I don’t. Marcus cleared my schedule."

A flicker of surprise crossed Sebastian’s face, but he quickly masked it. "Then I suppose you’re free to join us."

The way he said it—so indifferent—made her chest tighten. Was he still angry about last night? Or was this just another power play?

Beatrice burst into the room, her phone clutched in her hand. "You won’t believe what just happened!"

Lillian arched a brow. "What?"

"Evelyn posted a picture with Donovan at some fancy gala. The caption? ‘Fated and flawless.’" Beatrice rolled her eyes. "As if anyone buys that."

Lillian’s stomach twisted, but she refused to let it show. "Good for them."

Sebastian’s jaw clenched. "Ignore it. They’re not worth your energy."

She met his gaze, surprised by the intensity in his eyes. Was that… protectiveness?

Before she could dwell on it, Theodore entered, his expression grave. "Sir, we have a situation. Alpha Harrison’s pack is making moves near our eastern border."

Sebastian stood abruptly. "Gather the gammas. We’ll handle this now."

Lillian rose as well. "I’m coming."

Sebastian hesitated, then nodded. "Fine. But stay close."

As they strode out, Beatrice grabbed Lillian’s arm. "Be careful."

Lillian squeezed her hand. "Always."

Outside, the pack was already mobilizing. Marcus briefed them quickly—Harrison’s wolves had been spotted trespassing, likely testing their defenses.

Sebastian turned to Lillian. "Stick with Julian. Don’t engage unless necessary."

She bristled at the order but nodded.

The forest was eerily quiet as they moved in. Then—a rustle. A snarl.

Harrison’s wolves emerged from the shadows, their eyes gleaming with challenge.

Sebastian stepped forward, his voice a deadly calm. "You’re on Blackwood territory. Leave. Now."

The rival alpha smirked. "Or what?"

Before Sebastian could respond, a blur of fur lunged from the trees—straight for Lillian.

Instinct took over. She shifted mid-air, meeting the attack with claws and teeth.

The fight was brutal, but she held her own. When the dust settled, the trespassers were retreating, their alpha’s pride wounded.

Sebastian approached her, his gaze unreadable. "You didn’t follow orders."

Lillian lifted her chin. "I didn’t need to."

For a heartbeat, silence stretched between them. Then, the ghost of a smile touched his lips. "No. You didn’t."

As they walked back, Lillian realized something had shifted. The tension between them wasn’t just anger or frustration anymore.

It was something far more dangerous.

And she wasn’t sure she wanted to resist it.

Third Person POV

Donovan's phone buzzed against the polished mahogany bar. He swirled the amber liquid in his glass before taking a slow sip, then signaled the bartender for another refill. The ice clinked as he exhaled sharply before answering.

"You better not be wasting my time," he said, skipping any greeting.

On the other end, his subordinate hesitated before speaking. "Lillian wasn’t fired. She convinced Oliver to finish his assignments despite the leaked videos. Even Theodore tried appealing to Alpha Sebastian, but it didn’t work. She’s... persuasive."

Donovan’s grip tightened around his glass. The bartender slid a fresh drink toward him, and he tossed back half of it in one go. "What about the school? Did you handle it?"

"Yes," the subordinate replied quickly. "I paid off one of her professors—Sinclair. He’ll plant evidence to get her expelled."

A smirk curled Donovan’s lips. "Good. At least that’s one problem solved."

"There’s more," the man added. "I reached out to one of her enemies at school—Cassandra. She’s digging up dirt on Lillian. Anything useful, I’ll pass along. Could be leverage."

"Excellent." Donovan’s voice dripped with satisfaction. "Keep me updated."

"Will do, boss." The line went dead.

Donovan leaned back, swirling his whiskey as a dark smile spread across his face. Soon, everything would fall into place. He’d marry Victoria, claim the Alpha title, and make Lillian his—whether she wanted it or not.

Lillian’s POV

"I look like I’m here for a board meeting, not a gala," I muttered, tugging at the hem of my fitted black skirt. My blouse was crisp, professional, but compared to the sea of glittering gowns and tailored suits around me, I might as well have been wearing pajamas.

The reception hall had been transformed into something out of a fairy tale—crystal chandeliers, cascading floral arrangements, and waiters weaving through the crowd with silver trays. The award ceremony was about to start, and my stomach twisted at the thought. Winning meant a full scholarship—freedom from tuition worries next year.

I turned to Beatrice, who was scanning the room with wide eyes. "Why is everyone dressed like they’re meeting royalty?"

She shot me an incredulous look. "You didn’t hear? Sebastian Blackwood might actually show up tonight. He’s invited every year but never comes. Rumor has it he personally confirmed with Headmaster Wellington this time." She lowered her voice. "Half these girls would sell their souls just to breathe the same air as him."

My chest tightened at the mention of Sebastian. Of course, I knew he was invited annually, but the idea of him actually being here sent an unexpected jolt through me.

Then the whispers began.

A hush fell over the crowd as the grand doors swung open.

And there he was.

Sebastian Blackwood, in the flesh, his presence commanding the room like a storm rolling in.

Every head turned. Every breath hitched.

Including mine.

The stage was elegantly set with a row of chairs, each bearing a nameplate that gleamed under the soft lighting. My seat was right in the center, positioned beside Cassandra’s. A few other distinguished guests had already taken their places on either side of us, waiting with poised anticipation for the ceremony to begin.

Then, the grand doors swung open.

A hush fell over the room as the Silver Crescent Gamma warriors filed in, their presence commanding immediate attention. At their center stood a figure who radiated power—Sebastian Blackwood, the Lycan chairman himself.

Sebastian strode into the hall with the effortless confidence of a man who owned every space he entered. His entourage moved in perfect sync, their disciplined steps echoing through the now-silent reception hall. My breath caught as my gaze locked onto him, standing tall amidst his warriors.

The moment he appeared, the whispers began—giggles, gasps, and hushed admiration from the girls around the room.

"Oh my goddess," Beatrice murmured beside me, her voice barely above a whisper. "He actually came."

"I’m just as shocked," I admitted, unable to tear my eyes away as Sebastian took his seat in the front row, his piercing gaze scanning the room.

Beatrice nudged me playfully, a mischievous grin tugging at her lips. "If only they knew you were the one who almost ended up in his bed last weekend. The entire school would lose their minds."

I elbowed her sharply, but my cheeks burned at the memory.

The ceremony was about to begin—but with Sebastian here, I already knew this night wouldn’t be ordinary.

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the lavish bedroom as Lillian stirred awake. She blinked against the light, momentarily disoriented by the unfamiliar silk sheets beneath her fingertips. Then it all came rushing back - the mating ceremony, the intoxicating scent of Sebastian Blackwood, the way his strong arms had carried her to this very bed last night.

A delicious shiver ran down her spine as she recalled the possessive gleam in his dark eyes when he'd finally claimed her as his mate. The memory made her toes curl beneath the sheets.

"You're awake." The deep rumble came from the doorway, making her heart skip a beat. Sebastian leaned against the frame, his muscular form barely contained by the crisp white shirt he wore. The top buttons were undone, revealing a tantalizing glimpse of his sculpted chest.

Lillian instinctively pulled the sheets higher, suddenly self-conscious. "Good morning," she murmured, her voice still thick with sleep.

Sebastian's lips curved into that devastating smirk that always made her knees weak. "Sleep well, little wolf?"

She could feel the heat rising in her cheeks. "I... um..."

Before she could form a coherent response, Sebastian crossed the room in three long strides. He perched on the edge of the bed, his large hand reaching out to tuck a stray curl behind her ear. The simple touch sent electric currents dancing across her skin.

"Don't be shy now," he teased, his thumb tracing the mark he'd left on her neck. "After last night, I thought we were past formalities."

Lillian swallowed hard, her pulse fluttering beneath his fingertips. Every nerve in her body was acutely aware of his proximity, of the intoxicating mix of sandalwood and musk that was uniquely Sebastian.

"I'm just... adjusting," she admitted, meeting his gaze. The intensity in his dark eyes made her breath catch.

Sebastian leaned closer, his warm breath ghosting over her lips. "Then let me help you adjust faster," he murmured before capturing her mouth in a searing kiss that left no doubt about his claim.

When they finally broke apart, both breathing heavily, Sebastian rested his forehead against hers. "Breakfast is waiting downstairs," he said, his voice rough with barely restrained desire. "But I'd much rather stay here and feast on you."

Lillian's stomach chose that moment to growl loudly, making them both laugh. Sebastian pressed one last kiss to her forehead before standing. "Come down when you're ready. Oliver has been asking for you all morning."

As he turned to leave, Lillian called after him, "Sebastian?" When he glanced back, she gave him a shy smile. "Thank you... for last night."

The look he gave her then - full of heat and promise - made her toes curl all over again. "Oh darling," he said, his voice dropping to that low, dangerous register that did things to her insides. "Last night was just the beginning."

###Chapter 32 Time to face the wolves.

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the lavish bedroom as Lillian stirred beneath the silk sheets. Her body ached from the previous night’s events—Donovan’s betrayal still fresh in her mind, the sting of rejection lingering like a phantom wound.

She rolled onto her side, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her. A bitter laugh escaped her lips. Of course he’s gone.

The scent of expensive cologne still clung to the sheets—Sebastian Blackwood’s signature fragrance, a mix of sandalwood and something darker, wilder. It reminded her of the way his piercing gaze had locked onto hers last night, the unspoken promise in his voice when he’d said, "You’re mine now."

A shiver ran down her spine.

The door creaked open, and Beatrice peeked in, her dark curls bouncing as she grinned. "Rise and shine, sleeping beauty. You’ve got a pack to impress."

Lillian groaned, pulling the covers over her head. "Five more minutes."

Beatrice yanked the sheets away. "Nope. Sebastian’s waiting downstairs, and trust me, you do not want to keep the Lycan Chairman waiting."

Lillian’s stomach twisted. Right. The pack meeting.

She dragged herself out of bed, her reflection in the mirror revealing dark circles under her eyes. The mark on her neck—Sebastian’s claiming bite—stood out starkly against her pale skin. A permanent reminder of the bond she hadn’t asked for.

Dressing quickly in the designer clothes laid out for her—a fitted black dress that hugged her curves, paired with knee-high boots—she took a deep breath.

Time to face the wolves.

The grand hall of Blackwood Manor was packed with Lycans, their murmurs falling silent as Lillian descended the staircase. Every eye turned to her, some curious, others hostile.

Sebastian stood at the center, his imposing frame commanding attention. His dark suit accentuated his broad shoulders, and when his gaze met hers, something primal flickered in his eyes.

"Lillian," he said, his voice smooth yet edged with authority. "Join me."

She forced her legs to move, ignoring the whispers that followed her.

"She’s the one he claimed?"
"A mere college student?"
"Donovan’s ex? Pathetic."

Sebastian’s hand settled possessively on the small of her back as she reached his side. The contact sent a jolt of electricity through her, and she stiffened.

"Relax," he murmured, his breath warm against her ear. "They’ll learn their place."

Then, louder, to the crowd: "Lillian is under my protection. Any disrespect shown to her will be dealt with… severely."

A tense silence followed.

Just as Lillian began to relax, the doors burst open.

Evelyn stormed in, her perfect blonde hair disheveled, her eyes blazing with fury. "You bitch!" she snarled, pointing at Lillian. "You stole him from me!"

Sebastian’s grip tightened. "Evelyn," he warned.

But Evelyn wasn’t done. She lunged forward, claws unsheathed—

And Lillian reacted on instinct.

Her own claws slashed through the air, meeting Evelyn’s attack mid-motion. The sound of tearing fabric and a sharp gasp filled the room.

Evelyn stumbled back, clutching her bleeding arm.

Lillian’s heart pounded. She hadn’t meant to—

Sebastian’s low chuckle cut through the tension. "Well done, darling."

Then, to the stunned crowd: "Anyone else care to challenge my mate?"

Silence.

Lillian swallowed hard.

Mate.

The word hung in the air, sealing her fate.

And as she stood there, surrounded by predators, one thought echoed in her mind:

What have I gotten myself into?

Nathaniel's cheeks flushed a deep crimson, his gaze dropping to the polished floor. To spare him further discomfort, I closed the distance between us and placed a reassuring hand on his shoulder, drawing his attention back to me.

"That's incredibly sweet of you, Nathaniel. But really, I'll be fine. Thank you anyway," I assured him with a soft smile.

He returned the smile, nodding before straightening his posture.

"I should find my seat," Nathaniel murmured. "I think I'm sitting beside you."
"I'll see you up there," I replied.

With another nod, he brushed past me, heading toward the stage.

Beatrice chuckled, shaking her head as she watched him walk away.
"That boy is absolutely smitten," she teased, mischief dancing in her eyes.

"Beatrice, no, he's not," I countered, rolling my eyes. "Nathaniel is just a friend."
"You might believe that, but he's been head over heels for you since sophomore year," she shot back. "One day, you'll realize I'm right."

I frowned, watching Nathaniel's retreating figure—his tousled chestnut hair, his well-fitted blazer, the faint trace of his expensive cologne lingering in the air. Objectively, he was attractive. But my heart had never once fluttered for him.

"Ladies, the ceremony is about to begin. Please take your seats," one of the professors announced as she passed by.

Beatrice pulled me into a tight embrace.
"Good luck, Lillian. I'll be cheering for you the whole time."

I squeezed her back before hurrying to the stage, slipping into my seat among the other candidates. Cassandra shot me a venomous glare, but I ignored her, my focus drifting instinctively to the front row—where Sebastian sat.

My breath hitched when I realized he was already watching me.

Heat flooded my cheeks, and I quickly averted my gaze before I could combust under the intensity of his stare.

The dean stepped onto the stage, tapping the microphone to quiet the murmuring crowd.

After introducing himself and the purpose of the ceremony, he turned to us, calling each candidate forward by name and major. We stood as our names were announced, basking in the applause from the audience.

When my name echoed through the hall, Beatrice's enthusiastic whooping rose above the polite clapping, making me grin despite myself. Even as I sat back down, I could still feel Sebastian's piercing gaze on me.

The ceremony unfolded beautifully—live performances from the school's band and choir, speeches from past award recipients, and heartfelt congratulations from faculty.

Then, the dean gestured toward Sebastian.
"As a special honor, we're privileged to have Chairman Blackwood with us tonight—the first Lycan to ever attend this ceremony."

Sebastian rose, offering a regal nod to the crowd. The she-wolves in attendance practically swooned, their whispers of admiration filling the air.

And yet, his eyes never strayed far from me.

The moment had finally arrived. The dean cleared his throat, holding the golden envelope that contained the name of this year's top student scholarship winner.

"And the winner of this year's prestigious award goes to..." He paused for dramatic effect, his fingers carefully unfolding the paper. A knowing smile curled on his lips as his gaze swept across the auditorium before landing on me.

"Lillian Dumont!"

The room erupted into applause. My heart hammered against my ribs, disbelief flooding my senses. I—I had actually won? The scholarship was mine? No more sleepless nights worrying about tuition, no more crushing student loans looming over my head.

My eyes darted to Beatrice, who was practically vibrating with excitement, clapping so hard her palms had to be stinging. I grinned, standing shakily to my feet. Then, against my will, my gaze flickered to Sebastian Blackwood.

He was watching me with an unreadable expression, those piercing eyes locked onto mine. My stomach twisted. What was he thinking? Did he—

No, don’t be ridiculous.

Of course he didn’t care. Why would he? I was nothing to him.

Shaking off the thought, I straightened my shoulders and walked toward the stage, my heels clicking against the polished floor. The dean handed me the envelope with a firm handshake.

"Congratulations, Lillian," he said warmly. "You’ve earned this not just through academic excellence, but through perseverance despite your family’s financial struggles. This scholarship will change your life."

A murmur rippled through the crowd. Normally, I would have cringed at such a public revelation of my hardships—but the whispers were already there. At least now, they’d see why I deserved this.

"Thank you," I said, gripping the envelope tightly. "I’d like to say a few words."

The dean nodded, stepping aside as I turned to face the microphone. The cheers began to quiet, anticipation thickening the air.

Just as I opened my mouth to speak—

"STOP!"

A sharp, venomous voice sliced through the silence.

I spun around.

Cassandra Declaire stood from her seat, her eyes burning with malice. The murmurs surged louder, confusion spreading like wildfire.

"Miss Declaire," the dean said sharply, "what is the meaning of this?"

Cassandra smirked, crossing her arms. "Lillian Dumont is a fraud," she declared, her voice dripping with disdain. "She doesn’t deserve that award—or that scholarship!"
###Chapter 33 Lillian's POV

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains, stirring Lillian from her restless sleep. She groaned, rubbing her temples as the remnants of last night's tension lingered in her muscles. The scent of Donovan still clung to her skin, a bitter reminder of the past she couldn’t escape.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. Beatrice’s name flashed across the screen, followed by a string of frantic texts:

"Lil, where are you? You missed combat class!"
"Professor Montclair is pissed. He said if you skip again, he’ll fail you!"

Lillian sighed, tossing the phone aside. She couldn’t bring herself to care. Not when her mind was still tangled in the mess of yesterday—Donovan’s smug smirk, Evelyn’s possessive grip on his arm, and worst of all, the way Sebastian had looked at her when she stormed out of the pack meeting.

A sharp knock at the door startled her.

"Lillian?" The deep timbre of Sebastian’s voice sent an involuntary shiver down her spine. "Open the door."

She hesitated, fingers curling into the sheets. Part of her wanted to ignore him, to bury herself under the covers and pretend none of this was happening. But another part—the stubborn, prideful part—refused to let him see her weak.

With a deep breath, she swung her legs over the edge of the bed and padded to the door.

Sebastian stood in the hallway, his broad frame filling the space. His dark eyes flickered over her disheveled state—messy hair, sleep-creased clothes—before settling on her face. "You weren’t at breakfast."

Lillian crossed her arms. "I wasn’t hungry."

His jaw tightened. "You weren’t in class either."

"So what? It’s not like you care."

A muscle ticked in his cheek. "I do care."

The words hung between them, heavy and unexpected. Lillian’s breath hitched.

Before she could respond, the sound of hurried footsteps echoed down the hall. Marcus appeared, his expression grim. "Alpha, we have a problem."

Sebastian didn’t take his eyes off Lillian. "What is it?"

"Alpha Harrison’s pack is at the border. They’re demanding to speak with you."

Lillian stiffened. Harrison—the Alpha who had tried to take advantage of her when she was drunk. The memory sent a fresh wave of anger through her.

Sebastian’s gaze darkened. "Tell them I’ll be there in five minutes."

Marcus nodded and disappeared.

Sebastian turned back to Lillian. "Stay here. Don’t leave the house."

She bristled. "I’m not a prisoner."

"No," he said, stepping closer. "But you are under my protection. And until I know what Harrison wants, I’m not taking any chances."

His proximity sent heat flooding through her. She could smell his scent—cedar and something darker, wilder. It made her pulse race.

Before she could argue, he leaned in, his voice dropping to a whisper. "And for the record, Lillian… I always care."

Then he was gone, leaving her standing there, heart pounding, as the weight of his words settled over her.

Outside, the distant growl of engines signaled Harrison’s arrival.

And Lillian knew—whatever was coming next, it wouldn’t be good.

The moment I realized Cassandra was no longer my friend came a few days after the middle school spelling bee. She had only missed one letter in the word "Necessary," and that single mistake cost her the competition. It was just a small contest, but she took it personally—as if I had stolen something from her.

She pretended everything was fine, of course. She congratulated me with a tight smile and even hugged me afterward. The school planned a mock award ceremony a few days later, and my adoptive mother, Evelyn, helped me pick out a pretty dress and draft a speech.

What most people didn’t know about me was that I had dyslexia. Reading and writing had always been a struggle—letters jumbled together, words swam on the page, and reading aloud in class was pure torture. I had spent months preparing for that spelling bee, practicing every night, never expecting to actually win.

Thanks to years of therapy, I’d learned to manage my condition better, but it still made everything harder. Only a handful of people knew—Beatrice, my best friend since elementary school, my adoptive parents, and, unfortunately, Donovan. I had confessed it to him after he marked me, wanting no secrets between us.

Cassandra, like the rest of the school, only knew I struggled with reading. She had seen how hard I worked for the competition because we’d practiced together. After my win, she sat beside me while I rehearsed the speech Evelyn and I had written. It took me a while to get through it smoothly, but by the time the ceremony arrived, I was confident.

Then, disaster struck.

As I stood in front of the entire school, about to deliver my speech, I realized the words on the paper weren’t the ones I had memorized. Someone had switched them—scrambling letters, replacing words with nonsense. My throat tightened. I stumbled over the first line, then the next, my voice faltering as I tried to make sense of the mess in front of me.

Laughter erupted around me.

My gaze snapped to Cassandra’s, and there it was—the smirk. The satisfaction in her eyes. She had done this.

Before I could react, one of her new friends stepped forward and dumped a bucket of glue over my head. The sticky mess dripped down my face, my dress ruined. Cassandra stepped in front of me before the headmaster could intervene.

"You stole my prize," she hissed. "You don’t deserve to win. I saw your notebook—you had every word written down, memorized. You cheated!"

Then she flung handfuls of glitter at me, marking me as a fraud in front of everyone.

I hadn’t cheated. I had just studied. She could have done the same. But she didn’t care. The crowd chanted, calling me a cheater, mocking my inability to read.

Headmaster Wellington finally pulled Cassandra and her friends away, but the damage was done. Beatrice rushed to my side, shielding me from the worst of it. She had always been my friend, but that day, she became something more—my truest ally. It was also the day I finally told her about my dyslexia.

Cassandra barely faced consequences. Her famous mother and wealthy father made sure of that.

But I never forgot. And I never forgave.

I had sworn to myself that I would never feel that powerless again. After that humiliating day, my parents enrolled me in therapy sessions to help me cope, and I threw myself into my studies with twice the determination.

It had been years since I last thought about that moment—until now.

Standing center stage, I could feel the weight of every gaze fixed on me. My peers watched in silence, their expressions a mix of curiosity and judgment. What would I do? Would I defend myself? Would I declare that I deserved this scholarship?

But just like back then, my voice failed me.

"Cassandra, these are serious allegations," the dean said, crossing his arms. "This is neither the time nor the place for such theatrics."

"I have proof that Lillian doesn’t deserve this award," Cassandra announced, stepping closer to me with a smirk. "She’s a fraud. A liar."

My breath caught. The words hit like a physical blow, leaving me frozen.

The room buzzed with murmurs. I could feel the expectation pressing down on me—everyone waiting for me to speak, to fight back. But my mind was blank, my body numb.

The dean hesitated, clearly uncomfortable with the disruption. Clearing his throat, he straightened.

"Let’s continue this discussion in my office," he said firmly. "This matter requires privacy."

"Fine by me." Cassandra’s eyes gleamed with triumph as she shot me a venomous look. "I’d be happy to show you exactly what I mean."

The dean nodded and gestured for us to follow. As we moved toward the exit, I kept my head down, the whispers of my classmates swirling around me like a storm. His assistant—wide-eyed and startled—received a quiet instruction before we left the ceremony hall behind.

Each step felt heavier than the last.

I had promised myself I’d never be this vulnerable again.

Yet here I was.

###Chapter 34 she would be ready

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the Blackwood estate as Lillian stirred beneath silk sheets. Her fingers traced the empty space beside her where Sebastian should have been. The lingering scent of sandalwood and musk told her he hadn't left long ago.

Downstairs, the mansion buzzed with unusual activity. Lillian pulled on a cashmere robe, her bare feet silent against the marble staircase. The scent of freshly brewed espresso and buttery croissants led her to the dining room where Oliver sat swinging his legs, chocolate smeared across his cherubic face.

"Morning, sunshine," Lillian kissed the top of his head, stealing a bite of his pain au chocolat.

Oliver giggled, "Papa said you'd sleep till noon!"

"Did he now?" Lillian arched an eyebrow just as the study door burst open. Sebastian emerged with Marcus Grayson, both wearing identical grim expressions that vanished when they noticed her.

"Darling." Sebastian's voice dropped an octave as he crossed the room in three strides. His lips brushed her temple while his hand settled possessively at the small of her back. "We have guests arriving today."

Marcus cleared his throat. "The Voss delegation from the northern territories. Alpha Maximilian insists on discussing the border disputes personally."

Lillian's spine stiffened. She'd heard stories about the ruthless Lycan leader who'd challenged three Alphas to death matches last winter. "When do they arrive?"

Sebastian's thumb traced circles on her hipbone. "Before luncheon. Which reminds me—" He turned to Theodore Whitmore who materialized with a silver tray. "Have Genevieve prepare the emerald gown for Lillian. And notify the kitchen about the—"

A crash interrupted him as Oliver knocked over his orange juice. The boy's eyes widened in horror as the liquid spread across the antique Persian rug.

"Oliver Sebastian Blackwood," Sebastian growled.

Lillian stepped between them, grabbing a napkin. "It's just juice, love." She dabbed at the mess, catching Oliver's trembling lower lip between her teeth. "Though someone might need to practice his table manners before our important guests arrive."

Oliver threw his arms around her neck. "I'll be extra good! Promise!"

Sebastian's phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen and his jaw tightened. "Victoria's early. She's bringing Donovan."

The name hung between them like a guillotine blade. Lillian's fingers froze on the damp napkin. After six months of silence, her ex-fated mate was about to walk through those doors—with Sebastian's daughter no less.

Beatrice chose that moment to barrel into the dining room, her phone aloft. "Lil! You'll never believe who just—" She skidded to a halt, taking in the tense atmosphere. "Oh. You already know."

Lillian exhaled slowly, rising to her feet. The game board had just been upended, and every piece was in motion. Somewhere beyond the estate walls, destiny sharpened its claws.

And she would be ready.

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains of Lillian's bedroom, casting a golden glow over the room. She stretched lazily, her muscles still sore from yesterday's intense combat training. The scent of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, signaling that Giselle, the head maid, was already up and preparing breakfast.

Lillian's phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Beatrice lit up the screen: "Meet me at the café in 20. Big news!"

Curiosity piqued, Lillian dressed quickly, opting for a simple yet stylish outfit—a fitted blouse and high-waisted jeans. She slipped on her favorite ankle boots and grabbed her leather jacket before heading downstairs.

The mansion was unusually quiet, save for the distant clatter of pots and pans in the kitchen. Lucien, the flirtatious head chef, winked at her as she passed by. "Morning, gorgeous. Coffee?"

She smirked. "Not today, Lucien. I’m in a hurry."

Outside, the crisp autumn air nipped at her cheeks as she made her way to the campus café. Beatrice was already there, perched on a stool near the window, her fingers drumming impatiently on the table.

"You’re late," Beatrice teased as Lillian slid into the seat opposite her.

"By two minutes," Lillian countered, rolling her eyes. "So, what’s this big news?"

Beatrice leaned in, her eyes sparkling with excitement. "You’ll never guess who’s back in town."

Lillian raised an eyebrow. "Who?"

"Sebastian Blackwood."

The name sent a jolt through Lillian. Sebastian—Lycan chairman, her fated mate, and the man whose presence always left her heart racing. She hadn’t seen him since he left for his business trip three weeks ago.

"Why didn’t he tell me?" Lillian muttered, more to herself than to Beatrice.

Beatrice shrugged. "Maybe he wanted to surprise you."

Before Lillian could respond, her phone buzzed again. This time, it was a message from Sebastian himself: "Meet me at the pack house. Now."

Her pulse quickened. There was an urgency in his tone that she hadn’t heard before.

Beatrice grinned. "Looks like you’re about to find out."

Lillian stood abruptly, her chair scraping against the floor. "I’ll catch up with you later."

As she hurried toward the pack house, her mind raced with possibilities. What could Sebastian want? Why the sudden summons?

The pack house loomed ahead, its grand architecture a testament to the Blackwood family’s power. The moment she stepped inside, the scent of sandalwood and something distinctly Sebastian enveloped her.

He stood at the far end of the hall, his broad shoulders tense, his piercing gaze locked onto her. "Lillian," he said, his voice low and commanding.

She swallowed hard. "Sebastian. What’s going on?"

His jaw tightened. "We have a problem."

And just like that, the calm of the morning shattered.

"Does she truly deserve the scholarship?"
"Her silence says it all!"
"Why isn't she saying anything to defend herself?"

My head lifted slightly as I passed Beatrice. Her eyes were wide, brimming with concern. But when our gazes locked, she gave me a small, reassuring smile—one that made my shoulders feel just a fraction lighter. At least I wasn’t alone in this.

We walked in tense silence toward the administration building. The dean’s office was on the top floor, forcing us to climb the stairs—each step heavier than the last.

"Take a seat, ladies," the dean said, settling into his leather chair.

I sat beside Cassandra, who immediately pulled out her phone, lips curling into a smirk. My stomach twisted into a tight knot. Whatever she was planning, I knew it wouldn’t be good. My pulse hammered against my ribs, loud enough that I wondered if the others could hear it.

Then—a knock at the door.

"Enter," the dean called, leaning back.

Professor Sinclair stepped inside. My defense training instructor. A man I respected.

For some reason, seeing him made me exhale in quiet relief. A familiar face in this mess was more comforting than I expected.

"Professor Sinclair," the dean greeted, raising a brow. "What brings you here?"

"I came to offer my support," he said, leaving the door slightly ajar as he entered. "I consider myself a mentor to these young women. If you’ll allow it, I’d like to be present for this discussion."

The dean nodded. "Of course." He gestured to an empty seat.

Professor Sinclair moved toward it—but his eyes never met mine.

The dean turned his attention to Cassandra. "You claimed to have proof of her dishonesty?"

Cassandra straightened, swiping through her phone with a triumphant gleam in her eyes.

"See for yourself," she sneered. "Lillian doesn’t need this scholarship. She’s loaded. Look—she got into a luxury car last night. Only the wealthy ride in something like this. The scholarship should go to someone who actually needs it. Is her family even struggling? Or was this all just a scheme to play the victim?"

She shoved her phone forward, displaying a photo of me stepping into Sebastian’s car.

My jaw clenched. I had felt eyes on me last night. But I’d ignored it.

Now, that mistake was coming back to bite me.

The dean studied the photo, brow furrowed. Then his gaze flicked to me, lips pressing into a thin line.

"Miss Lillian," he said slowly. "Where, exactly, do you work?"

The weight of the contract I'd signed for Sebastian Blackwood pressed heavily on my shoulders. I couldn't reveal where I worked—or worse, who I worked for. My throat tightened as I scrambled for an explanation, but nothing came.

Headmaster Wellington's sharp gaze bore into me, suspicion darkening his expression. Just as he opened his mouth to demand answers, Professor Sinclair cleared his throat, drawing all attention to him.

"It's become painfully obvious," he said, crossing his arms, "that we truly don't know who Lillian Montague is."

My stomach dropped. What was he doing?

His lips curled into a smirk as he continued, "If she's willing to lie about something like this, what else is she hiding? Her unnatural proficiency in every subject has always struck me as suspicious. I wouldn't be surprised if she's paying someone to do her work for her." He turned to the headmaster. "Sir, I strongly suggest we investigate this further. A student with such blatant dishonesty has no place in this institution."

The air in the room thickened, suffocating me. My fingers curled into fists at my sides, nails biting into my palms. This wasn't just about my job anymore—it was about my entire future.

And Professor Sinclair had just lit the fuse.
###Chapter 35 Lillian's POV

Cassandra's face drained of color the moment Sebastian spoke. I could see the panic flashing in her eyes as she scrambled to come up with an excuse—anything to justify what she’d done. I knew Cassandra was many things—ambitious, ruthless, even manipulative—but a cheater? She had always been fiercely proud of her academic achievements, working harder than anyone else to stay at the top. Despite our strained relationship since middle school, I had secretly admired her relentless drive.

But now?

Now, I saw her in a completely different light.

She had cheated. Paid someone to take her exams for her.

Why?

That was the question burning in my mind. Cassandra was brilliant—more than capable of acing those tests on her own. And yet, she had still passed with flying colors. So why resort to fraud?

"I... I don’t understand," the dean said, his sharp gaze narrowing at Cassandra. "Is this true?"

"N-no," she stammered, her voice trembling. "It’s not true, I swear!"

Before she could spin another lie, the door opened, and a familiar figure stepped inside. Marcus Grayson—Sebastian’s Beta. I had only met him briefly before, but he carried himself with quiet authority.

"I have the reports you requested," he said, handing Sebastian a single sheet of paper.

Sebastian scanned the document, his expression unreadable. His jaw tightened, lips pressed into a thin line. Then, without a word, he passed the paper to the dean.

"This is proof that Cassandra has been cheating," he stated coolly. "How exactly did she score top marks on this exam when she wasn’t even present in class to take it? Unless she’s mastered the art of being in two places at once." His tone was dry, laced with disdain. "There’s also a record of transactions—payments made to the students who took the tests for her."

The dean’s eyebrows shot up in disbelief.

"It’s not what it looks like!" Cassandra blurted, her voice cracking.

Sebastian ignored her. "You’re welcome to investigate further, but this is what my Beta uncovered in a short amount of time."

The dean’s expression darkened. "We have zero tolerance for academic dishonesty."

Then Sebastian turned his attention to Professor Sinclair. "One of her classes happens to be yours. Are you telling me you never noticed her absence? Yet you still passed her."

The professor paled, his eyes darting between Cassandra and the dean.

That’s when it clicked.

They were in this together.

My stomach twisted. I stared at the floor, unsure of what to say or do. The tension in the room was suffocating. I just wanted to disappear.

"Miss Lillian," the dean said, his voice cutting through the silence, "why don’t you head to the feast? My assistant has already directed everyone there to begin the celebration." His gaze remained locked on Cassandra, flickering between her and the professor.

I wasn’t sure my legs would cooperate, but when I glanced at Sebastian, he gave me a firm nod.

Something inside me loosened. I hadn’t even realized I’d been holding my breath.

Exhaling slowly, I turned and walked out, leaving the storm behind me.

"Thank you," I murmured, barely above a whisper, before turning on my heel and striding out of the office. I didn’t bother glancing back—not at Donovan, not at Evelyn, not even at the silent, watchful gaze of Sebastian Blackwood.

The moment I stepped into the dining hall, the air thickened with tension. A sea of curious eyes locked onto me, whispers slithering through the crowd like snakes. Were they speculating about my punishment? Wondering if my reward had been stripped away?

Then, cutting through the murmurs like a blade, Beatrice’s voice rang out. "Hope you all enjoyed the show," she declared, standing boldly in the center of the room, arms crossed. "Now, how about you find something else to gossip about?"

The crowd hesitated, exchanging glances, but the whispers didn’t stop. If anything, they grew louder, more insistent.

I clenched my fists.

This wasn’t over.

###Chapter 36 Be careful

The morning sun filtered through the heavy drapes of Lillian's bedroom, casting golden patterns across the silk sheets. She stretched languidly, her body still humming from last night's encounter with Sebastian Blackwood. The memory of his hands tracing her curves sent delicious shivers down her spine.

A soft knock interrupted her reverie. "Miss Lillian? Breakfast is ready," Sophia Delacroix's gentle voice called through the door.

"I'll be right down," Lillian replied, her voice still thick with sleep. She glanced at the clock - 8:17 AM. Classes didn't start until ten, but she needed to meet Beatrice before then.

Downstairs, the dining room smelled of freshly brewed coffee and warm croissants. Lucien Dubois, the mansion's head chef, had outdone himself again with an elaborate spread. Sebastian sat at the head of the table, reading the morning paper while Oliver colored beside him.

"Good morning," Lillian murmured, taking her usual seat to Sebastian's right. His gaze flickered up, those piercing silver eyes warming as they met hers.

"Sleep well?" he asked, his deep voice sending another wave of heat through her.

Before she could answer, Oliver piped up, "Papa said you were working late last night. Did you finish your homework?"

Lillian nearly choked on her orange juice. Across the table, Giselle Beaumont discreetly turned away, but not before Lillian caught her knowing smile.

"Something like that," she managed, shooting Sebastian a glare when he smirked into his coffee.

Theodore Whitmore entered with a silver tray. "Sir, Marcus Grayson is here with the security reports you requested."

Sebastian nodded. "Have him wait in my study." He turned to Lillian. "I'll be working from home today. Julian will drive you to campus."

Lillian opened her mouth to protest, then remembered yesterday's incident with Nathaniel Whitlock. Maybe having a guard wasn't such a bad idea. "Fine," she conceded, "but he has to stay outside the lecture hall."

"Deal." Sebastian stood, pressing a kiss to her forehead that made her pulse stutter. "Be careful today."

The ride to campus was uneventful, though Lillian caught Julian Mercer scanning every passerby with military precision. Beatrice waited by the main fountain, bouncing on her toes.

"You're late!" her best friend accused, then lowered her voice. "So? How was your first official night as the Lycan Chairman's mate?"

Lillian's cheeks burned. "We didn't... I mean, it's not like that..."

Beatrice arched a perfectly sculpted brow. "Please. The whole pack could smell you two last night." She linked arms with Lillian as they walked toward their first class. "Anyway, more important news - Cassandra is spreading rumors again. Says you're only with Sebastian for his money."

Lillian rolled her eyes. "Let her talk. She's just jealous because Donovan dropped her for Evelyn."

The words tasted bitter, even now. Donovan Winslow might have been her fated mate once, but after his betrayal, she'd severed that bond completely. Or so she told herself.

Their conversation cut off as Professor Sinclair entered the lecture hall. "Today we'll discuss pack hierarchy dynamics," he announced, setting down his briefcase. "Specifically, the challenges of cross-species mating."

Lillian's pen froze mid-note. Was this intentional? She glanced around, catching several classmates staring at her with open curiosity. Even Professor Sinclair's gaze lingered a beat too long.

Beatrice squeezed her hand under the desk. "Ignore them," she whispered.

But when class ended, a folded note landed on Lillian's notebook. She opened it to find a crude drawing of her and Sebastian with the caption: "Gold-digging whore and her sugar daddy."

Lillian's vision tinted red. Her claws extended before she could stop them, shredding the paper to ribbons. The scent of bergamot and sandalwood suddenly filled her senses - Julian must have sensed her distress through their pack bond.

"Who gave you this?" she demanded, turning to face the smirking group behind her. Cassandra sat at the center, flanked by her usual sycophants.

Cassandra fluttered her lashes. "No idea what you're talking about, mutt. Maybe your kind can't read human writing?"

The insult hung in the air like a challenge. Lillian's wolf surged forward, eager to put this petty omega in her place. But before she could respond, the classroom door burst open.

Victoria Blackwood stood framed in the doorway, her perfect features twisted in fury. "There you are!" she spat, storming toward Lillian. "Did you really think you could steal my fiancé and get away with it?"

The room fell silent. Lillian blinked. "Your... what?"

Victoria's laugh was brittle. "Don't play dumb. Donovan and I were engaged before you seduced him with your little orphan act." She advanced, her manicured nails gleaming like claws. "But now that you've moved on to my father, I suppose I should thank you for taking the trash out."

Lillian's breath caught. Sebastian's daughter... and Donovan's ex-fiancée? The pieces clicked into place with sickening clarity. No wonder Victoria had been cold to her since day one.

Before she could respond, Julian materialized at her side. "Miss Blackwood," he said smoothly, "your father wouldn't appreciate you causing a scene."

Victoria's eyes flashed. "Stay out of this, gamma." She turned back to Lillian. "This isn't over, half-breed. My father might be blinded by your act, but the rest of us see you for what you really are."

With that, she spun on her heel and stalked out, leaving Lillian standing there with the entire class staring.

Beatrice broke the silence first. "Well... that was dramatic."

Lillian barely heard her. Her mind raced with implications. If Victoria had been engaged to Donovan... did Sebastian know? Was that why he'd been so quick to claim her? And more importantly - what else was Victoria capable of?

As she gathered her things, Lillian noticed Cassandra whispering excitedly with her friends. This was going to be all over campus by lunchtime. Just great.

Julian's phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, then at Lillian. "The Chairman wants to see you. Immediately."

Lillian's stomach dropped. Had Victoria already called her father? Or was this about something else entirely?

Either way, she had a feeling her day was about to get much more complicated.

Beatrice only rolled her eyes and sauntered over to me, wrapping her arms around my shoulders in a tight embrace. "Are you okay?" she murmured, her voice low enough that only I could hear.

I nodded, swallowing hard against the lump in my throat. The sting of unshed tears burned behind my eyes, but I refused to let them fall—not here, not in front of everyone. I wouldn’t give them the satisfaction of seeing me break.

"Yeah, just a misunderstanding," I lied smoothly.

"Did Sebastian do anything to help?" she asked, her tone laced with curiosity.

I arched a brow, caught off guard by the question. "Why would he?" I replied, keeping my voice carefully neutral.

She smirked and nudged me playfully as we wove through the crowded dining hall toward an empty table. "Because he bolted after you two like a man possessed," she explained. "Barked orders at Marcus to dig up dirt on Cassandra. Looked downright furious—and I have a feeling it wasn’t just about the ceremony." She wiggled her eyebrows. "Maybe someone wanted to protect his precious Lillian."

Heat flooded my cheeks despite myself. "You’re being ridiculous," I muttered. "We had one almost-moment, and we haven’t spoken about it since."

"Sure, sure," she chuckled, clearly unconvinced.

A waitress glided by, depositing two flutes of champagne on our table. Perfect. Exactly what I needed right now—something to dull the edges of this disaster.

I took a long sip, grimacing at the bitter tang. Champagne wasn’t my drink of choice, but tonight, I’d take anything.

"Let’s just enjoy the rest of the party," Beatrice said, offering a small, reassuring smile. "He didn’t take back your award, did he?"

I shook my head. "No. But I never got to give my speech. That stings."

"That bitch stole your moment," she huffed. "But karma’s a patient hunter. She’ll get hers."

I drained the rest of my glass in one go. "I need another."

"Open bar," she said, nodding toward the glittering counter. "Courtesy of the Blackwood Foundation—who, by the way, basically own this entire school. Rumor has it Sebastian’s the biggest shareholder."

My brows shot up. That was news to me.

I made my way to the bar, the buzz of alcohol already softening the sharp edges of my frustration.

"Congratulations on the award," a smooth voice said beside me.

I turned to find Alpha Harrison seated there, watching me with an unreadable expression. He was the Alpha of a smaller neighboring pack, one of the many who attended these ceremonies when their members were nominees.

His presence sent a prickle of unease down my spine. Something about the way his gaze lingered felt... calculated.

But I forced a polite smile. "Thank you."

The night was far from over, and I had a feeling the real drama was just beginning.

"Do you truly believe I'm worthy?" I murmured, the alcohol already warming my veins as I took another sip. My fingers traced the rim of the glass, the weight of the night pressing down on me.

Alpha Harrison's gaze held mine, a smirk playing at the corner of his lips. "If anyone deserves this honor, it's you, Lillian," he said, his voice smooth as he leaned in slightly. "I was cheering for you the whole time."

A flicker of surprise passed through me. One of the other candidates was from his pack—Evelyn, if I remembered correctly. Yet here he was, favoring me instead. I bit back the question on my tongue, choosing silence over stirring unnecessary tension.

"Let me get you another drink," he offered, his tone laced with something I couldn’t quite place.

I glanced at the open bar, then back at him with a wry smile. "It is an open bar."

His chuckle was low, intimate. "Then allow me to order for you."

I was already on my second glass, the edges of my vision softening, but I wasn’t about to refuse. The sting of humiliation still burned too fresh, and if alcohol could dull it, even for a moment, I’d take it. "Yes, please," I murmured, my voice steadier than I felt.

Alpha Harrison turned to the bartender—Benedict, if I recalled his name correctly—and gestured toward me. "Something stronger for the lady. She’s had a long night." His eyes flicked back to me, assessing. "Tequila shot?"

I knew better. I should have known better. But the numbness was too tempting, the escape too sweet. Before I could second-guess myself, I nodded.

Mistake or not, I was already falling.
###Chapter 37 Long enough to ruin everything.


The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting a golden glow over Lillian’s room. She stretched lazily, the events of the previous night still fresh in her mind. The gala had been a whirlwind of emotions—Donovan’s unexpected appearance, Sebastian’s possessive protectiveness, and the lingering tension between them all.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Beatrice:

"Did you survive last night? Spill everything."

Lillian chuckled, typing back. "Barely. I’ll tell you over coffee."

She dressed quickly, opting for a simple yet elegant outfit—a fitted blouse and tailored trousers. As she descended the grand staircase of Sebastian’s mansion, the scent of freshly brewed coffee and warm pastries wafted from the dining room.

Sebastian was already there, impeccably dressed in a dark suit, reading the morning paper. His sharp gaze flicked up as she entered, and for a moment, the air between them crackled with unspoken tension.

"Good morning," he said, his voice smooth as velvet.

"Morning," she replied, trying to ignore the way her pulse quickened at the sound of his voice.

Marcus, Sebastian’s beta, cleared his throat from the doorway. "Alpha, the council has requested an urgent meeting. It’s about the recent… disturbances."

Sebastian’s expression darkened. "I’ll be there shortly."

Lillian frowned. "What disturbances?"

Sebastian hesitated, then sighed. "There have been reports of rogue werewolves near the borders. Some believe it’s connected to Donovan."

Her stomach twisted. Donovan had always been reckless, but this was different. If he was stirring trouble, it wouldn’t just affect her—it would put the entire pack at risk.

"I should come with you," she said firmly.

Sebastian studied her for a long moment before nodding. "Very well. But stay close."

As they left the mansion, Lillian couldn’t shake the feeling that something far more dangerous was brewing beneath the surface. And this time, she wouldn’t be able to avoid the storm.

The council chamber was tense, filled with the pack’s highest-ranking members. Alpha Harrison, a burly man with a permanent scowl, leaned forward. "Blackwood, we can’t ignore this. If Donovan’s behind these attacks, he’s testing our borders. We need to act."

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "I’m aware. But we don’t have proof yet."

Lillian stepped forward. "I might be able to help. I know Donovan better than anyone here."

The room fell silent. Then, Alpha Harrison scoffed. "And why should we trust you? You were his mate."

Sebastian’s growl reverberated through the chamber. "Careful, Harrison."

Lillian held her ground. "I have no loyalty to him. Not after what he did. But if you want to stop him, you’ll need my insight."

Sebastian’s gaze burned into her, pride flickering in his eyes. "She’s right."

The council murmured in reluctant agreement.

As the meeting adjourned, Marcus pulled Sebastian aside. "There’s something else. A witness claims they saw Donovan meeting with someone from the Darkmoon pack."

Sebastian’s expression turned icy. "Tristan Whitlock."

Lillian’s breath hitched. The Darkmoon pack was notorious for their ruthless tactics. If Donovan was allying with them, the stakes had just gotten higher.

Sebastian turned to her, his voice low. "We need to move fast. Are you ready for this?"

She met his gaze without flinching. "I’ve been ready."

The game had changed. And Lillian wasn’t about to back down.

"I'll take care of you tonight," Alpha Harrison murmured, his voice low and reassuring. "Don't worry about a thing. Just focus on enjoying yourself and forget about that dreadful ceremony." I managed a weak smile, grateful for his concern—though something about his tone made my skin prickle.

After my third tequila shot, the world tilted dangerously. The moment I slid off the barstool, my legs buckled beneath me. Strong arms caught me before I hit the floor. Alpha Harrison held me flush against his chest, his fingers tracing slow circles on my back in a way that felt too intimate. A shiver ran down my spine, but my foggy mind couldn’t muster the energy to protest.

"Lillian, you can stay with me," he whispered, his breath hot against my ear.

My lips felt numb, so I stayed silent.

He half-carried, half-dragged me toward the exit. My feet barely cooperated, leaving him to bear most of my weight. A fleeting thought of Beatrice crossed my mind—Where is she?—but it dissolved as we reached the doorway. Without warning, Alpha Harrison scooped me up bridal-style, cradling me against him.

My head lolled against his chest.

I mumbled something incoherent, and his chest vibrated with a low chuckle.

"Alpha!" A sharp female voice cut through the haze. I kept my eyes shut—the room was spinning too violently—but her tone was unmistakably familiar. "What are you doing? You can't take her anywhere like this. She's completely wasted."

"We're two consenting adults," Harrison replied smoothly. "It's her choice, and she clearly wants to come with me."

Before she could argue, another voice sliced through the air, cold and lethal.

"Walk away now, or I'll break every bone in your body."

Harrison stiffened.

"I tried to stop him, sir," the woman said quickly.

Cracking my eyes open, I recognized her—Sebastian’s assistant. And beside her, him. Sebastian Blackwood stood rigid, his piercing gaze locked onto me. Harrison’s grip tightened possessively.

"It's fine, Alpha. I know her well. I'll ensure she gets home safely."

Sebastian’s voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "I won’t repeat myself. Release her, or I’ll strip you of your title and leave you crawling in the dirt."

A tremor ran through Harrison’s body before he reluctantly stepped forward. The moment Sebastian’s arms wrapped around me, warmth flooded my veins. I clung to him instinctively, burying my face in his chest, breathing in his intoxicating scent—spice and something darker, something his.

"I—I apologize," Harrison stammered, bowing his head.

Sebastian didn’t spare him another word as he carried me away. The crisp night air hit my skin as we exited the building. A sleek car pulled up, and the door swung open. Sebastian slid inside with me still in his arms, settling me against him as the engine purred to life.

Heat bloomed across my cheeks as my fingers wandered over his torso. The crisp lines of his suit, the taut muscles beneath—Gods, he was irresistible. His scent alone was enough to make my head spin all over again.

And right now, all I wanted was to peel that perfect suit off him, piece by piece.

My mouth went dry with anticipation, imagining the taste of him, the feel of his skin beneath my fingertips.

His large hand closed over mine as I reached for his silk tie. The room still spun slightly from the champagne, but a boldness I'd never known surged through my veins.

"Little minx," he growled, his voice rough like gravel. "Do you even know what you're asking for?"

I didn't answer. Instead, I slid my free hand up his chest, loosening the knot with practiced fingers. The scent of his cologne - sandalwood and something distinctly masculine - made my head swim.

"Tell me to stop," I challenged, my lips brushing his ear. "Tell me you don't want this, Sebastian."

His pupils dilated, the gold rings in his hazel eyes nearly disappearing. Just as the tie slipped free, the shrill ringtone of his phone shattered the moment.

The screen flashed with a name that made his entire body tense - Victoria. His daughter.

Ice flooded my veins. Reality came crashing back. What was I doing? This wasn't me. The champagne, the dress, this reckless desire - none of this was the real Lillian.

Sebastian swore under his breath, his grip tightening on my wrist for a heartbeat before releasing me entirely. The distance between us suddenly felt like miles instead of inches.

"Blackwood," he answered tersely, already stepping back, already shutting me out.

I turned away, my cheeks burning with shame and something far more dangerous - the sting of rejection. The fantasy had lasted exactly three minutes and seventeen seconds.

Long enough to ruin everything.
###Chapter 38 He's getting bold

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting golden streaks across Lillian's face as she stirred awake. Her body ached from the previous night's events, but her mind was sharper than ever. The scent of Donovan still lingered in her memory, a bitter reminder of what could have been.

She stretched, her muscles protesting slightly, before slipping out of bed. The floor was cool beneath her bare feet as she padded to the window, pushing the curtains aside to take in the view of the Blackwood estate. The gardens below were already bustling with activity—maids tending to the flowers, guards patrolling the perimeter, and Sebastian's son, Oliver, chasing butterflies with unrestrained glee.

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts. "Come in," she called, turning to see Beatrice stepping inside, a tray of breakfast balanced in her hands.

"You look like you could use this," Beatrice said with a knowing smile, setting the tray on the bedside table.

Lillian sighed, running a hand through her tousled hair. "I feel like I've been run over by a truck."

Beatrice chuckled. "Well, that's what happens when you challenge an Alpha's authority in front of his entire pack."

Lillian grimaced, recalling the confrontation with Sebastian the night before. His icy demeanor had sent shivers down her spine, but she refused to back down. Not when Donovan and Evelyn were still out there, plotting their next move.

She picked up a piece of toast, nibbling absentmindedly. "Any news?"

Beatrice shook her head. "Nothing concrete. But Marcus mentioned Donovan was spotted near the border last night."

Lillian's grip tightened around the toast. "He's getting bold."

"Or desperate," Beatrice countered. "Especially now that Sebastian has made it clear you're under his protection."

Lillian scoffed. "Protection? More like surveillance."

Beatrice arched a brow. "You really think he'd go through all this trouble just to keep tabs on you?"

Before Lillian could respond, another knock sounded—this one firmer, more authoritative. The door swung open to reveal Sebastian himself, his towering frame filling the doorway. His piercing gaze locked onto Lillian, and for a moment, the air between them crackled with unspoken tension.

Beatrice cleared her throat. "I'll just... leave you two to talk." She slipped out, closing the door behind her with a soft click.

Sebastian stepped further into the room, his expression unreadable. "We need to discuss last night."

Lillian crossed her arms. "What's there to discuss? You made your position clear."

His jaw tightened. "You deliberately provoked me in front of my pack."

"And you deliberately ignored the threat Donovan poses," she shot back.

Sebastian's eyes darkened. "I don't ignore threats, Lillian. I assess them."

"Then assess this," she said, stepping closer. "Donovan won't stop until he gets what he wants. And right now, that's me."

A low growl rumbled in Sebastian's chest. "Over my dead body."

The intensity in his voice sent a thrill down Lillian's spine, but she refused to let it show. "Then stop treating me like a prisoner and start treating me like an ally."

Silence stretched between them, thick and heavy. Finally, Sebastian exhaled sharply. "Fine. But you follow my lead. No more reckless stunts."

Lillian smirked. "No promises."

Sebastian's lips twitched, almost as if he wanted to smile. Almost. "Get dressed. We have work to do."

As he turned to leave, Lillian called after him, "Sebastian."

He paused, glancing over his shoulder.

"Thank you," she said softly.

He gave a curt nod before disappearing into the hallway, leaving Lillian alone with her thoughts—and the undeniable realization that their fates were now irrevocably intertwined.

The game had changed. And she was ready to play.

"I'll take care of you tonight," Alpha Harrison murmured, his voice low and smooth. "Don't worry about a thing. Just enjoy yourself and forget about that awful ceremony."

I managed a weak smile, grateful for his reassurance. By my third tequila shot, the room had started spinning. When I slid off the barstool, my legs buckled beneath me. Strong arms caught me before I hit the ground—Alpha Harrison’s. His grip was firm, one hand pressed against my back, the other cradling me close. My face was buried in his chest, his fingers tracing slow circles along my spine.

Something about his touch unsettled me, but my head was too foggy to protest.

"Lillian, you can stay with me," he whispered, his breath hot against my ear. My lips felt numb, so I stayed silent. He half-carried, half-dragged me toward the exit, my feet barely cooperating.

A flicker of worry crossed my mind—Where’s Beatrice?—but it vanished as quickly as it came when Alpha Harrison suddenly lifted me off the ground, cradling me bridal-style. My head lolled against his chest as I mumbled something incoherent. He chuckled, the sound vibrating through me.

"Alpha!"

A sharp female voice cut through the haze. I kept my eyes shut—the world was still spinning—but I recognized that voice.

"What are you doing? She’s too drunk to go anywhere."

"We’re consenting adults," Alpha Harrison replied smoothly. "She wants this."

Before she could argue, another voice cut in—deep, dangerous.

"Walk away now, or I’ll break every bone in your body."

Alpha Harrison stiffened.

"I tried to stop him, Sir," the woman said.

Blinking through the blur, I saw Beatrice’s assistant standing there, her expression tight. Beside her stood Sebastian Blackwood, his gaze locked onto me like a predator.

Alpha Harrison’s grip tightened.

"It’s fine, Alpha. I know her. I’ll take her home."

Sebastian’s voice turned lethal. "I won’t ask again. Or you’ll lose your title—and the ability to walk."

A shudder ran through Alpha Harrison before he reluctantly stepped forward, releasing me.

The moment Sebastian’s arms wrapped around me, warmth flooded my veins. I clung to him instinctively, pressing my face into his chest, breathing in his scent—dark, intoxicating, his.

"I—I apologize," Alpha Harrison stammered, bowing his head.

Sebastian didn’t respond. He simply carried me away, his steps firm and purposeful. The cold night air hit my skin as we stepped outside, sharpening my senses just enough to register a sleek car pulling up.

The door opened. Sebastian slid in first, pulling me onto his lap, his arms locking around me possessively. My fingers trailed up his chest, tracing the lines of his suit, the heat of his body beneath the fabric.

God, he was gorgeous like this—tie slightly loosened, jaw set, eyes burning with something primal.

His scent, his presence—it was too much.

My lips parted, breath hitching as desire coiled low in my stomach.

And then—

His fingers tangled in my hair, tilting my face up.

"Don’t," he warned, voice rough. "You’re drunk."

But I didn’t care.

Because right now, all I wanted was him.

My mouth practically watered at the thought of claiming him, savoring every inch of Sebastian Blackwood. His large hand covered mine as I reached for his silk tie, the expensive fabric sliding between my fingers. The world still spun around us, but a boldness I'd never known surged through my veins.

"What are you doing?" His voice was rough, strained, as if speaking pained him.

I didn't answer. Instead, I used my free hand to loosen the knot at his throat, my gaze locked on the way his pulse jumped beneath his skin. "I want you," I murmured, my voice husky with desire. "And I know you want me too, Daddy."

The words didn't sound like mine, but I didn't care. Not when his eyes darkened to molten gold, not when his breath hitched as I finally undid his tie.

Then—his phone rang.

The sharp trill shattered the moment. Sebastian's jaw clenched, his grip tightening on my wrist. For a heartbeat, neither of us moved.

Then, with a growl, he pulled away.
###Chapter 39 This was a bad idea

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains, stirring Lillian from her restless sleep. She groaned, rubbing her temples as the remnants of last night’s argument with Donovan echoed in her mind. His accusations, his cold dismissal—it still stung like a fresh wound.

Rolling out of bed, she padded to the window and pushed the curtains aside. The campus below was already bustling with students, their laughter a stark contrast to the storm brewing inside her. A sharp knock at the door made her jump.

"Lillian? You awake?" Beatrice’s voice was muffled through the wood.

Lillian sighed, forcing herself to sound composed. "Yeah, come in."

The door swung open, revealing Beatrice with two steaming cups of coffee. "Figured you could use this after last night."

Lillian accepted the cup gratefully, the warmth seeping into her fingers. "Thanks."

Beatrice plopped onto the bed, eyeing her friend. "So… what’s the plan? You can’t avoid Donovan forever."

"I’m not avoiding him," Lillian muttered, though they both knew it was a lie. "I just need space."

Beatrice arched a brow. "Space? Or a distraction?"

Lillian shot her a look. "What’s that supposed to mean?"

A mischievous grin spread across Beatrice’s face. "Sebastian Blackwood is hosting a charity gala tonight. Rumor has it, half the elite Lycan packs will be there."

Lillian’s grip tightened around her cup. "And?"

"And," Beatrice leaned in, "maybe it’s time you reminded Donovan what he’s missing."

Lillian scoffed, but the idea took root. A night away from campus, surrounded by power and prestige—where Donovan’s words couldn’t reach her.

"Fine," she relented. "But only if you come with me."

Beatrice grinned. "Wouldn’t miss it for the world."

The Blackwood estate was a vision of opulence, its grand ballroom glittering under crystal chandeliers. Lillian smoothed the emerald silk of her gown, nerves fluttering as she stepped inside.

Sebastian stood at the center of the room, commanding attention in a tailored black suit. His gaze locked onto hers the moment she entered, a slow, knowing smile curving his lips.

Beatrice nudged her. "Told you he’d notice."

Lillian ignored the heat creeping up her neck. "This was a bad idea."

Before she could retreat, Sebastian was there, his hand extended. "Dance with me."

It wasn’t a request.

The music swelled as he pulled her close, his grip firm yet gentle. "You look stunning," he murmured, his breath warm against her ear.

Lillian’s pulse raced. "This doesn’t mean anything."

Sebastian chuckled, low and rich. "Keep telling yourself that."

Across the room, Donovan watched, his expression darkening. Beside him, Evelyn clung to his arm, her smile brittle.

Lillian met his gaze defiantly, letting Sebastian spin her deeper into the crowd.

Let him see what he’d lost.

The night blurred into a whirl of music and whispered conversations. By the time Lillian excused herself to the terrace, her head was spinning—whether from the champagne or Sebastian’s proximity, she wasn’t sure.

Cool air brushed her flushed skin as she leaned against the railing, staring at the moonlit gardens below.

"You’re avoiding me now too?"

Sebastian’s voice sent a shiver down her spine. She didn’t turn. "Just needed air."

He stepped beside her, close enough that their arms brushed. "Donovan’s watching."

Lillian stiffened. "I don’t care."

Sebastian tilted his head, studying her. "Liar."

Before she could retort, his fingers grazed her chin, turning her face toward his. "Let me make you forget him."

Her breath hitched.

Then his lips were on hers, fierce and claiming, igniting a fire she couldn’t control.

And for the first time in weeks, Lillian stopped thinking altogether.

I internally cursed as I approached Lillian's front door. Her purse dangled from my shoulder, and I fished inside for her keys. The moment I stepped in, the darkness of the house unsettled me. It was too quiet—eerily so—as if no one lived there at all. But I knew her mother should be home by now.

Finding the staircase took no time, and her room was even easier to locate. The faint scent of lavender and vanilla led me straight to it. Her space was a perfect reflection of who she was. Academic certificates lined the walls, while trophies from track meets crowded her bookshelf. Clothes were strewn across the floor, some draped over her desk chair. A sleek desktop setup sat among stacks of textbooks and notebooks.

A framed photo on her nightstand caught my eye—Lillian, radiant and smiling between her parents. Another showed her with Beatrice, whom I recognized from Blackwood Resort.

I didn’t dare change her clothes—that was a line I wouldn’t cross. Instead, I tucked her into bed, smoothing the covers over her before quietly slipping out.

"You're late," Evelyn remarked the second I walked through my own front door.

"I'm right on time," I countered, glancing at the clock.

"If you're not early, you're late," she chided, arching a brow. "Everyone's already in the kitchen. Dinner's almost ready."

"Hi, Grandma," Victoria chirped, stepping past me into the house.

Evelyn's stern expression melted as she pulled my daughter into a warm embrace. "Oh, Victoria, darling! I thought you'd be too busy tonight. I'm so glad you're here."

"I wanted you to officially meet my fiancé," Victoria said, gesturing for Donovan to step forward.

He obliged, offering a respectful nod. "It's an honor to finally meet you, ma'am."

Evelyn chuckled, cupping his cheek affectionately. "Quite the charmer," she murmured to Victoria with a playful wink.

Victoria blushed, looping her arm through Donovan’s and resting her head against his shoulder.

Then Evelyn’s gaze landed on Oliver, and her smile softened. "Matthew, dear, you're looking rather dashing tonight." She motioned for him to join her.

Oliver hesitated, uncertainty flickering across his face. He rarely came to Evelyn’s house, but I’d insisted he join us tonight. I gave him a reassuring nod, and he followed her into the living room.

I gestured for Victoria and Donovan to do the same. She took his hand, pulling him along, and I exhaled before trailing after them.

The moment I stepped into the kitchen, I immediately wished I could turn around and leave.

"Sebastian! You're here!" Penelope exclaimed, rounding the table to greet me.

Marcus Grayson was already there when I arrived, standing near the fireplace with a glass of wine in hand. He’d been a constant presence at my mother’s gatherings since I was a child—practically family. My jaw tightened as I shot him a sharp glare, and he had the decency to offer an apologetic smile, though it did little to ease my irritation. He should have warned me.

Penelope wasted no time. The moment she saw me, she rushed forward, arms outstretched, her sickly-sweet perfume invading my space before she even touched me. I sidestepped her embrace, my body rigid with barely contained frustration.

“What are you doing here, Penelope?” My voice was low, laced with warning.

“I invited her,” my mother chimed in, her smile bright as she gazed at Penelope like she was some long-lost treasure.

“We discussed this,” I ground out, my fingers curling into fists at my sides. The air around me thickened with my barely restrained anger.

Penelope fluttered her lashes, the picture of innocence. “Your mother and I have always been close, Sebastian. My being here is no different than Marcus.” She crossed her arms, tilting her head. “Besides, I assumed you would have come to your senses by now.”

My mother, ever the peacemaker, gestured toward the dining table. “Let’s all sit down, shall we?”

I didn’t move. My eyes flicked to the table, noting the deliberate placement—the only empty seat was right beside Penelope. A test. A trap.

Marcus stepped closer, his voice dropping to a murmur meant only for my ears. “Isabella’s been gone for years, Alpha. Maybe your mother has a point. It’s time to move forward.”

The words struck like a blade, but I didn’t flinch. Moving forward didn’t mean surrendering to my mother’s schemes—or Penelope’s manipulations.

I exhaled slowly, forcing my temper under control.

This wasn’t over.
###Chapter 40 Lillian's POV

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains, stirring Lillian awake. She stretched lazily, her muscles still sore from yesterday’s training session with Professor Montclair. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted into the room, courtesy of Giselle, the ever-efficient head maid.

Lillian’s phone buzzed—a message from Beatrice.

"Meet me at the café in 20. Big news."

Curious, Lillian dressed quickly, opting for a simple sweater and jeans. As she descended the grand staircase of Sebastian Blackwood’s mansion, she nearly collided with Oliver, his small frame darting past her with a mischievous grin.

"Slow down, trouble," she teased, ruffling his hair.

"Can’t! Dad’s taking me riding today!" he called over his shoulder before disappearing down the hall.

Lillian smiled. Despite the chaos of her life, moments like these made everything feel… normal.

The campus café was bustling when she arrived. Beatrice waved from a corner table, her expression unreadable.

"What’s the big news?" Lillian asked, sliding into the seat opposite her.

Beatrice leaned in, lowering her voice. "You’ll never guess who I saw last night."

Lillian arched a brow. "Who?"

"Donovan."

The name sent a jolt through her. Her ex-fated mate. The man who had chosen Evelyn over her.

"Where?" she demanded, her grip tightening around her coffee cup.

"At The Crimson Moon," Beatrice said. "With Evelyn. And get this—they were arguing. Like, really arguing."

Lillian’s pulse quickened. "About what?"

Beatrice shrugged. "Couldn’t hear much, but Evelyn looked furious. Kept saying something about ‘ruining everything.’"

Before Lillian could process this, her phone buzzed again—Sebastian.

"Emergency meeting at the pack house. Now."

Her stomach twisted. Emergency meetings never meant good news.

Beatrice squeezed her hand. "You okay?"

Lillian exhaled sharply. "I have to go."

As she hurried toward the pack house, her mind raced. What was Donovan up to now? And why did Sebastian need her so urgently?

The moment she stepped into the meeting room, the tension was palpable. Sebastian stood at the head of the table, his expression grim. Marcus Grayson, his beta, stood beside him, arms crossed.

Sebastian’s gaze locked onto hers. "Lillian. We have a problem."

She swallowed hard. "What kind of problem?"

"Donovan," he said, his voice low and dangerous. "He’s made a move against us."

The room seemed to tilt.

"What did he do?" she whispered.

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "He’s allied himself with Alpha Maximilian Voss."

Lillian’s blood ran cold. Maximilian Voss was Sebastian’s most dangerous rival—a ruthless Lycan chairman with a reputation for brutality.

And now, Donovan was working with him.

Sebastian’s next words sent a chill down her spine.

"This isn’t just a power play, Lillian. This is war."

What in the goddess's name happened last night?

I blinked against the morning light, my head pounding like a drum. How did I end up back in my own bed? My room looked untouched, but the air carried a faint, intoxicating scent that made my pulse spike.

Sebastian's scent.

I groaned, pressing my palms against my temples. The memories were hazy, but the aftermath was clear—I was a wreck. My hair was a tangled mess, my makeup smudged down my cheeks, and dark circles shadowed my eyes. I looked like I'd been dragged through a storm.

Splashing cold water on my face did little to help. Then, like a rogue wave, the memories crashed over me.

The ceremony. The drinks. Too many drinks.

One of the Alphas—Alpha Harrison—had gotten handsy, trying to pull me away. Then Sebastian appeared, all sharp angles and simmering dominance, and whisked me out of there.

He took me to his car.

And then—

Oh, no.

My stomach twisted as the realization hit.

I threw myself at him.

Did he bring me home? My face burned crimson, shame coiling tight in my chest. I couldn’t even look at my reflection anymore.

My purse sat at the foot of the bed, and now I understood why my room smelled different—like leather and winter pine. Sebastian had been here.

My heart stuttered at the thought.

Then I noticed the disaster around me—clothes strewn across the floor, half-empty cups on the nightstand. I hadn’t cleaned in days, and now I regretted every second of my laziness.

I fumbled for my phone, the screen flickering weakly. It was nearly dead. The moment it connected to the charger, notifications flooded in—all from Beatrice.

Beatrice: Where the hell are you? You vanished after saying you were getting a drink.
Beatrice: Answer me, Lillian. I swear to the Moon Goddess, if you don’t respond—
Beatrice: Someone just told me Sebastian took you home. Are you alive? How much did you drink?
Beatrice: CALL ME.

I winced. I’d abandoned her. She’d only come to that stupid ceremony to support me, and I’d left her there because I couldn’t handle my own liquor.

Guilt churned in my gut.

Without hesitation, I hit her contact and pressed call.

The line connected instantly.

"By the gods, Lillian!" Beatrice’s voice was sharp with relief and fury. "Where have you been? Do you have any idea how worried I was?"

I swallowed hard.

This was going to be a long conversation.

Beatrice wasted no time in confronting me the moment I stepped into the dorm.

"I'm so sorry, Bea," I whispered, squeezing my eyes shut as the memories assaulted me. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t push them away. "I don’t know what came over me..."

"The rumors are spreading like wildfire," she said, her voice hushed but urgent. "I heard you got wasted and hooked up with an Alpha. Was it Sebastian?"

My heart nearly stopped. Had I really kissed an Alpha last night? Fragments of the evening flashed through my mind—Alpha Harrison getting too close, Sebastian stepping between us. I remembered throwing myself at him, but the rest was a blur.

"I don’t think that happened," I muttered, biting my lip. "At least, I hope it didn’t."

"Then what did happen?" she pressed. "Did you actually leave with Alpha Sebastian?"

I exhaled shakily. "Yes." My voice was barely audible. "And I think I made a huge mistake, Bea. I don’t know how to fix this."

"Tell me everything," she urged, gripping my arm. "If you didn’t kiss him, then you definitely didn’t sleep with him. It can’t be that bad, right?"

"I’m not sure," I admitted, my stomach twisting. "I think... I threw myself at him."

The silence stretched between us as she processed my words.

"And then?" she finally asked.

"And then... nothing. He rejected me." My cheeks burned with humiliation. "I think he got a call or something. I passed out in the car, and the next thing I knew, I was waking up in my room."

Beatrice studied me, her expression unreadable. "So, you don’t remember anything else?"

I shook my head. "Nothing."

She let out a slow breath. "Well, that’s... something."

But the way she said it made my stomach drop. Because if I didn’t remember, that meant only one person knew what really happened last night.

And he wasn’t talking.

###Chapter 41 Where is he?

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting golden streaks across the bedroom. Lillian stretched lazily, her muscles still sore from yesterday’s training session. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted in from the hallway, making her stomach growl.

She had barely stepped out of bed when a sharp knock echoed at her door.

"Lillian? Are you awake?" Beatrice’s voice was muffled but urgent.

Lillian frowned, wrapping a robe around herself before opening the door. Beatrice stood there, her usually cheerful face tight with worry.

"What’s wrong?" Lillian asked, instantly alert.

Beatrice bit her lip. "It’s Donovan. He’s here—at the pack house."

A cold wave washed over Lillian. "What?"

Beatrice nodded. "Sebastian’s dealing with him now, but… he’s demanding to see you."

Lillian’s pulse spiked. After everything—the rejection, the betrayal—Donovan had the audacity to show up here?

She clenched her fists. "Where is he?"

"Main hall," Beatrice said. "But Lillian, be careful. He’s not alone."

Lillian didn’t wait for further explanation. She stormed down the grand staircase, her bare feet slapping against the marble. The moment she reached the bottom, the tension in the air was palpable.

Sebastian stood tall, his broad shoulders rigid, his expression unreadable. Across from him, Donovan lounged in a chair, his smirk infuriatingly familiar. Beside him, Evelyn clung to his arm, her eyes flickering with something between smugness and unease.

And then—there was someone else.

A woman, elegant and poised, stood slightly apart from them. Her dark hair was swept into an intricate updo, her crimson lips curved in a knowing smile.

Lillian froze.

"Ah, there she is," Donovan drawled, his gaze locking onto her. "Miss me, sweetheart?"

Sebastian’s growl reverberated through the room. "You have ten seconds to state your business before I throw you out."

Donovan chuckled, unfazed. "No need for hostility. I just came to deliver a message." He gestured to the unfamiliar woman. "This is Isabella Fontaine. She’s here on behalf of the Council."

Lillian’s breath hitched. The Council?

Isabella stepped forward, her heels clicking softly. "Lillian," she said smoothly. "We’ve heard quite a bit about you."

Lillian swallowed hard. "What do you want?"

Isabella’s smile widened. "Oh, nothing too dramatic. Just your presence at the next full moon gathering." She tilted her head. "Consider it… an invitation."

Sebastian’s eyes darkened. "She’s not going anywhere with you."

Isabella sighed, as if dealing with a stubborn child. "I’m afraid it’s not a request, Alpha Blackwood. It’s a summons."

Silence stretched between them, thick and suffocating.

Then Donovan smirked. "Looks like you don’t have a choice, Lillian."

Lillian’s nails dug into her palms.

This wasn’t just a visit.

This was a trap.

"He put you to bed?" Beatrice asked, amusement lacing her voice.

"In the most platonic way possible," I admitted, cheeks burning. "I was still fully dressed, if that helps."

"Ouch," she murmured sympathetically.

"What am I supposed to do, Bea? I made a complete spectacle of myself in front of a Lycan." My fingers twisted in my lap.

"You were drunk, Lillian. Cut yourself some slack. I’m sure Sebastian Blackwood understands," she said, though her tone lacked conviction. "Besides, it’s not like you’re trying to win him over."

I bit the inside of my cheek, suppressing a groan. If only she knew—Sebastian wasn’t just any Lycan. He was my boss, and keeping him happy meant keeping my job.

"I guess," I muttered, the uncertainty in my voice making her sigh.

"No classes today—do you have tutoring?" she asked, steering the conversation.

"Thankfully, no. It’s my day off."

"Perfect! We’re having a girls' day," she declared. "Let’s hit the city. Shopping, dinner—the works."

I rolled my eyes. "I’m broke, remember?"

"Window shopping, then. And my treat for dinner," she bargained. "I need to grab a few things anyway, and I miss you. School doesn’t count as quality time."

"You saw me yesterday," I laughed.

"Not the same," she huffed. "Come on. Say yes."

"Fine," I relented. "Give me an hour to get ready."

"Deal. I’ll pick you up!"

True to her word, Beatrice pulled into the driveway just as I finished slipping into a casual sundress. I snatched my purse and dashed outside, sliding into the passenger seat of her car.

She grinned at me, already shifting gears. "How’s your mom holding up?"

"The same," I admitted as we merged onto the highway. "Ever since my father was taken, she’s just... existing. I think it’s more than grief—it’s like she’s drowning in it."

Beatrice frowned. "He was her true mate, right?"

I nodded, lips pressed tight. "Yeah. I don’t blame her for falling apart. I just wish I knew how to pull her back."

Silence settled between us, heavy but brief.

"Let’s not dwell," Beatrice said finally, forcing cheer into her voice. "Today’s about fun."

By the time we reached the city’s bustling center, she’d already mapped out her favorite boutiques. The weight in my chest lightened—just a little.

"So, what exactly are we shopping for?" I asked as we stepped out of the sleek black car and merged into the bustling city crowd. The air was thick with the scent of expensive perfumes and freshly brewed coffee from nearby cafés.

"My sister's birthday is next month, and she's hosting this extravagant gala in her penthouse," Beatrice explained, adjusting the strap of her designer bag. "I need something showstopping to wear. And, of course, the perfect gift—something that’ll make her eyes light up."

Isabella Fontaine, or "Bella" as the fashion world knew her, was the epitome of luxury. A supermodel with a global following, she owned multiple properties, including a penthouse that overlooked the city’s skyline. Beatrice and Bella had a decent relationship, but I’d always sensed a quiet envy simmering beneath Beatrice’s admiration—Bella had everything handed to her effortlessly.

"You should pick out an outfit too," Beatrice declared, looping her arm through mine as she steered us toward an upscale boutique. "Because you’re coming with me."

I frowned. "I told you, I don’t have money to blow on designer clothes right now."

"This is important to me, Lillian," she said, her voice dropping into a pleading tone.

"And my father’s release from prison is important to me," I countered firmly. "I have to prioritize, and a trendy dress isn’t at the top of my list."

She opened her mouth to argue but snapped it shut when her gaze landed on the woman stepping out of the boutique.

"Lillian, is that really you?" Victoria Blackwood called out, her lips curling into a polished smile as she approached us.

Oh, hell.
###Chapter 42 The Moonlight Confession

The night air was crisp as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse suite. The city lights glittered below like scattered diamonds, but her gaze was fixed on the full moon hanging low in the sky. Its silver glow bathed her skin, sending a familiar shiver down her spine—her wolf stirred, restless beneath the surface.

She hadn’t expected to end up here, in the private wing of the Lycan Chairman’s estate. Not after everything that had happened with Donovan and Evelyn. Yet here she was, wrapped in a silk robe that smelled faintly of cedar and alpha musk—Sebastian’s scent.

The sliding door behind her whispered open. She didn’t need to turn to know who it was. His presence was like a living flame, warming the space between them before he even spoke.

“Couldn’t sleep?” Sebastian’s voice was rough with exhaustion, yet still laced with that commanding edge that made her pulse quicken.

Lillian exhaled, her breath fogging in the cool air. “Too much on my mind.”

He moved beside her, his broad frame casting a shadow over the railing. Dressed in nothing but low-slung sweatpants, his bare torso gleamed under the moonlight, scars from old battles mapping his skin like a warrior’s history.

“Oliver asked about you at dinner,” he murmured.

Her chest tightened. The boy had wormed his way into her heart faster than she’d thought possible. “What did he say?”

Sebastian’s lips quirked. “That you’re the only one who lets him put extra syrup on his pancakes.”

A laugh escaped her, soft and unexpected. “Guilty.”

Silence settled between them, comfortable yet charged. Then, without warning, Sebastian turned to face her fully. His golden eyes burned with an intensity that stole her breath.

“Lillian.” Just her name, but it sounded like a vow.

She swallowed. “Yes?”

“I don’t do this,” he admitted gruffly. “Bring women here. Let them near my son. But with you…” His jaw clenched. “I can’t seem to help myself.”

Her heart hammered. This was dangerous. He was dangerous. Not just because he was a Lycan Alpha, but because every word felt like a thread weaving them tighter together.

Before she could respond, his hand lifted, fingers brushing a stray curl behind her ear. The touch was featherlight, yet it sent sparks skittering across her skin.

“Tell me to stop,” he challenged, voice dropping to a growl.

She should. For a hundred logical reasons, she should.

Instead, Lillian rose onto her toes—and closed the distance between them.

The kiss was electric, a collision of heat and hunger that shattered every rational thought. Sebastian’s arms banded around her waist, pulling her flush against him as if he couldn’t bear even an inch of space.

Somewhere in the back of her mind, a warning bell rang. This changed everything.

But as his lips moved against hers, possessive and demanding, Lillian realized one terrifying truth—

She didn’t want to stop.

"Victoria," I greeted, forcing my voice to remain steady despite the storm raging inside me. "I didn't expect to run into you here."

She smiled brightly, lifting a designer shopping bag. "Just picking up some things for the wedding." Her gaze flickered to Beatrice. "And who's this?"

My throat tightened. The last thing I needed was Victoria taking an interest in Beatrice—as if losing Donovan to her wasn't enough. Logically, I knew it wasn’t fair to blame her. She was just as much a victim as I was, if not more. But logic didn’t stop the bitterness from rising every time I saw her face.

The memory of Donovan’s hands on her—hands that once traced my skin with reverence—made my stomach churn. We were supposed to be eternal. Fated mates, bound by the stars themselves. The Goddess had chosen us.

Yet here we were.

Had She made a mistake? Or had Donovan?

The ache in my chest flared, a wound that refused to heal no matter how many times I swore I was over him.

But could anyone truly move on from their mate?

"This is my best friend, Beatrice," I said, nudging her forward. Beatrice shot me a questioning look—she already knew exactly who Victoria was.

Victoria extended her hand, ever the picture of grace. Beatrice hesitated, her glossy lips pursed in distaste. I elbowed her subtly, snapping her out of it. Victoria couldn’t suspect anything.

With visible reluctance, Beatrice took her hand.

"Nice to meet you," she said, her smile strained.

"Hello, Beatrice!" Victoria chirped, oblivious to the tension. "I'm Victoria Blackwood—Sebastian Blackwood’s daughter and Donovan Cash’s fiancée. It’s such a pleasure!"

I could see Beatrice’s jaw clench, but she dipped her head in a polite nod. "The honor is mine, Miss Blackwood," she replied, her words laced with barely concealed venom.

Victoria tilted her head. "What brings you two out today?"

I glanced at Beatrice, who gave a tiny shrug before I answered. "Just shopping."

"Girl’s day out," Beatrice added.

Something flickered in Victoria’s eyes—something I couldn’t decipher.

"Oh," she murmured, a wistful note in her voice. "I’ve never had a girl’s day before. Never really had friends to do that with."

My brows shot up. That was hard to believe. She was Victoria Blackwood.

"You’ve never had friends?" Beatrice echoed, voicing my exact thoughts.

Victoria shrugged, her expression tinged with melancholy. "Not real ones," she admitted. "I think people are just... intimidated. It’s fine, really."

The vulnerability in her voice caught me off guard. For the first time, I saw past the polished exterior—to someone just as lonely as I was.

And that realization unsettled me more than I cared to admit.

Victoria bit her lower lip, her gaze fixed on the pavement as if it held the answers to her unspoken request. I glanced at Beatrice, sensing the tension in the air—Victoria clearly wanted an invitation to join our shopping trip, and I could tell Beatrice was thinking the same thing when our eyes met and she gave an almost imperceptible shake of her head.

Without hesitation, I looped my arm through Beatrice’s and turned back to Victoria with a practiced smile.

"Well, it was lovely running into you, Victoria," I said smoothly, already tugging Beatrice along with me. "But we really should get going now."

Victoria’s face fell. "Oh," she murmured, disappointment lacing her voice. "Alright, I suppose I’ll see you around."

I offered a polite nod and a wave over my shoulder, ignoring the weight of her stare burning into my back as we hurried down the bustling street.

Once we were safely inside the boutique, Beatrice let out a quiet laugh. "She’s certainly… something," she remarked, shaking her head.

"To put it lightly," I agreed, rolling my eyes playfully.

The rest of the evening was spent in much better company—shopping for Beatrice and picking out a birthday gift for Isabella. Beatrice settled on an exquisite ruby bracelet with a delicate heart charm, personalized with Isabella’s name engraved in elegant script. Afterward, we treated ourselves to dinner at a cozy little bistro, laughing over shared desserts and swapping stories.

As Beatrice dropped me off at home later that night, she turned to me with a soft smile. "Thanks for coming out with me today," she said, squeezing my hand.

I returned her smile warmly. "You never have to thank me for that. I always love spending time with you."

We hugged goodbye, and I stepped out of her car, the silence of the house swallowing me whole as soon as the door shut behind me.

It had been eerily quiet since my father was taken. My mother had barely left her room in days. I’d checked on her this morning, but she’d barely acknowledged me, lost in her own grief. If she didn’t come out tomorrow, I’d have no choice but to call her doctor. She couldn’t keep living like this—wasting away, drowning in sorrow.

Watching her fade before my eyes was breaking my heart.

###Chapter 43 This was a warning.

The morning sun filtered through the heavy drapes of Lillian's bedroom at the Blackwood estate. She stretched beneath the silk sheets, her werewolf senses immediately picking up the scent of freshly brewed coffee and warm croissants. The digital clock on her nightstand blinked 7:32 AM - she had slept through her alarm again.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. "Miss Lillian?" came Sophia's gentle voice through the door. "Mr. Blackwood has requested your presence in the dining room. He says it's urgent."

Lillian's heart skipped a beat. Sebastian never summoned her this early unless something was wrong. Throwing on a robe, she hurried downstairs, her bare feet silent against the marble floors.

The dining room was bathed in golden morning light, but the atmosphere was anything but warm. Sebastian stood by the window, his broad shoulders tense beneath his tailored suit. Oliver sat at the table, unusually quiet while pushing scrambled eggs around his plate.

"What's happened?" Lillian asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Sebastian turned, his stormy gray eyes meeting hers. "We've received word from the Winslow pack," he said, his deep voice laced with restrained anger. "Donovan and Evelyn are coming to the city."

The blood drained from Lillian's face. Her traitorous ex-fated mate and his new partner - here? After everything? Her fingers curled into fists at her sides.

Oliver looked up, his young face scrunched in concern. "Are they coming to hurt us?"

Sebastian placed a reassuring hand on his son's shoulder. "No one will hurt you, Oliver. Not while I'm here." His gaze flicked back to Lillian. "They're attending the annual Lycan Summit as representatives of the Winslow pack."

Lillian's stomach twisted. The Summit - the most important gathering of werewolf leaders in the country. Of course Donovan would use this opportunity to flaunt his new position.

Beatrice burst into the room then, her phone clutched in her hand. "You won't believe what I just heard from Isabella!" she exclaimed, then froze when she saw their expressions. "Oh. You already know."

Lillian sank into a chair, her mind racing. After months of peace, her past was catching up with her in the worst possible way. And with the Summit being hosted at the Blackwood estate this year, there would be no avoiding Donovan.

Sebastian moved to stand behind her, his presence a steady anchor. "Whatever happens," he murmured, just for her ears, "remember you're not that scared college student anymore. You're the future Luna of the Blackwood pack."

Lillian reached up to grasp his hand, drawing strength from his touch. She would face Donovan again - but this time, she wouldn't be alone. And this time, she would be the one holding all the power.

The idea struck Beatrice over dinner—perhaps visiting my father in prison could provide some insight into handling his mate. I wasn't sure I was ready for that confrontation, but after classes the next day, I steeled myself and headed to the penitentiary.

"Apologies, Miss. You're not permitted entry," the guard at the gate declared, arms crossed firmly over his chest.

I blinked up at him, confusion knitting my brows.

"Excuse me?" My voice wavered. "This is a public facility. I'm in the visitation area—I have every right to be here. I need to see my father."

The guard's frown deepened as he scanned his clipboard, then shook his head.

"Direct orders to bar Lillian Dumont from entering," he said flatly. "Nothing I can do. You'll have to leave."

I opened my mouth to protest, but a sharp, familiar voice cut in behind me.

"And who, precisely, issued those orders?" Victoria Blackwood demanded, stepping forward with her arms folded. "Unless my father personally authorized this, I suggest you reconsider. Why is my friend being denied access to her own father?"

The guard stiffened, his posture instantly deferential. "M-Miss Blackwood! I didn’t realize you were—"

"I was passing by when I saw Lillian enter," Victoria interrupted coolly. "Now, answer the question."

My pulse raced. I hadn’t expected Victoria to intervene—or even be here. But the way the guard paled told me everything. Donovan. He must have paid them off.

The guard swallowed hard, glancing between us. "I... didn’t know you two were acquainted." He forced a nervous laugh. "Of course, she can see him. My mistake." He stepped aside.

I met Victoria’s gaze, gratitude swelling in my chest, but words failed me. Instead, I gave a small nod before slipping past the guard.

Inside, another officer led me to the visitation room. I sat at a cold metal table, fingers twisting anxiously until the door creaked open.

My father shuffled in, flanked by guards.

"No physical contact," one warned.

I nodded, biting my lip—until I saw him fully.

My breath hitched.

Bruises mottled his face, one eye swollen shut. Dried blood crusted his split lip. He looked... broken.

"Lillian..." His voice was a ragged whisper, as if speaking pained him. "You came..."

Tears blurred my vision. "Dad..." I choked out. "What did they do to you?"

His bloodshot eyes held mine, and for the first time, I saw true fear in them.

This wasn’t just punishment.

This was a warning.

A sorrowful, pained smile tugged at his lips as he sank into the seat across from me. I sat down as well, unable to tear my gaze away from him. This wasn’t the strong, commanding man I had known as my adoptive father—he looked fragile, shattered, a mere shadow of the man he once was. The sight of him like this tore at something deep inside me.

"I never thought I’d see you again," he murmured, his voice barely above a whisper.

Guilt twisted in my chest. "I’m sorry it took so long..."

He shook his head, a wave of sadness darkening his eyes. "This isn’t the kind of place you should be in, Lillian. I don’t blame you for staying away."

Tears spilled over before I could stop them, streaking down my cheeks and dripping from my chin. Seeing him like this—broken, defeated—was unbearable. I wrapped my arms around myself, as if that could hold me together.

"How’s your mother?" he asked, pulling my attention back to him.

"Not good, Dad," I admitted softly. "That’s… that’s why I’m here. She’s not happy. I think she’s slipped into depression, and I—I don’t know what to do. I was hoping… maybe you could help?"

The words hung between us, heavy with unspoken pain. His expression shifted, something raw flickering in his gaze before he exhaled slowly.

"I wish I could, sweetheart," he said, his voice rough. "But I’m not the man I used to be. Not anymore."

The admission struck like a blow. I swallowed hard, my fingers tightening around my arms. "Then who is?"

His lips pressed into a thin line. "Someone who can’t fix this."

A cold weight settled in my stomach. If he couldn’t help… then what hope did we have?

But then his gaze sharpened, just slightly. "But maybe there’s someone else who can."

My breath caught. "Who?"

He leaned forward, lowering his voice. "Sebastian Blackwood."

The name sent a jolt through me. The Lycan chairman. The man whose world I had been dragged into against my will.

"Why him?" I whispered.

"Because," my father said, his voice firm despite its weariness, "he’s the only one with the power—and the reason—to help you now."

The implication hung in the air, unspoken but undeniable.

And with it came a terrifying question:

What would I have to give up in return?
###Chapter 44 Lillian's POV

The morning sun cast golden rays through the sheer curtains of Lillian's bedroom, stirring her awake. She stretched languidly, her muscles still sore from yesterday's training session with Professor Montclair. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted up from the kitchen, making her stomach growl.

Downstairs, the mansion was already bustling with activity. Giselle, the head maid, directed the staff with quiet efficiency while Lucien, the flirtatious head chef, hummed a French tune as he prepared breakfast. Lillian smiled at the familiar chaos—it was comforting, in a way.

She found Donovan in the dining room, his dark eyes scanning the morning papers. He barely glanced up when she entered, his expression unreadable. The tension between them was palpable, a silent reminder of their broken bond.

"Morning," she murmured, sliding into her seat.

Donovan grunted in response, flipping a page with unnecessary force.

Sebastian strode in then, his presence commanding the room's attention. His gaze flickered between them before settling on Lillian. "Sleep well?"

She nodded, forcing a smile. "Yeah. You?"

Before he could answer, Oliver burst into the room, his face alight with excitement. "Papa! Look what I found!" He held up a small, polished stone, its surface shimmering under the light.

Sebastian chuckled, ruffling his son's hair. "A moonstone. Where did you find this?"

"Near the garden! Beatrice said it's lucky!"

Lillian's heart warmed at the mention of her best friend. Beatrice had always had a way with children, and Oliver adored her.

The moment was shattered when Victoria entered, her cold gaze sweeping over them. "Father," she said stiffly, ignoring Lillian entirely. "We need to discuss the upcoming council meeting."

Sebastian sighed, setting down his coffee. "Later, Victoria. Let's enjoy breakfast first."

But Victoria wasn't one to be deterred. "It's urgent. The Darkmoon pack is making moves again."

Lillian stiffened. The Darkmoon pack—Alpha Maximilian's pack—had been a thorn in their side for months.

Sebastian's expression darkened. "Fine. My study. Five minutes."

As he left, the air in the room grew heavier. Donovan finally looked up, his lips curling into a smirk. "Trouble in paradise?"

Lillian ignored him, focusing on her food. But inside, her mind raced. If the Darkmoon pack was stirring, it could only mean one thing—war was coming.

And she wasn't sure she was ready.

The sorrow in my father's gaze was unmistakable as he listened to my desperate words about my mother. It shattered me to see him like this—trapped, unable to wrap his arms around her, to soothe her pain the way he always had. He used to tell me stories of their first meeting, how the moment he laid eyes on her, he knew. His wolf hadn’t even needed to confirm it—she was his fated mate, his other half. Their love was a constant presence in my life, a warmth I carried with me even now.

He lifted his arms, revealing the silver cuffs clamped around his wrists. My stomach twisted at the sight of the angry burns marring his skin. Silver was poison to our kind, a cruel barrier severing the bond between werewolves and their wolves.

"I can't reach her," my father murmured, his voice thick with grief. "The silver blocks me from feeling her. Mates aren’t meant to be separated like this. Her wolf must be in agony, and it’s dragging her down with it." His jaw clenched. "If I could do anything—" He cut himself off, shaking his head. "Just be there for her, Lillian. Remind her she’s loved."

I nodded, blinking back tears.

I couldn’t tell him the truth—that every time I tried to speak to my mother, all she wanted to discuss was Donovan and how I’d disrespected him. I couldn’t confess that my own fated mate was engaged to another woman, that the only way he’d help our family was if I became his mistress and abandoned my education.

The thought alone made me sick.

My father was suffering enough. He didn’t need my burdens piled on top of his.

"I love you, Dad," I whispered instead, forcing a fragile smile. "I miss you every day."

His expression softened. "I love you too, Lillian."

His fingers twitched toward mine where they rested on the table, but the guard cleared his throat sharply.

"No touching."

My father exhaled, leaning back in his chair. "How are you holding up? How’s school?"

I chewed my lip. I ached to tell him about my new job, to confide in someone. But Sebastian’s contract bound me to silence.

"School’s good," I lied. "I even got a tutoring job. The pay isn’t bad. I’m saving up—for you."

His smile was sad. "Don’t waste your money on me. Besides, I doubt tutoring wages will cover what I owe."

I swallowed hard. If only he knew exactly how much I was earning—and why.

"Time’s up," the guard announced.

My father stood, his gaze heavy with regret. "Tell your mother I love her. That I’ll see her soon." He hesitated. "I’m sorry I can’t do more."

Tears spilled free before I could stop them. I swiped them away with the back of my hand, watching as they led him away.

And just like that, I was alone again.

"I will," I promised her, my voice barely above a whisper. "Take care of yourself."

He gave me one last sorrowful smile before the guard yanked him away. Moments later, another guard appeared to escort me out of the building. I murmured my thanks, but he barely glanced at me before turning on his heel.

With a heavy sigh, I stepped outside—only to freeze at the sight of a familiar figure waiting at the bottom of the steps. Leaning against a sleek pink Porsche 718 Boxster, Victoria Blackwood watched me with an unreadable expression.

I didn’t know much about cars, but even I recognized the latest model. And of course, the custom license plate—VICTORIA—left no doubt about who owned it.

"Hey," she called as I descended the last step. "Like it? Just picked it up this morning."

"It’s stunning," I admitted, forcing a polite smile. "But… why are you still here?" I had assumed she’d be long gone by now.

She shrugged, twirling her keys around her finger. "You have tutoring today, right?"

I nodded cautiously.

"Let me give you a ride," she offered, gesturing to the car. "We can get to know each other better."

The suggestion twisted my stomach into knots. Spending time with the woman my mate was marrying? No, thank you. But refusing would only make things awkward—and I really didn’t want to waste money on a ride if I didn’t have to.

"That’s… kind of you," I said finally. "Thank you, Victoria."

She grinned and practically skipped to the driver’s side. I slid into the passenger seat, immediately enveloped by the scent of expensive leather and her floral perfume. Every inch of the car screamed luxury—just like her.

And I had no doubt Sebastian had been the one to buy it for her.
###Chapter 45 Are you mad?

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, painting the marble floors in warm hues. Lillian stretched lazily in the silk sheets, her body still humming from the intensity of last night’s mating bond.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Miss Lillian?" Harper’s voice, smooth as velvet, carried through the door. "Breakfast is ready. Mr. Blackwood requests your presence in the dining room."

Lillian bit her lip, her heart skipping a beat at the mention of Sebastian. The man was an enigma—cold and commanding in public, yet devastatingly tender when they were alone.

"I’ll be right there," she called back, slipping out of bed.

The penthouse was a masterpiece of modern luxury, every detail meticulously curated. As she padded down the hallway, the scent of freshly brewed coffee and buttery croissants teased her senses.

Sebastian sat at the head of the table, his dark eyes lifting as she entered. The intensity of his gaze sent a shiver down her spine.

"Sleep well?" His voice was low, laced with amusement.

Lillian flushed, memories of tangled limbs and whispered promises flooding her mind. "Like a dream," she murmured, sliding into the chair beside him.

Before he could respond, Oliver burst into the room, his small face alight with excitement. "Lillian! You’re finally awake! Can we go to the park today? Dad promised!"

Sebastian sighed, though his lips twitched. "Oliver, manners."

The boy pouted but corrected himself. "Please?"

Lillian laughed, ruffling his hair. "Of course. But only if you finish your breakfast first."

As they ate, the domesticity of the moment struck her. It was surreal—just weeks ago, she had been a struggling college student, betrayed by Donovan and drowning in debt. Now, she was mated to the most powerful Lycan in the city, living in a penthouse that belonged in a magazine.

But the peace was short-lived.

Victoria stormed in, her heels clicking sharply against the marble. "Father, we need to talk." Her gaze flicked to Lillian, disdain curling her lips. "Alone."

Sebastian’s expression hardened. "Whatever you have to say, you can say it in front of Lillian."

Victoria’s eyes flashed. "Fine. Donovan’s been spotted near the pack borders. He’s demanding to see her."

Lillian’s fork clattered against her plate.

Sebastian’s growl was barely human. "He’s lost that privilege."

Victoria crossed her arms. "He claims he has proof that their bond wasn’t properly severed. That it’s still active."

The air in the room turned glacial.

Lillian’s pulse roared in her ears. That couldn’t be possible. She had felt the bond snap when Donovan rejected her. Hadn’t she?

Sebastian stood abruptly, his alpha aura pressing down on them all. "Tell him if he values his life, he’ll stay away."

But as Victoria turned to leave, she shot Lillian a look that sent ice through her veins.

This isn’t over.

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains of Lillian's bedroom, stirring her awake. She stretched lazily, her muscles still sore from yesterday's training session with Professor Montclair. A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Lillian? Are you up?" Beatrice's voice carried through the wood.

Lillian groaned, rubbing her eyes. "Yeah, come in."

Beatrice pushed the door open, already dressed in her usual stylish ensemble—a fitted blouse and high-waisted jeans. "You look like you wrestled a bear last night," she teased, tossing a protein bar onto the bed.

"Close enough," Lillian muttered, unwrapping the bar and taking a bite. "Combat training was brutal."

Beatrice perched on the edge of the bed, her expression turning serious. "So, have you decided yet?"

Lillian hesitated. The question hung in the air between them—whether she would accept Sebastian Blackwood's offer to stay at his estate permanently. The thought sent a shiver down her spine. His presence was magnetic, but the complications were undeniable.

"I don’t know," she admitted. "It’s not just about me. There’s Oliver, the pack dynamics, and… Donovan."

Beatrice scoffed. "Donovan made his choice when he left you for Evelyn. You don’t owe him anything."

Lillian sighed. "It’s not that simple."

Before Beatrice could argue, Lillian’s phone buzzed. A message from Sebastian lit up the screen: "Meeting at noon. We need to discuss the upcoming summit."

Her pulse quickened. The summit—where rival packs would gather, including Alpha Maximilian Voss, who had been eyeing Sebastian’s territory for months.

Beatrice raised an eyebrow. "Trouble?"

Lillian exhaled sharply. "Always."

By the time Lillian arrived at Sebastian’s study, the tension in the air was palpable. Marcus Grayson stood by the window, arms crossed, while Sebastian sat behind his desk, his piercing gaze locked onto a map spread before him.

"You’re late," Sebastian remarked without looking up.

Lillian bristled. "I came as soon as I could."

Finally, he lifted his eyes, and the intensity in them made her breath hitch. "Sit."

She obeyed, sinking into the chair opposite him. Marcus cleared his throat. "We’ve received word that Alpha Voss is bringing reinforcements. He’s not here to negotiate—he’s here to challenge."

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "Then we’ll be ready."

Lillian frowned. "What does this have to do with me?"

Sebastian leaned forward, his voice low. "Because you’re part of this pack now, whether you’ve accepted it or not. And Voss knows it."

A chill ran down her spine. "You think he’ll target me?"

Marcus exchanged a glance with Sebastian before answering. "He’ll use any weakness he can find."

Lillian clenched her fists. She wasn’t a weakness. She was a fighter.

Sebastian’s lips curved into a faint, dangerous smile. "Prove it."

The challenge hung between them, unspoken but clear.

The summit was coming.

And Lillian would be ready.

I fastened my seatbelt as Victoria did the same. With a smooth motion, she shifted the car into drive and pulled away, heading toward Sebastian’s estate.

The silence between us stretched for a moment before she spoke. "I apologize if my brother is... difficult," she said, her fingers tightening slightly on the steering wheel. "He’s driven away every tutor we’ve ever hired. I don’t know what’s gotten into him."

"He’s actually quite charming," I admitted honestly. "I think he just wants attention—any way he can get it. With Sebastian being a Lycan chairman and Alpha, and you being... engaged..." I hesitated on the last word, the weight of it making my stomach twist. Talking to Victoria about this felt strange, but she didn’t seem to notice my discomfort.

She sighed, her gaze fixed on the road. "I suppose I’ve been distracted with wedding preparations. I love Donovan so much that being apart from him even for a moment unsettles both me and my wolf."

My breath caught at her words. I definitely didn’t want to delve into this conversation, but one detail snagged my attention.

"Your wolf?" I asked before I could stop myself.

Victoria let out a soft laugh. "Yes. Don’t misunderstand—we both know Donovan isn’t our fated mate. But he’s been so tender, so devoted since the day we met that it hardly matters. My wolf claimed him as ours, and I can’t argue with her."

A wave of nausea rolled through me. I clenched my hands in my lap, unsure how to respond. Victoria must have sensed my tension because she glanced at me as we stopped at a red light.

"Have you ever been in love?"

The question startled me. When I looked up, her lips were pursed in a small frown, curiosity flickering in her eyes. I didn’t want to lie, but the truth was too dangerous. If I told her, it would ruin everything—this job, this fragile peace.

"I thought I was once," I admitted carefully. "But he didn’t feel the same way."

A shadow of sympathy crossed her face before the blare of a horn behind us snapped her attention back to the road. The light had turned green. She pressed the accelerator, and we continued toward the villa, its grand silhouette now visible in the distance.

As we neared the pack borders, the Silver Crescent guards didn’t stop us—they recognized Victoria’s car immediately. They dipped their heads in respect as she drove past, offering them a polite smile before we entered Sebastian’s sprawling estate.

"He’s a fool for not loving you," Victoria said after a beat of silence. "You’re wonderful. Any man would be lucky to have you."

I didn’t answer. Instead, I stared out the window, watching the trees blur past until we finally arrived. Victoria parked smoothly, and we both stepped out.

"Thank you for the ride," I said, forcing a smile. "I won’t keep you. I’m sure you have more wedding planning to do."

She nodded, though her expression turned wistful. "So much to do. But Donovan has a meeting today, so I’m left to my own devices." She gave me a small, sad smile. "I know you’re busy, though. Maybe we can talk more later?"

I nodded, though I had no idea what else we could possibly discuss. With a final glance, I turned and walked toward the villa, my chest tight with unspoken words.
"Good evening," Theodore greeted as I walked past him at the grand entrance. I shot him a glance—one I knew wasn’t particularly warm. When I first arrived, I’d thought Theodore and I could be friends. But after that reckless stunt he pulled, trying to get himself fired, I wasn’t sure I could trust him anymore. We hadn’t spoken since the incident, and I’d made a point to keep my distance.

"Is Oliver here?" I asked, my tone clipped.

"He’s out back, practicing his sparring," Theodore replied. "He’s nervous about his combat test next week."

Oliver had mentioned the test briefly—apparently, he’d been paired against someone much larger, and the thought of embarrassing himself had him on edge.

I found him in the courtyard, his movements sharp but hesitant. Without a word, I joined him, adjusting his stance and demonstrating a few new techniques. Within the hour, his confidence had visibly improved. We focused on swordplay, and he handled the weapon with surprising finesse.

"Try to disarm me," I challenged, gripping my sword firmly. "Take it from my hand."

He hesitated only a second before lunging forward, using the moves I’d just taught him. His footwork was precise, his grip steady—until, in a flash, the sword clattered to the ground. He had me exactly where he wanted.

But then, in his eagerness, he misjudged his swing. The blade caught the fabric of my blouse, and the sharp rip of tearing silk froze us both in place.

Oliver’s eyes widened in horror. "I—I didn’t mean to—"

I exhaled sharply, glancing down at the ruined sleeve. "Well," I muttered, "at least you’re learning."

His face paled. "Are you mad?"

I smirked. "Only if you don’t fix your grip before next week."

A beat of silence—then, to my surprise, he grinned.

Maybe, just maybe, he’d be ready after all.
###Chapter 46 Lillian's POV

The morning sun cast golden rays through the sheer curtains of Lillian's bedroom, stirring her awake. She stretched languidly, her muscles still sore from yesterday’s intense combat training. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted up from the kitchen, signaling that Beatrice was already awake.

Lillian padded downstairs, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. Beatrice sat at the kitchen island, scrolling through her phone with a smirk. "You look like you wrestled a bear last night," she teased, pushing a steaming mug toward Lillian.

"Close enough," Lillian muttered, taking a grateful sip. The rich, bitter warmth soothed her nerves.

Her phone buzzed—a message from Donovan. Her stomach twisted. "We need to talk. Meet me at the café near campus at noon."

Lillian frowned. After everything he’d done, what more could he possibly want? She hadn’t seen him since he’d publicly humiliated her at the pack gathering, flaunting Evelyn as his new mate.

Beatrice glanced at the screen and scoffed. "Don’t tell me you’re actually considering it."

"I don’t have a choice," Lillian admitted. "If he’s reaching out, it’s not for small talk."

Beatrice rolled her eyes. "Or he’s just trying to mess with your head again. You know how he gets."

Lillian sighed. She did. Donovan had a way of twisting words until she doubted her own reality. But ignoring him could be worse. If he was scheming something, she needed to know.

The café was bustling when she arrived. Donovan sat at a corner table, his posture relaxed, but his eyes sharpened the moment she walked in. Evelyn wasn’t with him—odd.

"You came," he said, leaning back. "I wasn’t sure you would."

Lillian slid into the seat across from him, keeping her expression neutral. "What do you want, Donovan?"

He smirked, swirling his coffee. "Straight to the point. I like that." His gaze flickered over her shoulder, and Lillian stiffened.

Sebastian Blackwood stood in the doorway, his presence commanding immediate silence from the room. His piercing eyes locked onto theirs, and Donovan’s smirk widened.

"Interesting," Donovan murmured. "Seems we’re not the only ones with secrets."

Lillian’s pulse spiked. What game was he playing now?

Sebastian approached, his voice low but firm. "Lillian. We need to leave."

Donovan chuckled. "Running away so soon? And here I thought we were just getting started."

Sebastian ignored him, his hand hovering near Lillian’s elbow. "Now."

Lillian hesitated, torn between defiance and the unsettling glint in Donovan’s eyes.

Then the café door burst open—Evelyn stormed in, her face flushed with fury.

"Donovan!" she snapped. "You said you were meeting your sister!"

Lillian’s breath caught.

Sebastian’s grip tightened. "Move."

But Donovan only laughed, leaning in. "Looks like the fun’s just beginning."

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting golden streaks across the plush carpet of Lillian’s bedroom. She stretched lazily, her muscles still sore from yesterday’s training session with Professor Montclair. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted up from the kitchen, mingling with the faint aroma of lavender from her sheets.

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Lillian? Are you awake?" Beatrice’s voice was muffled through the wood.

Lillian groaned, rubbing her eyes. "Yeah, come in."

The door creaked open, revealing Beatrice in her usual oversized hoodie and leggings, her dark curls piled messily on top of her head. She held out a steaming mug. "Thought you might need this. You looked dead on your feet last night."

Lillian accepted the coffee gratefully, taking a long sip. The rich, bitter warmth spread through her, chasing away the last remnants of sleep. "Thanks. I feel like I got run over by a truck."

Beatrice smirked, perching on the edge of the bed. "Well, maybe if you didn’t insist on sparring with Odette every damn day, you wouldn’t be so wrecked."

Lillian rolled her eyes. "Someone has to keep her in check. She’s gotten way too cocky since she won that last tournament."

Beatrice snorted. "Yeah, and you’re just the humble hero to put her in her place, right?"

Lillian threw a pillow at her, but Beatrice dodged with a laugh.

Their banter was cut short when Lillian’s phone buzzed on the nightstand. She glanced at the screen, her stomach tightening at the name flashing across it.

Sebastian Blackwood.

Beatrice raised an eyebrow. "Trouble in paradise?"

Lillian hesitated before answering. "I don’t know. He’s been... distant lately."

Ever since the incident at the resort, Sebastian had been wrapped up in pack business, barely sparing her more than a few clipped words. She knew he was dealing with Alpha Maximilian’s threats, but the coldness in his tone stung more than she cared to admit.

Swallowing her unease, she swiped to answer. "Sebastian?"

His voice was crisp, devoid of its usual warmth. "Lillian. I need you at the packhouse. Now."

The line went dead before she could respond.

Beatrice frowned. "What was that about?"

Lillian set down her coffee, her fingers trembling slightly. "I don’t know. But it didn’t sound good."

She dressed quickly, pulling on a fitted black sweater and dark jeans before grabbing her jacket. Beatrice followed her to the door, worry etched across her face.

"Text me if you need backup, okay?"

Lillian nodded, forcing a smile. "Always."

The drive to the Blackwood estate was tense, her mind racing with possibilities. Had something happened with Alpha Maximilian? Was Donovan causing trouble again? Or worse—had Victoria found another way to sabotage her?

When she arrived, Theodore was waiting at the entrance, his expression unreadable.

"Miss Whitmore," he greeted stiffly. "Alpha Blackwood is in his study."

Lillian followed him inside, her pulse quickening with each step. The mansion was eerily silent, the usual bustle of pack members absent.

Sebastian stood by the window when she entered, his broad shoulders tense beneath his tailored suit. He didn’t turn as she approached.

"You wanted to see me?" she asked, keeping her voice steady.

Finally, he faced her, his golden eyes dark with something she couldn’t decipher.

"We have a problem," he said quietly. "And it involves you."

Lillian’s breath hitched. "What kind of problem?"

Sebastian exhaled sharply, running a hand through his hair. "Someone leaked footage of you shifting during the resort attack. It’s gone viral."

Her blood ran cold. "What?"

He stepped closer, his voice dropping to a growl. "Every pack in the country knows what you are now, Lillian. And not all of them are happy about it."

The weight of his words crashed over her.

She was no longer just a college student.

She was a target.

"Oliver! What in the world have you done?!" Victoria's sharp voice cut through the air from the back porch steps. I hadn’t even realized she was there, and I couldn’t help but wonder how long she had been watching us.

Sebastian’s son—Oliver—froze, his face paling as his eyes welled up with unshed tears. His bottom lip trembled before he managed to speak.

"I-I’m so sorry, Lillian," he choked out, his voice breaking. "I didn’t mean to. I just—" His words dissolved into a hiccup, reminding me once again that beneath his usual bravado, he was still just a little boy.

My expression softened as I knelt before him, placing a reassuring hand on his shoulder. "It was an accident," I said gently, giving his shoulder a light squeeze. "I know you didn’t mean to, and I’m not angry with you, Oliver."

His gaze flickered downward, his voice dropping to a whisper. "Dad’s going to be furious."

I shook my head. "Your father won’t hear a word about this from me. It’ll be our little secret."

His eyes lifted, searching mine for confirmation. "Really?"

"Of course," I assured him with a smile. "Now, why don’t you go get cleaned up? I’m sure dinner will be ready soon."

He wiped at the stray tears on his cheeks before nodding, offering me a small, grateful smile. "Okay," he murmured before turning and heading back toward the villa.

I exhaled, brushing the dirt from my pants as I stood.

"You’re really good with him," Victoria remarked, stepping closer. "I’ve never seen anyone handle him like that. No wonder he adores you."

I shrugged casually, reaching for my bag propped against a nearby tree. "I suppose I just have a way with kids."

But Victoria wasn’t convinced. "I think it’s more than that," she mused, watching me closely as I gathered my things. "He sees something in you that he hasn’t found in anyone else. It’s… fascinating, honestly."

The thought warmed me, and I couldn’t help but smile. "He’s a special boy," I said softly. "He deserves the world."

Slinging my bag over my shoulder, I turned to her. "I should call an Uber and head out."

Her eyes widened in alarm. "You can’t leave looking like that!" she exclaimed, gesturing to my torn shirt, which was barely clinging to my frame. Thankfully, I had a sports bra underneath, but I still felt uncomfortably exposed.

"The last thing you need is some stranger ogling you," she insisted. "Come with me."

Before I could protest, she seized my arm and tugged me toward the villa. I didn’t resist—partly because I knew Sebastian would lose it if he found me upstairs, but Victoria didn’t seem to care. She led me down the hall until we reached what I assumed was her bedroom.

Victoria pulled me into her room with such force that I nearly tripped over my own feet. The door clicked shut behind me with finality, sealing me inside a space that reeked of Donovan's cologne—a scent that made my skin prickle with discomfort.

I hugged myself, my fingers digging into my arms as my gaze darted around the room. The bed, neatly made but undoubtedly shared countless times, sent a sharp twist of nausea through me. On the nightstand, a framed photo of Victoria and Donovan stared back at me—their eyes locked in a gaze so intimate it could fool anyone.

But I knew better.

Donovan didn't love her. He was playing a role, using her to secure his position as Alpha. The realization burned in my chest, and for a fleeting second, I considered warning her. But what good would it do? She’d never believe me. She’d think I was just jealous, bitter. And maybe I was—but that didn’t make the truth any less real.

I tore my eyes away from the photo just as Victoria began rifling through her closet, pulling out blouses and tossing them onto the bed.

"You really don’t have to do this," I said, my voice tight. The walls felt like they were closing in, the air thick with memories I didn’t want to acknowledge.

"Nonsense," she replied without turning around. "It’s nothing. Besides, you can’t walk around looking like that."

I glanced down at my torn shirt, the fabric barely holding together. She was right—but that didn’t make standing in this room any easier. Every breath I took was laced with his scent, every corner of the space a reminder of what he’d chosen over me.

And yet, Victoria moved through it all with oblivious grace, humming softly as she selected a silk blouse and held it up to me.

"Here," she said, smiling. "This will suit you."

I forced a nod, swallowing back the bitterness.

If only she knew.

The morning sun filtered through the heavy drapes of Lillian's bedroom at Blackwood Manor. She stretched lazily, her muscles still sore from yesterday's intense training session with Marcus. The scent of freshly brewed coffee and warm croissants drifted upstairs, making her stomach growl.

Downstairs in the grand dining room, Sebastian Blackwood sat reading the financial section of the morning paper while Oliver colored quietly beside him. The boy looked up as Lillian entered, his face lighting up immediately.

"Lily! You're finally awake!" Oliver scrambled from his chair, nearly knocking over his juice glass in his excitement. "Papa said we could go riding today if the weather stays nice."

Sebastian folded his newspaper with deliberate precision, his piercing gaze meeting Lillian's. "Good morning, Miss Whitaker. Did you sleep well?" His voice held that familiar deep timbre that always sent shivers down her spine.

Before she could respond, Theodore Whitmore entered with a silver tray bearing an envelope. "This arrived for you by special courier, Miss Whitaker."

Lillian's fingers trembled slightly as she recognized the elegant wax seal - the Winslow family crest. Breaking it open, she scanned the contents quickly, her breath catching in her throat.

"What is it?" Sebastian's voice sharpened, his protective instincts immediately on alert.

"It's... an invitation," Lillian managed to say. "From Eleanor Winslow. She's hosting a charity gala next week at Winslow Manor and has requested my presence."

Oliver tugged at her sleeve. "Are you going to go, Lily? Will there be dancing and fancy dresses?"

Sebastian's jaw tightened visibly. "Absolutely not. After what Donovan and his family put you through—"

"But it's not just about me," Lillian interrupted gently. She turned the invitation over, revealing a handwritten note at the bottom. "Eleanor says she wants to make amends. And... she mentions having information about my mother's current situation."

The room fell silent except for the ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner. Sebastian's eyes darkened with concern. "This could easily be a trap."

Lillian squared her shoulders. "Then I'll be ready for it. Marcus has been training me well, and I won't go unprepared." She met Sebastian's gaze steadily. "I need to do this. For my mother's sake."

Sebastian studied her for a long moment before giving a curt nod. "Very well. But you won't go alone. I'll accompany you as your escort."

Oliver clapped his hands excitedly. "Does this mean I get to see Lily in a princess dress?"

The tension broke as Lillian laughed, ruffling the boy's hair. "Something like that, sweetheart." But when she glanced back at Sebastian, she saw the unspoken worry in his eyes. This gala would be far more than just a social event - it would be her first real confrontation with Donovan since their disastrous breakup, and the first time facing the Winslow family in their own territory.

As breakfast continued, Lillian couldn't shake the feeling that this invitation marked the beginning of something much bigger - a game where the stakes were higher than she could imagine, and where every move could change everything.
###Chapter 47 The Outfit Dilemma

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine and dew as Lillian stepped out onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s sprawling estate. The sunrise painted the sky in hues of gold and pink, casting a warm glow over the manicured gardens below. She wrapped her arms around herself, the silk robe fluttering slightly in the breeze.

Last night had been… unexpected.

Her fingers traced the faint mark on her neck—Sebastian’s claiming bite. The memory sent a shiver down her spine. The way his hands had gripped her waist, the possessive growl rumbling in his chest as he sealed their bond. It should have terrified her. Instead, it ignited something primal inside her, something she hadn’t known existed.

A knock at the door pulled her from her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, turning just as Beatrice pushed the door open, balancing a tray of coffee and pastries.

"Morning, sunshine," Beatrice chirped, setting the tray on the bedside table. "You look like you didn’t sleep a wink."

Lillian scoffed, rubbing her temples. "That obvious?"

"Girl, you’ve got that look. The ‘I just got claimed by a Lycan chairman and my life is officially a mess’ look."

Lillian groaned, sinking into the plush armchair by the window. "It’s not just that. It’s… everything. Donovan’s still out there. Evelyn’s probably plotting my demise. And now I’m—" She hesitated, her fingers brushing the mark again.

"Officially off the market?" Beatrice smirked.

"More like officially tangled in pack politics."

Beatrice handed her a steaming cup of coffee. "Well, at least Sebastian’s loaded. Silver linings, right?"

Lillian rolled her eyes but took the coffee gratefully. The rich aroma soothed her nerves, if only slightly.

A sharp knock echoed through the room before the door swung open without invitation.

Sebastian stood in the doorway, his broad frame filling the space effortlessly. His dark eyes locked onto Lillian, intense and unreadable.

"Beatrice," he said, his voice low. "Leave us."

Beatrice shot Lillian a knowing look before slipping out, closing the door behind her with a soft click.

Silence stretched between them, thick and charged.

Sebastian stepped forward, his gaze never leaving hers. "We need to talk."

Lillian swallowed hard. "About?"

"About the fact that you’re mine now." His voice was a growl, sending a thrill down her spine. "And what that means for both of us."

She lifted her chin, meeting his stare head-on. "I don’t belong to anyone."

A slow, dangerous smile curved his lips. "Oh, little wolf. You already do."

The air between them crackled with tension, a silent battle of wills.

And Lillian knew—this was only the beginning.

Victoria was right, and it annoyed me to admit it.

After several minutes of rummaging through her closet, she emerged with a delicate blouse paired with a matching skirt. My nose wrinkled at the sight of the skirt, and I shot her a skeptical look, gesturing to my perfectly serviceable pants.

"My pants are fine," I insisted.

She shook her head, undeterred. "This blouse demands the skirt. They were meant to be worn together—trust me, I have an eye for fashion."

I exhaled sharply, resisting the urge to roll my eyes. "Don’t you have one shirt that doesn’t come with a dress code?"

Victoria pouted, her bottom lip jutting out dramatically. "Just try it, Lillian. If you hate it, you can change. But I know you’ll look stunning."

"I’m literally just going home," I reminded her. "No one cares if I look stunning."

She waved a dismissive hand. "Details. Please?"

I groaned, relenting. "Fine."

Her face lit up like I’d just handed her the moon. Clapping her hands together, she thrust the outfit at me with a triumphant grin.

I had to admit—the set was cute. And that irritated me even more.

"I’ll give you some privacy," she chirped, already backing toward the door. "Be back in five!"

The door clicked shut, leaving me standing in the middle of her bedroom, surrounded by the suffocating scent of Donovan. If I closed my eyes, I could almost feel him here, and the thought made my stomach twist.

Victoria’s room was a shrine to her perfect life—prom queen tiara on the dresser (her date conspicuously cut out of the photos), cheerleading trophies lining the shelves, pop star posters plastering the walls. The pink rug, the pink bedspread, the pink everything—it was like stepping into a teenage fantasy.

And knowing Donovan had spent countless nights here made bile rise in my throat.

I stripped off my ruined shirt and tossed it into the trash—no salvaging that. My pants followed, folded neatly and placed on the edge of her bed before I examined the outfit she’d forced on me.

The blouse was pretty—if you ignored the plunging neckline that would leave my cleavage on full display. My current bra wouldn’t work with it, but there was no way I was borrowing one of Victoria’s.

With a huff, I yanked off my bra and tossed it aside, my breasts finally free. I caught my reflection in the full-length mirror across the room—curves, toned abs from years of training, skin still flushed from the fight.

I scowled.

This was not happening.

But Victoria’s hopeful smile flashed in my mind, and I groaned.

Fine.

I’d humor her.

But only this once.
###Chapter 48 Sebastian's POV

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, painting the marble floors in warm hues. Lillian stretched lazily in the silk sheets, the scent of sandalwood and leather—Sebastian’s signature fragrance—lingering in the air.

She had barely opened her eyes when a deep voice rumbled beside her.

"Sleep well, little wolf?"

Sebastian’s arm was draped possessively over her waist, his fingers tracing idle patterns on her bare skin. Lillian shivered, her wolf purring in contentment.

"Too well," she murmured, rolling over to face him. His piercing blue eyes held a predatory glint, one that sent heat pooling low in her stomach.

Before she could say another word, his lips crashed onto hers, stealing her breath. The kiss was demanding, intoxicating—a silent claim that made her toes curl.

A sharp knock at the door shattered the moment.

"Alpha, urgent pack business," Marcus Grayson’s voice filtered through.

Sebastian growled, reluctantly pulling away. "This better be life or death."

Lillian bit back a laugh as he reluctantly untangled himself from her, his expression dark with irritation. She watched as he strode to the door, his muscular frame barely concealed by the black silk robe he’d thrown on.

Outside, Marcus stood stiffly, his gaze flickering briefly to Lillian before addressing Sebastian. "Alpha Levi’s pack has challenged our territory rights near the northern border. They’re claiming the hunting grounds."

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "Levi always did have a death wish."

Lillian sat up, the sheets pooling around her waist. "What does this mean?"

Sebastian turned to her, his expression unreadable. "It means war, unless I handle it personally."

A chill ran down her spine. She had seen Sebastian in battle mode before—ruthless, calculating, lethal. But this was different. This wasn’t just about dominance; it was about protecting what was theirs.

"I’m coming with you," she declared, already reaching for her clothes.

Sebastian’s eyes flashed with warning. "No."

"I’m not some fragile damsel," she shot back, pulling on her jeans. "I’m your mate, and I fight by your side."

For a moment, she thought he’d argue. Then, a slow smirk curved his lips. "Fine. But if you get hurt, I’m locking you in this penthouse forever."

Lillian rolled her eyes. "Deal."

As they prepared to leave, her phone buzzed. A message from Beatrice lit up the screen:

"Don’t forget—Evelyn’s party tonight. She’s already bragging about how Donovan’s going to propose."

Lillian’s stomach twisted. She had almost forgotten about Evelyn’s ridiculous engagement celebration.

Sebastian noticed her hesitation. "Problem?"

She forced a smile. "Nothing I can’t handle."

But as they stepped out into the crisp morning air, Lillian couldn’t shake the feeling that tonight would change everything.

And not necessarily for the better.

The moment I stepped into the villa, Marcus handed me a sleek black case. "Got those pink gems you wanted," he said with a knowing smirk. I took it without hesitation, flipping it open to admire the delicate string of pink stones inside. Perfect. These would look stunning on the mirror in Victoria's new car—she was going to adore them.

A glance at the clock told me it was later than usual, but still early for me. Even Theodore, my ever-silent butler, raised a brow at my presence, though he knew better than to speak unless permitted.

Victoria was probably out with Donovan at this hour, and Oliver would still be wrapping up his tutoring session. "Anything else before I head out?" Marcus asked, checking his watch.

"No. Have a good night," I replied, dismissing my Beta and longtime friend.

Marcus shot me a suggestive grin before turning toward the door. "Yeah, you too," he tossed over his shoulder. I rolled my eyes as he left, shaking my head before heading upstairs.

No point waiting for Victoria—if she was with Donovan, she likely wouldn’t be back tonight. Lately, she’d been spending most of her evenings at his place, and sometimes he stayed here. I pretended not to notice.

I strode to her room, gripping the doorknob. I’d leave the gift on her pillow for when she returned. She’d wanted something special for her car, and I’d found the perfect thing. Patience wasn’t my strong suit, but I’d manage—until then.

The door swung open, and the rich scent of lavender and vanilla hit me like a wave. My entire body locked up when my gaze landed on a wide-eyed Lillian, frozen mid-motion. Then my eyes dropped—and my wolf snarled with instant, primal hunger.

Two full, tempting curves greeted me before she yanked a shirt up to cover herself. Her sharp gasp barely registered through the haze of desire clouding my mind. Only when she clutched the fabric tighter did I blink, forcing my gaze back to hers.

"What the hell are you doing in my daughter’s room?" My voice came out harsher than intended. She wasn’t supposed to be on the second floor—that rule had been clear from day one of her tutoring Oliver.

"Do you always barge into your daughter’s room without knocking?" she fired back, chin lifted in defiance. My eyes darkened, irritation flaring—until Victoria’s voice cut in.

"Dad?" She peeked around the doorway, frowning. "Why are you home so early?"

I shot her a glare. "Why are you home at all? I thought you’d be with Donovan."

She shrugged. "He had a meeting. I had time to kill, so I hung out with Lillian."

My grip tightened on the gift box. "You... hung out... with Lillian?" I repeated slowly, each word deliberate.

This was new. And I wasn’t sure I liked it.

"Oliver adores her, and I must confess, she intrigued me as well," Lillian admitted with a playful shrug. "So yes, we spent some time together."

The tension in the room was palpable, but Lillian wasn't one to be easily flustered. She turned her back to us, deliberately cutting off our view of her—though the movement only emphasized the curve of her shoulders and the confidence in her stance.

"This has been entertaining," she said, her voice laced with amusement, "but do you mind giving me a moment of privacy?"

Her tone was light, but there was an unspoken challenge in her words, a silent dare for anyone to question her further. The air between us crackled with unspoken tension, and I couldn't help but wonder what secrets lay beneath that effortless smile.

###Chapter 49 Back off

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains of Lillian’s bedroom, stirring her awake. She stretched lazily, her muscles still sore from yesterday’s intense combat training with Professor Montclair. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted up from the kitchen, signaling that Giselle, the head maid, was already at work.

Lillian dressed quickly, opting for a simple yet elegant outfit—a fitted blouse and tailored trousers, something that wouldn’t draw too much attention but still made her feel confident. She had promised Beatrice they would meet for breakfast before classes, and she didn’t want to be late.

As she descended the grand staircase of Sebastian Blackwood’s mansion, she caught sight of Oliver, his small frame perched on a chair in the dining room, swinging his legs as he nibbled on a piece of toast. His bright eyes lit up when he saw her.

"Morning, Lillian!" he chirped, crumbs tumbling from his lips.

She ruffled his hair affectionately. "Morning, trouble. Where’s your dad?"

Oliver shrugged. "Dunno. He left early with Marcus."

Lillian frowned. Sebastian had been unusually distant lately, buried in pack business. She tried not to let it bother her, but the absence of his usual teasing remarks left an odd emptiness in her chest.

Beatrice arrived just as Lillian was finishing her coffee, her cheeks flushed from hurrying. "Sorry! Professor Sinclair kept me after class yesterday, and I overslept."

Lillian waved it off. "No worries. Let’s grab something from the café before lecture."

The campus was alive with students, the air buzzing with chatter and laughter. As they walked, Lillian noticed Donovan and Evelyn standing near the fountain, their heads bent close in conversation. A flicker of irritation sparked in her chest, but she forced herself to look away. He wasn’t her problem anymore.

At the café, Gabrielle greeted them with a warm smile. "The usual?"

Lillian nodded, but before Gabrielle could hand over their drinks, a sharp voice cut through the noise.

"Well, if it isn’t the little werewolf and her shadow." Cassandra sauntered up, flanked by two of her usual followers. "Still clinging to Sebastian’s coattails, I see."

Lillian clenched her jaw but kept her tone light. "Morning, Cassandra. Still bitter about being rejected from the Alpha’s inner circle?"

Cassandra’s smirk faltered, her eyes flashing with anger. "You think you’re so special just because he lets you stay in his house? Newsflash—you’re just a charity case."

Beatrice stepped forward, her fists clenched. "Back off, Cassandra."

Before things could escalate, Professor Sinclair’s voice rang out from behind them. "Ladies, save the drama for the stage. Class starts in five minutes."

Cassandra shot Lillian one last glare before strutting away, her entourage in tow.

Lillian exhaled slowly, her pulse still racing. "Thanks, Professor."

He gave her a knowing look. "Don’t let her get to you. She’s not worth your energy."

As they headed to class, Beatrice nudged her. "You okay?"

Lillian forced a smile. "Yeah. Just tired of her nonsense."

But beneath the surface, unease prickled at her. Cassandra’s words had struck a nerve. Was she really just a charity case to Sebastian?

The question lingered in her mind as she took her seat, her fingers tapping restlessly against her notebook.

And then, as if summoned by her thoughts, Sebastian strode into the lecture hall, his presence commanding immediate silence. His piercing gaze swept the room before landing on her.

A slow smirk curled his lips.

Lillian’s breath hitched.

Whatever game he was playing, she was about to find out.

Victoria's fingers trembled with anticipation as she tore open the gift box. The moment the delicate pink crystals caught the light, her breath hitched audibly. Her eyes sparkled like the gems themselves, and a radiant smile bloomed across her perfectly glossed lips.

"Oh, Dad!" she squealed, throwing her arms around Sebastian in a crushing embrace. "It's perfect! I've been dreaming of something exactly like this!" She pulled back just as quickly, dashing toward Lillian to proudly display her treasure. "Look! These would look absolutely divine hanging from my rearview mirror, don't you think?" She held up the crystals, letting them catch the light.

"That was the idea," Sebastian murmured, watching his daughter's delight with quiet satisfaction.

Lillian's gaze flickered to the gems, and she offered Victoria a tight-lipped smile—forced, but present. Sebastian noted the effort with surprise. Given that Victoria was engaged to Donovan, Lillian's fated mate, he hadn't expected even this much civility. His wolf growled low in his chest, irritated by the thought, and he mentally shoved the beast back.

"They're beautiful," Lillian finally said after a beat of hesitation. "They'll suit your car perfectly."

Victoria beamed, bouncing on her toes. "I'm going to put them in right now! Dad, don’t leave before I come back!" With that, she dashed out of the room in a whirl of excitement, leaving Sebastian alone with Lillian.

His eyes immediately dropped to her outfit—borrowed clothes that clung too tightly, clearly not her own. A deep frown creased his brow.

"I thought we had an agreement about your attire," he said, his voice edged with disapproval.

Lillian paled slightly, her throat working as she swallowed. "There was… an incident with my clothes," she admitted, shrugging as if it were nothing.

Sebastian's jaw tightened. "What kind of incident?" His tone darkened, though he told himself it was purely professional concern. If something had happened on his property involving his staff, he needed to know.

She bit her lower lip, hesitating. "Oliver and I were sparring. My shirt got torn."

Her refusal to meet his eyes told him there was more to the story. Knowing Oliver, Sebastian wouldn’t be surprised if the boy had played a role in the damage. But Lillian was clearly covering for him, and he wasn’t about to push further.

"Victoria was kind enough to lend me something," Lillian finished quickly. "But I shouldn’t stay. I should go."

Sebastian didn’t move as she stepped past him toward the door. The faintest brush of her arm against his sent an inexplicable jolt through him, his pulse stuttering in response. He frowned, unsettled by the reaction.

Lillian paused, and for a fleeting second, he wondered if she’d felt it too. When her eyes lifted to meet his, the world seemed to still around them, the air thick with something unspoken.

"I'll see you later," she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper.

Sebastian managed a stiff nod, watching as she hurried away. His body betrayed him with a traitorous twitch, and he cursed inwardly. This woman—this infuriating, complicated woman—was getting under his skin in ways he refused to acknowledge. His wolf stirred hungrily, and he forcefully silenced it, locking the beast away.

Shaking off the tension, he strode out of the room and down the stairs. Lillian was already halfway across the foyer, not sparing him a backward glance. But at the doorway, she stopped abruptly, her expression darkening as Victoria reappeared, her earlier excitement now replaced with a frown.

"Everything alright?" I asked Victoria as I descended the staircase.

She gave a small sigh, her fingers absently playing with the hem of her sleeve. "I suppose so. The jewels look stunning in the car. I took some photos to send to Donovan and called him, but..." Her voice trailed off. "He said he'd be busy all night and won't see me until tomorrow."

I caught the way Lillian stiffened at the mention of Donovan's name, and I had to bite back a sharp remark.

Just then, Oliver bounded in from the living room, his face lighting up the moment he spotted Lillian.

"Can we keep practicing?" he asked eagerly, as if the rest of us had suddenly vanished.

Lillian offered him a soft smile, though her eyes held a hint of exhaustion. "I think I should head home for tonight," she said gently. "But I'll be back tomorrow, I promise."

Oliver's face fell, and my chest tightened. The boy was starved for connection—Lillian had been right about that. "But we didn’t finish!" he protested, his lower lip jutting out.

She placed a reassuring hand on his shoulder and gave it a light squeeze. "Tomorrow, we’ll practice twice as long, okay?"

He looked ready to argue, so I stepped in before he could.

"What I'm hearing," I said, glancing between Victoria and Oliver, "is that both of my kids are free tonight. How about we have the chefs prepare something special? It’s been too long since we’ve had a proper family dinner."

Victoria brightened immediately, and even Oliver perked up.

"That sounds perfect," Victoria said, slipping an arm around my waist in a quick hug.

"I'm in!" Oliver declared, bouncing on his toes. "But only if Lillian stays too!"

Lillian hesitated, but the hopeful look in Oliver’s eyes was impossible to resist.

"Alright," she relented with a small laugh. "One dinner won’t hurt."

Oliver cheered, and for the first time in weeks, the house didn’t feel quite so empty.
###Chapter 50 The Storm Before the Calm

The moon hung low in the sky, casting an eerie glow over the Blackwood estate. Lillian paced the length of her bedroom, her fingers twisting the hem of her sweater. The weight of Donovan’s betrayal still pressed heavily on her chest, but tonight, something else gnawed at her—something far more immediate.

A sharp knock at the door startled her.

"Lillian?" Sebastian’s deep voice resonated through the wood.

She hesitated before pulling the door open. The sight of him—tall, imposing, his dark eyes shadowed with concern—sent an unexpected warmth through her.

"You’re still awake," he murmured, stepping inside without waiting for an invitation.

"I could say the same about you," she countered, crossing her arms.

Sebastian’s lips quirked. "I don’t sleep much these days."

Silence stretched between them, thick with unspoken words. Then, abruptly, he exhaled. "We need to talk about Donovan."

Lillian stiffened. "What about him?"

"He’s been spotted near the eastern border." Sebastian’s voice was calm, but his jaw tightened. "With Evelyn."

A cold knot formed in Lillian’s stomach. She had known Donovan would move on, but hearing it confirmed was another thing entirely.

Sebastian stepped closer, his gaze piercing. "He’s not just here to flaunt his new mate. He’s challenging my authority."

Lillian’s pulse spiked. "What does that mean?"

"It means," he said slowly, "that he’s gathering allies. And if he succeeds, this pack will be divided."

The gravity of his words settled over her. She had come here seeking refuge, but now, she was tangled in a power struggle she hadn’t asked for.

Sebastian’s hand lifted, hovering near her cheek before he seemed to think better of it. "I won’t let him hurt you again."

Lillian swallowed hard. "I can fight my own battles."

A ghost of a smile touched his lips. "I know. But you don’t have to."

Outside, the wind howled, rattling the windows. A storm was coming—both literal and metaphorical.

And Lillian had a sinking feeling she was standing right in the eye of it.

All three pairs of eyes locked onto me—Victoria and Oliver with bright, hopeful smiles, while Sebastian's dark brows furrowed into a scowl.

I stood frozen, my pulse hammering so hard I could feel it in my throat. Every instinct screamed at me to escape. Dinner with Sebastian and his family? Absolutely not.

"I—I really should go," I stammered, jerking my thumb toward the door with a laugh that sounded more panicked than polite.

"Please, Lillian," Oliver begged, latching onto my wrist with both hands. "Stay with us!" His eyes sparkled with excitement.

Victoria clasped her hands together. "It would be lovely to have another woman at the table." The quiet longing in her voice was unmistakable—she was starved for companionship.

I shot Sebastian a pleading look, silently begging him to intervene. But he only exhaled sharply, dragging a hand through his tousled dark hair before turning to the maid who had just entered.

"Set another place for Miss Dumont," he commanded, his voice brooking no argument.

My stomach plummeted.

"Yes, Alpha," the maid murmured, bowing before scurrying off to the kitchen.

Sebastian's gaze finally met mine, his expression unreadable. I gaped at him, stunned. He clearly didn’t want me here—so why force me?

Before I could demand an answer, Oliver let out an excited squeal, bouncing on his toes. Victoria beamed, clapping her hands. "Perfect! Oliver, come help me set the table."

The moment they disappeared into the dining room, I whirled on Sebastian, my lips pressed into a thin line. "What was that?"

He arched a brow. "What was what?"

I scoffed. "Don’t play dumb. Why did you just volunteer me for dinner?"

His expression darkened, and the air between us turned icy. "Because you are staying," he said, his voice low and edged with steel. "Oliver hasn’t smiled like that in months. For some reason, he likes you. So for his sake, you’ll sit through this meal without complaint."

I opened my mouth to argue—then snapped it shut. He was right. I couldn’t ruin Oliver’s happiness.

With a stiff nod, I turned toward the dining room—only for Sebastian’s fingers to curl around my wrist, stopping me mid-step. His grip was firm, yet oddly gentle. A shiver raced up my spine at the contact, warmth blooming beneath my skin.

My pulse stuttered when I turned to face him, the air freezing in my lungs as I realized just how little space separated us. His scent wrapped around me like a storm, intoxicating and impossible to ignore. For a fleeting moment, I was lost in it—in him.

Sebastian Blackwood stood frozen, his dark eyes burning into mine, lips slightly parted as if he’d forgotten what he meant to say. His gaze dropped to my mouth, lingering there, and my breath hitched. Was he going to kiss me?

Did I want him to?

I bit my lower lip, the answer already clear in the way my heart hammered against my ribs.

I wanted Sebastian Blackwood to kiss me.

But then, as if snapped back to reality, he released my arm and straightened, his expression shuttering. The spell broke, leaving me blinking up at him, my cheeks flaming.

"It's just dinner, Lillian," he reminded me, his voice low and firm. "Don’t start thinking this means anything."

He turned away without another glance, striding toward the kitchen. I pressed my fingers to my cheek, the skin scorching beneath my touch. Swallowing hard, I forced myself to breathe before following him.

Victoria and Oliver were already seated at the table, two empty plates waiting—one at the head, the other right beside it. My stomach twisted. That was my seat. Right next to Sebastian.

He noticed it too, exhaling sharply as he approached the table. The rich aroma of food filled the dining room, making my mouth water. I hadn’t eaten all day—not since visiting my father in prison and rushing straight here to tutor Oliver. Time had slipped away from me entirely.

###Chapter 51 You wanted to see me?

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains, rousing Lillian from her restless sleep. She blinked against the light, her mind still foggy from the previous night’s turmoil. The scent of pine and musk lingered faintly in the air—Sebastian’s scent—reminding her of the heated argument they’d had before he stormed out.

She sat up, rubbing her temples. The bond between them pulsed with tension, a dull ache that refused to fade.

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Miss Lillian?" Giselle’s voice was gentle but firm. "Mr. Blackwood has requested your presence in his study."

Lillian swallowed hard. So he’s back.

She dressed quickly, choosing a simple blouse and jeans, then made her way down the grand staircase. The mansion was eerily quiet, the usual bustle of staff subdued.

Sebastian stood by the window when she entered, his broad shoulders tense beneath his tailored suit. He didn’t turn as she stepped inside.

"You wanted to see me?" Her voice was steady, though her pulse betrayed her.

Finally, he faced her. His golden eyes burned with restrained fury. "We need to talk about last night."

Lillian crossed her arms. "There’s nothing to talk about. You made your stance clear."

His jaw tightened. "You put yourself in danger. Again."

"Because I had no choice!" she snapped. "Donovan was—"

"Donovan is not your concern anymore," Sebastian growled, cutting her off. "He’s Evelyn’s problem now."

Lillian flinched. The mention of her ex-fated mate still stung, but she refused to show it. "He’s still a threat. To me. To Oliver. To you."

Sebastian’s expression darkened. "And you think running off alone to confront him was the solution?"

"I wasn’t alone," she countered. "Beatrice was with me."

"That’s hardly reassuring."

Lillian’s temper flared. "I don’t need your permission to protect the people I care about!"

The air between them crackled with unspoken tension. For a moment, neither spoke.

Then, Sebastian exhaled sharply. "Fine. But from now on, you don’t act without me."

Lillian opened her mouth to argue, but the look in his eyes silenced her. There was something else there—something raw and vulnerable beneath the anger.

Before she could respond, the door burst open.

"Alpha!" Marcus Grayson, Sebastian’s beta, rushed in, his face grim. "We have a situation."

Sebastian’s gaze snapped to him. "What is it?"

Marcus hesitated, glancing at Lillian. "It’s Victoria. She’s gone."

Lillian’s blood ran cold.

Sebastian’s voice was deadly calm. "Explain."

Marcus swallowed. "She left a note. She’s… she’s gone to meet Donovan."

The room spun.

Lillian barely registered Sebastian’s furious command before he stormed out, Marcus at his heels.

She stood frozen, dread coiling in her stomach.

This wasn’t just a fight anymore.

This was war.

Sebastian took his seat at the head of the table, and I cautiously settled into the chair beside him.

A maid hurried into the dining room, balancing a bottle of aged red wine and a carafe of freshly pressed apple juice. Without hesitation, she poured Victoria a generous glass of wine and Oliver a smaller serving of juice. Moving gracefully around the table, she filled Sebastian’s glass next before pausing before me with a polite smile.

“Wine, madam?” she inquired.

“Apple juice, please,” I answered swiftly.

There was no way I’d risk drinking here—not when I needed to keep my wits sharp. Drunk Lillian around Sebastian was a disaster waiting to happen.

The maid blinked in surprise but quickly complied, pouring me a glass of the crisp golden juice. As she retreated, Victoria shot me a puzzled look.

“You don’t drink?” she asked, swirling her wine.

“Only on special occasions,” I replied smoothly.

Before she could press further, another maid entered, pushing a silver cart laden with steaming dishes. The rich aromas made my stomach growl—I didn’t even care what was under those domed lids anymore. The first cover was lifted, revealing four perfectly seared T-bone steaks, their juices sizzling against the hot metal. My mouth watered as she placed one on each of our plates.

The next dish was a mountain of creamy garlic mashed potatoes, followed by a medley of roasted vegetables glistening with butter and herbs. “Will there be anything else, Alpha?” the maid asked as she wheeled the cart away.

“That’s all,” Sebastian murmured, his gaze fixed on his plate. Then, to my surprise, he added, “Thank you.”

The maid beamed before slipping out.

“This looks amazing,” I breathed, admiring the vibrant colors and intoxicating scents.

“Our kitchen staff is exceptional,” Victoria agreed, picking up her utensils.

I followed suit, cutting into the steak—medium rare, just how I liked it. The tender meat practically melted on my tongue, each bite bursting with flavor. My wolf hummed in satisfaction, and for the first time since arriving, I felt myself relax.

“How are the lessons going?” Sebastian asked suddenly, glancing at Oliver, who was meticulously avoiding the fatty edges of his steak.

Oliver looked up, startled by the question. After a brief pause, he grinned. “Great! Lillian’s the best. She teaches me stuff no other tutor ever has!”

Sebastian’s expression remained unreadable, but something flickered in his eyes—something I couldn’t quite place.

And just like that, the tension returned.
"That's probably because they didn't have a clue how to do any of it," Victoria chimed in, swirling her wine glass thoughtfully. "Honestly, Father, where did you even find those tutors? They were utterly hopeless."

Sebastian hummed in agreement, his deep voice sending an unexpected shiver down my spine. My cheeks warmed at the unspoken praise, and I quickly stuffed a piece of roasted asparagus into my mouth, savoring the rich, buttery flavor. A soft sigh nearly escaped me, but I swallowed it down, not wanting to draw attention.

"Complete idiots," Oliver muttered under his breath.

"Language," Sebastian reprimanded, though his tone remained calm.

Oliver paled slightly but wisely kept quiet.

The rest of the meal passed in comfortable silence, punctuated only by the occasional clink of silverware against fine china. Victoria and Oliver drifted into a light conversation, but I barely registered their words. My mind was elsewhere—specifically, on the way Sebastian’s gaze lingered on me when he thought I wasn’t looking.

By the time I finished, I pushed my plate away, pleasantly full but eager to put some distance between us. The maids glided in silently, clearing the table with practiced efficiency.

"Dessert, Alpha?" one of them asked, refilling Sebastian’s wine glass with a practiced hand.

He glanced at me, as if waiting for my answer.

"I should probably head out," I said, offering him a small, polite smile. "Thank you for dinner, though. It was wonderful."

For a moment, he just stared at me, his expression unreadable, as if debating whether to say something more. Then, with a slight nod, he relented. "Let Frederick drive you home. It's late, and I don’t like the idea of you walking alone at this hour."

I hesitated, then nodded. "That would be nice."

As I stood, Sebastian rose with me, his towering presence impossible to ignore. I hadn’t expected him to walk me to the door, but he did, his piercing gaze tracking my every move.

Third Person POV

Neither Sebastian nor Lillian noticed the way Victoria and Oliver watched them leave the dining room. Victoria had been intrigued by Lillian from the start—Oliver had never taken to any of his tutors before, yet he seemed genuinely fond of her. It made her wonder what made this woman so different.

Admittedly, Victoria liked her too. There was something undeniably compelling about Lillian—something secretive, something she couldn’t quite place.

But as dinner progressed, she caught her father stealing glances at Lillian when he thought no one was looking. And in that moment, realization struck her like lightning.

Something was happening between them.

A slow, knowing smile curved Victoria’s lips as she watched them disappear down the hall. Oliver, too, was staring after them, a hopeful glint in his eyes. When he turned to meet his sister’s gaze, they shared an identical, conspiratorial smirk.

###Chapter 52 Third Person POV

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the Blackwood estate grounds. Her fingers tightened around the strap of her backpack, her heart pounding with a mix of anticipation and dread. Today was the day she would face Donovan again—her former fated mate, the man who had shattered her trust without a second thought.

Sebastian Blackwood stood by the grand oak tree near the mansion’s entrance, his piercing gaze locked onto her. Even from a distance, his presence was commanding, the very air around him crackling with restrained power. His dark hair was tousled slightly by the breeze, and the sleeves of his tailored shirt were rolled up to his elbows, revealing the intricate tattoos that marked him as Lycan royalty.

"You're late," he remarked, though his tone lacked its usual sharpness.

Lillian exhaled sharply. "Traffic."

A smirk tugged at his lips. "Excuses won’t save you from training."

She rolled her eyes but followed him toward the private training grounds. The moment they stepped onto the soft earth, the atmosphere shifted. The scent of damp soil and pine filled her lungs, and the distant howl of a wolf sent a shiver down her spine.

Sebastian turned to face her, his expression unreadable. "Today, we work on control. Your emotions are still too volatile."

She bristled. "I’m not the one who nearly tore apart a pack member last week."

His eyes darkened. "That was different."

"Because it was Evelyn?" The name tasted bitter on her tongue.

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "Because she was provoking you deliberately. And you almost lost yourself to the rage."

Lillian clenched her fists. "I won’t let it happen again."

"Prove it."

Without warning, he lunged.

She barely had time to react before his fist grazed her shoulder, sending her stumbling back. Instinct took over—her claws unsheathed, her vision sharpening as her wolf surged forward. But she forced herself to breathe, to steady the wild pulse of her heartbeat.

Sebastian’s lips curled in approval. "Better."

They circled each other, the tension between them thick enough to cut. Then, in a blur of motion, she struck—swift, precise, controlled. He blocked her effortlessly, but she didn’t falter.

For the first time in weeks, she felt alive.

Until a sharp voice cut through the clearing.

"Am I interrupting?"

Lillian whirled around to find Donovan standing at the edge of the training grounds, his arms crossed, his expression unreadable. Beside him, Evelyn smirked, her fingers tracing idle patterns on his arm.

Sebastian’s growl was low, dangerous. "You weren’t invited."

Donovan’s gaze flicked to Lillian. "I came to talk."

Her stomach twisted. "We have nothing to say to each other."

Evelyn’s laugh was like nails on glass. "Oh, I think you do."

Sebastian stepped forward, his voice a lethal whisper. "Leave. Now."

But Donovan didn’t back down. Instead, he pulled something from his pocket—a folded piece of paper.

"Read it," he said, tossing it at Lillian’s feet. "Then decide if you still have nothing to say."

Her hands trembled as she picked it up. The moment her eyes scanned the first line, her blood turned to ice.

"If you ever want to see your mother again, meet me at midnight. Alone."

The world tilted.

Sebastian snatched the note from her grip, his fury igniting like wildfire. "Who gave you this?"

Donovan’s smile was cold. "Someone who knows exactly how to hurt her."

Lillian’s breath came in short, panicked gasps. Her mother—her mother—was in danger.

And the only way to save her was to walk straight into a trap.

Sebastian’s hand closed around her wrist, his grip unyielding. "You’re not going anywhere."

She met his gaze, her voice barely a whisper.

"I have to."

The clock ticked past 9:30 PM, and Victoria remained curled on the plush couch, her phone clutched tightly in her hands. Donovan had promised to call at eight. Now, over an hour late, her messages sat unread, her calls unanswered.

A cold knot twisted in her stomach. This wasn’t like him. Not once had he vanished without warning. She bit her lip, the silence of the penthouse pressing in around her. She wished she had someone to confide in—but real friends were a luxury she didn’t have. The girls who flitted in and out of her life only wanted proximity to the Blackwood name, to her father’s influence.

The closest thing she had to a friend was Lillian, but she didn’t even have her number. Did Lillian even want to be friends? Victoria wrapped her arms around herself, as if she could physically hold her fraying nerves together.

"Everything alright?"

Sebastian’s deep voice cut through the quiet. He stood in the doorway, bare-chested, his pajama bottoms the only concession to comfort. It was rare to see him out of his tailored suits, even at home.

Victoria glanced at her phone again. "I’m worried about Donovan. He hasn’t called."

Sebastian exhaled sharply—a sound she knew too well. Disapproval. He’d never hidden his dislike for Donovan, though Victoria couldn’t fathom why. From the moment they met, Donovan had been nothing but perfect.

She remembered it vividly: the Alpha banquet, the air thick with ambition. News of Alpha Harrison’s death had sent every eligible Alpha scrambling to impress Sebastian Blackwood, the most powerful Lycan chairman in the world.

And then Donovan had walked in.

Dressed in a tuxedo, his dark curls swept back, he’d scanned the room with an intensity that made her pulse stutter. When his gaze locked onto hers, the world narrowed to just the two of them. Her wolf had purred, delighted.

He hadn’t bothered with politics that night. Instead, he’d ordered her another glass of champagne and talked to her until dawn. Not once did he mention her father.

By sunrise, he had her number.

The next night, they talked until the sky lightened. No one had ever made her feel like this—consumed, desperate. When she’d begged Sebastian for his blessing, he’d refused at first, warning her Donovan wasn’t what he seemed.

She’d screamed. Threatened her own life if he didn’t relent.

A month later, Donovan proposed.

And now he was ignoring her.

Victoria’s fingers tightened around her phone. Something was wrong. She could feel it.

But what?

Lillian glanced at her father, Sebastian Blackwood, who sat beside her on the plush velvet sofa. The silence between them was thick, charged with unspoken emotions. Finally, she broke it.

"Did you love Mom when she was alive?"

Sebastian stiffened, his piercing golden eyes widening slightly before turning to study her face. Concern flickered in his gaze, followed by a deep, contemplative shadow. "She was my fated mate," he answered firmly, his voice rough with conviction. "Of course I loved her."

Lillian twisted her fingers in her lap, staring down at them. "I know she was your fated mate," she murmured. "But that just means your wolves chose each other. It doesn’t mean you had to love her."

Sebastian exhaled sharply, his broad shoulders tensing. "You think the bond is just instinct?" His voice dropped, low and dangerous. "That it’s only about wolves recognizing each other?"

Lillian lifted her chin, meeting his gaze. "Isn’t it?"

For a moment, Sebastian looked as though she had struck him. Then his expression hardened, his jaw clenching. "Your mother was more than just a bond to me," he said, each word deliberate. "She was my heart. My choice."

Lillian swallowed hard, her chest tightening. "But what if the bond is wrong?" she whispered. "What if it forces people together who shouldn’t be?"

Sebastian’s eyes darkened. "Is this about Donovan?"

Lillian flinched.

Sebastian leaned forward, his voice dropping to a growl. "Listen to me, Lillian. A fated bond is a gift, but love? That’s something you fight for. Something you choose every damn day."

Silence fell between them again, heavier than before.

Lillian’s mind raced. If love was a choice, then maybe—just maybe—she wasn’t doomed after all.
###Chapter 53 I don't have time to date

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains, painting delicate patterns across the bed where Lillian lay. She stretched lazily, her muscles still humming from the previous night’s events. The scent of Sebastian still lingered on her skin, a comforting reminder of their bond.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. Beatrice’s name flashed across the screen.

"You’re alive! I was starting to think Sebastian had kidnapped you for good."

Lillian rolled her eyes but couldn’t suppress a smile. "Very funny. I was just… busy."

"Busy? Oh, I bet you were."

She ignored the teasing and sat up, glancing around the lavish bedroom. The sheets were silk, the furniture dark mahogany—everything screamed wealth and power. It still felt surreal that this was her life now.

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," she called.

The door creaked open, and Oliver peeked inside, his bright eyes filled with mischief. "Morning, Lillian! Dad says breakfast is ready."

She grinned. "Tell him I’ll be right down."

Oliver nodded before darting off, his footsteps light against the hardwood floor.

Lillian sighed, running a hand through her tangled hair. She had barely slept, her mind racing with everything that had happened—Sebastian’s confession, their kiss, the way he had looked at her like she was the only thing that mattered.

But doubt still gnawed at her.

She wasn’t just some ordinary girl anymore. She was the mate of a Lycan chairman, a man with enemies, responsibilities, and a past that still haunted him. Could she really handle this?

Her phone buzzed again.

"Don’t overthink it," Beatrice’s message read. "You deserve this. Now go eat breakfast before I come over and drag you out myself."

Lillian chuckled. Leave it to Beatrice to keep her grounded.

She slipped out of bed and headed for the ensuite bathroom, determined to push her worries aside—for now.

But as she splashed cold water on her face, a chilling thought crossed her mind.

Sebastian might have claimed her, but Donovan wasn’t the type to let go so easily.

And neither was Evelyn.

The game was far from over.
"Why do you ask?" Sebastian Blackwood countered, his piercing gaze narrowing in Victoria's direction.

She sucked her bottom lip between her teeth, nibbling gently as she weighed her response.

Truthfully, she wasn’t entirely sure why she needed to know. Perhaps to convince herself that the mate bond wasn’t absolute. She and Donovan weren’t fated mates—but if either of them ever found their true match, would they still choose each other? Or would instinct override everything? The thought sent a chill down Victoria’s spine. She’d be lying if she claimed she wasn’t terrified of Donovan one day meeting his destined mate and walking away without a second glance.

She needed to know if the bond could be resisted. If someone as formidable as Sebastian Blackwood couldn’t defy it, what hope did the rest of them have?

"I suppose I’m just trying to understand how the mate bond works," she murmured, twisting her fingers nervously.

He exhaled deeply, leaning back against the plush couch as he considered her question.

"The bond is… overwhelming," he admitted. "The most powerful force you’ll ever experience. You think you’re in control, but you’re not. It’s your wolf that takes command. They make distance unbearable. And yet, there’s a part of you that wants to surrender. The craving becomes so intense it borders on agony. Fighting it only brings misery—to you and your wolf."

"Did you try to fight it?" she pressed.

A shadow crossed his features. "I was young," he murmured. "I didn’t understand the pull—the depth of it. It was… confusing. Part of me resisted, yes. But your mother had a way of drawing me out. And then… she gave me the greatest gift I could have ever received."

Victoria tilted her head. "What was that?"

Sebastian wrapped an arm around her, pulling her into a rare embrace.

"You," he answered simply.

A soft smile curved her lips as she looked up at him.

"So you did love her," she said quietly—not a question this time, but a statement. Still, Sebastian answered.

"Yes," he confirmed, the ghost of a smile touching his mouth. "When she died… it nearly destroyed me."

Victoria hesitated before voicing her next thought. "Is that why you don’t date?"

His brows lifted in surprise. "I do date."

She scoffed. "Not seriously. It’s always fleeting—never anything real."

"I don't have time to date," Sebastian told her, his voice firm yet weary. "Running a pack, fulfilling duties, and raising Oliver take up all my energy."

"I'm not a child anymore, Dad," Victoria reminded him, nudging his arm playfully. "And Oliver doesn’t need you hovering over him constantly. We both want you to be happy—even if that means dating someone younger." She bit her lip, the unspoken suggestion hanging between them.

Sebastian frowned. "Someone younger?" His piercing gaze remained fixed on her profile.

She shrugged, feigning nonchalance. "We just want you to be happy... with whoever you choose. We don’t want you to be lonely."

"You’ve given this a lot of thought, haven’t you?" he asked, his tone dry.

A small smile tugged at her lips, but she didn’t deny it.

"I’m heading to bed now. I doubt Donovan will call tonight," she said, standing abruptly. The ache in her voice was unmistakable. "Good night, Dad. Thanks for the talk."

Sebastian said nothing, merely nodding as she left the room. His thoughts drifted to Lillian—how she must be suffering through her own mate bond. He knew the bond was unbreakable, a force beyond control. To endure the knowledge that her fated mate was marrying another woman... He wondered if she was strong enough to survive such torment.

"Is there anything you require before I retire for the night?" one of the maids asked, stepping into the room.

Sebastian exhaled and rose to his feet. "No, you’re dismissed," he said, moving past her.

"I quite liked Miss Dumont," the maid ventured before he could leave. "She suits this household well, don’t you think?"

Sebastian didn’t respond. He strode out of the living room without a backward glance.

###Chapter 54 Lillian's POV

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the lavish bedroom as Lillian stirred beneath silk sheets. Her fingers brushed against the empty space beside her—Sebastian had already left for his early meeting. A faint trace of his cedarwood scent lingered on the pillow, making her heart flutter.

Downstairs, the mansion buzzed with activity. Giselle, the head maid, directed staff with quiet efficiency while Lucien, the flirtatious head chef, whistled as he prepared breakfast. The aroma of freshly baked croissants and rich coffee filled the air.

Lillian dressed quickly, opting for a simple yet elegant navy-blue dress. As she descended the grand staircase, she spotted Oliver in the foyer, his small hands clutching a sketchbook.

"Morning, sweetheart," she greeted, ruffling his hair. "What are you drawing?"

Oliver beamed. "A surprise for Papa!" He flipped the book to reveal a rough sketch of their family—Sebastian towering protectively beside Lillian, Oliver grinning between them, and even Victoria in the corner, though her expression was less than enthusiastic.

Lillian’s chest tightened. Family. The word still felt foreign yet achingly precious.

Her phone buzzed—a message from Beatrice:
"Emergency gossip session. Café Noir. 10 AM. DON’T be late."

Lillian chuckled. Beatrice’s "emergencies" usually involved campus drama or new crushes. Still, she texted back: "On my way."

The café was bustling when she arrived. Beatrice waved from their usual corner booth, her auburn curls bouncing. "Finally! I’ve been dying to tell you—" She froze, eyes widening. "Oh no. She’s here."

Lillian followed her gaze. Cassandra, her rival, sauntered in with a group of snickering friends. Their eyes met, and Cassandra smirked before deliberately brushing past Lillian’s chair, nearly spilling her latte.

"Oops," Cassandra drawled. "Clumsy me."

Beatrice’s grip on her cup turned white-knuckled. "I swear, one more ‘accident,’ and I’ll—"

Lillian placed a calming hand on hers. "Ignore her. What’s your news?"

Beatrice leaned in, lowering her voice. "Rumor has it Donovan and Evelyn are already having problems. Apparently, he’s been sneaking out at night."

Lillian’s stomach twisted. Donovan, her ex-fated mate, had chosen Evelyn, but his restless behavior didn’t surprise her. He’d always been impulsive.

Before she could respond, her phone rang—Sebastian’s name flashed on the screen.

"Lillian," his deep voice was tense. "We need you at the packhouse. Now."

Her pulse spiked. "What’s wrong?"

A pause. Then, grimly: "Victoria’s gone."

The packhouse was in chaos when Lillian arrived. Sebastian stood at the center, his alpha aura crackling with barely restrained fury. Marcus, his beta, was barking orders to warriors.

Sebastian’s gaze snapped to her. "She left a note. Said she couldn’t ‘live under your shadow.’" His jaw clenched. "She took Julian’s car."

Lillian’s mind raced. Victoria had always resented her, but this? "Where would she go?"

Sebastian’s eyes darkened. "To the one person reckless enough to help her defy me."

The unspoken name hung between them like a storm cloud: Donovan.

Meanwhile, in a dimly lit motel room, Victoria scowled at her phone. Donovan’s last text read: "Stay put. I’m handling it."

She tossed the phone onto the bed. "Useless," she muttered.

The door creaked open. But it wasn’t Donovan who stepped inside.

Evelyn’s smile was razor-sharp. "Hello, little runaway."

Victoria’s blood turned to ice.

Evelyn held up a syringe. "Donovan sends his regrets."

The house was eerily silent when I returned from dinner at Sebastian's mansion. These days, silence had become its permanent resident.

With my mother locked away in her room, the emptiness pressed down on me like a weight. I hung my coat on the hook and climbed the stairs, pausing outside her door. No light seeped from beneath it. I wasn’t even sure if she was awake—but I had to see her. I had to know she was still breathing.

The door creaked as I pushed it open, the stale air thick with neglect. My stomach twisted at the sight of the unmade bed, the untouched meals, the suffocating darkness.

"Mom?" My voice cracked as I flicked on the light.

She lay motionless, her frail body barely making an impression on the mattress. Panic clawed at my throat as I rushed forward, pressing my hand to her back. Relief flooded me when I felt the faint rise and fall of her breathing.

"Mom," I whispered, shaking her gently. "Have you eaten anything today?"

The plate from this morning sat untouched on the nightstand, the food congealed and cold.

She lifted her head, blinking sluggishly. "Oh... Lillian. When did you get home?"

"A while ago," I murmured, swallowing the lump in my throat. "You can’t keep doing this. You haven’t left this room in days. You need to eat."

"Not hungry," she mumbled, sinking back into the pillows.

I dragged a hand through my hair, frustration and fear warring inside me. "You have to, Mom. Dad wouldn’t want this for you."

At the mention of my father, she flinched. Then, her dull eyes sharpened slightly. "You saw him?"

I nodded. "He’s... okay." The lie tasted bitter. I couldn’t tell her about the bruises, the hollow look in his eyes. "Please, just come downstairs. Eat something with me."

For a long moment, she didn’t move. Then, with a sigh, she let me help her up. She clung to my arm like a ghost, her steps unsteady as we descended the stairs.

The kitchen felt like a battlefield. I moved mechanically, pulling out pasta, sauce, frozen meatballs—anything quick, anything easy. My mind was a storm of worry, of helplessness.

My mother was fading. Her wolf was shutting down. The thought made my vision blur.

I grabbed the orange juice from the fridge, hands trembling. The bottle slipped, crashing to the floor in a sticky, neon explosion.

And just like that, I shattered.

Tears spilled over as I sank to my knees, the mess around me a perfect mirror of the chaos inside.

"Damn it, Lillian."

The voice snapped my head up. Donovan stood in the doorway, his expression unreadable.

He didn’t wait for an answer. In two strides, he hauled me to my feet, then grabbed a towel and started cleaning without a word.

I wiped my face, watching in stunned silence as he mopped up the juice, poured a fresh glass, and shoved it into my hands.

"What are you doing here?" My voice was raw.

His gaze flicked to mine, sharp and assessing. "Saving you from drowning in orange juice, apparently."

I huffed, but the fight had drained out of me.

He saw right through it.

###Chapter 55 The Stolen Kiss

The evening air was thick with tension as Lillian stood frozen in the dimly lit hallway of the Blackwood estate. Her heart hammered against her ribs, the sound deafening in the silence.

Sebastian's towering frame loomed before her, his golden eyes burning with an intensity that sent shivers down her spine. The scent of his cologne—dark cedar and something distinctly him—wrapped around her like an intoxicating spell.

"You shouldn't be here," he murmured, his voice rough.

Lillian swallowed hard. "I—I was just leaving."

A beat passed. Then another.

Before she could react, Sebastian closed the distance between them in one swift motion. His fingers tangled in her hair, tilting her head back as his lips crashed against hers.

The kiss was fire and desperation, a collision of pent-up longing and unspoken words. Lillian's hands fisted in his shirt, her body arching instinctively toward his.

Then—

A sharp gasp echoed from the doorway.

They broke apart, breathless, to find Evelyn standing there, her face twisted in fury.

"You," she hissed, venom dripping from the word.

Lillian's stomach dropped.

Sebastian stepped in front of her, shielding her from Evelyn's glare. "Leave, Evelyn."

Evelyn's lips curled into a sneer. "Oh, I will. But this isn't over."

As she stormed off, Lillian's pulse raced.

One stolen kiss.

And everything had just changed.

"I've known you long enough, Lillian. You can't lie to me."

"What do you want me to say, Donovan? That I'm fine? That my mother barely eats and cries herself to sleep every night? Isn’t this exactly what you wanted? For us to suffer? So why pretend to care now when we both know you don’t!"

"Lillian!" My mother gasped from the doorway, her eyes wide with shock. "How dare you speak to him like that!"

"Mom—"

"He will be our Alpha one day, and he deserves respect," she scolded, her voice trembling.

"It's alright, Mrs. Dumont," Donovan said smoothly. "Why don’t you rest on the couch? I’ll make dinner for you."

My mother’s face softened—the first genuine smile I’d seen from her in weeks. Donovan always had that effect on her.

"How kind of you, Donovan," she murmured sweetly. "Thank you." She shot me a warning glance before leaving the kitchen.

I whirled around to face him, my arms crossed.

"What game are you playing?" I demanded, my voice flat.

"Believe it or not, I actually care about your mother. It’s painful seeing her like this. And you—you look exhausted. Go sit with her. I’ll cook, and then we’ll talk."

I studied him, searching for any hint of deception, but my mind was too drained to decipher his motives. With a sigh, I walked out, not bothering to tell him I’d already eaten. The last thing I needed was his interrogation.

My mother was curled up on the sofa, clutching a photo of my father, her cheeks wet with tears. I sat beside her, startling her.

"Why won’t you just do what he asks?" she whispered, catching me off guard. "We could have your father back."

I stared at her in disbelief. If only she knew what he truly wanted from me.

"We don’t need his help, Mom," I repeated for what felt like the hundredth time. "I’ve got this."

"How?" Her voice cracked. "That tutoring job barely covers rent, let alone your father’s debts. We need him, Lillian."

I took her hands in mine, squeezing gently. "He’ll come home," I promised. "I swear it."

Before long, the rich aroma of garlic and herbs filled the air. Pasta? Had Donovan actually cooked?

He didn't have to go through all this trouble. All I wanted was for my mother to have something in her stomach. As for me? I wasn’t hungry—Sebastian had already stuffed me full at his place.

Moments later, Donovan strode into the living room balancing two plates. He passed one to me, which I set aside on the coffee table, then handed the other to my mother. My suspicions were confirmed the second I caught sight of the rich, aromatic meat sauce glistening over perfectly al dente pasta.

"You really didn’t have to do all this," I said, gesturing at the meal. "Store-bought sauce would’ve been fine."

He scoffed, rolling his eyes. "I wouldn’t serve that garbage to a stray mutt."

My mother hesitated, her fingers hovering over the fork. "I’m not sure I can eat right now," she admitted softly, her gaze lingering on the plate like it was a distant memory rather than food.

Donovan lowered himself onto the armchair across from her, his voice gentle but insistent. "Please try," he murmured. "It would mean everything to me if you took just one bite."

###Chapter 56 Lillian's POV


The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the campus quad. Her fingers tightened around the strap of her backpack, the weight of her textbooks grounding her. She had barely slept last night, her mind replaying the confrontation with Donovan in the library. The way his new mate, Evelyn, had smirked at her still burned in her memory.

Beatrice caught up with her, breathless. "You look like you've been wrestling with a ghost," she teased, nudging Lillian's shoulder.

Lillian forced a smile. "Just tired."

Beatrice's expression softened. "Don't let them get to you. Donovan's an idiot, and Evelyn's just—"

"Pathetic?" Lillian supplied dryly.

"Exactly." Beatrice grinned. "Besides, you have bigger things to worry about. Like Professor Sinclair's pop quiz today."

Lillian groaned. "I completely forgot."

As they hurried toward the lecture hall, Lillian's phone buzzed. A message from Sebastian Blackwood lit up the screen:

"Meet me at the pack house after your last class. We need to talk."

Her pulse quickened. Sebastian had been distant since the incident at the gala, his usual warmth replaced with clipped words and guarded glances. She couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong.

The pack house loomed ahead, its grand facade bathed in the golden light of sunset. Lillian hesitated at the gate, her stomach twisting into knots. She hadn't seen Oliver since he'd stormed out of the dining room last week, furious over her refusal to attend his school play.

Theodore Whitmore greeted her at the door, his usual composed demeanor tinged with unease. "Miss Lillian," he said quietly. "Alpha Blackwood is waiting for you in his study."

She nodded, her throat tight. The house felt eerily silent, the usual hum of activity absent. Even Giselle, the head maid, was nowhere in sight.

Sebastian stood by the window when she entered, his broad shoulders tense. He turned, his piercing gaze locking onto hers. "Sit down."

Lillian obeyed, her fingers curling into the arms of the chair. "What's going on?"

He exhaled sharply. "There's been a development with the Winslows."

Her breath hitched. The Winslows—Donovan's family—had been silent since their failed attempt to pressure her into breaking the mate bond.

Sebastian continued, his voice low. "Reginald Winslow has been making moves against my business interests. And Donovan..." He paused, jaw tightening. "He's been spreading rumors about you."

Lillian's nails dug into the leather. "What kind of rumors?"

"That you're unstable. That you manipulated the mate bond to trap me." His eyes darkened. "He's trying to discredit you before the council."

The room spun. If the council believed Donovan, they could dissolve her bond with Sebastian—or worse, declare her a rogue.

Sebastian stepped closer, his hand brushing hers. "I won't let that happen."

She wanted to believe him. But the doubt in his eyes told her even he wasn't sure they could win this fight.

That night, Lillian lay awake, staring at the ceiling. The Winslows had power, connections. And she was just a college student with a fractured past.

Her phone buzzed again. An unknown number.

"Meet me tomorrow. Midnight. The old oak near the eastern border. Come alone."

Her heart pounded. Who—?

Then, a second message:

"I know what really happened the night your mother disappeared."

The screen blurred as tears welled in her eyes.

This wasn't just about the bond anymore.

Someone was playing a dangerous game.

And she was the pawn.

"Return the favor?" My voice trembled as my stomach twisted into knots. "What do you mean?"

Donovan straightened, his posture rigid, the warmth from earlier vanishing like smoke. His icy glare sent shivers through me. Instinctively, I stepped back, putting distance between us.

"You know exactly what I mean, Lillian," he said, his brows knitting together. "I want you as my mistress. Do this for me, and I’ll ensure your mother’s safety and have your father back by dawn."

My heart shattered. This was the man I had once loved more than life itself. The man I would have done anything for. Now, staring into his cold, unfamiliar eyes, I saw only a stranger. His lips pressed into a thin, cruel line.

No matter how many times he said it, I couldn’t believe it. He wanted me—his fated mate—to be his dirty little secret while he married another woman. A woman who didn’t deserve this. Victoria was kind, gentle, and clearly adored Donovan. The thought of her loving my mate twisted my insides, but I understood. The heart wants what it wants. And hers wanted him.

"How can you ask this of me?" My whisper barely carried. "Did those two years mean nothing to you?"

For a fleeting second, his expression softened.

"Of course they did," he murmured, closing the gap between us. "That’s why I can’t let you go. You’re mine, Lillian. My mate. And I’ll have you—one way or another. Wouldn’t you rather be with me in secret than not at all?" His voice dropped. "Think of your wolf. Do you want to end up like your mother?"

My wolf had been eerily silent this entire time, but I felt her pain, her conflict. She didn’t want to be his mistress—but she also couldn’t bear to let him go.

"And your wolf is fine with this?" I challenged, narrowing my eyes. "Making his mate a mistress?"

Donovan shrugged, unfazed.

"He understands what must be done. That’s what makes an Alpha."

"You’re not an Alpha yet," I muttered.

"I have the blood. The instincts. And soon, thanks to Victoria, I’ll have the title."

I scoffed. "You disgust me."

A smirk curled his lips as he took another step, nearly pressing against me. Exhaustion weighed me down, his words like chains dragging me into the dirt.

The only thing left was the bitter taste of betrayal.

All I could do was stand frozen in place, my gaze locked onto his towering figure as I fought back the tears threatening to spill.

"We've always been perfect together, Lillian. Don't ruin us just because you're too stubborn to see what must be done," Donovan murmured, his voice dangerously low as he lifted a hand to brush his fingers against my cheek.

The moment his skin grazed mine, it felt like acid searing through my flesh. I jerked away from him, my eyes blazing with fury. How dare he put me in this position? Using my mother's suffering as leverage to manipulate me—it was despicable. I would never forgive him for what he'd done to me and my family.

My fists clenched at my sides as I took a deliberate step back, putting distance between us.

"Don't you dare touch me," I hissed through gritted teeth. "You lost that right the moment you betrayed me!"

"You belong to me, Lillian!" he snarled, lunging forward to seize my wrist, but I twisted away before he could make contact.

"Correction—I used to belong to you," I spat. "You forfeited every claim the second you chose another woman. The second you got down on one knee and proposed to her right in front of me. You didn’t even have the decency to tell me, Donovan. You let me find out in the worst possible way, and I will never forget that. Not just what you did to me—but to my family. I may not have proof, but I know you had a hand in my father’s business collapsing."

A smug smirk curled his lips as he crossed his arms over his chest.

"Exactly—you can’t prove it," he taunted, his voice dripping with arrogance. "It’s your word against mine. And guess who everyone will believe?"

Just then, his phone buzzed insistently in his pocket. It wasn’t the first time tonight—whoever was calling clearly wasn’t giving up.

With an irritated sigh, he yanked the phone out, scowling at the screen. I half-expected him to finally answer, given how persistent the caller was.

But he didn’t.

And that silence between us felt heavier than ever.

###Chapter 57 The Moon's Whisper

The night air was thick with tension as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse. The city lights glittered below, but her mind was far from peaceful. The weight of Donovan’s betrayal still clung to her like a shadow, refusing to fade despite the weeks that had passed.

She exhaled sharply, her breath forming a mist in the chilly air. Why did he have to choose Evelyn? The question gnawed at her, relentless.

Behind her, the glass doors slid open with a soft whisper. She didn’t need to turn to know who it was—Sebastian’s presence was unmistakable, his aura wrapping around her like a warm embrace.

“You should be inside,” he murmured, his deep voice laced with concern. “It’s freezing out here.”

Lillian crossed her arms, hugging herself. “I needed air.”

Sebastian stepped beside her, his broad frame blocking the wind. “Thinking about him again?”

She clenched her jaw. “I wish I could stop.”

A low growl rumbled in his chest, but he didn’t press further. Instead, he reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a small velvet box.

Lillian’s breath hitched. What is this?

Sebastian flipped it open, revealing a delicate silver pendant shaped like a crescent moon. “For you.”

Her fingers trembled as she reached for it. “Why?”

His golden eyes burned with intensity. “Because you deserve more than memories of a man who didn’t see your worth.”

The sincerity in his voice sent a shiver down her spine. Before she could respond, her phone buzzed violently in her pocket.

Beatrice’s name flashed on the screen, followed by a frantic message:

“Lil, you need to see this. NOW.”

Attached was a photo—Donovan and Evelyn, locked in a heated embrace outside a high-end restaurant. The timestamp? Tonight.

Lillian’s grip on the pendant tightened.

Sebastian’s gaze darkened as he took in the image. “That bastard.”

A bitter laugh escaped her lips. “Guess some things never change.”

But then Sebastian’s hand cupped her chin, forcing her to meet his eyes. “You have.”

The conviction in his voice was undeniable. And for the first time in weeks, Lillian felt something shift inside her.

Maybe it was time to stop looking back.

Maybe it was time to embrace the moon’s whisper—and the man standing beside her.

The phone kept ringing insistently in his pocket, but Donovan didn’t answer. Instead, he shoved it back, letting the call go to voicemail. The ringing stopped, and my frown deepened.

"Why are you ignoring them?" I demanded, crossing my arms.

"Not your business," he muttered, his dark eyes flashing with something unreadable.

Then, realization hit me like a punch to the gut.

"Was it Victoria?" I asked, my voice tight. "Has she been trying to reach you, Donovan?"

"I said," he repeated slowly, his tone dangerously low, "it’s not your concern."

But I knew I was right. Victoria had mentioned earlier that Donovan was supposed to be in a meeting, and she’d been upset that he hadn’t made time for her tonight. Had he been dodging her calls all evening just to be here with me? He was already turning into that kind of man—the kind who played games with women’s hearts. And I hadn’t even agreed to be his mistress. The thought made me sick.

"You should leave," I snapped, turning away from him, my arms folded tightly over my chest. "Wouldn’t want to keep your precious Victoria waiting. She might lose interest, and then where would you be?"

He moved behind me, so close I could feel the heat of his breath against the back of my neck.

"You think we’re so different, Lillian," he murmured, his voice dripping with dark amusement. "But we’re exactly the same."

I stiffened, not understanding where he was going with this. I didn’t turn around.

"I’m marrying Victoria to get what I want," he continued, his words deliberate. "And you? You spread your legs for Sebastian to get what you want."

My face drained of color.

"It’s not like that," I whispered, my voice trembling.

"Don’t lie to me," he snarled, his hands gripping my hips hard enough to bruise. "I know what you’re doing. So why not spread them for me and get what you really want?"

I felt the hard press of him against me and jerked away, whirling around to face him, my eyes burning with unshed tears.

"Get. Out."

He laughed, low and dark.

"Sebastian will tire of you eventually," he said, his smirk cruel. "And when he does, you’ll have nothing. No job. No one. I’ll make sure of it. And when that happens, you’ll come crawling to me."

"Get out of my house," I repeated, louder this time, my voice shaking with fury.

He turned away, still chuckling as he shook his head.

"You’ll see, Lillian. I always get what I want. And what I want is you—in the house I bought for you by the end of the week. My patience isn’t infinite."

"GET OUT!" I screamed, not caring if I woke Beatrice. Hot tears spilled down my cheeks as I shoved him toward the door. He barely flinched but finally stepped out, pausing on the threshold to glance back at me.

"I’ll see you soon, mate," he said, smirking before disappearing into the night.

The moment the door closed, I collapsed against it, my stomach twisting in despair.

Third Person POV

Donovan was furious. How could Lillian be so blind? Didn’t she understand that being his mistress was the only way to keep their wolves from tearing each other apart? She was still his mate, and he wasn’t about to let her go—not even for Victoria.

He was only marrying Victoria for the Alpha title. He’d fulfill his duties—sleep with her, maybe even have children—but she could never satisfy his wolf the way Lillian could. Their bond was real. And no matter how many times he marked Victoria, the pull he felt toward Lillian would never fade.

The mark he’d left on Lillian’s neck was still there, faint but undeniable. The thought pleased him. She could still feel him.

As he slid into his car, he pulled out his phone. Missed calls and texts from Victoria lit up the screen. He was supposed to have called her after his meeting, but he’d been too focused on getting to Lillian, on making her submit.

He ignored them all.

Instead, he dialed his subordinate.

"Boss," the man answered immediately, having been waiting for this call.

"Move to the next phase," Donovan ordered, his voice cold. "It’s time Lillian learned just how much she needs me."

###Chapter 58 He's my fiancé,

The morning sun filtered through the heavy drapes of Lillian's bedroom, casting golden streaks across the silk sheets. She stirred awake, her body still humming with the afterglow of last night's passionate encounter with Sebastian. The memory sent delicious shivers down her spine.

"Morning, little wolf," Sebastian's deep voice rumbled beside her, his fingers tracing lazy circles on her bare shoulder. "Sleep well?"

Lillian turned to face him, her cheeks flushing at the intensity in his dark eyes. "Better than ever," she murmured, leaning in to brush her lips against his.

Their moment was interrupted by a sharp knock at the door. "Alpha Blackwood?" Theodore's voice carried through the wood. "You're needed downstairs immediately. There's been... an incident."

Sebastian's entire demeanor changed in an instant. The playful lover vanished, replaced by the formidable Lycan chairman. "What kind of incident?" he demanded, already reaching for his robe.

Lillian sat up straighter, clutching the sheets to her chest. She could hear the tension in Theodore's voice when he responded, "It's about Miss Victoria. She's returned... with company."

The blood drained from Sebastian's face. Without another word, he strode to the door, pausing only to glance back at Lillian. "Stay here," he ordered. "I'll send for you when it's safe."

But Lillian was already scrambling out of bed the moment the door closed behind him. Safe? What could possibly make her unsafe in Sebastian's own home? She dressed quickly in the first outfit she found - a simple blouse and jeans from the wardrobe Sebastian had filled for her.

As she crept down the grand staircase, the sound of raised voices grew louder. She recognized Sebastian's commanding tone immediately, but the other voice...

Her heart stopped.

Donovan.

He was here. In the mansion. With his new mate Evelyn.

Lillian's wolf bristled beneath her skin, the betrayal still fresh despite the months that had passed. She pressed herself against the wall, straining to hear the conversation in the foyer below.

"...how dare you bring him here after what he did?" Sebastian was snarling.

Victoria's response was icy. "He's my fiancé, Father. Where else would he be?"

"Not under my roof," Sebastian growled. "Not after he abandoned his true mate."

Lillian's breath caught. He was defending her. Even now, when it would be easier to pretend she didn't exist, Sebastian was standing up for her against his own daughter.

She took a deep breath and stepped into view. All eyes snapped to her as she descended the final steps.

The silence was deafening.

Donovan looked like he'd seen a ghost. "Lillian?" His voice cracked on her name.

Evelyn's grip on his arm tightened possessively. "Well, well," she purred. "If it isn't the little werewolf who couldn't keep her mate."

Sebastian moved like lightning, positioning himself between Lillian and the others. "One more word," he warned, his voice deadly quiet, "and I'll have you both thrown out on your asses."

Victoria gasped. "Father! You can't—"

"I can and I will," he cut her off. "This is my house, and I decide who's welcome here." His gaze locked onto Donovan. "You made your choice months ago. Now live with it."

Lillian placed a trembling hand on Sebastian's arm. "It's okay," she whispered. "I can handle this."

But as she met Donovan's shocked gaze, she realized with sudden clarity that she didn't have to handle anything. Not anymore. She had Sebastian now. She had a real mate who cherished her, protected her, fought for her.

And that knowledge gave her strength she never knew she possessed.

"That absolute bastard!" Beatrice gasped as we stood in line at the campus café, waiting to place our orders. "I can't believe he had the audacity to pull that stunt last night. And to drag your mother into it?"

It was the morning after Donovan had shown up unannounced, and I had just finished recounting the whole humiliating ordeal to Beatrice. I was still reeling from the fact that Donovan had the nerve to show up at my house and care for my mother—as if that would somehow make me agree to become his mistress. The thought made my skin crawl, but beneath the disgust, a pang of guilt gnawed at me. Victoria didn’t deserve this, even if she was blissfully unaware.

"I told him to get out," I finished with a shrug, trying to sound indifferent.

"What can I get for you two this morning?" Gabrielle, the barista, asked with a warm smile. Gabrielle was in a few of my classes and had a reputation for being a fierce sparring partner. We’d trained together a couple of times, and she always made my coffee just right.

"Just a vanilla cappuccino," I said.

"Make that two," Beatrice chimed in, pulling out her wallet.

I shook my head and reached for mine. "I’ve got it. You paid last time."

Gabrielle swiped my card and handed it back with a nod. "Coming right up."

As she turned to prepare our drinks, Beatrice leaned in, lowering her voice. "So, what are you going to do about Donovan?"

I frowned. "What can I do? He doesn’t take no for an answer. The only thing I can focus on is working hard enough to pay off my father’s debt."

"Are you going to tell Victoria what her fiancé is up to?" Beatrice arched a brow.

I hesitated, then shook my head. It wasn’t my place. Sebastian had made it crystal clear—he didn’t want anything jeopardizing this marriage. If I was the reason his daughter got hurt, I’d lose my job, and worse, his trust.

"It’s not my business, and I don’t want to get involved," I said firmly.

"Your cappuccinos are ready," Gabrielle announced, sliding two steaming cups toward us.

"Thanks," I said, handing one to Beatrice. "See you in class."

Gabrielle waved as we stepped out of the café and onto the sunlit campus path. Beatrice didn’t press further about last night or whether I should expose Donovan. As far as she knew, Victoria was just another high-profile name to me—someone from the notoriously private Blackwood family.

The Landrys—no, the Blackwoods—were always shrouded in secrecy. Victoria might have been in the public eye, but no one really knew her. And right now, that distance suited me just fine.


To have friends or navigate through the packs—Victoria Blackwood was an enigma to those outside her family, and that only made her more fascinating.

If Beatrice knew that I was actually acquainted with Victoria and growing closer to her, she would demand to know how I'd befriended the infamous Victoria Blackwood. I'd have to confess everything, which would violate my contract and cost me my job. I needed to cling to this position as if my life depended on it... because, in a way, it did. And my father's life depended on it too.

"I still have thirty minutes before class starts. Want to stop by the lounge for a bit?" I asked as we approached the university buildings.

"Sure," Beatrice agreed.

We stepped into the bustling lounge, where students usually gathered before morning lectures. But today, something felt off. Whispers slithered through the air like venomous snakes, hushed voices weaving a web of gossip.

The moment we entered, eyes flicked in my direction. My frown deepened as the murmurs swelled, sharpening into unmistakable accusations.

What had I done?

"That's the one who got Cassandra expelled," someone hissed.

"Can you believe she has the audacity to walk in here like nothing happened?"

"After what she pulled, she should be ashamed!"

Heat flared across my cheeks. I glanced at Beatrice, whose expression darkened as she surveyed the room.

"What's going on?" I asked under my breath.

"Cassandra was expelled," she answered, raising her voice deliberately. "And clearly, everyone's blaming you for it, even though it wasn't your fault!"

We pushed through the crowd toward our usual table by the window, but Cassandra's friends blocked our path, arms crossed, lips curled in disdain.

"How dare you show your face here after what you did?" one of them sneered. "Cassandra worked her ass off for that scholarship, and you stole it from her!"

I turned to face them, my gaze sharp.

"She cheated," I bit out. "She didn't earn anything. Someone else did the work for her."

"And you've been lying to everyone, pretending to be some poor, helpless girl," another spat.

The accusation stung, but I refused to back down.

###Chapter 59 Think whatever you like

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains of Lillian's bedroom, casting a golden glow over the room. She stretched lazily, her muscles still sore from yesterday's intense training session with Professor Montclair. A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Lillian? Are you awake?" Beatrice's voice was muffled through the wood.

Lillian groaned, rubbing her eyes. "Yeah, come in."

Beatrice pushed the door open, already dressed in her usual stylish ensemble—a fitted blouse and high-waisted jeans. "You look like you wrestled a bear," she teased, plopping onto the edge of Lillian's bed.

"Close enough," Lillian muttered, sitting up. "Combat training was brutal yesterday. Odette nearly dislocated my shoulder."

Beatrice winced. "Ouch. Well, at least you survived. You’ve got that pack meeting with Sebastian later, right?"

Lillian's stomach twisted at the reminder. "Yeah. I still don’t know why he wants me there. It’s not like I’m officially part of his pack yet."

Beatrice smirked. "Maybe he just likes having you around."

Lillian threw a pillow at her, but Beatrice dodged it effortlessly.

"Seriously, though," Beatrice continued, her tone turning serious, "you should be careful. Donovan’s been sniffing around again. Evelyn told me he’s been asking about you."

Lillian’s fingers clenched around the sheets. "What does he want now?"

"Who knows? But it can’t be good." Beatrice sighed. "Just… be on guard, okay?"

Lillian nodded, though unease settled in her chest. She had hoped Donovan would leave her alone after everything, but apparently, he wasn’t done making her life difficult.

The Blackwood pack house was bustling when Lillian arrived. Gamma warriors moved with purpose, their sharp eyes scanning for threats. Theodore, Sebastian’s butler, greeted her at the door with a polite nod.

"Miss Lillian, Alpha Blackwood is waiting for you in his study."

Lillian swallowed hard. "Thanks, Theodore."

She followed him through the grand halls, her heart pounding. The last time she’d been in Sebastian’s study, things had gotten… complicated.

Sebastian was seated behind his desk when she entered, his piercing gaze locking onto hers. "Lillian. You’re late."

She bristled. "I didn’t realize there was a set time."

A ghost of a smirk played on his lips. "There wasn’t. I just enjoy watching you get flustered."

Lillian rolled her eyes, but the tension in her shoulders eased slightly. "What’s this meeting about?"

Sebastian leaned back in his chair, his expression turning serious. "We have a problem. Alpha Maximilian Voss is making moves against us."

Lillian frowned. "The Darkmoon pack? What does he want?"

"Power. Territory. The usual." Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "But he’s targeting you specifically."

Lillian’s blood ran cold. "Me? Why?"

"Because you’re connected to me," Sebastian said simply. "And because he knows you’re strong. He wants to break you to weaken my position."

Lillian clenched her fists. "I won’t let him."

Sebastian’s eyes darkened. "Good. Because I won’t either."

For a moment, the air between them crackled with unspoken tension. Then, just as quickly, Sebastian broke the spell, standing abruptly. "We leave for the border tonight. Be ready."

Lillian nodded, determination settling over her. Whatever Alpha Voss had planned, she wouldn’t go down without a fight.

But as she turned to leave, Sebastian’s voice stopped her.

"Oh, and Lillian?"

She glanced back.

"Don’t even think about going alone."

She smirked. "Wouldn’t dream of it."

The door clicked shut behind her, leaving Sebastian alone with his thoughts—and the growing certainty that this battle would change everything.

"Think whatever you like," I muttered under my breath. "I don’t owe you any explanations."

Beatrice crossed her arms, her gaze sharp. "Maybe you should be more concerned about your own problems."

"Just drop it, Bea," I said, shaking my head. "I’m heading to class. See you later." Without waiting for a reply, I turned on my heel and walked away.

Even the lecture hall felt off—everyone’s eyes followed me, whispers trailing in my wake. Professor Pembroke handed out assignments, her gaze lingering on me a beat too long. When I glanced at my paper, my frown deepened.

Was it just me, or was the font different? I peeked at the girl beside me—her paper looked normal.

"Mind if I take a quick look?" I asked.

She hesitated but handed it over. The wording was different too—mine was condensed, the letters smaller, as if someone had deliberately altered it.

"Thanks," I murmured, returning it.

The class dragged on, the weight of scrutiny pressing down on me. As I packed up, Professor Pembroke stopped me.

"You did quite well today, Lillian," she said, her tone slow and deliberate, as if speaking to a child.

My brows knitted together. "Uh… thanks, Professor Pembroke."

I bolted from the room, eager to escape the condescension. My next class—Advanced Lycan Literature—was usually my sanctuary. We’d just finished our last novel and were supposed to receive a new one today.

Students filed in, each handed a book as they entered. But when I stepped forward, Professor Pembroke merely smiled.

"Lillian," she said gently, "I’ve decided to exempt you from this one. It’s quite dense, and I don’t want to overwhelm you. I’ll provide cliff notes instead."

I stared at her, disbelief knotting in my chest. "Excuse me?"

She sighed, setting the stack of books down. "It’s for the best. Some material just… isn’t suited for everyone."

Suited for everyone? Was she implying I couldn’t handle it? I clenched my jaw. Dyslexia didn’t make me incapable—just determined. And she had no right to assume otherwise.

"Take your seat, please," she said, her voice sweet but firm.

I bit back my retort and sat, simmering as the others received their books. I was the only one left empty-handed.

By the time my last class—Shifting and Combat—rolled around, my patience had worn thin. At least here, I could channel my frustration into something productive.

As I entered the training hall, I overheard Gabrielle speaking to Professor Montgomery, her voice edged with irritation.

"With all due respect, Professor, Lillian doesn’t need special treatment. She’s more than capable of handling the new drills without modifications."

Professor Montgomery—now our primary instructor since Cassandra’s expulsion—crossed his arms. "I’ll be the judge of that."

Gabrielle shot him a look. "Then judge her fairly."

I exhaled, rolling my shoulders. At least someone still saw me as competent.

Now, if only the rest of the world would catch up.

###Chapter 60 The Moon's Whisper

The night air was thick with tension as Lillian stood frozen in the dimly lit hallway of the Blackwood estate. Her heart hammered against her ribs, each beat echoing like a war drum in her ears. The scent of cedar and bergamot—Sebastian’s signature fragrance—lingered in the air, but it was undercut by something darker, something primal.

He knows.

The realization struck her like a physical blow. Sebastian had discovered her secret—the truth about her past with Donovan. She had hoped to bury it forever, but fate had other plans.

A floorboard creaked behind her.

Lillian didn’t turn. She didn’t need to. The weight of his presence pressed against her back, suffocating and electric all at once.

"Running away again, little wolf?" Sebastian’s voice was low, a velvet growl that sent shivers down her spine.

She swallowed hard, forcing steel into her voice. "I wasn’t running."

"Liar." His fingers brushed the nape of her neck, feather-light yet possessive. "You’ve been hiding from me since the moment you stepped foot in this house."

Lillian flinched. He wasn’t wrong. Every stolen glance, every carefully constructed excuse—she had been avoiding this confrontation. But now, there was nowhere left to hide.

She spun to face him, her golden eyes blazing. "What do you want from me, Sebastian?"

His lips curled into a smirk that didn’t reach his storm-gray eyes. "The truth."

A bitter laugh escaped her. "The truth? Fine. You want to know why I left Donovan? Because he sold me out to the highest bidder. Because he chose power over me." Her voice cracked. "And because I was stupid enough to believe he loved me."

Sebastian’s expression darkened. For a heartbeat, silence stretched between them, heavy with unspoken words. Then—

A crash echoed from downstairs.

They both stiffened.

"Oliver," Sebastian muttered, already moving toward the sound.

Lillian followed, her pulse racing for an entirely different reason now. The boy—his son—was in danger.

But when they reached the grand foyer, the scene before them was nothing like what she expected.

Oliver stood in the center of the room, surrounded by shattered glass. His small hands trembled as he clutched a framed photograph—one of Sebastian’s late wife, Penelope.

"Daddy," the boy whispered, tears streaking his cheeks. "I saw her. In the garden. She was crying."

Sebastian went utterly still.

Lillian’s breath caught.

Because in that moment, she understood.

This wasn’t just about her and Donovan.

This was about ghosts.

And some ghosts refused to stay buried.

How did every professor know about my dyslexia? And how in the world had the dean found out? My doctors and therapists had sworn confidentiality—no one outside my inner circle was supposed to know. I didn’t want pity or special treatment, as if I were some fragile thing incapable of keeping up. But now, my worst fear was unfolding right before me. They all knew. And worse, they thought I was the one cheating, the one who had orchestrated Cassandra’s expulsion.

The accusation burned in my chest, tightening like a vise. I couldn’t stand there any longer, listening to Gabrielle and Professor Montgomery whisper about me as if I weren’t standing just around the corner. I refused to let their assumptions ruin my favorite class—or let them believe I wasn’t capable of excelling on my own.

With my arms crossed, I stepped into view. Gabrielle’s face drained of color, her lips parting in shock. She knew. She knew I’d heard everything.

"Lillian!" she gasped, stumbling over her words. "H-how long have you been—?"

"Long enough," I cut in, my voice sharp. "Care to explain why the entire faculty knows about my dyslexia?"

Professor Montgomery stiffened, his gaze dropping to the floor. "The dean called an emergency meeting this morning. He… informed us."

My jaw clenched. "And how did he find out? That was supposed to be private."

"I don’t know," he admitted. "He didn’t say. Must’ve gotten outside information."

I stepped closer, my stare unwavering. "Let’s make one thing clear, Professor. I earned my place here. No shortcuts, no bribes—just hard work. My dyslexia doesn’t make me less capable. If anything, it pushes me to work twice as hard. I’ve made it this far without hand-holding, and I won’t let anyone treat me like I can’t handle the same material as everyone else. If you can’t teach me the way you teach the others, then maybe I should find a professor who can."

Gabrielle smirked, arms folded. "Told you," she muttered to her brother.

Professor Montgomery shifted uncomfortably, shame flickering across his face. "I… apologize, Miss Dumont. You’re right. I shouldn’t have assumed—"

The tension in the room was thick enough to slice through as I crossed my arms, my gaze unwavering. "Just because I've acquired this knowledge doesn't make me incapable. I expect my apologies to be delivered—not just to my professors, but to the dean as well. I don’t need their condescending 'help' as if I’m some helpless novice." My voice was sharp, laced with irritation.

Professor Montgomery lowered his head in reluctant agreement. "Understood," he murmured.

I exhaled sharply, unaware I’d been holding my breath until that moment. So that’s why my professors had been acting so oddly today.

Shaking off the lingering frustration, I turned my attention back to the matter at hand. "Now, what exactly were you two discussing before I arrived? Unless it was still about me," I said, glancing between them with a raised brow.

Professor Montgomery rifled through his folder before pulling out a sheet of paper. "I’m introducing a new combat maneuver today," he explained, handing it over. "These are the coordinates for the exercise I want everyone to practice."

I scanned the document quickly, my lips curving into a confident smirk. "Seems straightforward enough."

###Chapter 61 I DID IT!

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood's penthouse suite. Lillian stretched beneath the silk sheets, her werewolf senses immediately detecting the faint scent of bergamot and sandalwood that always lingered around the Lycan chairman.

She rolled over, expecting to find the space beside her empty as usual, but instead met the piercing blue gaze of Sebastian himself. He was already dressed in a tailored navy suit, his dark hair slightly damp from a recent shower.

"Good morning, little wolf," he murmured, his deep voice sending shivers down her spine. His fingers traced idle patterns along her bare shoulder. "Sleep well?"

Lillian blinked in surprise. "You're still here." The words slipped out before she could stop them.

Sebastian's lips quirked in amusement. "Disappointed?"

"No! I just..." She swallowed hard, suddenly aware of how close he was. "You're usually gone before I wake up."

His expression darkened slightly. "I had some business to attend to with Marcus. The situation with Donovan grows more complicated."

At the mention of her ex-fated mate, Lillian stiffened. The memory of Donovan's betrayal still burned fresh, especially now that he was engaged to Victoria, Sebastian's daughter.

Sebastian noticed her reaction immediately. His hand stilled on her shoulder. "I won't let him hurt you again," he vowed, his voice dropping to a growl. "Not after what he did at the gala."

Lillian remembered all too well - Donovan drugging her drink, nearly forcing the mate bond before Sebastian intervened. She shuddered at the memory.

A knock at the door interrupted them. "Sir?" Theodore's polite voice came through the wood. "Your nine o'clock appointment has arrived."

Sebastian sighed, pressing a kiss to Lillian's forehead before standing. "Duty calls. Oliver has his fencing lesson this morning - would you like to join us?"

Lillian nodded eagerly. The seven-year-old had wormed his way into her heart despite her initial reservations about Sebastian's family. "I'd love to."

As Sebastian moved toward the door, he paused. "Oh, and Lillian? Wear the blue dress from Genevieve's collection. We have... special guests arriving this afternoon."

Her brows furrowed. "Who—"

But he was already gone, leaving her with a dozen unanswered questions and a growing sense of unease. Something told her their peaceful morning was about to be shattered.

Downstairs in the grand foyer, the sound of raised voices caught her attention. Peering over the balcony, Lillian saw Victoria arguing vehemently with Sebastian, her perfect features twisted in anger.

"—can't just banish him! He's my fiancé!" Victoria's shrill voice carried up the staircase.

Sebastian's response was too low for Lillian to hear, but whatever he said made Victoria burst into tears and storm out, nearly colliding with Beatrice who was just arriving.

"Trouble in paradise?" Beatrice quipped as she bounded up the stairs toward Lillian.

Lillian sighed. "When isn't there?" She eyed her best friend's designer outfit and perfectly coiffed hair. "You're awfully dressed up for a casual visit."

Beatrice grinned. "Oh, didn't you hear? Celeste Devereaux is visiting today with Damien Laurent's film crew. The whole pack's buzzing about it." She wiggled her eyebrows. "Rumor has it Sebastian's planning something big."

Lillian's stomach dropped. The famous actress's unexpected visit, Sebastian's mysterious behavior... Pieces began clicking into place in her mind, forming a picture she wasn't sure she wanted to see.

Because if there was one thing she'd learned about Sebastian Blackwood, it was that the Lycan chairman never did anything without careful calculation. And whatever game he was playing now, she had a sinking feeling she was about to become one of the pieces on his chessboard.

The sleek black Bentley was already waiting when I stepped out of my last lecture. Of course, it would be. Frederick stood beside the car, his gloved hands clasped behind his back. As I approached, he gave a slight bow and opened the rear door with practiced ease.

I shot him a warning look.

"Frederick, you can't just park here like this," I hissed under my breath. "People will notice."

His ears turned pink as he ducked his head. "My apologies, Miss Dumont. I wasn't thinking clearly."

With a frustrated sigh, I slid into the leather seat before any curious eyes could spot me. The drive to Blackwood Manor passed in silence—the kind of heavy quiet that let me replay every awful moment of today. Someone had deliberately leaked my dyslexia to Headmaster Wellington. But why? To humiliate me? Destroy my academic standing?

The car rolled to a stop. Frederick opened my door with another murmured apology. Inside, Theodore stood stiffly by the grand staircase, his lips pressed into a thin line as I passed. That man had disliked me from day one, though I couldn't fathom why.

The back gardens offered sanctuary. There, beneath the golden afternoon light, Oliver was already practicing with his bow, his small frame tense with concentration. When he saw me, his entire face transformed.

"Lillian!" He came barreling toward me, nearly tripping over his own feet in excitement.

I couldn't help but smile. After the day I'd had, Oliver's unfiltered joy was exactly what I needed.

"Look what I can do now!" He grabbed my hand, dragging me toward the archery targets. With dramatic flair, he nocked an arrow, drew back the string—and missed the target completely.

But it was closer than last time. Much closer.

"Excellent form!" I clapped. "Now try relaxing your shoulders just a bit... yes, like that. And tilt your chin up—perfect."

Oliver took a deep breath. The arrow whistled through the air—

THUNK.

Dead center.

"I DID IT!" He jumped so high I thought he might take flight. "Did you see? Did you SEE?"

Laughing, I ruffled his hair. "Of course I saw. I never doubted you for a second."

The pure, radiant pride on his face made my chest ache. In this moment, with the sun warming our backs and Oliver's laughter ringing through the garden, all the day's ugliness melted away. Here, at least, I was needed. Here, I belonged.

"Thank you, Lillian," Donovan murmured, pulling me into a tight embrace.

I laughed softly and gave his back a reassuring pat.



"We should head inside now and finish your homework," I suggested, stepping back.

He nodded, carefully storing his bow and arrows before following me into the house. We settled into the parlor, our usual spot for tackling his assignments. Oliver retrieved his worksheets from earlier that day and spread them out in front of me.

Just as we began working, the front doors creaked open and shut. Moments later, Donovan and Victoria appeared in the doorway. She clutched a lavish bouquet of roses, her cheeks flushed with delight as she gazed up at her fiancé.

"Donovan, you shouldn’t have," she cooed, admiring the flowers. "They’re absolutely stunning."

"Not as stunning as you," he murmured, leaning down to brush his lips against hers. "I can’t wait to make you Mrs. Winslow."

My stomach twisted at his words. Victoria wrapped her arms around his neck, pressing herself against him.

"I love you," she whispered.

He didn’t respond—instead, he kissed her deeply, pouring all his supposed devotion into the gesture.

Then his eyes flicked to me, seated on the couch, and I watched them darken. My throat tightened as I realized this was all for my benefit. He pulled back from Victoria, tucking a loose strand of golden hair behind her ear, letting his fingers linger on her cheek a heartbeat too long.

"You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me," he murmured, pressing a kiss to the bridge of her nose.

Her blush deepened, and a radiant smile curved her lips. "I can’t wait to marry you, my love."

The entire time he spoke to her, his gaze never left mine.
###Chapter 62 Lillian's POV

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood's penthouse suite. Lillian stretched lazily beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming from last night's passionate encounter with the Lycan chairman. A contented sigh escaped her lips as she recalled how his strong hands had traced every curve of her body, igniting flames she never knew existed.

Her phone buzzed violently on the nightstand, shattering the peaceful moment. Beatrice's name flashed across the screen with an urgency that made Lillian's stomach clench. She swiped to answer just as Sebastian emerged from the ensuite bathroom, a towel slung low around his hips, water droplets glistening on his sculpted torso.

"Lil! You need to get back to campus right now!" Beatrice's voice was shrill with panic. "Cassandra just posted screenshots of your medical records in the university group chat! Everyone knows about your... condition."

Lillian's blood ran cold. Her fingers tightened around the phone as Sebastian's predatory gaze locked onto her. "What condition?" His voice was deceptively calm, the kind of calm that preceded a storm.

The air thickened with tension as Lillian struggled to form words. This wasn't how she'd planned to tell him. Not like this. Not when she hadn't fully processed the news herself.

Sebastian crossed the room in three strides, plucking the phone from her trembling hands. "Beatrice," he growled into the receiver, "explain. Now."

Lillian watched helplessly as realization dawned on Sebastian's face. His golden eyes darkened to molten amber, the towel around his hips straining against the sudden tension in his body. When he finally spoke, his voice was rough with barely contained fury. "You're carrying my child."

It wasn't a question.

Downstairs in the hotel lobby, Donovan Winslow adjusted his tie in the reflective surface of an elevator door. The notification from the university chat group had been... enlightening. His lips curled into a cruel smile as he watched Evelyn approach, her designer heels clicking against the marble floor.

"Did you see the news?" Evelyn purred, sliding her manicured fingers up his arm. "Our little stray mutt is pregnant. How... unfortunate."

Donovan's smile didn't reach his eyes. "Unfortunate?" He chuckled darkly. "This changes everything." His phone vibrated with an incoming call from Victoria Blackwood - Sebastian's daughter and his supposed fiancée. He silenced it without a second thought.

Evelyn's eyes gleamed with malicious understanding. "You're going to use this against them."

"Not just them," Donovan corrected, pulling her closer. His breath was hot against her ear as he whispered his plan, each word dripping with venomous intent. "Against everyone."

Back in the penthouse, Lillian stood frozen as Sebastian barked orders into his phone. "Marcus, I want Cassandra in my office within the hour. And get Theodore to pull every security feed from that hospital." He ended the call and turned his burning gaze back to Lillian.

"You should have told me," he said, his voice dangerously quiet.

Lillian lifted her chin, defiance sparking in her eyes despite the fear coiling in her stomach. "I just found out yesterday! I was going to tell you when—"

"When what?" Sebastian closed the distance between them, his large hands framing her face. "When you'd figured out how I'd react? When you'd decided whether to keep it?" The raw pain in his voice surprised them both.

Before Lillian could respond, the suite's door burst open. Oliver stood in the doorway, his small face pale, tablet clutched in shaking hands. "Dad... the news... they're saying awful things about Lillian!"

Sebastian snatched the tablet, his expression growing darker with each word scrolling across the screen. "Lycan Chairman Impregnates College Student" screamed the headline, accompanied by doctored photos of Lillian at parties and unflattering angles of her mid-shift at the campus coffee shop.

The tablet shattered against the wall as Sebastian's control snapped. His transformation was instantaneous - muscles rippling, claws extending. The alpha's roar shook the foundations of the building as he turned to Lillian, his beast barely restrained.

"Get dressed," he commanded, his voice guttural. "We're ending this. Today."

As Lillian hurried to comply, she caught sight of her reflection in the mirrored closet doors. The girl staring back at her wasn't the scared college student from months ago. This version had fire in her eyes and a protective hand resting instinctively over her still-flat stomach.

War was coming. And for the first time, Lillian was ready to fight.


"Oh, hey Lillian," Victoria said as she recovered from Donovan's hold. Her cheeks were flushed pink, that infuriating smile never leaving her lips. She ran her fingers through her hair, giving a sheepish look before stepping into the parlor.

Oliver lifted his gaze from his homework to glance at his sister.

"How's everything going in here?" she asked, settling onto the loveseat across the room. Donovan sat beside her, their fingers entwined. They were disgustingly close, whispering sweet nothings like they were the only two people in the world. I gritted my teeth, wondering if she had any idea he'd been at my place last night while she was frantically calling him.

"Great, just finishing up algebra," I answered, forcing my attention back to Oliver. I tried to ignore the way Donovan's lips brushed Victoria's ear, making her giggle like a lovesick fool.

Annoyance prickled down my spine. I could feel Donovan's gaze flickering toward me, but I straightened my posture and focused on the equations in front of me.

"I brought some pastries," one of the maids announced, entering the parlor. She set a tray of scones and sugar cookies on the coffee table.

"Thank you, Sophia," Victoria said sweetly.

The maid nodded and slipped out. Donovan stood, sauntering over to inspect the treats. The scent of warm sugar and butter filled the air, but my appetite had long since vanished. He picked up a few cookies and returned to Victoria, draping an arm around her possessively.

I watched, stomach churning, as he brought a cookie to her lips. She took a delicate bite, her eyes fluttering shut like this was some grand romantic gesture.

"Gag," Oliver muttered, rolling his eyes. "Do you have to do that here?"

Victoria shot him a glare as Donovan wiped a crumb from her lip—then licked it off his finger, his gaze locking onto mine. A challenge.

I pressed my lips into a thin line. He was doing this on purpose, trying to get a reaction. Well, I wouldn’t give him the satisfaction.

"You don’t have to watch," Victoria snapped.

She snuggled deeper into Donovan’s side, and he pressed a kiss to the top of her head.

Not for the first time, I wondered if Donovan had been the one to expose my dyslexia to my father. At this point, I wouldn’t put it past him. He’d do anything to push me out of college, out of his way. The thought twisted my stomach into knots.

I turned away, burying myself in Oliver’s work. For the next hour, we worked in silence while Victoria and Donovan continued their sickening display. Did they really have nothing better to do?

By the time we finished, exhaustion weighed on me—both from the mental strain and the sheer irritation of enduring their performance.

"Do you want to stay for dinner again?" Oliver asked as he neatly stacked his completed assignments.

"I should head home," I replied, rising from the couch. "But I'll see you tomorrow." Oliver's lips formed a small pout, but for once, he didn't protest.

Victoria stood as well, tugging Donovan along with her. "I'm going to check what's for dinner and lend a hand in the kitchen," she announced, fluttering her long lashes at him. "Care to join me?"

For a heartbeat, I thought he might actually agree—might follow her into the kitchen like an obedient puppy. Instead, Donovan merely offered her a tender smile before pressing a soft kiss to her lips. "I'll meet you there. I need to make a quick call first."

Her frown was fleeting, replaced by a playful nip at his lower lip before she turned to me with a breathy laugh. "My man is always working," she sighed, as if it were some grand virtue. "It was lovely seeing you, Lillian." With that, she sauntered toward the kitchen, Oliver trailing behind her like a loyal shadow.

"I'll come with you," he offered.

Victoria nodded, and the two disappeared down the hall. I snatched my bag off the coffee table, hyperaware of Donovan's gaze burning into my every movement. I refused to give him the satisfaction of acknowledging it—refused to let him see how his presence still unsettled me.

Shouldering my bag, I turned toward the door—only for his hand to shoot out and seize my wrist, jerking me to a halt.

I spun around, fury igniting in my veins as our eyes locked.
###Chapter 63  Trapped Between Desire and Duty


The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains, stirring Lillian from her restless sleep. She blinked against the light, her mind still foggy from the whirlwind of emotions that had consumed her the night before. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted up from the kitchen, mingling with the faint aroma of lavender—Sebastian’s preferred cologne.

She sat up, rubbing her temples. The events of yesterday played in her mind like a broken record—Donovan’s unexpected reappearance, Evelyn’s smug smirk, and the way Sebastian’s grip had tightened around her waist when he sensed her distress.

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Lillian?" Sebastian’s deep voice resonated through the wood. "Are you awake?"

She swallowed hard, forcing her voice to remain steady. "Yes, come in."

The door creaked open, revealing Sebastian in a crisp white shirt, sleeves rolled up to his elbows, exposing the intricate tattoos that marked him as Lycan royalty. His dark eyes scanned her face, concern flickering in their depths.

"You didn’t sleep well," he observed, stepping inside.

Lillian sighed, running a hand through her tangled hair. "It’s nothing. Just… a lot on my mind."

Sebastian moved closer, his presence both comforting and overwhelming. "Donovan won’t be a problem anymore," he said, his voice low and firm. "I made sure of that."

She looked up at him, her heart pounding. "What did you do?"

A shadow crossed his face. "Nothing irreversible. But he won’t dare approach you again."

Lillian exhaled shakily. Part of her wanted to protest, to insist she could handle Donovan herself. But another part—the part that had spent too many nights trembling in fear—was relieved.

Sebastian’s fingers brushed against her cheek, sending a shiver down her spine. "You’re mine, Lillian. And I protect what’s mine."

Before she could respond, the sound of hurried footsteps echoed in the hallway. Beatrice burst into the room, her face flushed.

"Lillian! You need to see this!"

Lillian frowned. "What’s wrong?"

Beatrice shoved her phone into Lillian’s hands. The screen displayed a gossip column, the headline screaming in bold letters:

"Scandal at Blackwood Estate: Is the Lycan Chairman’s New Mate Already Involved in a Love Triangle?"

Beneath it was a blurry photo of Donovan grabbing Lillian’s wrist outside the café yesterday, his expression twisted with desperation.

Lillian’s stomach dropped. "This is bad."

Sebastian snatched the phone, his jaw tightening as he read. "Who took this?"

Beatrice bit her lip. "I don’t know, but it’s already gone viral. The pack’s going to see it."

Lillian clenched her fists. Just when she thought things couldn’t get worse, the universe proved her wrong.

Sebastian’s phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, his expression darkening further. "Victoria’s calling."

Lillian’s heart skipped a beat. Sebastian’s daughter had never approved of her. If she saw this…

Sebastian answered the call, his voice icy. "Victoria."

A sharp, feminine voice crackled through the speaker. "Father, explain this now."

Lillian closed her eyes.

The storm was just beginning.

"Release me," I hissed, my voice barely above a whisper but laced with venom.

Donovan's grip only tightened, his dark eyes burning with an intensity that sent an involuntary shiver down my spine. "When will you stop lying to yourself, Lillian?" His voice was a dangerous purr, thick with unspoken promises. "I know you still crave me."

"In your delusional fantasies, Donovan," I shot back, wrenching my arm free with a sharp jerk.

His lips curled into a smirk as he caught my chin between his fingers, forcing me to meet his gaze. "You were watching us earlier—those jealous eyes of yours gave you away. Don't bother denying it."

"I was watching you parade your relationship like some cheap spectacle," I snapped. "It was tasteless, especially in front of Evelyn's little brother."

A mocking laugh escaped him. "Spare me the act. You don't give a damn about that brat. We both know you're just using him to get closer to Sebastian."

My blood boiled. "You have no idea what you're talking about," I seethed, slapping his hand away.

"Don't play innocent, Lillian," he sneered, stepping closer until his presence suffocated me. "You're just as deceitful as they come."

I clenched my jaw, my nails digging into my palms.

"You want to talk about deceit, Donovan?" My voice was ice. "Then explain how Headmaster Wellington found out about my dyslexia."

A flicker of guilt—or was it satisfaction?—flashed in his eyes before he schooled his expression. That was all the confirmation I needed. He knew exactly what I was referring to because he was the one who had betrayed me.

"I have no idea what nonsense you're spouting," he said, straightening his jacket with deliberate nonchalance.

"You're the one spewing lies," I countered, shaking my head in disgust. "You told the headmaster, and then he informed all my professors. Because of you, they treated me like some incompetent fool all day."

"Enough with the baseless accusations, Lillian. I did no such thing," he growled, closing the distance between us.

He would never admit the truth—that much was clear. But I loathed him for meddling in my education, for crossing a line he had no right to cross. He had no business speaking to the headmaster about something so personal.

"You don't even belong at that school," he continued, his voice dripping with condescension. "What could you possibly learn there that the real world hasn't already taught you? It's a waste of time and money. The professors are useless. Just come back to the house I bought for you."

His fingers dug into my arm, this time with bruising force. I was stunned by his audacity—here, in Sebastian's parlor, where his fiancée, Evelyn, was just a room away. She could walk in at any moment and see him manhandling me, but he didn’t seem to care. Or maybe he’d simply forgotten she existed.

"Let. Go. Of. Me." Each word was a blade, sharp and lethal. I shoved against him, but his grip only tightened.

The air between us crackled with tension as Donovan's fingers traced a burning path along my jawline. "Stop fighting it, Lillian. I can feel how much you want this," he whispered, his voice rough with desire. His other arm snaked around my waist, pulling me flush against his hard body as he pressed me firmly into the wall.

I gasped as my back met the unyielding surface, leaving me no room to escape. The heat of his body surrounded me, his scent—dark spice and something uniquely him—filling my senses. My pulse raced, torn between the instinct to push him away and the treacherous pull of attraction that had never fully faded.

His lips hovered dangerously close to mine, his breath warm against my skin. "You can't lie to me, pet. I know you better than you know yourself."

A shiver ran down my spine at the pet name, one he hadn’t used since before everything fell apart. My fingers curled into fists at my sides, nails digging into my palms as I fought to steady my breathing.

But the worst part?

He was right.

And that terrified me more than anything.
###Chapter 64 Sebastian's POV

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains of Lillian’s bedroom, stirring her awake. She stretched lazily, her muscles still sore from yesterday’s intense combat training. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted up from the kitchen, signaling that Sebastian was already awake.

She padded downstairs, her bare feet sinking into the plush carpet. The mansion was unusually quiet, save for the faint clinking of silverware. When she entered the dining room, she found Sebastian seated at the head of the table, reading the morning papers with a furrowed brow. Oliver was beside him, enthusiastically devouring a stack of pancakes.

"Good morning," Lillian murmured, sliding into her usual seat.

Sebastian glanced up, his piercing blue eyes softening as they met hers. "Sleep well?"

She nodded, reaching for the coffee pot. "Better than expected."

Before she could pour herself a cup, Theodore appeared, carrying a tray of fresh pastries. "Miss Lillian," he greeted with a polite nod. "I took the liberty of preparing your favorite—almond croissants."

Lillian smiled. "Thank you, Theodore."

Oliver grinned, syrup smeared across his cheek. "You should try the pancakes, Lillian! They’re amazing!"

Sebastian chuckled, ruffling his son’s hair. "Slow down, Oliver. You’ll choke if you keep inhaling them like that."

The domestic scene was almost too perfect—warm, comforting, and achingly familiar. But Lillian couldn’t shake the unease coiling in her stomach.

Her phone buzzed on the table. A message from Beatrice:

"Emergency meeting at the pack house. Now."

Lillian frowned. Beatrice wasn’t one for dramatics. If she was calling an emergency meeting, something was wrong.

Sebastian noticed her expression. "Problem?"

"I need to head to the pack house," she said, standing abruptly. "Beatrice just texted—something’s up."

Sebastian’s jaw tightened, but he merely nodded. "Take Marcus with you."

She shook her head. "No, I’ll be fine. It’s probably just pack business."

Before he could argue, she grabbed her jacket and hurried out the door.

The pack house was buzzing with tension when Lillian arrived. Beatrice stood at the center of the room, arms crossed, her usual cheerful demeanor replaced by grim determination.

"What’s going on?" Lillian asked, scanning the faces of the gathered pack members.

Beatrice turned to her, lips pressed into a thin line. "We just got word. Donovan’s back in town."

A cold ripple of dread shot through Lillian. Donovan—her ex-fated mate, the man who had betrayed her in the worst possible way.

"And?" Lillian forced her voice to remain steady.

Beatrice exhaled sharply. "He’s not alone. Evelyn’s with him, and they’re making moves against Sebastian’s business holdings. Word is, they’ve got allies in high places."

Lillian’s fingers curled into fists. "What do they want?"

Beatrice’s gaze darkened. "Revenge. And they’re starting with you."

The room fell silent.

Lillian’s pulse roared in her ears. She had thought she was done with Donovan, that her past was buried. But some ghosts refused to stay dead.

And now, they were coming for her.

"Care to explain why we're speeding toward your estate like the hounds of hell are on our heels, Alpha?" Marcus quipped, casting me an amused glance through the rearview mirror.

I clenched my jaw, refusing to dignify his teasing with a response. My gaze remained fixed on the blur of trees rushing past the window.

"We're not speeding," I muttered.

"You practically bolted from the packhouse the second the meeting adjourned," he pointed out, arching a brow.

"Eyes on the road, Beta. My business is none of yours," I snapped, my Alpha aura flaring in warning. Marcus held my gaze for a beat longer before smirking and turning his attention back to the windshield.

"As you wish, sir," he murmured, though the amusement in his tone was unmistakable. I scowled but stayed silent as we pulled up to the grand iron gates of Blackwood Manor.

Marcus parked at the entrance, and I was out of the car before the engine fully settled. Straightening my suit jacket, I cleared my throat and gave him a curt nod of thanks. Through the window, I caught his raised brow, but I ignored it, striding toward the front doors without another word.

Theodore stood at the entrance, bowing stiffly in greeting. He was still under punishment for spreading those vile rumors about Lillian, so he knew better than to speak in my presence. Good. Let him remember his place.

I brushed past him without acknowledgment, my footsteps echoing through the marble halls as I made my way toward the study where Oliver should have been working on his assignments. But as I approached, I froze outside the door at the sound of a soft gasp—followed by a panicked whimper.

My nostrils flared. Lillian's sweet, floral scent filled the air, but Oliver's was faint, as if he hadn't been in the room for hours.

And then I caught it—another scent. One that made my blood boil.

A low growl rumbled in my chest as I threw the door open, revealing Donovan pinning Lillian against the wall, his lips trailing down the curve of her neck. Her eyes were squeezed shut, but they flew open the moment the door crashed against the wall. The color drained from her face when she saw me.

Donovan stiffened at the sound of my voice. He released her instantly, and Lillian immediately wrapped her arms around herself, her cheeks burning crimson.

Before Donovan could utter a word, I seized him by the collar and slammed him into the wall with enough force to crack the plaster. He winced, his Alpha blood doing little to shield him from the wrath of a Lycan.

"Explain," I snarled, my voice a deadly whisper. "Now."

"How dare you betray my daughter's trust like that," I snarled, my voice a low, dangerous growl. "Betraying her is the same as betraying me—and you won’t like what I do to those who cross me."

Donovan was visibly trembling now, his breath coming in shallow gasps. The sight of his fear sent a dark thrill through me.

"I swear... nothing happened, Alpha," he stammered, his entire body shaking like a leaf in a storm.

My fingers tightened around his throat, cutting off his air. His face flushed crimson as he clawed uselessly at my grip.

"It didn’t look like nothing," I hissed, my voice dripping with venom. "Do you take me for a fool?"

"N-no, sir," he choked out.

"Sebastian, it’s not what it looked like," Lillian’s voice came from behind me, hesitant but insistent.

"And you think I’ll believe you?" I snapped, my burning gaze never leaving Donovan’s face. "You swore you wouldn’t jeopardize this arranged marriage. And yet, here I find you—pressed against the wall with my daughter’s fiancé."

The air crackled with tension, thick enough to choke on. Donovan’s eyes darted wildly, searching for an escape that didn’t exist.

Lillian stepped forward, her hands raised in a placating gesture. "Please, just let him explain—"

"Explain?" I cut her off with a sharp laugh. "There’s nothing to explain. Actions speak louder than words."

Donovan’s lips moved soundlessly, his face paling as the reality of his situation sank in.

And in that moment, I made a silent promise—one way or another, he would regret this betrayal.

###Chapter 65 What does he want?

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting golden streaks across the lavish bedroom. Lillian stretched beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming from the intensity of last night. Beside her, Sebastian Blackwood slept soundly, his muscular arm draped possessively over her waist.

She bit her lip, recalling the way he had claimed her—again and again—until exhaustion had finally pulled them both under. His scent, rich and intoxicating, clung to her skin, a silent declaration to the world that she was his.

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Miss Lillian?" Giselle’s voice was hushed but urgent. "You have a visitor."

Lillian frowned. "Who is it?"

"Miss Evelyn," the head maid replied. "She says it’s important."

Lillian’s stomach twisted. Evelyn. Donovan’s new mate. What could she possibly want?

Careful not to wake Sebastian, she slipped out of bed and pulled on a robe. The moment she stepped into the hallway, Evelyn’s sharp perfume hit her like a slap.

The blonde stood stiffly, her manicured fingers clutching a small envelope. "I didn’t want to come," she said, her voice tight. "But Donovan insisted."

Lillian crossed her arms. "What does he want?"

Evelyn thrust the envelope at her. "He said to give this to you—personally."

Lillian hesitated before taking it. The paper was thick, expensive. She flipped it open, and her breath caught.

Meet me at the old oak by sunset. We need to talk.

Her pulse spiked. Why now? After everything—after he’d abandoned her, after he’d chosen Evelyn—what could he possibly have to say?

Evelyn’s lips curled into a bitter smile. "He still thinks about you, you know. Even now."

Lillian’s grip tightened on the note. "Tell him I’m not interested."

Evelyn scoffed. "Oh, I will. But we both know you’ll go."

Before Lillian could respond, Evelyn turned on her heel and strode away, leaving her standing there, heart pounding.

She glanced back at the bedroom door. Sebastian would be furious if he knew. But something—some stubborn, foolish part of her—needed answers.

Just one last conversation.

Then she’d walk away for good.

Or so she told herself.

Donovan gave a stiff nod, his dark eyes simmering with barely contained fury. I could tell he was seething, but he was holding himself back—just barely.

"Yes, Alpha," he ground out, his voice rough with suppressed anger.

He turned on his heel and stalked into the kitchen, leaving Lillian and me alone in the parlor. She didn’t retreat, didn’t flinch. Instead, her gaze locked onto mine, searching—for what, I wasn’t sure. Understanding? Absolution?

"Are you satisfied now?" I asked, unable to keep the disgust from lacing my words. "Was this your plan all along? To remind everyone that you still have him wrapped around your finger?"

She blinked, her brows lifting in disbelief.

"Are you serious?" she shot back. "I didn’t ask for any of this. He was the one who cornered me. Pinned me against the wall. No matter how much I fought, he wouldn’t let go."

My lips curled into a bitter smile. "And you expect me to believe that? Every time I turn around, you and Donovan are tangled up in some mess. Funny how that keeps happening, isn’t it?"

Lillian pressed her lips into a thin line, her stare unwavering. "I didn’t ask for it. I didn’t want it. But believe whatever you want." She moved to leave, but I caught her wrist, pulling her back.

"We’re not done—"

The door swung open before I could finish. Victoria stepped inside, flanked by Donovan and Oliver. She paused mid-step, her sharp eyes flicking between us before landing on my grip around Lillian’s wrist.

"Am I interrupting something?" she asked, arching a brow.

I released Lillian as if burned.

"No," I clipped. "We were just talking. Is everything all right?"

Victoria bit her lip, hesitating before nodding. "The dinner… it’s ruined. The maids said they can prepare another meal, but it’ll take time."

"Tell them not to bother," I said. "We’ll go out tonight."

Oliver perked up instantly, bouncing on his toes. "Like a family dinner?"

I nodded. It had been too long since we’d done something like this—just the four of us. Well, five, if I had to include Donovan by default.

Victoria’s face brightened, a soft smile curving her lips. "That’s a wonderful idea." Then, to my surprise, she turned to Lillian. "You should come too. You haven’t eaten all day—you must be starving."


Lillian's brow furrowed as she scanned each of our faces. We stared back, waiting for her response. I already knew she was searching for an escape. The last thing she wanted was to be trapped at a dinner table with the Blackwood family—and her ex.

"No, I—"

"Yes, Lillian will join us," I cut in before she could refuse.

Her eyes widened in disbelief.

"I really should be heading home..."

"You need to eat," I said firmly, my tone leaving no room for argument. "It's just dinner, Lillian."

She opened her mouth to protest, but Oliver dashed over and wrapped his arms around her legs, babbling excitedly about how much fun they were going to have.

We chose an upscale Italian restaurant in the Silver Crescent pack. Victoria had lent Lillian one of her dresses—a sleek, dark red number that hugged her curves in all the right places. I hated how much skin it revealed, but what I hated even more was how breathtaking she looked. The slit in the skirt showcased her long, toned legs with every step, and when she leaned forward, the deep neckline threatened to spill secrets I had no business knowing. I swallowed hard, my jaw tightening.

She sat beside me, while Oliver occupied the other side. Victoria and Donovan faced us, with Donovan directly across from Lillian. I couldn’t help but notice the way his gaze flickered toward her every so often—and how she deliberately avoided meeting his eyes. A quiet tension simmered between them, and curiosity gnawed at me. What exactly had happened between those two?

Victoria, blissfully unaware, sipped her wine and nibbled on breadsticks while half-listening to Oliver ramble about how incredible Lillian had been during their sparring session.

When the waiter arrived with our meals, Oliver finally quieted down.

Lillian took a slow bite of her chicken parmesan, and a soft, involuntary moan escaped her lips. The sound shot straight through me, and I gritted my teeth.

Damn her.

"Dad, are you okay?" Victoria asked, tilting her head. "You seem... tense."

I forced a smile. "I'm fine. Just eat."

She studied me for a moment before Donovan distracted her by lifting a forkful of meatball to her lips. She giggled as she took the bite, sauce smudging her cheek. He wiped it away with his thumb, then licked it off with a smirk.

My gaze flicked to Lillian. Her jaw was clenched, her fingers tightening around her fork.

Unable to resist, I leaned in and whispered, "Don’t they make the perfect couple? Let’s not ruin it for them, hmm?"
###Chapter 66 Lillian's POV 

The morning sun cast golden rays through the sheer curtains of Lillian’s bedroom, stirring her awake. She stretched lazily, her muscles still sore from last night’s training session with Professor Montclair. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted in from the hallway, signaling that Harper was already up and preparing breakfast.

Lillian’s phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Beatrice lit up the screen:

"Meet me at the café in 20. Big news!"

Lillian frowned. Beatrice rarely texted in such a cryptic manner. Whatever it was, it couldn’t wait.

She dressed quickly, opting for a simple sweater and jeans before slipping into her favorite boots. As she descended the grand staircase of Sebastian Blackwood’s mansion, she nearly collided with Oliver, who was racing down the steps with his toy sword in hand.

"Whoa there, little warrior," Lillian laughed, steadying him. "Where’s the fire?"

Oliver grinned up at her, his eyes sparkling with mischief. "Papa said I can train with the gammas today! Real swords!"

Lillian ruffled his hair. "Just don’t scare them too much."

In the dining room, Sebastian sat at the head of the table, engrossed in a stack of documents. His sharp gaze flicked up as she entered, and for a fleeting moment, warmth softened his features.

"Morning," he murmured.

"Morning," she replied, pouring herself a cup of coffee. "Beatrice needs me at the café. Something urgent."

Sebastian’s expression darkened slightly. "Be careful. Donovan’s pack has been sniffing around campus lately."

Lillian nodded. She hadn’t forgotten the way Donovan had looked at her the last time they crossed paths—like a predator eyeing its prey.

The café was bustling when she arrived. Beatrice waved her over from a corner booth, her face flushed with excitement.

"You won’t believe this," Beatrice whispered, leaning in. "Evelyn is pregnant."

Lillian nearly choked on her latte. "What?"

"Yep. And guess who the father is?"

Lillian didn’t need to guess. The triumphant smirk on Beatrice’s face said it all.

"Donovan."

Beatrice nodded. "And here’s the kicker—Victoria doesn’t know yet."

Lillian’s stomach twisted. Victoria, Sebastian’s daughter, was still engaged to Donovan. If she found out…

"This is going to explode," Lillian muttered.

Beatrice grinned. "Oh, it gets better. Evelyn’s planning to announce it at the next pack gathering."

Lillian groaned. "Why do I feel like I’m about to be caught in the crossfire?"

Beatrice patted her hand. "Because you always are."

As if on cue, Lillian’s phone buzzed again. A message from an unknown number:

"We need to talk. Alone. —D."

Lillian’s blood ran cold. Donovan.

Beatrice’s eyes widened as she read the message over Lillian’s shoulder. "You’re not seriously considering meeting him, are you?"

Lillian exhaled sharply. "I don’t have a choice. If he’s reaching out now, it’s not for small talk."

Beatrice grabbed her wrist. "Then at least tell Sebastian."

Lillian hesitated. Sebastian would never let her go alone. But if Donovan had information—something dangerous—she needed to hear it first.

"I’ll be careful," she promised, slipping her phone into her pocket.

Beatrice didn’t look convinced. "Famous last words."

Lillian forced a smile, but her mind was already racing. Whatever Donovan wanted, it wouldn’t be good. And if Evelyn’s pregnancy was part of his game, then the stakes had just gotten a lot higher.

The clock was ticking. And Lillian had a sinking feeling that the next 24 hours would change everything.

I expected Sebastian to take me first before dropping off the others, so his decision to leave Victoria, Oliver, and Donovan at the villa first caught me off guard. The moment their car doors closed behind them, Marcus swiftly raised the privacy partition, sealing us in tense silence.

My fingers twisted in my lap as I studied Sebastian's rigid profile. "Was this whole dinner just an elaborate scheme to shove Donovan's relationship in my face?" The words slipped out sharper than intended, my voice steady despite the storm inside me.

His knuckles whitened on the steering wheel. "You needed to witness their bond firsthand. No amount of scheming will tear them apart." The glacial tone sent shivers down my spine.

A bitter laugh escaped me. "You think I want to come between them? I wouldn't touch Donovan with a ten-foot pole—"

"Excellent." His sudden turn pinned me with those mercury eyes, dissecting my soul. "Then keeping your distance should pose no difficulty."

The world narrowed to the space between us. My breath hitched when his palm cradled my nape, tilting my face upward. His minty breath fanned across my lips as he leaned in, close enough to count the flecks of silver in his irises. My eyelids threatened to flutter shut, but I clung to consciousness, resisting the magnetic pull of his proximity. Every thundering heartbeat echoed like war drums in my chest.

"Let's be perfectly clear, Miss Dumont." His velvet growl liquefied my bones. "If my daughter suffers due to your games with her fiancé, I will personally ensure you regret it. Nothing—and no one—comes before my family."

The threat should've angered me. Instead, heat pooled low in my belly. "You despise Donovan," I whispered, pulse jumping at my own audacity. "Why force Victoria into this?"

His grip vanished as if burned. "That," he hissed through clenched teeth, "is none of your concern."

The sudden coldness left me hollow. "You're right." I picked at my cuticles, throat tight. "I overstepped."

The limousine's abrupt halt startled me. Through the tinted windows, my apartment building loomed like a prison. My fingers trembled on the seatbelt clasp.

Sebastian seemed distant, his gaze fixed on some unseen point beyond the windshield. Lost in thought, his jaw was set in that familiar, unreadable way. I wanted to ask what was troubling him, but I knew better than to pry. Some doors weren’t meant to be opened.

"Thank you for the ride, Alpha Blackwood," I murmured, pushing the car door open.

The moment I stepped out, the biting night air coiled around me like an unwelcome embrace. The dress Victoria had lent me—if it could even be called that—left little to the imagination. More skin than fabric, it was hardly suited for the autumn chill. I wrapped my arms around myself, shivering as I hurried toward the entrance.

Then, warmth.

A heavy weight settled over my shoulders, the scent of cedar and something distinctly him enveloping me. I froze, glancing down to find Sebastian’s tailored coat draped around me. Slowly, I turned.

He stood close. Too close.

His expression was unreadable, but his eyes—those piercing, storm-gray eyes—flickered over me before meeting mine. "You should’ve dressed for the weather," he said, voice cool.

I scowled. "I didn’t exactly plan to wear this." My fingers tightened around the edges of his coat. "Especially not something this… revealing."

A beat of silence. His gaze dipped again, just for a fraction of a second, before snapping back up.

"Don’t make it a habit," he muttered.

Then he was gone, striding back to his car without another word.

The warmth of his coat was a stark contrast to the cold dismissal in his tone.

###Chapter 67 I’ll pretend to be your mother.

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains, stirring Lillian from her restless sleep. She groaned, rubbing her temples as the remnants of last night’s argument with Donovan lingered in her mind. The scent of his betrayal still clung to her senses, bitter and suffocating.

She rolled out of bed, her bare feet meeting the cold hardwood floor. The silence of the mansion was deafening—Sebastian had left early for a meeting, and Oliver was already at school. Only the distant hum of the staff moving about downstairs broke the stillness.

Lillian dressed quickly, opting for a simple blouse and jeans. She needed air—needed to escape the suffocating weight of her thoughts. The garden seemed like the perfect refuge.

As she stepped outside, the crisp morning breeze carried the scent of blooming roses. The vibrant colors should have lifted her spirits, but all she could think about was Evelyn’s smug smile, the way she had clung to Donovan at the pack gathering.

“Pathetic,” Lillian muttered to herself, kicking a pebble across the path.

“Talking to yourself now?”

She spun around to find Beatrice leaning against a nearby tree, arms crossed, a teasing smirk on her lips.

“Don’t you have classes?” Lillian deflected, not in the mood for her best friend’s usual sarcasm.

“Skipping,” Beatrice shrugged. “Figured you could use the company.”

Lillian sighed, but a small smile tugged at her lips. Beatrice always knew when she needed her.

They walked in comfortable silence for a while before Beatrice finally spoke. “You know, Donovan’s not worth it.”

Lillian clenched her fists. “It’s not just about him. It’s the principle. He humiliated me in front of the entire pack.”

“And yet, here you are, still letting him live rent-free in your head.” Beatrice nudged her shoulder. “Sebastian’s ten times the man Donovan could ever be.”

Lillian’s cheeks warmed at the mention of Sebastian. “It’s complicated.”

“No, it’s not,” Beatrice scoffed. “You’re just scared.”

Before Lillian could retort, her phone buzzed. A message from Victoria flashed on the screen:

”We need to talk. Meet me at the café in an hour.”

Lillian’s stomach twisted. Victoria had been distant ever since the engagement was called off. What could she possibly want now?

Beatrice raised an eyebrow. “Trouble?”

“Always,” Lillian muttered, pocketing her phone.

As they turned back toward the mansion, a shadow moved in the corner of her vision. Lillian froze, her wolf senses prickling.

Someone was watching them.

She glanced around, but the garden was empty. Still, the feeling of unseen eyes lingered, sending a chill down her spine.

Beatrice frowned. “What’s wrong?”

Lillian shook her head, forcing a smile. “Nothing. Just… thinking.”

But she knew better.

Something—or someone—was coming.

And it wasn’t going to be good.

"A habit? Seriously?" I called after Sebastian's retreating figure, my voice laced with disbelief. "Then perhaps you shouldn't insist on dragging me to upscale restaurants with your entire family. It's not like I had much say in my wardrobe choices."

The Lycan chairman didn't dignify my remark with a response, simply sliding into the black leather backseat of his luxury sedan and slamming the door with unnecessary force. I huffed and stomped toward my front door, rummaging through my bag for my keys with slightly trembling fingers.

As the lock clicked open, I hesitated before pushing the door ajar, peering into the darkened interior of my modest home. A weary sigh escaped my lips as I glanced back—the car remained stationary at the curb, its engine purring quietly. Sebastian always waited until I was safely inside before departing. This small courtesy made my traitorous heart flutter, suggesting perhaps the infuriating man did possess some shred of concern for my wellbeing.

The moment my front door closed behind me, the vehicle's tires crunched against the pavement as it pulled away. Only then did I release the breath I hadn't realized I'd been holding. My entire body trembled as I clutched his expensive overcoat tighter around my shoulders, inhaling deeply.

The rich, masculine scent—a blend of sandalwood and something uniquely Sebastian—wrapped around me like an embrace.

The Next Day

Oliver bounced excitedly beside me as we stepped into the training yard. "What's today's lesson?" he asked, practically vibrating with energy. We'd just finished his mathematics assignment, and I'd promised him some outdoor combat practice as a reward.

"I thought we might focus on defensive maneuvers," I suggested, stretching my arms overhead. "Every young Lycan should know how to protect themselves. Rogues could strike when least expected."

"Our warriors are the finest in the territory!" Oliver declared with all the confidence of his lineage, chest puffed out proudly. "No rogue would dare cross our borders."

I ruffled his hair affectionately. "Even the most vigilant guards can't be everywhere at once, Master Oliver. Better safe than sorry, don't you think?"

He gave me that signature Blackwood smirk but didn't argue further.

For the next hour, I demonstrated several advanced blocking techniques I'd recently mastered in my own training sessions. The boy mirrored each movement with startling precision—his natural athleticism and prior training evident in every fluid motion.

"Impressive," I admitted after he successfully parried my tenth consecutive strike. "You're quite the prodigy."

"Father drilled defense into me from the time I could walk," Oliver explained with a nonchalant shrug that reminded me painfully of Sebastian. "He says a true Alpha must always be prepared for the unexpected."

"A wise philosophy," I agreed, moving toward the ice-filled cooler I'd prepared. I handed Oliver a chilled water bottle before grabbing one for myself.

The boy's expression turned thoughtful as he twisted the cap. "He is wise. When he's actually home, I mean." The unspoken longing in his voice tugged at my heartstrings.

I crouched to meet his eye level. "Do you wish he could be around more often?"

Oliver focused intently on peeling the label from his water bottle, his small fingers working methodically. "It'd be nice," he murmured after a long pause. "But I understand... he has important responsibilities."

I reached out and placed my hand on his shoulder, giving it a gentle, reassuring squeeze.

"I'm sorry, Oliver," I said softly, my voice filled with sincerity.

His gaze remained fixed on the water bottle in his hands, his fingers fidgeting with the cap. Something was clearly troubling him, and I couldn’t help but wonder if it was still about his father—or if there was more weighing on his young heart.

"Is there something else bothering you?" I asked gently.

A faint blush crept up his cheeks as he hesitated, looking almost embarrassed.

"Kind of," he murmured, his voice barely above a whisper. "I... might have gotten into some trouble at school today. They want to have a parent-teacher conference."

My brows lifted slightly. "Does Sebastian know?"

Oliver shook his head quickly, his eyes darting up to meet mine.

"If he finds out, he’ll be furious," he whispered hoarsely. "I can’t tell him."

I sighed, tilting my head. "But if you don’t tell him, what are you going to do? The teachers will expect a parent there."

He swallowed hard, then took a deep breath, as if gathering the courage to ask the question burning in his mind.

"I was wondering... if maybe you could pretend to be my mom for the conference?"

I blinked, taken aback. "Oliver, I’m not your mother," I reminded him gently.

"I know!" he said quickly, his voice pleading. "But just for the conference? Please? You could pretend!"

I shook my head, exhaling. "Your father would have both our heads if he found out about this. I can’t risk losing my job."

"You won’t get fired, Lillian," Oliver insisted, his eyes wide with desperation. "You’re the first tutor I’ve actually liked. He wouldn’t risk losing you." He swallowed again, his voice dropping to a whisper. "Please. He doesn’t have to know if we don’t tell him. But if he finds out I got in trouble... he’ll disown me."

A small smile tugged at my lips. "He would never do that, Oliver," I assured him.

But the panic in his eyes was unmistakable. "I can’t lose him..." His voice cracked, and my chest tightened at the raw fear in his words. Where was this coming from?

"Please," he begged, his fingers clutching at my sleeve. "Help me."

Staring into his pleading, desperate eyes, my resolve crumbled. My heart ached for him—this young boy who carried so much weight on his small shoulders.

Finally, I sighed and nodded. "Alright, Oliver. I’ll help you. I’ll pretend to be your mother."

###Chapter 68 Lillian's POV


The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood's mountain retreat. Below, the training grounds buzzed with activity—warriors sparring, gammas running drills, and the occasional growl of shifting lycans. She tightened the sash of her silk robe, the fabric whispering against her skin.

"Miss Lillian?" A deep voice startled her. Donovan stood in the doorway, his amber eyes glinting with something unreadable. "You're up early."

She resisted the urge to bare her teeth. "Unlike some, I don't need beauty sleep to function."

His chuckle grated like gravel. "Still feisty. I'd heard Blackwood tamed you."

The lie burned her tongue. "Sebastian respects my fire. Something you never understood."

A crash from the courtyard drew their attention. Oliver, Sebastian's seven-year-old son, had toppled a training dummy twice his size. The boy scrambled up, grinning at his own mischief. Lillian's chest tightened—he had his father's stubborn chin.

"Speaking of understanding," Donovan leaned against the railing, too close, "you should know Evelyn's pregnant."

The world tilted. Lillian's claws pricked her palms. "Congratulations," she forced out. "Another pawn for your games."

His smile turned predatory. "Blackwood hasn't told you, has he? The council's vote is tonight. If he loses the chairmanship—"

"Enough." Sebastian's voice cut through the tension like a blade. He materialized behind Donovan, silver-streaked hair catching the dawn light. "My mate doesn't concern herself with pack politics."

Donovan's smirk faltered at the word mate. With a mocking bow, he retreated inside.

Sebastian's hand found the small of Lillian's back. "You're shaking."

She turned into his embrace, inhaling his cedar-and-bergamot scent. "Why didn't you tell me about the vote?"

His grip tightened. "Because I won't lose." But the shadow in his storm-gray eyes betrayed him.

From the gardens below, Victoria's laughter floated up—Donovan's fiancée, blissfully unaware of the viper in her bed. Lillian's wolf snarled. "We need to—"

A guttural howl interrupted her. Marcus Grayson, Sebastian's beta, sprinted toward them, his usually impeccable uniform torn. "Alpha! The perimeter's breached. Levi's pack—they've brought silver."

Sebastian's transformation was instantaneous. Fur rippled across his skin as he shoved Lillian toward the door. "Get Oliver to the safe room. Now."

As she grabbed the boy's hand, the first explosion rocked the mountainside. Glass shattered. Somewhere, Victoria screamed.

And in the chaos, Lillian caught Donovan's triumphant grin—directed not at the attackers, but at Sebastian's unprotected back.

I still couldn't believe I had actually agreed to this. Staring at my reflection in the mirror, I frowned. The tailored business suit I wore made me look at least a decade older. Oliver had been right—I could easily pass for his mother.

For a brief moment, doubt crept in. What if I look too young? Will the teachers really buy this? But the moment I slipped into one of my mother’s professional outfits, those worries vanished.

A quick glance at the clock told me I had mere minutes before my Uber arrived to take me to Oliver’s school. I hadn’t even asked what he’d done to land himself in trouble. I should’ve gotten details—how am I supposed to play the angry, scolding parent if I don’t even know what I’m scolding him for?

Running my fingers through my hair, I debated pulling it into a low ponytail instead of leaving it loose. Swallowing hard, I shook my head. No. If I can’t sell the "strict mother" act, my next best option is to flirt with the teacher. Beatrice would definitely say that if she knew what I was up to today.

A sharp honk outside signaled my ride’s arrival. I took a deep breath, gave myself one last critical look in the mirror, and nodded. Satisfied, I snatched my purse from the bed, slung it over my shoulder, and hurried out.

To my surprise, my mother was in the living room when I descended the stairs—and she was drinking coffee. She offered me a small smile and tilted her head toward the kitchen.

"I brewed some if you'd like a cup," she said.

"You made coffee?" I blurted before I could stop myself.

Her eyebrows arched. "I am capable of making coffee, Lillian," she replied dryly.

I blinked. "That’s not what I meant, Mom. It’s just… you haven’t really been up for doing much lately. I’m glad you’re out of bed."

She took another slow sip. "I figured it’s time for changes. Can’t exactly start fresh if I’m holed up in my room all day, can I?"

Smiling, I rounded the couch and wrapped my arms around her. For a second, her body tensed—but then she relaxed, resting her head against my shoulder.

Then she pulled back, frowning.

"Are you wearing my clothes?"

I swallowed hard and let out an awkward laugh.

"I have an interview," I lied smoothly, adjusting the strap of my bag. "I needed something professional to wear."

Her eyes brightened with hope. "Would this job pay well?"

I nodded, letting a small, determined smile curve my lips. "Maybe even enough to help with Dad's debt."

The way her face lit up made my chest tighten.

"I'm meeting with his lawyers today to discuss other options they might have found," she said, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear. "I’ll let you know what they say."

I gave her a quick nod. "I’ll be home a little later. We can talk then."

Outside, the Uber’s impatient honking grew louder. If I didn’t move now, the driver would leave without me.

"I have to go," I murmured, pressing a kiss to her cheek. "Love you."

"Love you too, Lillian," she replied softly, her gaze lingering on me as I hurried out.

The ride to the school was silent, the tension in my stomach coiling tighter with every passing minute. When the car finally pulled up, I thanked the driver and slipped out, my pulse hammering in my throat.

The school halls were eerily quiet, most students already in class. The main office wasn’t far—just past the front entrance. Inside, a young blonde receptionist was typing furiously, her attention locked on her screen. She didn’t even glance up as I approached.

I cleared my throat—once, twice—before she finally sighed and lifted her gaze.

"Can I help you?" she asked, arching one perfectly sculpted brow.

"Yes," I said, squaring my shoulders. "I’m here to see the headmaster."

Her eyes flicked over me, assessing. "And you are?"

"Lillian Whitaker," I lied smoothly. "I’m Oliver’s mother."

For a heartbeat, she just stared. Then her lips twitched. A snort escaped her before she burst into laughter, leaning back in her chair like I’d told the funniest joke in the world.

My cheeks burned.

Of course she saw right through me. If I were Mrs. Blackwood, that would mean I was married to Sebastian Blackwood—Lycan chairman, notorious bachelor, and the most sought-after man in the city.

I should’ve thought that through.

But the lie was out now, and there was no taking it back.

###Chapter 69 - Lillian's POV

The morning sun cast golden rays through the sheer curtains of Lillian’s bedroom, stirring her awake. She stretched languidly, her muscles still humming from the previous night’s training session with Donovan. The memory of his intense gaze and the way his fingers had lingered on her wrist sent an unexpected shiver down her spine.

No. She shook her head, dispelling the thought. He’s engaged to Victoria. And I have no business thinking about him like that.

But the dreams had been relentless—visions of Donovan’s lips brushing against hers, his voice whispering promises in the dark. It was maddening.

A sharp knock at her door startled her.

"Lillian?" Beatrice’s voice carried through the wood. "You up? We’ve got class in twenty."

"Coming!" Lillian scrambled out of bed, grabbing her towel before darting into the ensuite bathroom. The cold water did little to cool the heat in her cheeks.

By the time she emerged, Beatrice was already dressed, flipping through her notes with a frown. "Professor Sinclair’s quiz is today. You ready?"

Lillian groaned. "Completely forgot."

Beatrice tossed her a sympathetic look. "Well, good luck. You’ll need it."

The walk to campus was brisk, the autumn air crisp against Lillian’s skin. Students milled about, laughter and chatter filling the quad. But as she turned the corner toward the lecture hall, she froze.

There, leaning against the brick wall with effortless grace, was Donovan. His dark hair was tousled, his leather jacket hugging his broad shoulders. And beside him, Victoria—elegant, poised, her hand resting possessively on his arm.

Lillian’s stomach twisted.

Donovan’s gaze flickered toward her, and for a heartbeat, their eyes locked. Something unreadable flashed in his expression before Victoria tugged him away, her laughter ringing in the air like a taunt.

"Ugh, those two," Beatrice muttered, nudging Lillian forward. "Ignore them. You’ve got bigger things to worry about."

Lillian forced a smile, but the weight in her chest remained.

Because no matter how much she tried to convince herself otherwise, one truth was undeniable:

She was falling for Donovan Blackwood.

And it was going to ruin everything.

I still couldn't believe I had actually agreed to this.

Staring at my reflection in the mirror, I frowned. The tailored business suit I wore looked like it belonged to someone a decade older. Oliver had been right—I could easily pass for his mother. For a brief moment, doubt crept in. Was I too young? Would the teachers really buy this?

But then I slipped into one of my mother’s formal blazers, adjusted the collar, and the illusion snapped into place.

A glance at the clock sent my pulse racing. My Uber would be here any minute. I hadn’t even asked Oliver what he’d done to land himself in trouble. Maybe I should have—just so I could prepare a convincing parental lecture. Stern words, disappointed sighs, the whole act.

My fingers tangled in my hair. Should I tie it back? A low ponytail might make me look more authoritative. Or maybe leaving it loose would help sell the "busy working mother" persona.

A sharp honk outside snapped me out of my thoughts.

Time to go.

One last look in the mirror. The outfit was perfect—professional, mature, just intimidating enough. I snatched my purse off the bed and hurried downstairs.

And froze.

My mother was in the living room.

Not just present—awake, alert, sipping coffee like it was a normal morning.

When she spotted me, her lips curved into a small smile. She tilted her head toward the kitchen.

"I made coffee if you want some."

"You… made coffee?" The words slipped out before I could stop them.

Her brows arched. "I am capable of basic tasks, Lillian."

Heat rushed to my cheeks. "That’s not what I meant. It’s just… you haven’t been up much lately. I’m glad you’re out of bed."

She took another slow sip, her gaze steady. "I figured it’s time for changes. Can’t do that hiding under blankets all day, can I?"

A lump formed in my throat. Without thinking, I crossed the room and wrapped my arms around her.

For a heartbeat, she stiffened. Then, just as quickly, she relaxed, resting her head against my shoulder.

When she pulled back, her eyes narrowed.

"Are you wearing my clothes?"

I swallowed hard.

Awkward laughter bubbled up.

This was going to be a long day.

"I have an interview," I lied, smoothing down the borrowed blazer that was slightly too big for me. "I needed something professional to wear."

"Would this job pay well?" Mom asked, her tired eyes lighting up with cautious hope.

I nodded, forcing a confident smile. "Maybe even enough to start paying off Dad's debt."

Her face brightened instantly. "I have a meeting with his lawyers today to discuss other options they might have found," she said, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear. "I'll keep you posted."

"I'll be home a little later, and we can talk then," I assured her. Outside, the Uber driver honked impatiently, signaling that my time was up.

"I have to go," I said, pressing a quick kiss to her cheek. "Love you."

"Love you too, Lillian," she murmured, her voice soft with worry.

I bolted out the door and slid into the backseat of the waiting car. The ride to the school was silent, the driver barely glancing at me in the rearview mirror. With every passing minute, my nerves tightened like a coiled spring.

When we arrived, I thanked him and stepped out, my heels clicking against the pavement as I hurried toward the entrance. The halls were eerily quiet—most students were already in class. The main office wasn’t far, just a short walk from the front doors.

Inside, a young blonde receptionist was typing furiously at her computer, her attention locked on the screen. She didn’t even glance up when I approached her desk.

I cleared my throat. Once. Twice.

Finally, she sighed dramatically and lifted her gaze, her perfectly arched brows rising in question. "Can I help you?"

"Yes," I said, straightening my shoulders. "I'm here to speak with the principal."

She smirked, leaning back in her chair. "And who might you be?"

"Lillian Whitlock," I lied smoothly. "I'm Oliver's mother."

Her eyes narrowed, raking over me from head to toe before she let out a sharp, disbelieving laugh. She actually clutched her stomach, doubling over as if I’d told the funniest joke in the world.

My cheeks burned.

Of course she saw right through me. If I were Mrs. Whitlock, that would mean I was married to Sebastian Blackwood—and everyone knew Sebastian was the most notorious bachelor in the city, a man who had never been tied down.

I should’ve thought this through better. But the lie was already out there, and now I had no choice but to stand by it.
###Chapter 70 Lillian's POV


The morning sun cast golden rays through the sheer curtains of Lillian’s bedroom, stirring her awake. She stretched lazily, her muscles still sore from yesterday’s intense combat training. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted up from the kitchen, making her stomach growl.

Downstairs, Sebastian Blackwood was already dressed in his usual crisp suit, sipping his espresso while reading the morning reports. His sharp eyes flickered up as Lillian descended the stairs, her hair slightly tousled from sleep.

"Good morning," he murmured, his deep voice sending a pleasant shiver down her spine.

"Morning," she replied, grabbing a croissant from the tray. "Any updates on the competition?"

Sebastian set his cup down. "The Darkmoon Pack has arrived early. Alpha Maximilian is already making moves."

Lillian frowned. "Of course he is."

Just then, Oliver burst into the dining room, his face flushed with excitement. "Lillian! You have to see the new obstacle course they set up near the lake!"

She chuckled. "After breakfast, okay?"

Oliver pouted but nodded, bouncing on his toes.

Beatrice entered, her arms laden with shopping bags. "You won’t believe the deals I found at the boutique!" she announced, grinning.

Sebastian arched a brow. "More shopping?"

Beatrice waved him off. "A girl needs options, especially when she’s about to watch her best friend dominate the competition."

Lillian rolled her eyes but smiled. "Speaking of which, I should head to the training grounds early."

Sebastian stood. "I’ll walk with you."

As they stepped outside, the crisp morning air filled Lillian’s lungs. The resort was bustling with competitors and spectators, the energy palpable.

Then she spotted him—Donovan, standing near the registration desk with Evelyn draped over his arm. His cold gaze locked onto hers, a smirk playing on his lips.

Sebastian’s grip on her waist tightened subtly. "Ignore him," he murmured.

Lillian exhaled slowly. "Easier said than done."

Just as they turned away, a familiar voice called out. "Lillian! Over here!"

She turned to see Nathaniel waving enthusiastically from the crowd, his usual cheerful demeanor intact.

Sebastian’s jaw tensed. "Persistent, isn’t he?"

Lillian elbowed him lightly. "Be nice."

Nathaniel jogged over, slightly out of breath. "I was hoping to catch you before the matches started. Good luck today!"

"Thanks," she said, smiling.

Sebastian cleared his throat pointedly.

Nathaniel chuckled. "Right. I’ll, uh, see you around."

As he walked away, Lillian shot Sebastian an exasperated look. "You’re impossible."

Sebastian smirked. "Just making my position clear."

Before she could retort, Marcus approached, his expression serious. "Alpha, we have a situation."

Sebastian’s demeanor shifted instantly. "What is it?"

Marcus lowered his voice. "Someone sabotaged the eastern training field. The equipment’s been tampered with."

Lillian’s stomach dropped. "Was anyone hurt?"

"Not yet, but we need to address this before the matches begin."

Sebastian’s eyes darkened. "Find out who did this. Now."

As Marcus hurried off, Lillian clenched her fists. "This has Alpha Maximilian written all over it."

Sebastian nodded grimly. "Stay alert. They’re playing dirty."

The tension in the air thickened, the once-exciting competition now laced with danger.

And Lillian knew one thing for certain—this was far from over.

I still couldn't believe I had actually agreed to this.

Staring at my reflection in the mirror, I frowned. The navy-blue business suit I wore looked like it belonged to someone at least a decade older. Oliver had been right—I could easily pass for his mother.

For a brief moment, doubt crept in. Would the teachers really buy this? I was too young, wasn’t I? But then I slipped into one of my mother’s tailored blazers, adjusted the collar, and—oh. The transformation was instant.

A glance at the clock sent my pulse racing. My Uber would be here any minute.

What exactly did Oliver do to get in trouble? I should’ve asked. Now I had to improvise—channel the fury of a disappointed parent, scold him sternly, maybe even demand consequences.

My fingers combed through my loose waves. Should I tie it back? A low ponytail might make me look more authoritative.

A nervous laugh escaped me. If this fails, my backup plan is seducing the teacher. Beatrice would absolutely say that if she knew what I was doing today.

A car horn blared outside.

Time was up.

I took a deep breath, gave myself one last critical look, then grabbed my purse and bolted downstairs.

And froze.

My mother—awake, dressed, and sipping coffee in the living room—was the last thing I expected.

She glanced up, her lips curving slightly as she tilted her head toward the kitchen. "I made coffee if you want some."

"You made coffee?" The words slipped out before I could stop them.

Her eyebrow arched. "I am capable of basic tasks, Lillian."

Heat rushed to my cheeks. "That’s not what I meant. It’s just… you haven’t been up much lately. I’m glad you’re out of bed."

She took another slow sip. "I decided it’s time for changes. Can’t do that hiding under blankets, can I?"

Emotion swelled in my chest. I rounded the couch and pulled her into a hug.

For a second, she stiffened—then melted against me, resting her head on my shoulder.

Then she pulled back, frowning.

"Are you wearing my clothes?"

I swallowed hard.

Busted.

"I have an interview," I lied, smoothing down the fabric of my borrowed blazer. "I needed something professional to wear."

"Would this job pay well?" my mother asked, her eyes lighting up with cautious hope.

I nodded, forcing a confident smile. "Maybe even enough to start paying off Dad's debt."

Her face brightened further, and she reached out to squeeze my hand. "I have a meeting with his lawyers today to discuss some options they might have found," she said. "I'll keep you posted on what they say."

I nodded again, though my stomach twisted with guilt. "I'll be home a little later, and we can talk then," I assured her.

Outside, the Uber driver's impatient honking grew louder. If I didn’t leave now, he’d drive off without me.

"I have to go," I said, pressing a quick kiss to her cheek. "Love you."

"Love you too, Lillian," she murmured, her voice tinged with worry.

I dashed out of the house and slid into the backseat of the waiting car. The ride to the school was silent, the tension in my chest tightening with every passing mile. By the time the driver pulled up to the curb, my pulse was racing.

"Thanks," I muttered, slipping out before he could respond.

The school halls were eerily quiet, most students already in class. The main office wasn’t far—just past the front entrance—but each step felt heavier than the last.

Behind the reception desk, a young blonde woman was typing furiously, her attention locked on her screen. She didn’t even glance up as I approached.

I cleared my throat. Once. Twice.

Finally, she sighed and lifted her gaze, her perfectly arched brows rising in question. "Can I help you?"

"Yes," I said, straightening my shoulders. "I’m here to see the headmaster."

She tilted her head, assessing me with a slow, deliberate sweep of her eyes. "And you are?"

"Lillian Whitaker," I lied smoothly. "Oliver’s mother."

For a second, she just stared. Then her lips twitched. A snort escaped her, quickly turning into full-blown laughter. She leaned back in her chair, clutching her stomach as if I’d told the funniest joke in the world.

My cheeks burned.

Of course she saw right through me. If I were Mrs. Whitaker, that would mean I was married to Sebastian Blackwood—and everyone knew Sebastian was the most notorious bachelor in the city.

I should’ve thought this through. But the lie was already out there.

And now, I couldn’t take it back.
###Chapter 71 It’s not that simple

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains, stirring Lillian from her restless sleep. She blinked, her mind still foggy from the whirlwind of emotions that had consumed her the night before. The scent of Donovan still lingered in her memory, a bitter reminder of the past she couldn’t escape.

Rolling out of bed, she padded to the window and pushed the curtains aside. The pack grounds were already bustling with activity—warriors training, maids tending to the gardens, and children laughing as they played near the fountain. It was a stark contrast to the storm raging inside her.

A soft knock at the door pulled her from her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, smoothing her tousled hair.

The door creaked open, and Beatrice stepped inside, balancing a tray of breakfast in her hands. "Morning, sleepyhead," she teased, setting the tray on the bedside table. "You look like you wrestled a bear all night."

Lillian managed a weak smile. "Feels like it."

Beatrice studied her for a moment before sighing. "Donovan again?"

Lillian didn’t answer, instead reaching for the steaming cup of coffee. The rich aroma filled her senses, offering a small comfort.

"You can’t keep letting him haunt you like this," Beatrice said, sitting beside her. "He’s moved on. You should too."

Lillian’s grip tightened around the cup. "It’s not that simple."

Beatrice opened her mouth to argue, but another knock interrupted her. This time, it was Sebastian’s deep voice that followed. "Lillian? Are you awake?"

Her heart skipped a beat. "Y-yes," she stammered, hastily setting the coffee down.

Sebastian entered, his towering frame filling the doorway. His piercing gaze swept over her, lingering on the dark circles beneath her eyes. "You didn’t sleep well."

It wasn’t a question.

Lillian shrugged. "Just a rough night."

Sebastian’s jaw tightened, but he didn’t press further. Instead, he held out a folded piece of paper. "This arrived for you."

Frowning, Lillian took it and unfolded it. Her breath hitched as she recognized Donovan’s handwriting.

"We need to talk. Alone. Tonight at the old oak by the river. 8 PM."

Her fingers trembled slightly. What could he possibly want now?

Sebastian’s voice was dangerously calm. "What does it say?"

Lillian hesitated, then handed him the note. His expression darkened as he read it.

"You’re not going," he stated, crumpling the paper in his fist.

Lillian lifted her chin. "I have to."

Sebastian’s eyes flashed with something fierce—possessiveness, anger, protectiveness. "No. It’s a trap."

Beatrice, sensing the tension, cleared her throat. "Maybe we should—"

"I’ll handle this," Sebastian cut in, his tone leaving no room for argument. He turned on his heel and strode out, slamming the door behind him.

Lillian exhaled shakily, her mind racing. She couldn’t ignore Donovan’s summons, not when he had the power to unravel everything she’d built. But defying Sebastian? That was a risk she wasn’t sure she could take.

Beatrice squeezed her shoulder. "What are you going to do?"

Lillian met her friend’s worried gaze. "I don’t know," she admitted. "But I can’t let him control me anymore."

The clock on the wall ticked ominously, counting down to the moment her past and present would collide. And this time, there was no guarantee she’d walk away unscathed.

Sebastian Blackwood strode confidently to the chairs and settled into one, his fingers still entwined with mine in a gentle but possessive hold. His presence alone commanded the room, and Headmaster Wellington shifted uncomfortably under his piercing gaze.

"So, enlighten us about what our son has done," Sebastian said, his voice smooth but edged with authority. The headmaster cleared his throat, glancing between us with obvious unease.

"Oliver was involved in a physical altercation yesterday in the lunchroom," he explained, making my breath hitch. "We have a strict no-violence policy, and the only reason he wasn’t expelled is due to his status as a Blackwood. I wanted to discuss appropriate disciplinary measures with you."

I expected Sebastian to immediately demand consequences—Oliver shouldn’t be fighting, after all. But what I didn’t anticipate was the way his expression darkened, not with anger toward our son, but with quiet disapproval directed at the headmaster.

Sebastian leaned back in his chair, assessing the man before him with unnerving calm. "And what provoked Oliver to fight? Did you bother to ask?"

The question caught me off guard—it was a fair one. I turned to Headmaster Wellington, waiting.

"I... I’m not entirely certain of the details," the headmaster admitted, his brows knitting together.

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "You didn’t think to question him before summoning us here? Oliver isn’t the type to lash out without cause."

He was right. Oliver had chased off tutors before, but only because they’d been cruel or manipulative, trying to use him to get closer to his father. Beneath his occasional defiance, he was just a lonely little boy who longed for attention—but never the kind that would jeopardize his place at school. He worked too hard for that.

"Regardless of the reason, he broke school rules," Headmaster Wellington insisted, crossing his arms. "I understand he’s your son, Alpha Blackwood, but his behavior cannot go unchecked."

"His behavior?" I finally spoke up, my voice sharp. "You don’t even know what happened, yet you’re ready to punish him? What if he was defending himself? Why aren’t the other parents here? Are you disciplining their child as well?"

"The other boy suffered a broken nose and had to be sent to the infirmary," the headmaster said, his frown deepening.

Sebastian’s fingers flexed around mine, his patience visibly thinning. "So you’re telling me," he said, voice dangerously low, "that you called us here to punish our son without even hearing his side of the story?"

The headmaster paled.

And that was when the door burst open.

"And how do you know he didn't deserve it?" Sebastian asked, his voice low and dangerous.

"Alpha, I—"

"My wife and I have raised our son to defend himself when necessary," Sebastian interrupted, his grip tightening slightly around my fingers. "So I find it difficult to believe Oliver would strike another child without provocation."

Heat rushed to my cheeks at the way he called me his wife. I shot him a glance, catching the faint upward curve of his lips—like he was barely suppressing a smirk.

Biting back my own smile, I turned my attention back to Headmaster Wellington.

"Bring him here," I said, relieved that my voice carried more authority than I felt. "We’ll hear his side of the story."

The headmaster swallowed hard before nodding and reaching for his phone.

"Please send Oliver Blackwood to my office immediately," he instructed, then hung up with a shaky exhale.

Sebastian gave a satisfied nod. The silence that followed was thick, stretching uncomfortably long. His thumb traced slow circles over the back of my hand, and every so often, he’d tuck a loose strand of hair behind my ear—a deliberate display of affection meant for the headmaster’s benefit. But the effect on me was undeniable; my pulse fluttered wildly beneath my skin.

Then the door creaked open.

Oliver stepped inside, his small frame stiffening the second his eyes landed on Sebastian.

"D-Dad?"
###Chapter 72 Lillian's POV

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, painting the marble floors in warm hues. Lillian stretched lazily in the oversized bed, her fingers brushing against the cool silk sheets. The scent of sandalwood and something distinctly Sebastian lingered in the air, making her pulse quicken.

She had barely opened her eyes when the bedroom door creaked open. Oliver, Sebastian’s seven-year-old son, peeked inside, his dark curls tousled from sleep. "Lillian?" he whispered, as if afraid to wake her fully.

She smiled, propping herself up on one elbow. "Good morning, sweetheart."

Oliver shuffled closer, clutching a stuffed wolf toy to his chest. "Papa said you’re staying with us now. Forever?"

Lillian’s heart squeezed. The innocence in his voice was almost too much to bear. She reached out, ruffling his hair. "For as long as you’ll have me."

A satisfied grin spread across Oliver’s face before he scampered off, likely to find his father. Lillian exhaled, sinking back into the pillows. Forever. The word echoed in her mind, both thrilling and terrifying.

Downstairs, the penthouse buzzed with activity. The clinking of silverware and the rich aroma of coffee filled the air. Sebastian stood by the grand dining table, dressed in a tailored navy suit, his sharp jawline shadowed with the barest hint of stubble. His gaze flicked to her the moment she descended the stairs, dark eyes simmering with something unreadable.

"Sleep well?" he asked, his voice a low rumble that sent shivers down her spine.

Lillian nodded, suddenly hyper-aware of how underdressed she was in one of his oversized shirts. "Better than I have in months."

Sebastian’s lips curved into a smirk. "Good. You’ll need your energy today."

Before she could ask what he meant, Beatrice burst through the front door, her cheeks flushed. "Lillian! You won’t believe what just happened!"

Lillian blinked. "What?"

Beatrice grabbed her arm, dragging her toward the foyer. "Donovan and Evelyn are here—at the Blackwood Tower! They’re demanding to see Sebastian!"

Lillian’s blood ran cold. Donovan. Her ex-fated mate, the man who had betrayed her without a second thought. And Evelyn, the she-wolf he had chosen over her.

Sebastian’s expression darkened. "Let them wait."

But Lillian shook her head, squaring her shoulders. "No. I’ll handle this."

Sebastian studied her for a long moment before nodding. "Marcus," he called to his Beta, who materialized instantly. "Go with her."

As Lillian strode toward the elevator, her heart pounded, but her steps never faltered. She had spent too long running from her past. It was time to face it—head-on.

The elevator doors slid open, revealing Donovan and Evelyn standing in the opulent lobby, their presence like a stain on the pristine marble. Donovan’s eyes locked onto hers, widening in shock. "Lillian?"

She crossed her arms, tilting her chin up. "You have five minutes. Start talking."

Evelyn sneered, stepping forward. "Or what? You’ll cry to your new mate?"

Lillian’s lips curled into a cold smile. "No. But I will make you regret ever coming here."

The tension in the air crackled, thick enough to choke on.

And then—

The lobby doors burst open.

A figure stood silhouetted against the sunlight, tall and imposing.

Lillian’s breath caught.

Because standing there, with a smirk that promised chaos, was none other than Alpha Harrison.

The man who had tried to take advantage of her when she was vulnerable.

And he wasn’t alone.

Behind him, a dozen armed warriors filed in, their eyes glowing with predatory intent.

Sebastian’s voice cut through the silence like a blade.

"Get behind me."

Lillian didn’t move.

This time, she wasn’t running.

This time—she would fight.

"W-what are you doing here?" Oliver stammered, his eyes widening as he stared up at his father.

Sebastian arched a brow, his piercing gaze locked onto his son. "I was called in for a parent-teacher conference," he explained smoothly. "Imagine my surprise when I saw your mother already here."

Oliver’s gaze flickered to me, his cheeks flushing a deep crimson—mirroring the heat rising in my own face.

"My... mother?" he whispered, suddenly finding the floor far more interesting than either of us.

"Yes," Sebastian murmured, his fingers brushing a loose strand of hair behind my ear before trailing down my cheek. A shiver raced down my spine, my skin prickling with goosebumps. "I thought she had work today and wouldn’t be able to make it. Color me surprised when I saw her sitting here."

Oliver lifted his head, his eyes darting between us, confusion and disbelief swirling in their depths. He looked just as lost as I felt. Clearly, he hadn’t expected his father to play along with this charade.

"I... I asked her to come instead," Oliver admitted, shifting uncomfortably in his seat. "I didn’t want you to be mad at me."

Sebastian leaned back, his expression unreadable. "And you thought I wouldn’t understand?"

Oliver bit his lower lip, nodding hesitantly. "I didn’t want you to be disappointed in me," he murmured. "I’m sorry, Dad."

Sebastian’s gaze never wavered. "Then tell me exactly what happened. Why did you hit that boy?"

Oliver’s eyes flicked to me again, his face burning even hotter. I could tell he didn’t want to say it aloud. My curiosity spiked—what had pushed him to lash out? But I quickly reminded myself that this wasn’t my business. I wasn’t really his mother.

Come to think of it, I wasn’t even sure who his mother was.

I knew Sebastian’s fated mate had died in childbirth years ago, but was it during Victoria’s birth or Oliver’s? If it was Victoria’s, then Oliver would have had to come from another woman. The truth was, I hadn’t even known Sebastian had a son until I started tutoring him. He’d been kept out of the public eye for so long that I found myself more intrigued by their family dynamics than anything else.

"I can leave if you’d rather speak to your father alone," I offered, starting to rise—but Sebastian’s hand closed around my wrist, holding me in place.

"Whatever you need to say to me, you can say in front of your mother," he said firmly, his eyes never leaving Oliver.

Oliver swallowed hard, twisting his fingers together before finally speaking.

"He was telling me I was motherless and unwanted," he whispered, his voice barely audible. "That not even my own father wanted me. He said I’d never be important to the Blackwood family." His fists clenched. "I was about to walk away, but then he—"

His words cut off, his jaw tightening.

Sebastian’s expression darkened. "But then he what?"

Oliver exhaled sharply. "He said Mom was better off dead."

A heavy silence fell over the room.

Sebastian’s grip on my wrist tightened almost imperceptibly before he released me, his voice dangerously calm.

"Tell me his name."

Oliver hesitated. "It doesn’t matter—"

"His name, Oliver."

Oliver flinched at the steel in his father’s tone. "Lucas Pembroke."

Sebastian’s lips curled into a cold smile. "Ah. The principal’s nephew."

My stomach twisted. This wasn’t just some random bully—this was a calculated attack.

And Sebastian Blackwood never let an insult go unanswered.

The cafeteria had been crowded, the usual lunchtime chaos swirling around us. But then he pushed me—hard—and spat venomous words that cut deeper than any blade.

"You don't deserve the last name Blackwood. And your mother? She probably killed herself because of you."

Something inside me snapped.

Before I could think, my fist connected with his face. A sickening crack echoed, and blood gushed from his nose. I had forgotten my own strength.

I gasped, clapping a hand over my mouth as the reality of what I'd done crashed over me. Sebastian's grip on my wrist loosened as he listened, his usually composed expression cracking. His eyes widened as he stared at Oliver, his son, standing there with trembling fists.

"I'm sorry, Dad," Oliver whispered, voice thick with emotion. "I know I'm not supposed to fight, but I couldn't just—"

Sebastian lifted a hand, silencing him before he could finish. My instinct was to protest—how could he dismiss Oliver like that? But then Sebastian turned toward Headmaster Wellington, and the air in the room turned to ice.

His voice was lethally calm.

"As I said before, my son doesn't act without reason. Now, I want to know what you intend to do about the boy who provoked him."

The headmaster paled, his gaze darting between Oliver, Sebastian, and me. "I—I had no idea, Mr. Blackwood. I'm so sorry—"

"No, you didn't," Sebastian cut in, his tone sharp as steel. "You didn’t bother to ask. You were quick to accuse Oliver without giving him a chance to explain." He leaned forward slightly, his dominance pressing down on the room. "As the largest shareholder of this institution, I expect that boy to be suspended immediately. And if he so much as breathes another insult toward anyone—especially my son—he will be expelled. As for Oliver? No punishment is necessary."

Sebastian stood, his presence commanding the space. He took my hand again, pulling me up with him.

"He’s coming home for the rest of the day," Sebastian declared, leaving no room for argument.

Headmaster Wellington swallowed hard, nodding. "Y-yes, of course, Mr. Blackwood. My apologies for the misunderstanding."

Sebastian strode toward the door but paused just before opening it.

"Oh, and you'll need a new receptionist," he added casually. "My Beta just fired yours."

With that, he yanked the door open and stormed out, dragging me along in his wake.
###Chapter 73 The Hidden Truth

The morning sun cast golden rays through the sheer curtains of Lillian’s bedroom, stirring her from restless dreams. She sat up abruptly, her heart pounding as fragments of last night’s confrontation with Donovan flashed through her mind. The scent of betrayal still clung to her skin, bitter and suffocating.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Lillian? Are you awake?" Beatrice’s voice was muffled through the door.

Lillian swallowed hard, forcing her voice steady. "Yeah, come in."

Beatrice slipped inside, her usually bright eyes shadowed with concern. "You look terrible," she blurted, then winced. "Sorry. I mean—"

Lillian managed a weak laugh. "It’s fine. I feel terrible."

Beatrice perched on the edge of the bed, hesitating before speaking. "I heard what happened. Donovan and Evelyn…"

Lillian’s fingers tightened around the sheets. "Yeah. Turns out I was just a placeholder until he found his real mate."

Beatrice scowled. "That bastard. I always knew he was slimy."

Lillian sighed, rubbing her temples. "It doesn’t matter now. I just need to move on."

But moving on wasn’t that simple. Not when Donovan had been her first love, her first heartbreak. Not when the entire pack had witnessed her humiliation.

Beatrice nudged her shoulder. "You know what you need? A distraction. Let’s go to the café. Gabrielle just got a new espresso machine, and I heard she’s making killer caramel macchiatos."

Lillian hesitated. The thought of facing the crowded campus made her stomach churn. But hiding forever wasn’t an option.

"Fine," she relented. "But if anyone so much as looks at me with pity, I’m out."

Beatrice grinned. "Deal."

The café buzzed with chatter, the rich aroma of coffee wrapping around them like a comforting blanket. Gabrielle waved from behind the counter, her smile warm. "Lillian! I was hoping you’d stop by."

Lillian forced a smile. "Hey, Gabrielle."

Gabrielle’s expression softened. "I heard about… everything. If you need anything, just say the word."

Lillian nodded, grateful but exhausted by the sympathy. Beatrice quickly steered her toward a secluded corner table.

"See? Not so bad," Beatrice said, sliding into the chair opposite her.

Lillian sipped her coffee, the sweetness doing little to soothe the bitterness in her chest.

Then the door swung open.

Sebastian Blackwood strode in, his presence commanding the room’s attention. His sharp gaze swept the café before landing on Lillian.

Her breath hitched.

He approached without hesitation, his voice low but firm. "We need to talk."

Lillian’s pulse spiked. "About what?"

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "About why Donovan’s sudden mate bond with Evelyn reeks of deception."

Lillian’s cup clattered against the saucer.

What?

Beatrice’s eyes widened. "Wait, you think it’s fake?"

Sebastian’s expression darkened. "I know it is. And I intend to prove it."

Lillian’s mind reeled. If Donovan had lied about the mate bond…

Then everything she thought she knew was a lie.

And Sebastian Blackwood was the only one who could help her uncover the truth.

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, illuminating the spacious living area where Lillian sat curled up on the plush sofa. A steaming cup of coffee rested on the table in front of her, its rich aroma mingling with the faint scent of cedarwood—Sebastian’s signature scent.

She sighed, flipping through the pages of her textbook, but her mind was elsewhere. Last night’s argument with Donovan still lingered in her thoughts like a stubborn shadow. His words had been sharp, laced with bitterness, and though she had tried to remain composed, the sting of betrayal still burned.

The sound of footsteps pulled her from her reverie. Sebastian strode into the room, his tall frame exuding effortless authority. His dark hair was slightly tousled, as if he’d just run his fingers through it, and his piercing blue eyes locked onto hers.

“You’re up early,” he remarked, his voice low and smooth.

Lillian forced a small smile. “Couldn’t sleep.”

Sebastian studied her for a moment before crossing the room and settling beside her. The warmth of his presence was both comforting and electrifying.

“Donovan?” he guessed, his tone neutral.

She exhaled sharply. “It’s like he can’t let go. He keeps insisting we were meant to be, even though he’s the one who walked away.”

Sebastian’s jaw tightened imperceptibly. “He’s a fool.”

Lillian blinked, surprised by the vehemence in his voice. Before she could respond, the sound of tiny footsteps pattering down the hallway interrupted them. Oliver, Sebastian’s seven-year-old son, bounded into the room, his face alight with excitement.

“Lillian! Are we still going to the park today?” he asked, bouncing on the balls of his feet.

She chuckled, ruffling his hair. “Of course we are. Just let me finish this Chapter first.”

Sebastian watched the exchange, something unreadable flickering in his gaze. Then, abruptly, he stood. “I have a meeting with Alpha Harrison in an hour. I’ll be back by noon.”

Lillian nodded, though a part of her wished he would stay.

As Sebastian turned to leave, Oliver tugged at his sleeve. “Dad, can we get ice cream after the park?”

Sebastian’s stern expression softened. “We’ll see.”

The moment the door clicked shut behind him, Oliver leaned in conspiratorially. “He always says ‘we’ll see,’ but that means yes.”

Lillian laughed, the weight on her chest lifting slightly. Maybe today wouldn’t be so bad after all.

But just as she was about to return to her book, her phone buzzed. A message from Evelyn flashed on the screen:

“We need to talk. It’s about Donovan.”

Her stomach twisted. What now?

Oliver trailed closely behind us, his small footsteps barely making a sound on the pavement.



We didn’t stop until we reached the car where Marcus Grayson waited, his posture rigid with tension. The other Gamma warriors stood guard at a careful distance—close enough to intervene if needed, but far enough to grant us privacy.

Sebastian Blackwood finally released my hand, his grip lingering for a fraction of a second before he turned to face us. His voice was low, controlled, but the storm in his eyes betrayed his anger.

"Care to explain what the hell you two were thinking?"

My gaze dropped to the ground, guilt twisting in my chest.

"It's my fault, Dad," Oliver blurted out before I could speak. His small hands clenched into fists at his sides. "I asked Lillian to pretend to be my mom. I didn’t want you to be upset. I was scared, so I begged her to help me during our tutoring session last night."

Sebastian’s piercing gaze flicked to me, his expression unreadable.

"And you agreed?" His voice was dangerously soft.

I swallowed hard. "I should have asked more questions. I’m an Alpha. I never meant to deceive you."

His jaw tightened. "You both acted recklessly. Did you honestly think no one would question my marital status? The entire world would know if I had remarried."

I bit my lower lip, nodding. "I wasn’t thinking clearly. I shouldn’t have implied we were married. I’m sorry."

He exhaled sharply, shaking his head as if disappointed. The weight of his disapproval made me feel like a child being scolded.

"Please, don’t be mad at her," Oliver pleaded, grabbing his father’s sleeve. "It was my idea. Lillian was just trying to help."

Sebastian’s gaze hardened. "She’s the adult. She should have known better."

I blinked back the sting of tears. "It’s all right, Oliver. You don’t need to defend me." Turning to Sebastian, I straightened my shoulders. "If you want to fire me, I understand. I’ll find another job."

For a long moment, he just stared at me, his expression unreadable. Then, with a frustrated sigh, he rolled his eyes and strode toward the car without another word.

I watched his retreating back, confusion knotting my stomach.

Oliver glanced up at me, equally bewildered, before shrugging and following his father.

I remained rooted in place, unsure if I was meant to follow or if this was my dismissal.

It wasn’t until they were both inside the car that Marcus gave me a subtle nod—permission, or perhaps pity.

The moment I slid into the backseat of the sleek black car, Sebastian Blackwood’s piercing gaze flicked toward me.

"Get in. We don’t have all day," he muttered, his voice low and edged with impatience.

I quickly settled beside Oliver, who was already nestled against the plush leather seats. Marcus Grayson, ever the efficient Beta, had raised the privacy partition, sealing us off from the front. The city traffic was a sluggish river of red taillights, stretching our journey back to Sebastian’s villa longer than usual.

At some point, Oliver’s breathing evened out, his small head lolling onto my arm. The weight of him was warm, comforting.

Sebastian exhaled sharply, his eyes lingering on the sleeping boy.

"I’m sorry," I whispered, careful not to disturb Oliver. "For today. I shouldn’t have gone along with it."

His jaw tightened. "No, you shouldn’t have." The words were clipped, but his tone remained hushed—an unexpected consideration.

I turned my face toward the window, watching the blur of city lights. What else was there to say?

Then, quietly, he added, "But thank you for being there for him."

My breath hitched. I twisted back to face him, blinking. "You’re thanking me?"

"Don’t let it go to your head," he murmured, though something in his gaze softened. "Oliver doesn’t have a mother figure. It’s… good that you were there when he needed one."

A smile tugged at my lips before I could stop it.

Curiosity burned in my chest. "This might be bold, but… who is Oliver’s mother?"

Silence. Heavy and thick.

For a moment, I thought he wouldn’t answer. That he’d shut me out like he always did.

Then his eyes met mine. "My sister."

I stiffened. "What?"

"Don’t misunderstand," he said sharply. "Oliver is my sister’s son. I’m his uncle."

The realization crashed over me—Oliver wasn’t Sebastian’s child. That explained why his identity had been shrouded in secrecy all this time.

My voice dropped to a whisper. "What happened to her?"

His fingers flexed against his knee. "She’s in rehab. Getting the help she needs. Oliver was taken from her when he was young. It wasn’t a safe place for him." A pause. "I didn’t want him growing up in the system, so I took him in. He started calling me 'Dad' a few years ago."

The weight of his words settled between us, heavy with unspoken pain.

And for the first time, I saw Sebastian Blackwood not just as the formidable Lycan chairman—but as a man who had shouldered a burden he never asked for.

###Chapter 74 - Lillian's POV

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, illuminating the scattered papers on his desk. Lillian stirred in the massive bed, her limbs tangled in silk sheets, the scent of sandalwood and musk lingering in the air.

She blinked sleepily, her mind still foggy from last night’s events. The gala, the whispers, the way Donovan had stared at her from across the room—like a predator eyeing its prey.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Miss Lillian?" Giselle Beaumont, the head maid, peeked in, her expression carefully neutral. "Mr. Blackwood requests your presence in his study."

Lillian swallowed. "Now?"

Giselle nodded. "He mentioned it was urgent."

Urgent. The word sent a shiver down her spine.

She dressed quickly, slipping into a simple but elegant black dress—one of the many Sebastian had insisted on adding to her wardrobe. The fabric hugged her curves, the neckline dipping just low enough to be daring without crossing into indecent.

When she entered the study, Sebastian was standing by the window, his broad shoulders tense beneath his tailored suit. He didn’t turn as she approached, but she felt the shift in the air—the way his presence seemed to hum with restrained energy.

"You wanted to see me?" she asked, her voice steadier than she felt.

Finally, he turned. His golden eyes burned with an intensity that made her breath hitch. "We have a problem."

Lillian frowned. "What kind of problem?"

Sebastian exhaled sharply, running a hand through his dark hair. "Donovan."

Her stomach twisted. "What about him?"

"He’s making moves," Sebastian said, his voice low and dangerous. "Last night wasn’t just a social call. He was testing our defenses, looking for weaknesses."

Lillian crossed her arms. "And?"

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "And he’s not working alone."

A chill settled over her. "Who else is involved?"

Before he could answer, the door burst open. Marcus Grayson, Sebastian’s beta, strode in, his expression grim. "We just got word. Alpha Harrison’s pack is mobilizing near the northern border."

Sebastian’s eyes darkened. "Harrison?"

Marcus nodded. "He’s allied with Donovan. They’re planning something big."

Lillian’s pulse spiked. "What do they want?"

Sebastian met her gaze, his voice barely above a growl. "You."

The word hung in the air, heavy with implication.

Lillian’s fingers curled into fists. "Then let them try."

A slow, predatory smile curved Sebastian’s lips. "That’s exactly what I wanted to hear."

But before he could say more, his phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, his expression hardening. "It’s Victoria."

Lillian stiffened. Sebastian’s daughter had been engaged to Donovan before everything fell apart. If she was calling now…

Sebastian answered, his voice clipped. "What is it?"

The voice on the other end was frantic, the words too muffled for Lillian to make out. But she didn’t need to hear them to know—something was very, very wrong.

Sebastian’s grip on the phone tightened. "We’re on our way."

He hung up, his gaze locking onto Lillian’s. "Victoria’s been taken."

Lillian’s blood ran cold.

Sebastian’s next words sent a fresh wave of dread through her.

"And Donovan left a message."

He held out his phone. On the screen, a single sentence glared back at them:

"Come and get her, Alpha. If you dare."

The game had just changed.

And Lillian was right in the middle of it.

"And he knows that you aren't his biological father?" I asked softly, glancing down at a peacefully sleeping Oliver.

Sebastian nodded, his expression unreadable.

"Yes," he murmured. "He remembers his life with his mother. It wasn’t... easy. He still has nightmares sometimes." A shadow crossed his face before he continued, "He started calling me 'Dad' a few years after he came to live with me."

My heart clenched at the thought of Sebastian—a man known for his ruthless business dealings—being so tender with a child who wasn’t even his by blood. He treated Oliver as if he were his own, and I had never once doubted that bond.

"He’s family," Sebastian said simply, as if that explained everything.

I wanted to say more—to tell him how much I admired him for it—but the words stuck in my throat. What could I possibly say that wouldn’t sound trite? So instead, I stayed silent until the car rolled to a stop in front of the grand Blackwood estate.

"We should probably wake him," I suggested, smoothing a hand over Oliver’s tousled hair. "We have lessons to get through today."

Sebastian agreed with a quiet hum.

Gently, I nudged Oliver awake, brushing my fingers along his cheek. He looked so serene in sleep, his lashes fluttering as he stirred. A pang of guilt hit me for disturbing him, but soon his eyes blinked open, drowsy and disoriented.

"Are we home?" he mumbled, rubbing his eyes.

"Yes," I answered at the same time Sebastian said, "We are."

Our voices overlapped, and when our eyes met, warmth spread across my cheeks. Sebastian’s lips quirked in amusement, and I quickly looked away before he could comment.

Oliver, now fully awake, suddenly threw his arms around me. "Thanks for helping today," he said, squeezing tight. "You were a really good mom."

My face burned.

Sebastian’s smirk deepened, and I hastily pushed the car door open, desperate to escape the moment. "Let’s go inside and get started," I said, stepping out before either of them could see how flustered I was.

Behind me, Oliver’s laughter rang out, bright and carefree.

Third Person POV

"Remind me again why we’re preparing a feast fit for royalty," Donovan muttered, eyeing the elaborate spread of dishes the maids had arranged across the dining table.

Victoria had been in a frenzy all morning, darting between the kitchen and the dining room like a woman possessed. Every platter had to be perfect, every garnish placed just so.

"Because my cousin Nathaniel is visiting from France!" she exclaimed, adjusting the placement of a silver serving tray. "I haven’t seen him since we were children, and this is his first time here. Everything has to be perfect!"

"Which country? And how long is he staying?"

"France," Victoria answered, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. "He's here for a month. He's a journalist working on a global exposé—wanted to start his research here."

Donovan arched a brow. "So, Nathaniel is your father's nephew?"

"Yes," she confirmed with a soft smile. "My father is the middle child—he has an older sister and a younger brother. His brother left the country years ago."

"For his mate?" Donovan guessed.

Victoria nodded, her expression thoughtful. "He went to France on business and met her there. She refused to leave her homeland, and he refused to leave without her. So, he stayed. Started fresh. They only had one child—Nathaniel. He's just a few years older than me, and already making waves in his field."

"Do you have a picture of him?" Donovan asked, curiosity lacing his tone. "I wonder if I've heard of him."

Victoria pulled out her phone and swiped to a photo of Nathaniel Whitlock. The man looked like he'd stepped off the cover of a fashion magazine—golden curls, piercing sapphire eyes, and a jawline sharp enough to cut glass. The resemblance to the Blackwood lineage was undeniable, from his sculpted features to his athletic build.

"You two could pass for siblings," Donovan remarked.

Victoria’s face lit up. "We heard that all the time growing up," she admitted. "We were close whenever I visited. France is beautiful, and I always had the best time with my father's family."

Donovan wrapped an arm around her shoulders, pulling her close. "Well, if he matters to you, he matters to me," he murmured, pressing a kiss to her temple. "Looking forward to meeting him."

She leaned into his touch, warmth flooding her chest. "He should be here any minute."

Just then, one of the maids approached. "Miss Dumont and Master Oliver have gone out back for sparring practice. Should we set the food in the parlor?"

###Chapter 75 She’s stunning

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood's penthouse, painting the marble floors with streaks of light. Lillian stretched lazily in the oversized bed, her fingers brushing against the cold silk sheets where Sebastian had been moments before. The scent of his expensive cologne still lingered, mingling with the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee drifting from the kitchen.

She padded barefoot across the room, her toes sinking into the plush carpet. The penthouse was eerily quiet, a stark contrast to the chaos of last night's pack meeting. Voices had risen, tempers had flared, and for the first time since she'd arrived, Lillian had seen the cracks in Sebastian's usually unshakable composure.

The kitchen was empty, save for a steaming mug of coffee left on the counter—black, just how she liked it. A small note rested beside it in Sebastian's precise handwriting: "Emergency meeting. Don't wait up."

Lillian sighed, wrapping her fingers around the warm ceramic. She didn't need to ask what the meeting was about. The tension between Sebastian and Alpha Maximilian Voss had been palpable, their rivalry escalating with each passing day. And now, with the upcoming Lycan Summit, the stakes were higher than ever.

Her phone buzzed on the counter, startling her. Beatrice's name flashed across the screen, followed by a string of frantic texts:

"Lil, you need to see this. NOW."
"It's all over social media."
"Call me ASAP."

Frowning, Lillian tapped the link Beatrice had sent. The screen loaded to reveal a grainy video—security footage from some upscale club. Her breath hitched as the camera zoomed in on a familiar figure: Donovan, his arm slung around a woman who wasn't Evelyn. They were laughing, his fingers tracing circles on her bare shoulder. The timestamp read last night.

Lillian's grip on the phone tightened. This wasn't just a scandal—it was a calculated move. Donovan knew the summit was days away, knew the media would eat this up. And if the packs saw their future Alpha Consort's ex-mate embroiled in controversy, it would reflect poorly on Sebastian.

The coffee turned bitter in her mouth. She needed to act fast.

Dumping the rest of the mug into the sink, she dialed Beatrice. "Meet me at the boutique in twenty. We have damage control to do."

Beatrice didn't argue. "I'll bring the big guns."

Lillian was already pulling on a leather jacket when the penthouse elevator dinged. The doors slid open to reveal Sebastian, his tailored suit immaculate but his expression stormy. Behind him, Marcus Grayson looked equally grim.

Sebastian's gaze locked onto hers. "You've seen it."

She nodded. "We need to spin this before it spins us."

A muscle ticked in his jaw. "I've already called a press conference."

Lillian shook her head. "No. Let me handle Donovan my way."

Sebastian's eyes darkened, but before he could protest, Marcus cleared his throat. "Alpha, the car's waiting. The council won't be patient."

For a heartbeat, Sebastian hesitated. Then he stepped forward, cupping Lillian's face. His thumb brushed her cheekbone, his voice low. "Be careful."

She leaned into his touch. "Always."

As the elevator doors closed behind them, Lillian exhaled sharply. Time to remind Donovan why crossing her was a mistake.

Her phone buzzed again—a new message from an unknown number:

"Looking forward to our reunion, little wolf."

The screen went black before she could reply.

Lillian's pulse spiked.

Game on.

"Natalia?" Donovan inquired.

Victoria giggled, her eyes sparkling with amusement. "Childhood nickname," she explained. "Nate, this is my fiancé, Donovan."

"Ah, the legendary Donovan. It's an honor to finally meet you. My cousin has told me so much," Nathaniel said, extending his hand for a firm shake.

"I've read some of your articles recently. You've made quite a name for yourself in France. Impressive work," Donovan remarked, his tone genuine.

"Why don't we move to the parlor? There's refreshments waiting," Victoria suggested, looping her arm through Nathaniel's and guiding him down the hall toward the cozy back room.

As they settled onto the plush couches and helped themselves to the spread of hors d'oeuvres, Nathaniel and Donovan fell into an animated discussion about business strategies and the future expansion of Nathaniel's media empire. Victoria listened with quiet pride, her heart swelling at how effortlessly the two most important men in her life connected.

"So, you're next in line to become Alpha after your father steps down?" Donovan asked after Nathaniel explained his lineage—his mother being the daughter of a former Alpha, his father assuming the role after her father's passing, making Nathaniel the sole heir.

Nathaniel owned a thriving French news magazine that was rapidly gaining international recognition. As part of the Whitlock family, they were already well-established, with extensive property holdings across France. While not as globally dominant as Sebastian Blackwood—the most powerful Lycan chairman in the world—the Whitlocks were still a force to be reckoned with, their wealth and influence undeniable. Donovan found himself fascinated by Nathaniel's stories, understanding exactly why Victoria adored him. Their bond was unmistakable—playful teasing, shared laughter—like siblings who had grown up side by side.

"Where’s my uncle, by the way?" Nathaniel asked, scanning the room as if expecting Sebastian to materialize out of thin air.

"He’s at the packhouse handling some business," Victoria answered. "He’ll likely join us later. He’s been spending more time there since Oliver got a new tutor."

"Another one?" Nathaniel arched a brow. "From what you’ve told me, this must be the tenth tutor he’s gone through."

Victoria nodded, biting her lip. "Yes, but I think this one might actually stick. Oliver seems to like her, and she’s lasted two weeks without any incidents. They’re outside now, practicing sparring and defense. Maybe you’ll meet her later—she’s really something."

"Sounds promising," Nathaniel murmured, reaching for a delicate finger sandwich. "These are delicious."

"Turkey and brie," Victoria said, taking one for herself. "My favorite. I had a feeling you’d like them too."

He grinned and took another bite.

"So, Donovan, Victoria tells me you’re set to become the next Alpha of the Redmoon pack. Congratulations are in order," Nathaniel said, raising his glass of sparkling cider in a toast.

"Not quite yet, but I’m working toward it," Donovan admitted, slipping an arm around Victoria, who nestled closer.

"Don’t listen to him, Nate. My father adores him. It’s practically a done deal—Donovan was born for this," Victoria declared.

"Your faith in me is touching, my love," Donovan murmured, pressing a kiss to the tip of her nose, eliciting a soft laugh from her.

"You two are nauseatingly sweet. I hope one day I’ll be lucky enough to find a love like that," Nathaniel sighed, leaning back into the cushions.

Just as the words left his lips, Lillian strode into the parlor, oblivious to the attention she commanded. Dressed in a fitted workout bra that accentuated her toned physique and snug shorts that hugged her curves, she was the picture of effortless allure.

Her hair was damp, tied into a high ponytail, sweat glistening along her collarbone and down her exposed shoulders. A faint flush colored her cheeks, her skin glowing with exertion. She was radiant—utterly breathtaking.

Donovan didn’t realize he was staring until she disappeared into the kitchen, breaking the spell.

"Who was that?" Nathaniel asked, his gaze locked on the doorway she’d vanished through.

"Oliver’s tutor, Lillian Montague," Victoria answered, a hint of pride in her voice.

The reply snapped Donovan back to reality, and he blinked at Nathaniel, whose attention remained fixed on the kitchen entrance. Moments later, Lillian reappeared, a water bottle in hand. She tipped it against the back of her neck, sighing softly as the cool liquid soothed her heated skin.

The sound sent an unexpected jolt through Donovan—and judging by the darkening of Nathaniel’s eyes, he wasn’t immune either.

Lillian took a long drink, water trickling down her chin as she swallowed. Her gaze flickered over them—first Donovan, then Victoria, before lingering on Nathaniel a beat too long. A small, knowing smile curved her lips before she capped the bottle and turned to leave, heading back outside to rejoin Oliver.

"Oh my goddess," Nathaniel breathed. "She’s stunning."

###Chapter 76 Lillian's POV


The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood's penthouse, painting the marble floors in warm hues. Lillian stretched beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming from last night's passionate encounter with the Lycan chairman.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. "Miss Lillian? Breakfast is ready," called Sophia Delacroix, the head maid.

"Thank you, Sophia. I'll be right down," Lillian replied, her voice still thick with sleep. She reached for her phone, only to find fifteen missed calls from Beatrice.

Her heart skipped a beat. Beatrice never called this early unless it was urgent.

Lillian dialed back immediately. "Bea? What's wrong?"

"Lil! Thank the Moon Goddess you picked up!" Beatrice's voice was frantic. "It's Donovan—he's been spotted near campus with Evelyn. They're causing a scene at the coffee shop, telling everyone you're a gold-digging whore who seduced Sebastian for his money!"

Lillian's blood ran cold. The audacity of that man! After everything he'd done—cheating on her, rejecting their bond, publicly humiliating her—now he dared to slander her reputation?

She threw off the covers, her werewolf instincts roaring to life. "I'm on my way."

Downstairs, Sebastian was already dressed in his usual tailored suit, sipping espresso while reading the financial news. He looked up as Lillian stormed into the dining room, her eyes blazing with fury.

"Donovan's at my college," she growled. "Spreading lies about us."

Sebastian's grip tightened around his cup, the delicate porcelain cracking under the pressure. "Marcus!" he barked.

His beta, Marcus Grayson, appeared instantly. "Alpha?"

"Get the car ready. We're going to campus."

Lillian shook her head. "No, Sebastian. This is my fight. I need to handle Donovan myself."

Sebastian's golden eyes darkened. "Like hell you will. That bastard's been a thorn in our side for too long." He stood, towering over her. "You're my mate now. No one insults you and walks away unscathed."

The possessive edge in his voice sent shivers down her spine. Still, she lifted her chin. "Then let me confront him first. If things escalate, you can step in."

After a tense silence, Sebastian nodded. "Fine. But I'm coming with you—discreetly."

Twenty minutes later, Lillian pushed through the crowd gathered outside Moonbean Café. Donovan stood on a table, his arm draped around Evelyn's shoulders as he spewed venomous lies.

"—abandoned her true mate for a richer Alpha! That's the kind of woman Lillian Whitaker is!"

The crowd gasped as Lillian stepped forward. "Funny," she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "I seem to recall you breaking our bond first when you fucked Evelyn behind my back."

Donovan's smirk faltered. "L-Lillian! I was just—"

"Just what? Trying to salvage your nonexistent reputation?" She climbed onto an adjacent table, meeting him at eye level. "Let me set the record straight for everyone."

She turned to the gathered students. "Donovan Winslow rejected me after two years together because his family wanted a 'better match.'" She gestured to Evelyn. "Enter Evelyn Fontaine, daughter of some minor European Alpha. But when Donovan realized Sebastian Blackwood—yes, the Sebastian Blackwood—wanted me as his mate, suddenly he developed regrets."

Murmurs spread through the crowd. Evelyn's face turned crimson. "That's not true!"

"Isn't it?" Lillian arched a brow. "Tell me, Evelyn, does Donovan still wake up screaming my name at night? Because the mate bond doesn't just disappear—no matter how many times he claims it does."

Donovan lunged at her—only to be intercepted by a wall of muscle as Sebastian materialized from the crowd, his canines elongated. "Touch her," he growled, "and I'll rip your throat out."

The crowd erupted into chaos. Someone screamed. Phones were raised to record the confrontation.

Then—a new voice cut through the noise.

"Enough!"

Everyone turned to see Headmaster Wellington striding forward, his expression thunderous. "Mr. Winslow, Miss Fontaine—my office. Now." He glared at Sebastian. "Alpha Blackwood, while I respect your position, this is a school matter."

Sebastian's jaw clenched, but he nodded. As Donovan and Evelyn were led away, Lillian exhaled shakily.

Sebastian pulled her close, whispering in her ear, "This isn't over."

And she knew—with bone-deep certainty—that Donovan had just made the biggest mistake of his life.

I wasn’t blind. The man lounging in the parlor with Victoria and Donovan was undeniably striking. There was something oddly familiar about him too. The way his gaze locked onto me—as if I were the only person in the world—sent heat rushing to my cheeks.

I blinked rapidly, offering him a hesitant smile before slipping out of the room and rejoining Evelyn outside. She was hurling daggers at the training dummies, her form noticeably sharper than before. When I approached, she paused, accepting the water bottle I handed her.

"Do you know if Victoria was expecting visitors today?" I asked, settling onto the grass beside her.

She glanced toward the villa, her brow furrowing in thought before recognition lit her eyes.

"My cousin Nathaniel is visiting for the month," Oliver answered. "I’ve only met him once, but I think he was supposed to arrive today."

I frowned, turning the name over in my mind—then it clicked.

"Nathaniel Whitlock? The French journalist?" My eyebrows shot up.

Of course, I knew of Nathaniel Whitlock. But I’d assumed his last name being the same as Sebastian’s was just a coincidence. I never imagined he was actually related to Sebastian Blackwood and his family. Yet Oliver nodded, peering at me curiously.

"Yes," she said. "You’ve heard of him?"

"Obviously. His work is incredible," I admitted, shaking my head in disbelief. "I can’t believe you’re related to him."

"His last name is Whitlock," Oliver pointed out with a smirk.

"Yeah, but I thought it was just a coincidence," I confessed. "What’s he doing here?"

Oliver opened her mouth to respond, but a smooth, accented voice cut in from behind me, freezing me in place.

"I’m hunting for my next big story. Got any leads for me, Miss Dumont?"

I spun around to face Nathaniel as he strolled toward us, sunlight haloing his frame like some celestial being. He was undeniably handsome—though not quite as devastating as Sebastian. Still, the family resemblance was unmistakable.

I blinked hard, scrambling to regain my composure.

"Mr. Whitlock, it’s an honor," I said, extending my hand.

He studied my outstretched palm for a heartbeat before quirking a smirk. Instead of shaking it, he lifted my fingers to his lips, pressing a featherlight kiss to my knuckles.

"No formalities, please. Call me Nathaniel."

"Then you can call me Lillian," I countered.

"Lillian..." Nathaniel murmured, my name rolling off his tongue like a sweet melody. "What a beautiful name."

"How long are you staying in town, Nathaniel?" I asked, trying to keep my tone casual despite the way his gaze lingered on me.

"Only a month," he replied with a lazy smile. "Unless I find a compelling reason to extend my visit."

The unspoken suggestion in his words sent a shiver down my spine, and I swallowed hard. His eyes never left mine, dark and knowing.

"Oh, Lillian! I see you've met my cousin," Victoria chimed in, striding toward us with Donovan trailing behind her. Donovan's expression was thunderous as he glared at Nathaniel, and I couldn't help but wonder what his problem was.

"Yes," I said, straightening my shoulders. "He's quite charming."

Victoria laughed, looping her arm through Nathaniel's. "That's my cousin for you. We were inseparable growing up. I'm thrilled he's here—it's his first time in our country, and I was just about to show him around the pack. Want to join us?"

"I can't," I said, gesturing toward Oliver, who was back to hurling daggers at training dummies with impressive precision. "I still have work to do with Oliver."

Victoria pouted, disappointment clear on her face.

"Then we should probably get going," Donovan cut in, gripping Victoria's arm possessively. "We have places to be. Don't we, Nathaniel?"

Nathaniel's gaze remained locked on mine, a slow smirk curling his lips.

"Actually," he said smoothly, "I think I'll stay a little longer. Maybe I can be of some assistance to Lillian here."

I arched a brow. "You think you can help me?" I scoffed. "I don’t recall needing a journalist on the training field. But thanks." I turned to leave, but Victoria's voice stopped me.

"Actually, Nate has extensive warrior training," she explained. "He's set to become the next Alpha of the Black Moon pack in France once his father steps down. When he's not running his media empire, he's training with warriors, learning everything he needs to know about leadership."

Nathaniel's smirk deepened at her words, and I studied him with newfound interest.

"Is that so?" I challenged.

His eyes gleamed with mischief. "Would you like a demonstration?"

The air between us crackled with tension, and for the first time, I wondered if this charming, dangerous man might be more than he seemed.

###Chapter 77 That was insane!

"Allow me to demonstrate?" Nathaniel asked, stepping around me with effortless grace. He strode toward the archery set, slinging the quiver over his shoulder with practiced ease. Plucking an arrow from the quiver, he scooped up the bow from the ground and positioned himself before the target, standing just close enough to make it look effortless.

With a fluid motion, he nocked the arrow, drew back the string, and released. The arrow struck dead center in the blink of an eye. I nearly scoffed—anyone could hit a target from that distance. But then he took a deliberate step back, increasing the gap between himself and the mark.

Another arrow flew.

This one split the first clean down the middle.

My breath caught. I'd never seen anything like it.

Nathaniel didn’t stop. He kept retreating, each step widening the impossible distance, yet every arrow he loosed found its mark with terrifying precision, shattering the one before it. By the time he reached the far end of the field, he was little more than a distant silhouette against the horizon. Even Victoria squinted, struggling to make him out.

Then—thwack!

The final arrow didn’t just split its predecessor—it obliterated the target entirely, sending splinters flying as the wooden frame collapsed to the ground. The sheer force of the impact made all of us flinch.

My jaw practically hit the grass.

Nathaniel was already jogging back, his golden curls tousled by the wind, his shirt discarded somewhere along the way, revealing a torso sculpted from years of discipline. He wasn’t even winded when he stopped before us, a smug grin playing on his lips.

"That was insane!" Oliver blurted, bouncing on his toes. "How did you do that?"

"Practice," Nathaniel said, ruffling the boy’s hair. "Lots of it. I could teach you, if you’d like."

Oliver’s eyes lit up. "Yes! Please!"

I crossed my arms, tilting my head as I studied Nathaniel. "Impressive," I admitted, arching a brow. "But you do realize you just destroyed our entire set of arrows?"

He chuckled, pulling his phone from his pocket. With a few taps, he held it to his ear. "Get me a new archery set—top quality," he commanded whoever was on the other end. "Deliver it to my uncle’s villa." A pause. "Immediately."

He hung up without waiting for a response.

"You really do have connections," I mused, watching him carefully.

Nathaniel met my gaze, his voice dropping to a low, teasing murmur. "I never pretend to be anything I’m not."

A smirk tugged at my lips. "So, any other talents you’d care to show off?"

Was I flirting with him? The realization startled me. I didn’t flirt—not really. Not since Donovan, and certainly not like this. With Sebastian, my reactions had been raw, instinctive, my wolf responding before my mind could catch up. But with Nathaniel? It was different. Easy. Playful. Like a game where neither of us took the stakes too seriously.

His grin widened. "I do know a few defensive maneuvers."

"By all means," I said, gesturing for him to continue.

Before I could blink, his hand closed around my wrist. In one smooth motion, he spun me around, my back colliding with his chest. The world tilted—then suddenly, I was face-down in the grass, his weight pinning me effortlessly, his legs tangling with mine to keep me immobilized.

My pulse spiked—not with fear, but with something far more dangerous.

Challenge.
###Chapter 78 Years of practice

"Allow me to demonstrate?" Nathaniel asked, stepping around me with effortless grace. He strode toward the archery set, slinging the quiver over his shoulder with practiced ease. Plucking an arrow from it, he scooped up the bow from the ground and positioned himself before the target—close enough that I nearly scoffed.

With a fluid motion, he nocked the arrow, drew back the string, and released.

Thunk.

Bullseye.

I opened my mouth to tease him—anyone could hit a target from that distance—but then he stepped back, increasing the gap between himself and the mark. Another arrow flew, splitting the first one clean down the middle.

My breath caught.

He didn’t stop. Step by step, he retreated farther, each new arrow shattering the one before it with impossible precision. By the time he reached the far end of the field, he was little more than a distant silhouette against the horizon. Victoria squinted beside me, struggling to make him out.

Then—crack!

The final arrow struck with such force that the target itself splintered apart, collapsing into the grass.

Silence.

Then—Oliver erupted into cheers. "That was insane! How did you do that?"

Nathaniel jogged back toward us, his golden curls tousled by the wind, his shirt long discarded. Sunlight glinted off his toned torso, and though he had just sprinted across the field, he wasn’t even winded.

"Years of practice," he said, ruffling Oliver’s hair. "I could teach you, if you’d like."

"Yes!" Oliver nearly vibrated with excitement.

I crossed my arms, tilting my head. "Impressive," I admitted, though I kept my tone light. "But you do owe us a new set of arrows."

Nathaniel grinned, pulling his phone from his pocket. He dialed a number, pressed it to his ear, and issued a single command: "Get me the finest bow and arrow set available. Deliver it to my uncle’s villa."

He hung up without waiting for a response.

"You do have connections," I mused, eyeing him.

"I never pretend to be anything I’m not," he said, voice low.

I smirked. "Care to show off any other skills?"

Was I flirting with him? The realization startled me. I didn’t flirt—not really. Not with anyone except Donovan, and even that had been more necessity than desire. With Nathaniel, though, it felt like a game. Easy. Fun.

But it didn’t make my pulse race. Not like he did.

Nathaniel’s grin turned wolfish. "I do have a few defensive moves I could demonstrate."

"By all means," I said, gesturing for him to proceed.

In a blur of motion, he seized my arm, spun me around, and pinned me to the ground before I could react. His body pressed against my back, his legs trapping mine. Victoria gasped, clutching Donovan’s wrist as they watched.

"I guess you know a thing or two," I conceded, breathless.

Then—I twisted.

A sharp kick knocked him off balance, and in an instant, I reversed our positions, straddling him with a triumphant grin. "But so do I."

His hands settled on my hips, fingers flexing—

A furious snarl ripped through the air.

"What the hell do you think you’re doing?!"

I scrambled off Nathaniel so fast I nearly face-planted into the dirt. Whirling around, I found him—Sebastian—storming toward us, his expression thunderous.

"Get your hands off her!" he roared.
###Chapter 79 Show me."

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains, painting delicate patterns across the silk sheets. Lillian stirred, her body still humming with the lingering warmth of last night's passion. Beside her, Sebastian Blackwood lay sprawled, his muscular frame dominating the space, one arm draped possessively over her waist.

She bit her lip, resisting the urge to trace the scars that marred his chest—each one a story, a battle fought, a victory won. The man was a paradox—gentle yet ruthless, tender yet commanding. And he was hers.

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Alpha, you're needed in the conference room," Marcus Grayson's deep voice filtered through the wood.

Sebastian groaned, his grip tightening around Lillian. "Tell them to wait."

Lillian stifled a laugh. "You can't keep ignoring your duties."

He cracked one eye open, the silver in his irises glinting with mischief. "Watch me."

She rolled her eyes but couldn't suppress the flutter in her chest. This man—this Lycan—had turned her world upside down.

A second knock, more insistent this time.

Sebastian exhaled sharply before pressing a searing kiss to her lips. "This isn't over."

As he strode out, Lillian caught sight of the bite mark on his shoulder—her mark. Pride swelled within her.

But reality crashed in when her phone buzzed. A message from Evelyn:

"Donovan's back. And he's not alone."

Her blood ran cold.

Downstairs, the pack house buzzed with activity. Warriors moved with purpose, their expressions grim. Sebastian stood at the head of the table, his presence commanding silence.

"We have a problem," Marcus announced, projecting a holographic image of the northern border. "Rogues. At least two dozen, armed and organized."

Sebastian's jaw clenched. "This isn't random."

"No," Marcus agreed. "They're moving like they have a target."

Lillian's stomach twisted. Donovan.

Just then, Oliver burst into the room, his small face pale. "Dad! There's a man at the gates—he says he knows Lillian!"

Sebastian's eyes darkened to stormy gray. "Show me."

Lillian followed, dread coiling in her gut.

At the gates stood Donovan, smirking, flanked by unfamiliar warriors. His gaze locked onto hers, smug and triumphant.

"Miss me, sweetheart?"

Sebastian growled, the sound vibrating through the ground.

Lillian squared her shoulders. This wasn't just a confrontation—it was a declaration of war.

And she was ready.

"Pardon? What did you just say, Darling?" Her brows knitted together in deepening irritation.

"I'm going inside with Oliver," she bit out, her dark eyes flashing with barely contained fury. Without another glance, she turned on her heel and strode toward the mansion, Oliver trotting obediently beside her. Donovan's face drained of color as realization struck—he'd miscalculated.

"You might want to chase after her, lover boy," I remarked dryly, crossing my arms over my chest.

He didn’t grace me with a response, but the way he bolted after her spoke volumes. I shook my head, watching their retreating figures with mild amusement.

"Why do I get the feeling there’s history between you two?" Nathaniel’s voice pulled my attention back to him. If Sebastian caught us talking alone, he’d be livid. Honestly, I’d assumed Nathaniel had gone back inside during that tense standoff between Donovan and me. His lingering presence was unexpected—maybe even a little unnerving.

Despite having just met him, something about Nathaniel made me want to trust him. But revealing the truth about Donovan and me? That felt reckless. Given how close he seemed to Victoria—judging by their easy laughter and warm embrace earlier—I doubted he’d keep my secrets.

"There isn’t," I lied smoothly. "He’s just Victoria’s fiancé. We barely speak." Nathaniel tilted his head, studying me as if he could peel back the layers of my words. After a beat, he nodded, dropping the subject.

"Sorry if I made things awkward between you and your boss," he muttered, scuffing the ground like a chastised child. "He can be... a lot."

"That’s putting it mildly," I quipped. "Don’t apologize, Nathaniel. You didn’t do anything wrong." He shrugged, then lifted his gaze to meet mine.

"I hope he didn’t scare you away from me, though," he said softly.

I arched a brow. "Wasn’t it you he threatened?"

Nathaniel exhaled, his expression turning pensive. "He can strip me of whatever he wants. I never wanted to be an Alpha—that was my father’s dream. All I care about is my business, expanding it, proving my worth. Every cent I have, I earned myself. My success isn’t tied to the Blackwood fortune. Uncle Sebastian can’t truly take anything from me."

I frowned. "I wouldn’t be so sure. He’s a Lycan Chairman, Nathaniel. You know how much power that holds over the rest of us."

A smirk tugged at his lips. "I’d like to see him try."

Rolling my eyes, I moved to gather my things, pulling my phone from my bag to check my messages. Nathaniel’s gaze burned into me, but I ignored it—until my screen lit up with a notification that made my breath hitch.

I was about to grab my bag when Nathaniel's voice stopped me in my tracks.

"Can I give you my number?" His question made me freeze mid-motion. I turned to look at him, my heart skipping a beat.

"Is that a good idea?" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

He shrugged, that familiar sly grin playing on his lips.

"Probably not," he admitted, his tone teasing. "But maybe we could train together again. Or... something else." His words sent a flush of heat creeping up my neck, and I knew exactly what he meant.

"Something else?" I arched a brow, feigning innocence.

He stepped closer, his hand brushing against my arm—warm, firm, sending a jolt of electricity through me. I lifted my gaze to meet his, my lashes fluttering slightly as I waited for him to continue.

"I'd like to take you to dinner," he confessed, his voice low and earnest. "I've never met anyone like you, Lillian. You're stunning, sharp, and fearless. Let me take you out tonight."

I stared at him in disbelief. Was he seriously asking me out after Sebastian had just threatened him—nearly choked the life out of him?

My eyes darted around nervously, half-expecting Sebastian to materialize out of thin air. Nathaniel cupped my chin gently, tilting my face up until our eyes locked.

"Say yes," he murmured, his breath warm against my lips. "Let me show you how a real man treats a woman. Let me take you out tonight."

A heartbeat passed. Then another. His face was so close I could almost taste the words on his tongue.

Finally, I exhaled shakily.

"Okay," I whispered. "Yes."
###Chapter 80 Release her

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian hurried across the campus quad. Her fingers tightened around the strap of her backpack, her mind racing with thoughts of the upcoming midterms. The last thing she needed right now was another confrontation with Donovan, but fate had other plans.

"Lillian!" His voice cut through the chatter of students like a blade.

She stiffened but didn’t turn around. Not again. Not after everything.

A hand clamped down on her shoulder, forcing her to stop. Donovan’s grip was firm, his dark eyes burning with frustration. "We need to talk."

Lillian wrenched herself free, glaring up at him. "There’s nothing left to say, Donovan. You made your choice."

His jaw clenched. "You don’t understand—"

"I understand perfectly," she snapped. "You chose Evelyn. You broke the bond. End of story."

Around them, students slowed their steps, casting curious glances their way. Lillian hated the attention, hated how her heart still twisted at the sight of him.

Donovan exhaled sharply. "It wasn’t that simple."

"Save your excuses." She turned to leave, but he grabbed her wrist.

"Lillian, listen to me—"

A low growl rumbled behind them. Both froze as Sebastian Blackwood stepped into view, his presence commanding immediate silence. His golden eyes flicked to Donovan’s grip on Lillian’s wrist, and his expression darkened.

"Release her," he said, his voice deceptively calm.

Donovan hesitated, then let go. "This doesn’t concern you, Blackwood."

Sebastian smirked, though there was no humor in it. "Everything concerning my future mate concerns me."

Lillian’s breath hitched. Future mate? Since when had he decided that?

Donovan’s face twisted in disbelief. "You’re joking."

Sebastian stepped closer, his towering frame casting a shadow over Donovan. "Do I look like I’m joking?"

The tension between them crackled like static. Lillian could feel the weight of their unspoken challenge, the dominance radiating off Sebastian in waves.

Then, from the crowd, Evelyn’s shrill voice pierced the air. "Donovan!"

Lillian didn’t wait to see the fallout. She seized the distraction and bolted, weaving through the gawking students until she reached the library steps. Her pulse pounded in her ears, her thoughts a tangled mess.

Beatrice caught up with her moments later, breathless. "What the hell was that?"

Lillian shook her head, still reeling. "I have no idea."

Beatrice’s eyes widened. "Did Sebastian just claim you in front of everyone?"

Lillian swallowed hard. "Yeah. And I don’t know what game he’s playing."

Beatrice grinned. "Oh, this is going to be interesting."

Lillian groaned. Interesting was the last thing she needed right now.

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains, stirring Lillian awake. She stretched languidly, her muscles still humming from the previous night's training session with Sebastian. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted up from the kitchen, mingling with the crisp morning air.

Downstairs, the mansion was already alive with activity. Oliver sat at the dining table, swinging his legs as he scribbled in a notebook, while Victoria sipped her tea with an air of quiet elegance. Sebastian stood by the window, his broad shoulders silhouetted against the light, a steaming cup in hand.

"Good morning," Lillian murmured, her voice still thick with sleep.

Sebastian turned, his piercing gaze softening as it landed on her. "Sleep well?"

She nodded, though the truth was, her dreams had been restless—filled with shadows of Donovan and the past she couldn't quite escape.

Oliver grinned up at her. "We're going to the lake today! Dad promised we could take the boat out."

Lillian smiled, ruffling his hair. "Sounds fun."

Victoria set her cup down with a delicate clink. "Donovan called earlier," she said, her tone carefully neutral.

Lillian froze. "What did he want?"

Sebastian's jaw tightened. "He claims he has 'important matters' to discuss. I told him we weren't interested."

But Lillian knew Donovan. He never gave up that easily.

The lake was serene, its surface shimmering under the midday sun. Oliver laughed as he dangled his feet over the edge of the boat, splashing water playfully. Sebastian rowed with effortless strength, his eyes occasionally flickering to Lillian, as if ensuring she was still there.

Then, her phone buzzed.

A message from an unknown number: "We need to talk. It's about your mother."

Her breath hitched.

Sebastian noticed immediately. "What is it?"

She hesitated, then showed him the screen. His expression darkened.

"Donovan," he growled.

Lillian's fingers trembled as she typed back: "What do you know?"

The reply came instantly: "Meet me at the old mill. Tonight. Alone."

Sebastian snatched the phone from her hands. "You're not going."

"But—"

"No." His voice was steel. "This is a trap."

Lillian clenched her fists. "What if he knows something? What if my mother—"

Sebastian cupped her face, forcing her to meet his gaze. "I won't let him hurt you again."

The intensity in his eyes made her heart race. But the doubt lingered.

What if this was her only chance to uncover the truth?

That evening, as the mansion settled into silence, Lillian crept down the stairs. The grandfather clock chimed midnight, each toll echoing like a warning.

She paused at the door, glancing back.

Then she stepped into the night.

The old mill loomed ahead, its broken windows like hollow eyes. A figure stood in the shadows.

Donovan.

"You came," he said, stepping into the moonlight. His smirk was as infuriating as ever.

Lillian crossed her arms. "Talk."

His grin widened. "Always so impatient." He reached into his coat—

A growl cut through the darkness.

Sebastian emerged from the trees, his eyes blazing gold. "You have three seconds to explain why I shouldn't rip your throat out."

Donovan's smirk faltered—just for a second. Then he laughed. "Ah, the mighty Alpha. Always protecting what's mine."

Lillian's pulse spiked. "I was never yours."

Donovan's gaze turned icy. "We'll see about that."

And then—

A rustle in the bushes.

Figures emerged, surrounding them.

Lillian's stomach dropped.

They weren't alone.

And Donovan had planned this all along.

"I can't believe you're actually going on a date with Sebastian Blackwood's nephew!" Beatrice squealed as we tore through my closet. Nathaniel was picking me up in two hours, and I still had nothing to wear. My stomach twisted with nerves, making me second-guess everything.

"Maybe this is a mistake," I muttered, turning to face her.

She shot me a look of disbelief.

"Are you serious?" she gasped. "Nathaniel Whitlock is walking perfection—absurdly gorgeous. Not quite Sebastian Blackwood levels of hot, but damn, those genes don’t play around."

I rolled my eyes at her dramatics.

"I mean it, Bea. What was I thinking?" I groaned, running a hand through my hair.

"Who cares?" She waved me off. "Why are you freaking out? You admitted you're into him."

"I'd have to be dead not to be," I muttered under my breath.

Bea shook her head, grinning. "Still can't believe you 'randomly' ran into him at the library. Never pegged him as the bookish type."

I arched a brow. "He owns a publishing house, Bea. Reading and writing are literally his job."

"Yeah, but I figured that was just for show. Someone that hot belongs on a runway, not buried in some dusty old book."

I laughed despite myself.

Lying to her about how we met didn’t sit right with me, but she could never know the truth—that I’d first seen Nathaniel at Sebastian’s villa. Instead, I’d spun a story about studying at the library when he just happened to be there. We talked, he asked me out, and now here we were, an hour deep into a fruitless search for the perfect outfit.

"He’s more than just a pretty face," I admitted, chewing my lip. "His work on the French Gamma Warriors is incredible. I’ve referenced his articles and photos for my own reports before. I just... don’t know if I’ll measure up."

Bea ignored my self-doubt and yanked out a slinky black dress. "What about this?"

I eyed it skeptically. "A little... revealing, don’t you think? Not exactly first-date-with-a-Blackwood material."

She huffed. "Fine. But if you show up in something boring, I’m disowning you."

I smirked. "Noted."

The clock was ticking, and my nerves weren’t helping. But one thing was certain—this night would either be amazing or a disaster. No in-between.

Beatrice rolled her eyes dramatically.

"Then throw on a cardigan, Lillian," she said, tossing the dress at me. "It'll highlight those gorgeous legs of yours—and trust me, you’ve got legs to kill for."

I frowned down at my legs, unconvinced.

"Believe me," she added with a conspiratorial wink. "He’s going to lose his mind when he sees you in that." Heat rushed to my cheeks at her words.

"I don’t think I want him to lose his mind," I muttered.

Beatrice rolled her eyes again—if she kept that up, they’d probably get stuck that way.

"Just put it on," she pleaded.

With a sigh, I gave in. It wasn’t like I had anything better to wear, and the dress was stunning. I’d bought it ages ago during one of our impulsive shopping sprees—back when my family wasn’t drowning in debt and I could actually afford to splurge. At the time, I hadn’t known what occasion would call for such a dress, but Beatrice had insisted it was a must-have.

I guess tonight was the night to test that theory. I just prayed I didn’t end up looking like I belonged on a street corner.

I showered meticulously, shaving every inch of skin—not because I expected anything to happen, but because I’d rather be overprepared than regretful. Once I’d rinsed the last traces of shampoo from my hair, I stepped out of the shower, wrapping myself in a towel as steam curled around me. I brushed my teeth and worked through the tangled strands of my damp hair until they fell in a sleek, straight curtain down my back.

The dress lay neatly folded on the counter beside a chic black cardigan. Slipping into both, I turned to face the mirror—and blinked in surprise.

I had to admit, the outfit worked. The dress hugged my curves in all the right places, and Beatrice hadn’t been wrong about my legs. The cardigan added a touch of sophistication, toning down the look just enough that I didn’t feel like I was auditioning for a scandalous role.

Pleased, I stepped out of the bathroom—only for Beatrice to let out a delighted squeal.

"You look incredible!" she practically shouted.

I hushed her immediately.

"Mom’s asleep," I reminded her.

She rolled her eyes—again—and I knew exactly what she was thinking: Mom’s always asleep. But lately, she’d been doing better. She’d started leaving her bed, even helping around the house again. Yesterday, she’d gone grocery shopping for the first time in months. She’d been working with my father’s lawyers too, trying to piece together a plan to get him out of prison. The effort had drained her, so she’d turned in early tonight. I didn’t want to disturb her hard-earned rest.

I hadn’t had the chance to fill Beatrice in on everything yet, so she didn’t know the full story.

###Chapter 81 What the hell was Donovan doing here?


The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s estate. The sun had barely risen, casting a golden hue over the sprawling gardens below. She tightened the silk robe around her, the fabric cool against her skin.

Last night had been… unexpected.

Her fingers traced the faint mark on her neck—Sebastian’s claiming bite. The memory sent a shiver down her spine. The way his hands had gripped her waist, the possessive growl in his voice when he whispered, "Mine."

A knock at the door startled her.

"Lillian?" Beatrice’s voice was muffled through the wood. "Are you awake?"

Lillian hesitated. She wasn’t ready to face anyone yet, especially not after what had happened. But Beatrice had always been her anchor.

"Come in," she called softly.

The door creaked open, and Beatrice slipped inside, her eyes widening as she took in Lillian’s disheveled state. "Oh my Goddess," she breathed. "You did it."

Lillian’s cheeks burned. "It wasn’t planned."

Beatrice snorted, plopping onto the bed. "Please. You’ve been eyeing Sebastian since the moment you met him. The tension between you two could power a small city."

Lillian groaned, burying her face in her hands. "It’s complicated."

"Is it?" Beatrice arched a brow. "Because from where I’m standing, it looks like you finally accepted your fate."

Lillian’s stomach twisted. Fate. The word tasted bitter.

She had spent years running from the idea of a destined mate, especially after Donovan’s betrayal. But Sebastian… he was different. He didn’t demand her submission—he challenged her, pushed her to be stronger.

And last night, she had surrendered.

Beatrice leaned forward, her voice dropping to a whisper. "So… how was it?"

Lillian shot her a glare. "Really?"

"What? I’m living vicariously through you!" Beatrice grinned. "Come on, details!"

Before Lillian could respond, another knock echoed through the room—sharper this time.

"Lillian." Sebastian’s deep voice sent a jolt through her. "We need to talk."

Beatrice’s eyes sparkled with mischief. "Ooh, trouble in paradise already?"

Lillian shoved her off the bed. "Out."

Laughing, Beatrice winked before slipping past Sebastian at the door. The moment it clicked shut, the air thickened with tension.

Sebastian’s gaze raked over her, lingering on the mark he’d left. Satisfaction flickered in his eyes. "Sleep well?"

Lillian crossed her arms. "You’re insufferable."

A smirk tugged at his lips. "And yet, you’re stuck with me."

She huffed, turning back to the balcony. "What do you want, Sebastian?"

His expression sobered. "We have a problem."

That got her attention. She faced him fully. "What kind of problem?"

"Donovan." His jaw tightened. "He’s here."

Lillian’s blood ran cold. "What?"

Sebastian stepped closer, his voice low. "He arrived at the pack borders an hour ago. He’s demanding to see you."

Her pulse pounded in her ears. After everything—the lies, the betrayal—Donovan had the audacity to show up now?

"Why?" she whispered.

Sebastian’s eyes darkened. "He says he’s here to claim what’s his."

A growl ripped from Lillian’s throat before she could stop it. "I am not his."

Sebastian’s hand cupped her cheek, his thumb brushing the mark on her neck. "I know." His voice was a vow. "But we need to deal with this. Together."

Lillian took a shaky breath. The past was colliding with her present, threatening the fragile happiness she’d just found.

And she’d be damned if she let Donovan ruin it.

"Fine," she said, squaring her shoulders. "Let’s go."

Sebastian’s lips curved into a feral smile. "That’s my girl."

As they strode toward the door, Lillian couldn’t shake the feeling that this was only the beginning.

And the real battle was about to begin. 

"Let's do your hair and makeup now," Beatrice said, grabbing her bag filled with styling tools and cosmetics. I grinned at her enthusiasm and settled into the vanity chair across the room. She worked her magic, first brushing out my tangled waves before blow-drying them into smooth submission. With practiced hands, she curled my hair into soft, cascading waves that framed my shoulders perfectly. A delicate hairpin kept my side bangs from falling into my face, and then she turned her attention to my makeup.

By the time she finished, I barely recognized the girl staring back at me in the mirror.

"Wow," I breathed, touching my cheek lightly.

"You look absolutely stunning," Beatrice gushed, wrapping an arm around my shoulders. "Nathaniel is going to lose his mind when he sees you."

She grabbed a bottle of perfume and spritzed it lightly in the air, letting the mist settle over me. I flinched as a bit of it stung my eyes.

"Oops, sorry!" she giggled, not sounding very sorry at all.

Just then, the doorbell rang, and my entire body tensed.

"Oh my goddess!" Beatrice squealed, grabbing my wrist and yanking me toward the door. "He's here!" I swallowed hard, my pulse racing as I followed her out of my room. I snatched my purse from the door handle before shutting it behind me, then hurried after her down the stairs. She scooped up a pair of sleek black heels that had been abandoned in the living room corner.

"I spotted these earlier—you have to wear them," she insisted.

I frowned. "Those are my mother's."

"She won't care," Beatrice dismissed with a wave. "You two wear the same size. Besides, these heels are perfect with that dress."

Reluctantly, I slipped them on. They added just enough height—maybe an inch—but not so much that Nathaniel would tower over me completely. (Not that it mattered—he’d still be a full foot taller.)

Beatrice gave me one last approving once-over before gesturing toward the door.

"I'll hide. You answer it," she whispered, then darted around the corner like a mischievous shadow.

Shaking my head at her antics, I reached for the doorknob just as the bell chimed again.

The moment I opened the door, Nathaniel froze. His eyes widened, his lips parting slightly as his gaze traveled from my face all the way down to my heels—lingering just a second too long on the neckline of my dress—before snapping back up.

"Wow," he murmured under his breath. "You look…" His voice trailed off, as if he couldn't find the right word.

"You don’t look so bad yourself," I teased, assuming he meant to say something flattering. And he did look incredible—his tailored suit hugged his broad shoulders, the deep red tie a striking contrast against the crisp white shirt. His usually unruly blonde curls were neatly styled away from his face, and the clean shave made his sharp jawline even more pronounced.

I couldn’t help but smile at the effort he’d put in.

"We should get going," he said, finally dragging his gaze back to mine. "Don’t want to miss our reservation."

I nodded, then glanced over my shoulder where Beatrice was peeking around the corner, grinning like a Cheshire cat.

Nathaniel leaned against the corner of the wall, flashing me a mischievous grin and a playful thumbs-up. My lips curled into a smile as I shut the door behind me, following him to the sleek black car idling at the curb. He opened the back door with a flourish, and I slid inside, feeling the plush leather seat beneath me. He joined me a moment later, his presence warm and reassuring.

Behind the wheel sat a young man who couldn’t have been much older than Nathaniel. His eyes met mine in the rearview mirror, and he grinned, his suit slightly rumpled compared to Nathaniel’s impeccable one.

"Lillian, meet Dominic—my subordinate, my friend, and my future Beta," Nathaniel introduced, his voice laced with pride.

"Call me Dom," the young man said, twisting slightly in his seat to face me. His grin widened. "Nice to finally meet you. This guy hasn’t stopped talking about you since this morning."

Heat rushed to my cheeks, and I glanced at Nathaniel, who was now glaring daggers at his future Beta. Dom immediately shrank back, clearing his throat and focusing intently on the road ahead.

"We should get moving," Dom muttered, gripping the steering wheel a little tighter.

"Good idea," Nathaniel growled, though the corner of his mouth twitched.

The rest of the drive passed in comfortable silence. When we arrived at the restaurant, Nathaniel was out of the car before I could even blink, opening my door with exaggerated chivalry. He took my hand, lifting it to his lips for a soft, lingering kiss before helping me out. My heart fluttered as I followed him into the opulent dining establishment, the air thick with the scent of rich spices and expensive wine.

"A table for two under Nathaniel Whitlock," he announced to the hostess, his voice smooth and confident.

The woman’s eyes widened at the mention of his name. "Mr. Whitlock!" she gasped, bowing her head slightly. "What an honor to have you dining with us tonight."

Nathaniel smiled, draping a possessive arm around my shoulders. The hostess’s gaze flicked to me, her polite smile faltering for a fraction of a second before she forced it back into place. "Right this way," she said stiffly, snatching up two menus and leading us through the dimly lit dining room.

As we walked, an uneasy prickle crept up my spine—the unmistakable feeling of being watched. My eyes darted across the room, and then—

There.

Seated at a corner table, his piercing gaze locked onto mine, was him.

My stomach plummeted.

What the hell was Donovan doing here?

###Chapter 82 Lillian's POV

The scent of pine and damp earth filled the air as Lillian trudged through the dense forest, her boots sinking slightly into the soft ground. The full moon cast an eerie glow over the trees, illuminating the path ahead. She could feel the weight of Donovan’s betrayal pressing against her chest, a constant reminder of the life she had left behind.

Her phone buzzed in her pocket, startling her. Pulling it out, she saw Beatrice’s name flashing on the screen.

"Where are you? You were supposed to meet us an hour ago!"

Lillian sighed, rubbing her temple. She had completely forgotten about their plans.

"Sorry, got caught up in something. I’ll be there soon."

She shoved the phone back into her pocket and quickened her pace. The last thing she needed was Beatrice worrying about her.

As she neared the edge of the forest, the distant hum of chatter and laughter reached her ears. The pack’s annual bonfire was already in full swing, the flickering flames casting long shadows across the clearing.

Sebastian stood near the fire, his broad frame silhouetted against the orange glow. His piercing gaze locked onto hers the moment she stepped into the clearing, sending an involuntary shiver down her spine.

"You’re late," he murmured as she approached, his voice low and rough.

Lillian crossed her arms. "I had things to do."

A smirk tugged at his lips. "Running away again?"

She glared at him. "I don’t run."

Before he could respond, Oliver barreled into her legs, nearly knocking her off balance. "Lillian! You’re here!"

She ruffled his hair, forcing a smile. "Of course I am. Wouldn’t miss it."

Sebastian’s expression softened slightly as he watched them, but the moment was shattered when Victoria stepped forward, her arm looped possessively through Donovan’s.

"Lillian," she purred, her voice dripping with false sweetness. "So glad you could join us."

Lillian’s jaw tightened, but she refused to let them see her falter. "Wouldn’t dream of missing it."

Donovan’s gaze flickered with something unreadable, but he remained silent.

Beatrice appeared at her side, looping an arm through hers. "Come on, let’s get some food before it’s all gone."

As Beatrice dragged her away, Lillian couldn’t shake the feeling of Sebastian’s eyes burning into her back.

Something had shifted between them, and she wasn’t sure if she was ready for what came next.

"Lillian?" Victoria's voice sliced through my thoughts just as we passed their table.

I forced a polite smile in her direction, deliberately avoiding Donovan's piercing gaze. "Hello, Victoria," I replied, keeping my tone light.

"It is you," she said, her voice laced with something between surprise and tension. "I didn’t expect to see you here. This doesn’t seem like your usual scene."

Nathaniel’s arm slid around my shoulders, and as if noticing him for the first time, Victoria’s demeanor instantly brightened. "Nate! Are you two on a date?" she asked, her eyes flickering between us.

He flashed her a roguish grin. "We are," he confirmed without hesitation.

My cheeks burned at his boldness. What if Victoria told Sebastian about this? The thought sent a nervous flutter through my stomach. Victoria turned to me, her smile now genuine but edged with something unreadable.

"You’re a lucky girl," she said, tilting her head. "My cousin is notoriously selective when it comes to women. You must be very special—especially to defy Uncle’s wishes."

I let out an awkward laugh. "I wouldn’t go that far—"

Nathaniel cut in smoothly. "I would." His voice was low, teasing, and it only made me blush harder. "Now, if you’ll excuse us, Vicky, our table’s waiting."

"Of course," Victoria said, waving us off with a playful roll of her eyes.

Just before turning away, I risked a glance at Donovan. His eyes were dark, simmering with something dangerous—anger, jealousy, maybe both. A shiver ran down my spine, and I quickly looked away, following Nathaniel and the hostess to our table.

We were seated far enough from Victoria and Donovan to have privacy, but close enough that I could still see them clearly. The waitress handed us menus, her gaze lingering on Nathaniel a beat too long.

"Your server will be right with you," she murmured, her voice sugary sweet. When Nathaniel glanced up and gave her a polite nod, she actually winked at him before sauntering away, hips swaying.

I pressed my lips together. I wasn’t jealous—not really. But the blatant disrespect grated on me.

"Order anything you want," Nathaniel said, pulling my attention back. "Don’t worry about the cost."

I nodded absently as I scanned the menu, realizing why he’d mentioned money—everything was exorbitantly priced. Moments later, our waitress appeared, and just like the hostess, she only had eyes for Nathaniel.

The way she leaned in just a little too close, the way her fingers brushed his shoulder as she took his order—it was all too obvious.

Nathaniel, to his credit, remained perfectly polite but distant. Still, the whole exchange left a bitter taste in my mouth.

I wasn’t sure what unsettled me more—Donovan’s glare, Victoria’s knowing smile, or the way every woman in this restaurant seemed drawn to Nathaniel like moths to a flame.

But one thing was certain—this dinner was going to be far more complicated than I’d anticipated.

"Hello, Mr. Blackwood," she purred, fluttering her thick lashes at him. "It's such a privilege to serve you tonight." Her fingers trailed along his shoulder, lingering far longer than necessary. "You're even more striking in person. I've followed your work for years."

Sebastian arched a brow but didn’t shake her off—which irked me more than it should have. The blatant disrespect, the way she dismissed my presence entirely, and his passive acceptance of it all made my jaw tighten.

"I appreciate the compliment," he said smoothly, flashing her a charming grin. "Bring us your finest bottle of wine. And what’s tonight’s special?"

"Our signature dish is Ora King salmon served over green tea soba noodles—absolutely divine. The soup of the day is Mushroom Agnolotti with sweet potatoes and Kohlrabi."

"Perfect. We’ll take both," he replied before glancing at me. "And for my date..."

The waitress finally acknowledged me, her lips curling into a barely concealed sneer. As if she hadn’t noticed me until now. I swallowed hard, forcing my attention back to the menu before making my choice.

"I’ll have the soft-shell crab tempura ravioli," I told her coolly.

She scribbled down my order before letting her fingers drift up the back of Nathaniel’s neck. "I’ll be right back with your drinks, handsome," she cooed, winking before sauntering away.

I glared at her retreating figure before turning to Nathaniel. "Does that happen often?"

He frowned. "What?"

"Women draping themselves over you like you’re their personal armrest."

His expression darkened. "I’ve learned to tune it out. Was she that obvious?"

"Her hands were practically glued to you," I muttered under my breath.

He sighed. "Honestly, I don’t even notice anymore. Did it upset you?"

"A little," I admitted, staring at the empty plate in front of me. "It felt disrespectful."

Before I could say more, his hand closed over mine, warm and steady. When I met his gaze, the sincerity in his eyes was undeniable.

"I’m sorry, Lillian. I never meant to make you feel that way. Especially not tonight." His thumb brushed over my knuckles. "When she comes back, tell her to keep her hands to herself. I don’t want you uncomfortable because of me."

The raw honesty in his voice softened the tension in my shoulders. He genuinely hadn’t noticed—either the waitress’s advances or the hostess’s earlier disdain.

"You’re a handsome man, Nathaniel. Women will flirt. I can’t blame them for that." I exhaled. "But the way they looked at me... like I didn’t belong here..."

He nodded, squeezing my hand. "You belong wherever you want to be. And tonight, you’re with me."

"I get where you're coming from, and I’ll make sure they know you’re with me—that means treating you with respect," Sebastian assured me, his voice firm yet gentle.

Heat rushed to my cheeks, and I shook my head quickly. "You don’t have to make a big deal out of it," I murmured, tucking a loose strand of hair behind my ear. "Just… thank you for hearing me out."

His thumb brushed lightly over my knuckles, sending a warm shiver up my arm. "I’ll always listen to you, Lillian," he said, his golden eyes softening. "And if something bothers you, I’ll do everything I can to fix it. That’s a promise."

The sincerity in his voice made my pulse skip. He wasn’t just saying it—he meant it.

"That’s the kind of man I am," he added with a small, confident smile, as if daring me to argue.

I didn’t. Because for the first time in a long while, I actually believed him.
###Chapter 83  more, the waitress.

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains, gently rousing Lillian from her slumber. She stretched lazily, her muscles still sore from yesterday’s training session. Beside her, Sebastian’s side of the bed was already empty, the sheets cool to the touch.

She sighed, running a hand through her tousled hair. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted up from downstairs, mingling with the faint aroma of breakfast.

He must be in his study already, she thought, rolling out of bed.

As she padded across the plush carpet, her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Beatrice lit up the screen:

"Emergency brunch. Meet me at The Moonlight Café in an hour. It’s about Donovan."

Lillian’s fingers tightened around her phone. Donovan. Just the mention of his name sent a ripple of unease through her.

She quickly typed back: "What happened?"

Beatrice’s reply was immediate: "Not over text. Just get here."

Lillian exhaled sharply. Whatever this was, it couldn’t be good.

The Moonlight Café was bustling when she arrived, the chatter of students and the clinking of silverware filling the air. Beatrice sat at their usual corner table, her expression grim.

Lillian slid into the seat across from her. "Alright, spill. What’s going on?"

Beatrice leaned in, lowering her voice. "I saw Donovan last night. At The Crimson Lounge."

Lillian frowned. "So? He’s allowed to go to bars."

Beatrice shook her head. "Not just any bar, Lillian. That place is packed with rogues and mercenaries. And he wasn’t alone."

Lillian’s pulse quickened. "Who was with him?"

"Evelyn," Beatrice said, her lips pressing into a thin line. "And Alpha Harrison."

Lillian’s stomach twisted. Alpha Harrison was notorious for his shady dealings—black-market trades, underground fights, even whispers of assassinations.

"Why would Donovan be meeting with him?" Lillian whispered.

Beatrice’s eyes darkened. "I don’t know. But I overheard them talking about Sebastian."

Lillian’s blood ran cold.

Before she could respond, her phone buzzed again. A message from Sebastian:

"Emergency meeting at the packhouse. Now."

Lillian’s fingers trembled as she typed back: "On my way."

She looked up at Beatrice. "Something’s happening. Sebastian just called a meeting."

Beatrice’s grip tightened around her coffee cup. "Then we’d better move fast."

The packhouse was eerily silent when Lillian arrived. The usual hum of activity was gone, replaced by a tense stillness.

Sebastian stood at the head of the table, his expression unreadable. Marcus, Theodore, and the rest of the high-ranking pack members were already gathered, their faces grim.

Lillian took her seat beside Sebastian. "What’s going on?"

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "We have a problem." He turned to Marcus. "Show them."

Marcus tapped a button on the table’s projector. A grainy surveillance video flickered to life on the wall.

Lillian’s breath caught.

There, clear as day, was Donovan—standing in a dimly lit alley, shaking hands with Alpha Harrison.

Sebastian’s voice was ice. "He’s making a move against us."

Lillian’s heart pounded. "What do we do?"

Sebastian’s eyes gleamed with quiet fury. "We strike first."

The room erupted into murmurs of agreement.

But Lillian couldn’t shake the dread coiling in her chest.

Because if Donovan was desperate enough to ally with someone like Alpha Harrison…

This wasn’t just a fight for power.

This was war.

Before I could utter a word, the waitress appeared with a bottle of red wine and two crystal glasses.

"Our finest selection tonight is the Château Lafite Rothschild Pauillac," she purred, her gaze locked onto Nathaniel with unmistakable interest.

He gave a casual nod.

"Sounds perfect," he replied smoothly. "Would you mind pouring my date first?"

The waitress's smile faltered as she flicked a glance in my direction. I offered her a practiced, polite smile, reclining slightly in my chair. With stiff movements, she filled my glass, the deep crimson liquid catching the glow of the chandelier above us.

Then she turned back to Nathaniel, her demeanor softening instantly, that coy smile returning as she poured his wine.

"Is there anything else I can do for you?" she asked, her fingers brushing against his arm.

Nathaniel's expression darkened. He caught her wrist, gently but firmly removing her hand from his sleeve. Her cheeks flushed at the rejection.

"Let's keep this professional, shall we?" he said, arching a brow. "There's no need to disrespect my companion."

The waitress stiffened, her face burning scarlet.

"I—uh—" she stammered.

"Just check on our meals," Nathaniel dismissed her with a wave.

Swallowing hard, she hurried away. Nathaniel exhaled and met my eyes, his expression apologetic.

"Sorry about that," he said with a rueful smile. "I promise the rest of the evening will be about making sure you're comfortable."

"I appreciate that, Nathaniel," I replied sincerely.

"Then let's enjoy the night," he said, lifting his glass. I mirrored the gesture, and our glasses clinked before we each took a sip.

Third Person POV

Lillian was so engrossed in her date with Nathaniel that she didn’t sense Donovan’s burning glare from across the room. Seething in his seat, he barely registered Victoria’s incessant chatter. His mind was consumed by one thought: How could Lillian be out with another man?

Then again, he was on a date too—with the very she-wolf he’d left his fated mate for. It was necessary, he told himself. A calculated move to secure his position as the next Alpha of the Redmoon Pack.

His wolf, however, remained restless, furious that he’d abandoned their destined bond for ambition.

Once Donovan secured everything he desired, his wolf would finally be at peace.

But that included Lillian—he wanted Lillian, and he wouldn’t rest until she was in the house he’d bought specifically for her.

"Are you even listening to me?" Victoria snapped, arms crossed tightly over her chest.

Donovan blinked, realizing he hadn’t registered a single word she’d just said.

"Of course I am," he lied smoothly.

"Then repeat what I just told you," she challenged, arching a brow.

A beat of hesitation—enough for her to know the truth.

"Something about the wedding?" he guessed.

She rolled her eyes, tossing her napkin onto her half-finished plate.

"I’m done here," she muttered, pushing back her chair. "I want to leave."

His frown deepened. "Why are you acting like this?"

"Like what?"

"Like a child," he shot back. "If something’s bothering you, just say it."

"I could say the same to you," she hissed. "You haven’t been the same since you saw Lillian again. Is there something I should know? Did something happen between you two?"

His pulse spiked. Had he been that obvious? He needed to tread carefully—especially if he wanted to secure his position as Alpha.

"Don’t be ridiculous, Victoria. You’re the only one I care about," he assured her, voice low and honeyed.

"Then why can’t you stop staring at her?" she gritted out, nails digging into her palms.

"I wasn’t staring."

"Liar." Her voice trembled, unshed tears glinting in her eyes.

"Let’s not do this here," he murmured, leaning closer. "I’ll pay the bill, and we’ll talk in the car. Okay?"

She hesitated before giving a stiff nod.

"I’ll wait outside." Without another word, she stood and strode away, leaving Donovan scrambling to figure out how to salvage this mess.

Meanwhile, Nathaniel had noticed Donovan’s relentless focus on Lillian throughout the entire date—and it was driving him insane. He knew Lillian and Donovan shared some kind of past she refused to talk about, but curiosity burned through him.

With a sharp exhale, he opened a mindlink to his Beta.

"We need to talk."

"Nathaniel," Sebastian's deep voice resonated through the mindlink, laced with quiet urgency.

Dominic's response came instantly, sharp and alert. "I'm listening. What's wrong?" The unspoken tension in his tone betrayed his readiness for action.

Sebastian's fingers tightened around his phone as he stared at the text thread between Lillian and Donovan. His jaw clenched. "I need you to investigate Donovan Winslow. Dig up everything—especially about his past with Lillian."

A beat of silence. Then Dominic's voice turned razor-sharp. "Consider it done. Any particular leads?"

"Start with their university days," Sebastian growled, the memory of Lillian's guarded expression when Donovan's name had come up earlier flashing in his mind. "And cross-reference with his family's business dealings. The Winslows didn't get this powerful playing fair."

Dominic exhaled sharply. "You think he's still a threat to her?"

Sebastian's eyes darkened. "I know he is." The unspoken truth hung between them—Donovan had been Lillian's fated mate before the bond shattered. And men like him didn't let go of what they considered theirs.

A rustle of papers came through the link as Dominic presumably pulled files. "I'll have preliminary intel by midnight. Should I loop in Marcus?"

Sebastian hesitated only a second. "No. Keep this between us for now." The last thing he needed was his Beta's protective instincts complicating matters when Lillian was already skittish about her past.

"Understood." Dominic's voice dropped. "Be careful, Sebastian. The Winslows have claws in places even we haven't mapped yet."

Sebastian smirked without humor. "So do I." He severed the connection, his gaze drifting to the window where moonlight silvered the estate gardens. Somewhere out there, Donovan Winslow was making moves.

And Sebastian intended to be three steps ahead when he did.
###Chapter 84 Lillian's POV

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains, stirring Lillian from her restless sleep. She rubbed her eyes, the events of last night replaying in her mind like a haunting melody. Donovan’s betrayal still stung, but what unsettled her more was the way Sebastian Blackwood had looked at her—like she was something precious, something worth protecting.

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Lillian?" Beatrice’s voice was muffled through the wood. "Are you awake? You have class in an hour."

Lillian groaned, dragging herself out of bed. "Yeah, I’m up."

She pulled on a sweater and jeans, her movements sluggish. The weight of her wolf’s emotions pressed against her chest, a constant reminder of the bond she had lost—and the one that might be forming.

When she opened the door, Beatrice stood there, arms crossed, her expression a mix of concern and exasperation. "You look like you got into a fight with a pillow and lost."

Lillian rolled her eyes. "Thanks, that’s exactly what I needed to hear."

Beatrice smirked, tossing her a granola bar. "Eat. You’ll need the energy."

As they walked to campus, the crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves and distant bonfires. Lillian’s wolf stirred, restless. She couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched.

Then she saw him.

Sebastian stood near the entrance of the humanities building, his dark coat billowing slightly in the breeze. His gaze locked onto hers, intense and unreadable.

Beatrice nudged her. "Looks like someone’s waiting for you."

Lillian swallowed hard. "I don’t have time for this."

But before she could turn away, Sebastian closed the distance between them in a few long strides. "Lillian," he said, his voice low. "We need to talk."

Her pulse quickened. "About what?"

His jaw tightened. "About last night. About Donovan."

Lillian crossed her arms. "There’s nothing to talk about. He made his choice."

Sebastian’s eyes darkened. "He’s dangerous. And he won’t stop until he gets what he wants."

A shiver ran down her spine. "And what does he want?"

Sebastian leaned in, his breath warm against her ear. "You."

The word sent a jolt through her. Before she could respond, Beatrice grabbed her arm. "Class. Now."

Lillian let herself be pulled away, but she could feel Sebastian’s gaze burning into her back.

Something was coming.

And she wasn’t sure she was ready.

"This was a perfect evening, Nathaniel," I murmured as we approached my front door. The golden glow from the porch light spilled onto the pathway, guiding our steps from the car to the entrance. Above us, thick clouds swallowed the moon, and the scent of impending rain hung heavy in the air.

When we reached the door, I hesitated before turning to face him. It felt strange having someone walk me home—Donovan never bothered. He'd kiss me in the car and drive off the moment my feet touched the pavement. And Sebastian? He'd wait until I was safely inside before leaving, though that didn't mean anything. He was just my employer. Nothing more.

A flush crept up my cheeks at the thought of Sebastian escorting me to the door. Would he kiss me if he did? Why was I even imagining this while standing here with another man? I shouldn't be entertaining such thoughts about Sebastian at all, especially not now.

Shaking my head, I forced the idea away and met Nathaniel's warm gaze.

"I'm glad you enjoyed yourself," he said, his fingers lightly brushing mine. "I had a wonderful time too. You've made my first night here unforgettable."

I smiled at the compliment, biting my lower lip.

"That's sweet of you to say," I replied.

"Can I see you again tomorrow?" he asked, hopeful.

I mentally ran through my schedule—morning lectures, then tutoring Oliver in the evening.

"I have tutoring tomorrow night," I admitted.

"We could go after," he suggested, his smile brightening. "There's an outdoor light gallery I've been wanting to visit. Would you come with me?"

I hesitated. "At night?"

He nodded. "It's an illuminated exhibit. I thought it might be something you'd enjoy."

Beatrice would kill me if I turned him down. So, I nodded.

"Alright," I agreed. "That sounds lovely."

His grin deepened, revealing charming dimples—just like his uncle's, though Sebastian's features were far more rugged.

I needed to stop this. Comparing Nathaniel to Sebastian was ridiculous. Nathaniel was his own person, and I was on a date with him.

Before Lillian could react, Nathaniel was leaning in, his lips hovering dangerously close to hers.

Holy hell! He was going to kiss her! Did she want this? The thought had never crossed her mind until this exact moment. Was she attracted enough to Nathaniel for this? Was she prepared to take this step? Her heart answered before her mind could - she wasn't ready to kiss anyone else yet. At the last possible second, she turned her face away. His lips grazed her cheek instead, soft as butterfly wings.

Nathaniel frowned when he realized his mistake, but to his credit, he didn't complain or make a scene. Instead, he offered her a small, understanding smile and gave a slight bow.

"Until tomorrow," he murmured.

Lillian nodded mutely, watching as he retreated to the waiting car. Only when she heard the engine start did she exhale sharply and turn toward the house. Just like Sebastian would have done, Nathaniel waited until she was safely inside before driving away. These Blackwood men would be the death of her yet.

Third Person POV

"I've uncovered the information you requested, sir," Dominic said from the driver's seat as they both watched Lillian disappear into the house.

"What did you find?" Nathaniel asked, though part of him dreaded the answer. Still, if he wanted to truly understand Lillian and protect her properly, he needed all the facts.

"Lillian and Donovan Winslow are fated mates," Dominic revealed, making Nathaniel's stomach drop. "They grew up together in the same pack but only discovered their bond when she turned eighteen. They were together for two years before..."

"Before what?" Nathaniel pressed, his knuckles whitening on the armrest. It was nearly unheard of for fated mates to separate - wolves didn't abandon their mates unless something catastrophic occurred... or death intervened.

Dominic hesitated before delivering the final blow. "Before Donovan betrayed her with another woman on their supposed mating anniversary."

Nathaniel's jaw clenched. Now he understood the shadows in Lillian's eyes - and why she'd turned away from his kiss. The wounds of betrayal ran deep indeed.

###Chapter 85 He met your cousin
The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting a golden glow over the room. Lillian stretched lazily, her body still humming with the lingering warmth of Donovan’s presence from the night before. She sighed, running a hand through her tousled hair.

Last night…

Her cheeks flushed at the memory. The way Donovan had looked at her, the way his hands had traced her skin—it had been intoxicating. But now, in the sober light of day, reality settled back in.

She wasn’t supposed to feel this way. Not for him. Not after everything.

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Lillian? Are you awake?" Beatrice’s voice was muffled through the wood.

Lillian cleared her throat. "Yeah, come in."

The door creaked open, and Beatrice stepped inside, her eyes immediately narrowing in suspicion. "You look… different."

Lillian feigned ignorance. "Different how?"

Beatrice smirked. "Like someone who had a very good night."

Lillian rolled her eyes, but her traitorous pulse betrayed her. "Shut up."

Beatrice flopped onto the bed beside her, grinning. "So? Details. Now."

Lillian hesitated. She wanted to tell Beatrice everything—about the way Donovan had shown up at her door, about the way he’d kissed her like he was starving for her. But something held her back.

"It’s complicated," she muttered.

Beatrice snorted. "When is it not complicated with you two?"

Lillian sighed. "I don’t know what I’m doing, Bea. One minute, I hate him. The next, I—"

"You what?"

Lillian bit her lip. "I don’t know."

Beatrice studied her for a long moment before sighing. "You’re in deep, aren’t you?"

Lillian didn’t answer. She didn’t have to.

A sharp knock at the door startled them both.

"Lillian?" Sebastian’s deep voice sent a jolt through her.

Beatrice raised an eyebrow. "Well, well. The plot thickens."

Lillian shot her a glare before calling out, "Just a second!"

She scrambled out of bed, hastily smoothing her hair and straightening her clothes. When she opened the door, Sebastian stood there, his expression unreadable.

"We need to talk," he said, his voice low.

Lillian’s stomach twisted. "About what?"

Sebastian’s gaze flicked to Beatrice before returning to her. "Alone."

Beatrice, ever the opportunist, stood up. "I was just leaving anyway. Have fun, kids." She winked at Lillian before slipping out the door.

Silence stretched between them.

Sebastian stepped inside, closing the door behind him. "I heard about last night."

Lillian’s breath hitched. "Heard what?"

His jaw tightened. "Donovan was here."

Lillian swallowed. "It wasn’t—"

"Save it," he cut her off. "I don’t care what happened. But you need to be careful."

Lillian frowned. "Careful of what?"

Sebastian’s eyes darkened. "Of him. Of yourself. Of whatever game you think you’re playing."

Her temper flared. "I’m not playing any games."

A humorless smile tugged at his lips. "Aren’t you?"

Lillian crossed her arms. "What’s that supposed to mean?"

Sebastian stepped closer, his presence overwhelming. "It means I know you, Lillian. Better than you think. And I know when you’re lying to yourself."

She opened her mouth to argue, but the words died on her tongue.

Because he was right.

And that terrified her.

"He met your cousin," Dominic murmured.

Nathaniel's brows shot up in surprise.

Victoria was undeniably beautiful, but she couldn't compare to Lillian. What baffled him even more was how Donovan's wolf could willingly choose Victoria when his fated mate had been right there all along.

"That doesn't add up," Nathaniel muttered, shaking his head.

"I don’t get it either," Dominic admitted. "But he met Victoria, and before anyone knew it, he was proposing to her."

"You couldn’t dig up a reason?"

"Nothing’s documented," Dominic replied. "If there’s a motive, he’s keeping it locked away."

Nathaniel’s frown deepened, his jaw tightening. He didn’t need Dominic to spell it out—he already knew the truth. It was painfully obvious. Victoria was the daughter of Sebastian Blackwood, the most powerful Lycan Chairman in the world. Donovan wanted power, and what better way to secure it than by aligning himself with Sebastian through his daughter?

But to abandon his fated mate for ambition? The thought alone made Nathaniel sick.

Did Lillian know Donovan had left her for power? Was Victoria even aware she was just a pawn in her fiancé’s game? He couldn’t tell her—it would only shatter her. Nathaniel had to stay silent, but he refused to let Donovan hurt Lillian any longer. She needed someone to protect her, and he was determined to be that person.

"Oliver, you’re done with tutoring already?" Victoria asked as Oliver walked into the kitchen, sweat glistening on his forehead from his sparring session.

Victoria sat at the counter, nibbling on fruit while Donovan scrolled through his phone beside her. They’d spent most of the night arguing—about the date, about how he couldn’t keep his eyes off Lillian. He’d managed to conjure up some excuse, and after relentless back-and-forth, Victoria had finally relented. She loved him too much to keep fighting. Even if it meant ignoring the gnawing doubt in her chest, she’d rather believe him than lose him.

Now, it was the next evening, and they’d spent the entire day wedding planning. The ceremony was fast approaching, and there was still so much left to do.

"Yeah," Oliver said, grabbing a water bottle from the fridge. "Lillian and Nathaniel are going on another date tonight, so she ended our session early."

That caught Donovan’s attention.

"They're going on another date?" Oliver asked, raising an eyebrow.

Nathaniel nodded. "Yes," he replied, a small smile playing on his lips. "I'm taking her to the night gallery. She just left to get ready."

Victoria leaned back in her chair, a thoughtful expression crossing her face. "I'm glad he's taken a liking to her," she mused. "They both deserve good people in their lives. Maybe we could arrange a double date sometime."

Donovan, who had been silent until now, cut in sharply, ignoring Victoria’s suggestion. "Does your father know Nathaniel is taking Lillian out?"

Oliver shook his head. "Not yet," he admitted, twisting the cap off his water bottle and taking a long drink. After recapping it, he turned to Donovan. "Nathaniel said he’d talk to him later. But you know how Dad can be—intimidating."

"I'll be right back," Donovan muttered abruptly, standing up. "Need to use the restroom."

Victoria barely acknowledged his departure, already engrossed in conversation with Oliver about Lillian and Nathaniel. The moment Donovan left the room, his steps quickened as he headed straight for the parlor, nostrils flaring as he searched for the faintest trace of Lillian’s scent. It was barely there—she must have already left the villa.

But she couldn’t have gone far. She had only just stepped out.

"Going somewhere?" A deep, amused voice cut through the silence from the shadowed corner of the parlor.

Donovan stiffened, turning slowly to face Nathaniel, who stood leaning against the wall, arms crossed over his chest, a knowing smirk on his face.

"Where I go is none of your concern," Donovan growled, his jaw tightening.

"Isn’t it?" Nathaniel pushed off the wall, closing the distance between them. "I think it is, considering I know exactly who you’re looking for." His smirk widened. "Tell me, Donovan, does my cousin know you’re sneaking off to chase after another woman?"

"You don’t know what you’re talking about," Donovan snapped, his eyes flashing with barely contained fury.

Nathaniel scoffed. "Don’t I?" He tilted his head, feigning innocence. "Victoria might not realize where you’re really headed right now… but does she know that Lillian is your fated mate? Or that she’s just a pawn in your little game?"

###Chapter 86 Sebastian's POV

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s estate. The sun had barely risen, casting golden streaks across the sprawling gardens below. She tightened the silk robe around her, the fabric cool against her skin.

Last night’s argument with Donovan still weighed heavily on her mind. His betrayal had cut deeper than she cared to admit. The way he had looked at Evelyn—his new mate—with such devotion made Lillian’s stomach twist.

A soft knock at the door pulled her from her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, turning to see Beatrice poking her head in.

"Morning, sunshine," Beatrice chirped, balancing a tray of coffee and pastries. "You look like you didn’t sleep a wink."

Lillian sighed, accepting the steaming cup. "Couldn’t."

Beatrice flopped onto the plush armchair, nibbling on a croissant. "Still thinking about him?"

Lillian’s grip tightened around the cup. "I just don’t understand how he could move on so quickly. It’s like I meant nothing."

Beatrice rolled her eyes. "Please. Donovan was never worthy of you. And now he’s stuck with Evelyn, who, let’s be honest, is about as exciting as watching paint dry."

Despite herself, Lillian chuckled. "You’re terrible."

"Terribly right," Beatrice corrected with a smirk.

A knock at the door interrupted them again. This time, Sebastian stood in the doorway, his broad frame filling the space. His dark eyes flicked to Lillian, and for a moment, something unreadable passed between them.

"Good morning," he said, his voice smooth as velvet. "I hope I’m not interrupting."

Beatrice waggled her eyebrows suggestively before standing. "Nope! Just leaving. You two have fun." She winked at Lillian before slipping past Sebastian.

Lillian groaned inwardly. Great.

Sebastian stepped inside, his presence commanding as always. "I wanted to check on you," he said. "After last night…"

She looked away. "I’m fine."

He moved closer, his scent—rich and woodsy—wrapping around her. "You don’t have to lie to me, Lillian."

Her heart stuttered. There was something about the way he said her name—like it was precious.

Before she could respond, his phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, his expression darkening.

"We have a problem," he murmured.

Lillian frowned. "What is it?"

Sebastian met her gaze, his jaw tight. "Donovan just challenged me to a duel."

Her breath caught. No.

"For what?" she demanded.

His lips thinned. "For you."

The words hung between them, heavy and dangerous.

Lillian’s pulse roared in her ears. This wasn’t just about pride—this was war.

And she was the prize.

"Alpha, there's something you should know," Marcus murmured from the front seat as the car sped toward the estate. The day had been grueling, and the last thing I needed was another problem. My temper still simmered from yesterday—catching Nathaniel with Lillian in broad daylight had left me seething. I hadn’t spoken to either of them since.

I knew my reaction had been excessive. Nathaniel was a good kid—sharp, ambitious, and carrying himself well, just like his father. But the thought of him with Lillian made my gut twist violently. I forced the image away and turned to Marcus, whose gaze remained fixed on the road.

"Out with it," I snapped, my patience already frayed.

"It's about Lillian and Nathaniel," he admitted, hesitating.

Ice flooded my veins.

"What about them?" My voice was dangerously low.

"They were seen together last night. On a date." He swallowed. "At Le Ciel. Witnesses say they were holding hands."

Red clouded my vision. I had explicitly ordered Nathaniel to stay away from her. And Lillian—she knew damn well I could dismiss her in an instant. Was she really this reckless? Or was she banking on Nathaniel’s wealth to settle her father’s debts?

Either way, I wouldn’t tolerate her games.

"Drive faster," I snarled. "Now."

Marcus didn’t argue. He knew better than to test me when I was like this. The engine roared as we tore through the streets, reaching the estate in record time. I didn’t spare him a glance as I stormed inside.

Theodore bowed as I passed, still silent under my command. I barely registered him, striding straight into the parlor—expecting to find Lillian tutoring Oliver.

Instead, I found Nathaniel pinning Donovan against the wall by his collar, fury rolling off him in waves.

"Let go of me," Donovan hissed through clenched teeth.

"Why the hell would you abandon your fated mate for my cousin?" Nathaniel growled, his voice lethally quiet.

"Because I fell in love," Donovan said, struggling against Nathaniel's grip. "I love Victoria."

"Bullshit," Nathaniel spat, his voice laced with venom.

"Believe what you want, but I'm telling the truth," Donovan shot back, his eyes narrowing dangerously.

"She was your fated mate!" Nathaniel snarled. "Your wolf would never abandon her so easily."

"You don’t understand," Donovan snapped. "You’ve never had a fated mate. I refused to let the Moon Goddess decide my future. I chose Victoria. I love her, and I’d do anything for her—even walk away from Lillian. She doesn’t know we were mates, and I’d prefer it stayed that way."

"And it will," I cut in, my voice slicing through the tension like a blade.

Both men froze. Nathaniel’s grip slackened, his golden curls falling into his eyes as he swallowed hard. He released Donovan and took a step back, raking a hand through his hair.

"Uncle," he murmured, his gaze dropping to the floor. "I… I lost control. I just—I don’t want anyone getting hurt because of him."

"I agree," I said, watching as surprise flickered across both their faces. "I don’t want anyone hurt either." My attention locked onto Donovan, my expression hardening.

"If you aren’t completely devoted to my daughter," I said, my voice low and deliberate, "then walk away now. Before it’s too late. I won’t let her marry someone who isn’t all in."

As much as it would devastate Victoria if Donovan left now, it would destroy her far worse if they married and he betrayed her later. She wouldn’t survive that kind of pain.

My daughter’s happiness was everything. I’d move heaven and earth to see her smile.

But if Donovan ever hurt her?

I wouldn’t hesitate to end him.

The scent of pine and damp earth filled Lillian's senses as she stepped onto the forest trail behind Blackwood Manor. Moonlight filtered through the dense canopy, casting eerie patterns on the moss-covered ground. Her wolf stirred restlessly beneath her skin, sensing something her human mind couldn't yet comprehend.

"Sebastian?" she called softly, her voice barely above a whisper. The Alpha had asked her to meet him here after dinner, but the clearing stood empty except for the rustling leaves.

A twig snapped behind her. Lillian spun around, her claws extending instinctively. The familiar musk of sandalwood and leather washed over her just as Sebastian emerged from the shadows, his golden eyes glowing in the dim light.

"You're getting better at sensing my approach," he murmured, stepping close enough for his warmth to chase away the evening chill. "But your defensive stance still needs work."

Lillian rolled her shoulders, forcing herself to relax. "Maybe if you didn't enjoy sneaking up on me so much, I wouldn't need one."

Sebastian's lips quirked in that infuriating half-smile she'd come to both dread and anticipate. "Come," he said, jerking his chin toward a narrow path. "There's something I want to show you."

They walked in silence for several minutes, the only sounds being their footsteps and the occasional hoot of an owl. Lillian's pulse quickened when Sebastian's hand brushed against hers, sending electric currents up her arm.

The trees suddenly gave way to a hidden glade illuminated by hundreds of tiny bioluminescent mushrooms growing in perfect concentric circles. At the center stood an ancient oak, its gnarled trunk wider than three men standing shoulder to shoulder.

"This is..." Lillian breathed, stepping forward in awe.

"The Heart Tree," Sebastian finished. "It's been in my family for generations. Legend says it grows where the first Blackwood Alpha found his mate."

Lillian reached out to touch the rough bark, but Sebastian caught her wrist. "Wait." His voice held an unfamiliar note of tension. "There's something you should know before we go any further."

The seriousness in his tone made her stomach clench. "What is it?"

Sebastian hesitated, his jaw working. Just as he opened his mouth to speak, a chorus of howls erupted in the distance - too close for comfort. His head snapped up, eyes flashing dangerously.

"Stay here," he commanded, already shifting. "Don't move until I return."

Before Lillian could protest, Sebastian's massive black wolf form disappeared into the trees. The howls grew louder, accompanied by the unmistakable sound of snapping branches and snarls.

Lillian's wolf clawed at her consciousness, demanding to be set free. She knew she should obey Sebastian's order, but the thought of him facing danger alone made her blood run cold.

Another sound cut through the night - a high-pitched whimper that didn't belong to any adult werewolf. Lillian's heart stopped when she recognized it.

"Oliver!" She took off running toward the sound, her transformation already beginning.

As she burst into a smaller clearing, the scene before her made her blood freeze. Oliver stood trembling between two enormous wolves she didn't recognize, their lips curled back in vicious snarls. Behind them stood a tall figure silhouetted by moonlight - a man with eyes that glowed the same eerie gold as Sebastian's.

"Well, well," the stranger drawled, his voice dripping with malice. "If it isn't the little human pet my brother's become so fond of."

Lillian bared her teeth as her shift completed. She positioned herself between Oliver and the threat, her growl reverberating through the clearing. The stranger merely laughed.

"How touching. The mutt thinks she can protect what belongs to us." He took a step forward, his scent hitting Lillian like a physical blow - similar to Sebastian's, but twisted with something dark and rotten. "Tell me, girl, did my brother mention he had an identical twin?"

###Chapter 87 I do love her

"I do love her, sir," Donovan said, bowing his head in my direction. "I would never do anything to hurt her."

"Nathaniel took Lillian on a date last night. Donovan and Victoria happened to be at the same restaurant. He couldn’t take his eyes off her the entire time," Nathaniel hissed through clenched teeth.

I hadn’t expected Nathaniel to openly confess his date after I explicitly forbade him from seeing Lillian. But his fury toward Donovan had clearly overridden his caution.

"I thought I made myself clear—stay away from her," I growled, pinning my nephew with a glare.

Nathaniel exhaled sharply and met my gaze head-on.

"I know, Uncle, and I’m sorry. But I couldn’t stay away. She’s unlike anyone I’ve ever met. She’s extraordinary, and we connect in ways I never thought possible. I care about her, and I believe she feels the same," Nathaniel explained, his voice firm.

A cold wave of irritation washed over me at his words. Logically, I had no right to dictate Lillian’s choices. What she did in her personal life wasn’t my concern—no matter how much my wolf snarled at the thought.

"We’re seeing each other again tonight," Nathaniel continued, undeterred. "I don’t want to hide it from you, but I will if I have to."

My jaw tightened, my stare unwavering.

"You’ve got some nerve," Donovan scoffed, crossing his arms. "That waitress was practically draped over you all evening. You barely even acknowledged it."

Nathaniel’s expression darkened.

"Not that it’s any of your business, but it was handled. Lillian and I talked about it, and she understood," he snapped.

Donovan rolled his eyes.

"Lillian’s sharp. She’ll see through you eventually. This won’t last," he muttered under his breath.

"Enough!" My voice cut through the tension like a blade, forcing their attention back to me. "This isn’t about Lillian—this is about Victoria. Donovan, I swear to the Moon Goddess, if you hurt my daughter, death will be a mercy compared to what I’ll do to you first."

The air thickened with my Alpha aura, and Donovan visibly shuddered, bowing his head.

"I would never hurt her. I love her, Alpha," he insisted.

Even as he spoke, doubt gnawed at me. Nathaniel was right—why would Donovan abandon his fated mate for Victoria unless he saw an opportunity? With her at his side, he’d secure his claim to the Redmoon pack.

"You don’t seem surprised that Donovan and Lillian were mates," Nathaniel pointed out.

My gaze remained locked on Donovan as I answered.

"Because I already knew. Lillian and I had an understanding—her past with Donovan wouldn’t interfere with the present. She wouldn’t jeopardize this wedding for my daughter’s sake. I expect you to honor that same understanding."

Nathaniel’s brows shot up. "Lillian knew you knew? She never mentioned it—"

"That wasn’t her responsibility to share, and it wasn’t information you needed. Your focus should be on Victoria. Do I make myself clear?"

Donovan swallowed hard, his eyes flickering between defiance and submission. He knew better than to challenge me if he wanted to keep his ambitions intact.

"Yes, Alpha," he said stiffly. "My priority is Victoria."

"Good." My tone was icy. "Now leave."

He nodded and turned toward the kitchen.

Once alone with Nathaniel, I studied him. "I know you don’t want to hear this, but—"

"Just be careful," I cut him off.

Midway through this confrontation, I’d realized the absurdity of my possessiveness. Lillian wasn’t mine to control. If she chose Nathaniel, so be it—he was still better than most. My wolf bristled at the thought, but I forced it down.

"You’re actually okay with this?" Nathaniel asked, incredulous.

"I didn’t say that," I muttered, turning away. "Nephew or not, Nathaniel—if you hurt her, I’ll end you."

###Chapter 88 Lillian's POV

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the lavish bedroom, illuminating Lillian’s tousled hair as she stirred awake. Beside her, Sebastian Blackwood slept soundly, his muscular arm draped protectively over her waist. A faint smile touched her lips as she traced the sharp line of his jaw with her fingertips.

Last night had been… intense.

Her cheeks warmed at the memory. The way his hands had explored every inch of her body, the possessive growls rumbling in his chest, the way he had whispered her name like a prayer—

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Miss Lillian?" Harper’s voice floated through the wood. "Breakfast is ready. Alpha Sebastian requested you join him in the dining room."

Lillian bit her lip. Alpha Sebastian. Even the title sent a thrill down her spine.

"I’ll be right there," she called back, carefully slipping out of bed so as not to wake him.

She padded to the ensuite bathroom, her bare feet sinking into the plush carpet. The mirror reflected her flushed face, her lips still slightly swollen from last night’s kisses. She turned on the faucet, splashing cool water onto her skin in an attempt to calm the lingering heat.

Get it together, Lillian.

She dressed quickly in a simple sundress, one of the many Sebastian had insisted on buying for her. The soft fabric hugged her curves, and she couldn’t help but admire the way it made her feel—beautiful, desired.

When she stepped into the dining room, Sebastian was already seated at the head of the table, his piercing gaze locking onto her the moment she entered. His lips curled into a slow, knowing smirk.

"Sleep well?" he murmured, his voice rough with amusement.

Lillian’s pulse spiked. Oh, he knew exactly what he was doing.

"Like a rock," she shot back, sliding into the chair beside him.

His chuckle was low, sending shivers down her spine. "Good. You’ll need your energy today."

She arched a brow. "And why’s that?"

Before he could answer, Oliver bounded into the room, his small face alight with excitement. "Lillian! Dad! Guess what? Uncle Marcus said I can train with the warriors today!"

Sebastian’s expression softened as he ruffled his son’s hair. "Did he now?"

Oliver nodded eagerly. "He said I’m strong enough!"

Lillian grinned. "That’s amazing, Oliver."

The boy beamed before digging into his pancakes with gusto.

Sebastian leaned closer to Lillian, his breath warm against her ear. "As for you… I have a surprise."

Her stomach fluttered. "What kind of surprise?"

His smirk deepened. "You’ll see."

Just then, Theodore entered, clearing his throat. "Alpha, Beta Marcus is waiting for you in the study."

Sebastian sighed but stood. "Duty calls." He pressed a lingering kiss to Lillian’s temple. "Don’t go anywhere."

She watched him leave, her heart pounding.

What was he planning?

And more importantly—why did the thought of it make her blood sing?

I had no idea what to expect, but an outdoor light show gallery certainly wasn’t it. The entire place was buzzing with energy, the open-air space illuminated by breathtaking displays of light and art. It was the most mesmerizing sight I’d ever seen. Packmates from all over had contributed their artwork, each piece glowing under the most enchanting lighting imaginable. My mind spun as Nathaniel and I wandered through the exhibit.

Nathaniel had told me not to dress up, so I’d opted for dark jeans and a fitted blouse—just enough to tease a hint of cleavage without distracting him too much. Dominic had driven us, but he stayed in the car while we explored. Food trucks lined the street, and Nathaniel suggested grabbing a bite. I agreed, and we made our way over.

"How did you even find out about this place?" I asked between bites of my corn dog. Nathaniel had gone for a chili dog, and I couldn’t help but smile at the contrast—last night, we’d dined on gourmet cuisine, and now we were indulging in greasy street food.

He took a messy bite, smearing sauce on his cheek before washing it down with a sip of his oversized soda. "Victoria mentioned it," he admitted.

I frowned. "What?"

"She said she wanted to check it out. Figured it’d be fun for us too," he said with a casual shrug. My stomach twisted as I glanced around, my lips pressing into a thin line.

"Did she say she was coming?" I tried to keep my voice light, but the thought of Donovan showing up made my skin prickle. The last thing I needed was another confrontation.

"I think she changed her mind. She and Donovan have been arguing a lot lately," he murmured. "Doubt she was in the mood for anything tonight." I nodded, chewing my lower lip. Donovan hadn’t exactly been subtle with his hostility, and I worried it would ruin his relationship with Victoria. If they broke up, Sebastian would blame me—and I had no doubt he’d fire me.

"This is amazing," Nathaniel said, taking another huge bite. "Who knew messy food could taste this good?"

I laughed, grabbing a napkin and stepping closer to wipe the sauce from his cheek. "You’ve got a little something… everywhere," I teased.

After finishing our food, we tossed our trash and continued exploring. One sculpture in particular caught my eye—a stunning white marble carving of a woman. Her long, flowing hair cascaded around her slender waist, her gown clinging to her curves while still leaving enough to the imagination. She gazed up at the sky, arms outstretched as if reaching for the stars, her face bathed in moonlight.

The entire gallery shimmered under the soft glow of golden lights, but it was her—the marble statue of the Moon Goddess—that commanded attention, her ethereal beauty casting a spell over the space.

"Who is she?" I breathed, my voice barely above a whisper as I gazed into the statue's lifelike eyes, carved with such precision they seemed to hold secrets of the night.

Nathaniel stepped closer, his warmth brushing against my side. "The Moon Goddess," he murmured, his voice rich with reverence. "A celestial queen who watches over our kind."

"She's breathtaking," I admitted, unable to tear my eyes away.

His fingers found mine, intertwining gently, sending a jolt of warmth through me. "She is," he agreed, but when I glanced at him, he wasn’t looking at the statue. His dark eyes were fixed on me, intense and unreadable. My cheeks burned under his scrutiny, my pulse quickening.

The evening was nothing short of magical—soft jazz notes floated through the air, mingling with the hushed conversations of guests who moved through the gallery like shadows, careful not to disturb the sacred ambiance.

Nathaniel closed his eyes, swaying slightly to the melody. "I love this song," he confessed, a faint smile playing on his lips.

I arched a brow. "You listen to jazz?"

He cracked one eye open, mischief dancing in his gaze. "Religiously," he admitted. "Back in France, it was my escape. The saxophone, the piano—it reminds me of home."

"You've only been gone a few days," I pointed out. "Do you miss it?"

He shrugged, his expression thoughtful. "Parts of it, yes. My company, my friends. But there's something here that I can't find there."

I watched as he moved effortlessly to the rhythm, his body attuned to the music in a way that was almost hypnotic. "And what's that?" I pressed.

Instead of answering, he extended his hand toward me, palm up—an invitation. I hesitated, my breath catching. His lips curved into that boyish grin that always unraveled my defenses, and before I could second-guess myself, I placed my hand in his.

In one fluid motion, he pulled me into his arms, one hand settling at the small of my back while the other cradled mine with surprising tenderness. We moved together, swaying to the music as if we’d done this a thousand times before. Then, with a playful spin, he twirled me out before drawing me back against his chest, my back pressed to his front.

His breath tickled my ear as he finally answered, his voice low and rough. "You."

The world tilted as he dipped me backward, my head falling with a breathless laugh. But before I could fully process the rush, he pulled me upright again, our bodies flush, our steps perfectly in sync. Around us, guests paused to watch, their smiles knowing, but I barely noticed.

All I could see was him.

###Chapter 89 you lied

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, painting the marble floors in warm hues. Lillian stretched lazily in the oversized bed, her body still humming from the intensity of last night’s mating bond. Sebastian had been relentless, his possessive nature flaring up after the confrontation with Donovan.

She traced her fingers over the fresh bite mark on her shoulder—Sebastian’s claim, still tender. A shiver ran down her spine at the memory of his growl vibrating against her skin.

The door creaked open, and Oliver peeked in, his dark curls tousled from sleep. "Lillian?" he whispered, clutching a stuffed wolf to his chest.

She smiled and patted the space beside her. "Morning, sweetheart. Did you sleep well?"

Oliver climbed onto the bed, his small frame bouncing slightly. "I had a dream about flying," he said excitedly. "But then I woke up and remembered I can’t."

Lillian chuckled, ruffling his hair. "Maybe one day, when you’re older."

Sebastian strode in then, already dressed in a tailored navy suit, his presence commanding the room. His golden eyes flickered with satisfaction as he took in the sight of Lillian and Oliver together.

"Good, you're awake," he said, his voice deep. "We have a meeting with the council in an hour."

Lillian groaned, flopping back onto the pillows. "Do we have to? I was hoping for a lazy morning."

Sebastian smirked, leaning down to brush his lips against hers. "No excuses, little wolf. The sooner we deal with this, the sooner I can have you to myself again."

Oliver made a face. "Ew, gross."

Lillian laughed, swatting Sebastian’s chest lightly. "See what you did?"

Sebastian merely arched a brow before turning to his son. "Oliver, go get dressed. Victoria will take you to breakfast."

The boy scrambled off the bed, his stuffed wolf forgotten as he dashed out the door.

Lillian sighed, sitting up. "What’s the meeting about?"

Sebastian’s expression darkened. "Donovan’s been stirring trouble. He’s challenging my claim over you."

Her stomach twisted. "He can’t be serious."

"He is," Sebastian growled. "And he’s not alone. Alpha Harrison is backing him."

Lillian’s breath hitched. Alpha Harrison—the same man who had tried to take advantage of her when she was vulnerable. The thought of facing him again made her skin crawl.

Sebastian cupped her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. "No one touches what’s mine," he said, his voice edged with steel. "Not Donovan, not Harrison—no one."

The possessiveness in his tone sent a thrill through her, but beneath it, unease lingered.

Because if Donovan was willing to go this far, what else was he capable of?

And more importantly—what would Sebastian do to stop him?


The music swirled around us as Nathaniel and I began to dance, our steps perfectly in sync. "You certainly know how to charm a lady, Mr. Whitlock," I teased as he spun me again, this time with a little more flair. The sudden motion nearly sent me stumbling, forcing me to clutch his shoulder for balance. The movement brought me flush against him, our bodies pressed close enough that I could feel the steady rhythm of his heartbeat.

My breath hitched when we paused, mere inches apart, our breaths mingling in the cool night air.

"I only speak what I feel, Miss Dumont," he murmured before dipping me low, his grip firm yet gentle.

As the final notes of the song faded, applause erupted around us. I offered the crowd a small, gracious wave while Nathaniel chuckled, guiding me away from the gathering with a hand at the small of my back. We strolled beneath the glittering canopy of stars, the moon casting a silvery glow over the gardens.

"It's a perfect night," I mused, tilting my head up to admire the sky.

"Indeed," he agreed, his voice warm.

Then, unexpectedly, his arm slid around my waist, pulling me closer. I stiffened slightly—without the excuse of dancing, the sudden intimacy felt strange, almost too deliberate.

"Thank you for accompanying me tonight, Lillian," he said, his tone sincere. "You’ve made this evening unforgettable."

"I enjoyed myself too, Nathaniel," I replied softly. "Thank you."

We stopped walking, and he turned to face me fully. His fingers brushed a loose strand of hair from my cheek, his touch featherlight.

"You’re breathtaking," he murmured. "And I owe you an apology—I may have been too forward last night. I never meant to make you uncomfortable."

Heat rushed to my cheeks at the memory—his lips nearly meeting mine before I turned away, avoiding the kiss.

"It wasn’t discomfort," I admitted. "I just… wasn’t ready."

His gaze searched mine, thoughtful. "Because of Donovan?"

The name struck like a physical blow. I tensed, instinctively trying to step back, but his grip held me in place.

"I—what?" My voice came out sharper than intended, my pulse spiking.

"I know about the two of you," he confessed. "Dominic looked into it. You were fated mates."

"Why would you investigate that?" I hissed, my stomach twisting.

"I didn’t mean to cross a line," he said quickly. "But I could tell something was weighing on you. I just wanted to understand, Lillian. Not to hurt you."

"And you couldn’t have just asked me?" My voice trembled with betrayal.

"I did," he reminded me gently. "And you lied."

The accusation burned. I opened my mouth to protest, but he continued before I could speak.

"You don’t have to be afraid—"

The rest of his words were lost as my mind reeled. How much did he really know? And what else had Dominic uncovered?

The night no longer felt so perfect.

Nathaniel's voice was soft yet firm as he spoke. "Lillian. I'm here, and I won't hurt you. What he did was unforgivable, but none of it was your fault."

"Victoria must never find out—"

"I know," he murmured, his tone soothing. "And she won't."

I swallowed hard, my throat tight with unshed tears. My gaze locked onto his, searching for any hint of deception. When I found none, I gave a small, hesitant nod.

"You're safe with me, Lillian. I swear it," he promised, his hand resting lightly on my shoulder.

Something in his words made my rigid posture ease. His lips curved into a gentle smile as he leaned closer, his breath warm against my skin.

"You say you're not ready," he murmured, his fingers tracing the line of my jaw. "But the fact that you're here with me now tells a different story." His thumb brushed my lower lip, sending a shiver down my spine. "I want to kiss you."

My breath hitched. His dark eyes burned with intensity, fixed on my mouth. My pulse quickened, and after a heartbeat of hesitation, I nodded.

A slow, satisfied smile tugged at his lips before he closed the distance between us. His kiss was tender, achingly soft, as if he feared I might break beneath his touch.

Third Person POV

The moment stretched between them, charged with unspoken emotions. Nathaniel's hands cradled Lillian's face as if she were something precious, something to be cherished.

She melted into him, her earlier tension dissolving under the warmth of his touch.

But even as their lips moved together, a shadow of doubt lingered in the back of her mind.

Was this real?

Or was it just another fleeting moment before the storm?

###Chapter 90 Lillian's POV

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains of Lillian's bedroom, casting delicate patterns across the rumpled sheets. She stirred, her body aching in places she hadn't known could ache, memories of last night flooding back with embarrassing clarity.

"Ugh," she groaned, burying her face in the pillow that still carried Sebastian's intoxicating scent. Her wolf purred contentedly, thoroughly satisfied after their passionate reunion.

A soft knock at the door made her jump. "Miss Lillian?" Giselle's polite voice called. "Mr. Blackwood asked me to inform you breakfast will be served in thirty minutes."

Lillian's stomach growled in response. "Thank you, Giselle," she called back, wincing at how hoarse her voice sounded.

She dragged herself to the ensuite bathroom, catching her reflection in the mirror. The love bites trailing down her neck made her cheeks burn. "You animal," she muttered to her absent mate, though she couldn't suppress the smug smile tugging at her lips.

The steaming shower helped ease some of the soreness. As she dressed in the casual outfit someone—probably Sebastian—had left out for her, her phone buzzed with a message from Beatrice:

"So... did you two work things out? Or should I start planning a funeral?"

Lillian snorted. "Very funny. We're good. Better than good."

"Details. Now."

"Not a chance," Lillian typed back, grinning. "Some things are private."

She pocketed her phone just as another knock sounded—this one sharper, more impatient. Before she could respond, the door swung open to reveal Oliver, his little face scrunched in disapproval.

"You slept forever!" he accused, hands on his hips. "Dad said not to wake you, but I'm hungry and he won't eat until you do."

Lillian's heart melted. "Well, we can't have that, can we?" She ruffled his hair. "Lead the way, munchkin."

The dining room was bathed in golden morning light, the long table set with an elaborate spread. Sebastian stood by the window, phone to his ear, his commanding presence making the spacious room feel suddenly small. He turned at their entrance, his stormy eyes lighting up when they landed on her.

"I'll call you back," he said abruptly, ending his call. In three long strides he was before her, cupping her face with surprising gentleness. "Good morning," he murmured, brushing his lips against hers in a kiss that made her toes curl despite their audience.

Oliver made exaggerated gagging sounds. "Gross! Can we eat now?"

Sebastian chuckled, the rare sound sending warmth through Lillian's chest. "Yes, Oliver. Let's eat."

As they settled around the table, Marcus entered with urgent news. "Alpha, we have a situation at the eastern border. Rogue wolves trespassing again."

Sebastian's jaw tightened. "How many?"

"At least a dozen. They're being unusually aggressive."

Lillian's stomach dropped. Rogues didn't normally travel in such numbers unless... unless they were being directed by someone.

Sebastian met her worried gaze. "Eat," he ordered gently. "I'll handle this." He stood, already issuing commands to Marcus.

But as he turned to leave, Lillian caught his wrist. "Wait." She rose, determination straightening her spine. "I'm coming with you."

Oliver piped up, "Me too!"

"No," both adults said simultaneously.

Sebastian's thumb stroked her inner wrist. "You're still recovering," he said lowly, for her ears only.

She lifted her chin. "I'm your Luna now. This is my duty too."

The pride in his eyes made her pulse skip. After a beat, he nodded. "Very well. But stay close."

As they hurried out, Lillian couldn't shake the growing unease coiling in her gut. This wasn't random. Someone was testing their borders—testing them. And she had a terrible suspicion she knew exactly who.

"He kissed you?!" Beatrice's shriek pierced through the phone the next afternoon, forcing me to pull the device away from my ear.

"Yes," I admitted, stepping out of the Uber as it parked outside Sebastian’s sprawling villa. The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the manicured lawn. "It was... unexpected." I handed the driver a generous tip before shutting the door behind me.

"Beatrice, I have to go—I just got to work," I said, hurrying up the stone steps leading to the grand entrance.

"Fine, but you better call me later. I need every detail," she demanded.

"Promise," I assured her before ending the call.

Truthfully, there wasn’t much to tell. The kiss had been... adequate. Pleasant, even. But it hadn’t set my pulse racing. It hadn’t left me breathless. It certainly hadn’t made my knees weak.

Not like his kisses had.

My cheeks flushed at the memory.

Why did Sebastian keep invading my thoughts at moments like this? I shouldn’t be thinking about him—or the way his lips had once claimed mine with such possessive heat. But even last night, while dancing under the stars with Nathaniel, my traitorous mind had wandered.

What if it had been Sebastian’s arms around me instead? What if it had been his lips brushing against mine in the dim glow of the jazz club? What if, just for one night, I had been the only woman he wanted?

I shook my head sharply. Ridiculous. Those thoughts were dangerous. Sebastian was my employer—nothing more. That one reckless night in his office didn’t mean he felt anything for me.

If anything, he saw me exactly as I feared: a fleeting distraction. Someone to indulge in for a night and forget by morning.

The bitter thought coiled in my chest like smoke.

Theodore stood at the doorway, his expression as cold as ever. He still hadn’t forgiven me for humiliating him in front of Sebastian. Now, he wasn’t even permitted to speak unless directly addressed. Not that I felt guilty—Theodore had been scheming to get me fired since day one.

Ironically, he had been the one to recommend me for this job.

"Master Oliver is waiting in the parlor," he informed me stiffly. "He’s already begun his assignments. I believe he’s eager for your sparring session this evening."

A smile tugged at my lips. Oliver’s enthusiasm was contagious.

"Thank you, Theodore," I replied, keeping my tone polite despite the tension between us.

As I stepped inside, the weight of unspoken desires and unasked questions lingered in the air—thick enough to choke on.

I didn’t want any tension between us, but that was entirely up to him.

He gave a curt nod, and I continued toward the back parlor, where Oliver was hunched over his book, scribbling notes in his notebook. The sight made me smile—until my gaze landed on the figure lounging on the loveseat across the room, her fingers flying over her phone screen.

When I stepped inside, she glanced up, offering a tight, humorless smile.

"Hello, Lillian," Victoria greeted, her voice tinged with something close to melancholy.

"Hey, Victoria," I replied, keeping my tone neutral, though her presence here unsettled me.

At least she was alone this time. I wanted to ask where Donovan was, but the stormy look in her eyes told me everything. Maybe she was still fuming over being dragged to the gallery last night. Nathaniel had mentioned they’d been arguing nonstop lately, and she hadn’t even wanted to go out. So, imagine my surprise when I spotted them there after our walk.

I’d fully expected Donovan to corner me at some point, but shockingly, he kept his distance.

Maybe he’d finally gotten the message that I wanted nothing to do with him. Or maybe he was too busy reassuring his precious Victoria that his attention wasn’t wandering.

"Do you mind if I sit with you while you tutor?" she asked, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. "I need a distraction."

I glanced at Oliver, still absorbed in his work, then back at Victoria.

"Sure," I said.

Relief flickered across her face as she sank deeper into the loveseat. I took my place beside Oliver, and for the next hour, we worked through his assignments, reviewing what he’d already completed. Once finished, we headed outside for combat practice.

To my surprise, Victoria trailed after us, eyes glued to her phone, barely watching where she stepped.

When we reached the training area, she flopped onto a lounge chair, fingers still flying over her screen. I frowned, but she didn’t notice.

"Her and Donovan had another fight," Oliver murmured under his breath. "She’s been sulking all day."

###Chapter 91 Big day?

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting a golden glow over the room. Lillian stretched lazily, her muscles still sore from yesterday’s training session. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted up from downstairs, making her stomach growl.

She rolled out of bed, her bare feet sinking into the plush carpet. The events of last night replayed in her mind—Donovan’s sudden appearance at the pack gathering, the way his eyes had lingered on her before he turned away. It had been months since their bond was severed, yet his presence still unsettled her.

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, pulling on a robe.

The door creaked open, revealing Beatrice, her best friend, balancing a tray of breakfast in one hand and a stack of fashion magazines in the other. "Morning, sleepyhead," she chirped, setting the tray down on the bedside table. "Thought you might need some fuel before your big day."

Lillian blinked. "Big day?"

Beatrice rolled her eyes. "Don’t tell me you forgot. The Alpha Summit starts today. Sebastian’s expecting you to be there."

Right. The summit.

Lillian groaned, rubbing her temples. With everything that had happened recently, the event had completely slipped her mind. "I’m not sure I’m ready for this," she admitted, picking at the fruit on the tray.

Beatrice plopped down beside her, flipping open one of the magazines. "You’ll be fine. Besides, it’s not like you’re going alone. Sebastian will be there, and so will Marcus and the others."

Lillian sighed. That was true. But the thought of facing Donovan again—this time in front of the entire Lycan Council—made her stomach twist.

"You’re overthinking it," Beatrice said, nudging her shoulder. "Just focus on what you need to do. And maybe wear something that’ll make Donovan regret ever letting you go."

A smirk tugged at Lillian’s lips. "You’re terrible."

Beatrice grinned. "I know."

The Blackwood estate was buzzing with activity when they arrived. Lycans from various packs milled about the grand hall, their voices a low hum of conversation. Lillian adjusted the strap of her dress, suddenly self-conscious under the weight of so many gazes.

Sebastian appeared at her side, his presence instantly grounding her. "You look stunning," he murmured, his fingers brushing against hers.

She exhaled, some of the tension leaving her shoulders. "Thanks. I just hope I don’t embarrass you in front of everyone."

He chuckled. "Impossible."

Before she could respond, a familiar voice cut through the crowd.

"Lillian."

She turned, her breath hitching as Donovan stepped into view. His dark eyes flickered over her, unreadable. Evelyn clung to his arm, her lips curved in a smug smile.

"Donovan," Lillian replied, forcing her voice to remain steady.

The air between them crackled with unspoken tension.

Sebastian’s grip on her hand tightened slightly, a silent reminder that she wasn’t alone.

Then, from the corner of her eye, Lillian spotted Alpha Harrison making his way toward them, his expression unreadable.

The summit was about to begin.

And with it, the storm.

My heart softened slightly; I couldn't help but feel a pang of sympathy for her. She had no clue about the heartless bastard she was engaged to, but perhaps, in time, she’d figure it out on her own. I shook the thought away—it wasn’t my place to worry. My only concern was completing my job. My focus was on my father, paying off his debts so he could return to my mother, and we could finally be a family again.

Oliver and I spent the next few hours sparring, drilling his defensive techniques. By the time we finished, we were both breathless and drenched in sweat.

"Good session," I praised, giving him an encouraging pat on the shoulder. "You're improving fast."

"Only because I have the best teacher," he replied with a bright grin. "Thanks, Lillian."

"You should head inside and shower before dinner. I’m sure the maids are already preparing it," I said, checking my watch—just past five.

He nodded eagerly and dashed inside. My gaze drifted to Victoria, who was no longer engrossed in her phone. Instead, she was staring at me with an unreadable expression—nervousness, maybe? Like she wanted to say something but was too hesitant. If she had something on her mind, she’d speak up eventually, so I turned away and began packing my gear into my bag.

I hadn’t noticed her moving, but when I turned back around, she was standing right behind me. I nearly stumbled backward in surprise.

"Sorry," she murmured, biting her lower lip. "Didn’t mean to startle you..."

She shifted awkwardly, rubbing her arm as she stood there. I exhaled, relenting. "Everything okay, Victoria? You seem... off today."

As if snapping out of a trance, she blinked rapidly before meeting my eyes.

"I don’t know. I guess I’m just... confused," she admitted. "Lillian, would you come shopping with me tonight?"

I arched a brow. "I don’t exactly have spare cash for shopping," I admitted, heat creeping into my cheeks.

"My treat, obviously," she said quickly. "We could grab dinner too. Just us."

"Is there a reason?" I asked, studying her.

She glanced down. "No... I just need someone to talk to."

"I’m not sure I’m the right person for that, Victoria—"

"I don’t have anyone else," she cut in, her voice pleading. "Please. I could really use some girl time."

My heart ached for the girl, and I couldn’t bring myself to refuse. With a reluctant sigh, I gave in.

"Alright," I said, glancing down at my sweat-drenched workout clothes. "But I should probably change first."

"I have something you can borrow!" Victoria exclaimed, seizing my arm with enthusiasm. "Come on, Lillian!"

She tugged me along, and as we stepped inside, we nearly collided with Sebastian Blackwood. He froze at the sight of us, his piercing gaze darkening when he noticed our linked arms.

"What’s going on here?" he demanded, his eyes flickering between us.

Victoria answered before I could even open my mouth. "I’m taking Lillian to change. We’re going shopping and then grabbing dinner."

Sebastian’s brows lifted slightly as he studied his daughter before his attention shifted to me, his expression unreadable.

"Is that so?" His voice was low, edged with something I couldn’t quite place.

I bit my lip, nodding slowly, refusing to break eye contact. "Yes," I replied, though my voice came out softer, breathier than I intended.

My pulse raced, and my wolf stirred instantly in Sebastian’s presence. I clenched my jaw, forcing her back under control—she had a habit of making things awkward at the worst possible moments.

Victoria started to pull away, but as we moved to step around Sebastian, his hand closed around my bicep, stopping me in my tracks. The contact sent an electric jolt through me, raising goosebumps along my skin. Victoria frowned at her father.

"She’ll meet you upstairs," Sebastian told her, his tone leaving no room for argument.

Victoria hesitated, shooting me a concerned look before glaring at her father again. Finally, she relented, unhooking her arm from mine and hurrying up the stairs without another word.

Left alone with him, I turned to face Sebastian, his grip still firm but surprisingly gentle.

"Can I help you with something, Alpha?" I asked, feigning innocence.

His jaw tightened. "I don’t know what game you’re playing, but keep Victoria out of it," he growled through clenched teeth.

His words stung. I wasn’t playing any games—and the accusation was unfair.

"I’m not sure what you mean," I said honestly.

"You can pretend all you want," he murmured, his voice dangerously low. "But I know women like you. You’ll use anyone to get what you want." His grip tightened slightly. "You’ve already got my nephew wrapped around your finger. I’m sure he’s just another pawn in whatever scheme you’re running. But if you hurt my daughter, I swear, I’ll make your life a living hell."
###Chapter 92 Lillian's POV 

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian hurried across campus, her backpack slung over one shoulder. She had just finished her last class of the day, and her mind buzzed with thoughts of the upcoming weekend.

"Lillian! Wait up!" Beatrice called from behind, jogging to catch up.

Lillian turned, smiling as her best friend reached her. "You're late again. What happened this time?"

Beatrice rolled her eyes. "Professor Sinclair decided to give us a surprise quiz. As if we didn’t have enough to stress about."

Lillian chuckled. "Well, at least it’s over now. Want to grab coffee?"

Before Beatrice could answer, a sleek black car pulled up beside them. The tinted window rolled down, revealing Sebastian Blackwood’s piercing gaze.

"Lillian," he said, his voice smooth but commanding. "Get in."

Her pulse spiked. "What? Why?"

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "There’s been an incident at the pack house. We need to leave now."

Beatrice nudged her. "Go. I’ll see you later."

Lillian hesitated but climbed into the car. The moment the door shut, Sebastian accelerated, weaving through traffic with practiced ease.

"What kind of incident?" she asked, gripping the seat.

His knuckles whitened on the steering wheel. "Victoria’s engagement party was announced today. Donovan didn’t take it well."

Lillian’s stomach twisted. "What did he do?"

Sebastian’s expression darkened. "He showed up at the estate, drunk and furious. He made a scene, demanding to see you."

Her breath hitched. "Me? Why?"

Sebastian shot her a sidelong glance. "Because he still believes you’re his mate."

The car sped toward the Blackwood estate, the trees blurring past. Lillian’s mind raced. She had hoped Donovan would move on, but his obsession seemed to deepen with time.

As they pulled through the wrought-iron gates, she spotted Marcus Grayson waiting on the steps, his expression grim.

Sebastian parked and turned to her. "Stay close to me. No matter what."

Lillian nodded, her heart pounding. Whatever awaited them inside, she knew one thing—Donovan wasn’t going to leave without a fight.

And this time, she might not escape unscathed.

His words hit me like a slap. Did he truly believe I was so heartless, so scheming, that I would deliberately hurt someone just to get what I wanted? All I ever wanted was to work hard and clear my father’s debts. I wasn’t after anything else—and I certainly didn’t want to hurt anyone. Donovan was doing enough damage for the both of us.

But I refused to stand there and take his insults. I was sick of being treated like dirt. Wrenching my arm from his grip, I glared up at Sebastian, my fury burning in my gaze.

"I don’t want to hurt anyone," I snapped. "I’m perfectly capable of being friends with your daughter without any ulterior motives, Alpha Sebastian. If you have a problem with that, maybe you should take it up with her. She’s the one who invited me out, after all."

I didn’t wait for his reply. Turning on my heel, I stormed up the stairs after Victoria, though I could still feel the heat of Sebastian’s stare boring into my back. What was he thinking now? Did he actually believe me?

When I stepped into Victoria’s bedroom, she was already rummaging through her closet, pulling out an outfit for me. She glanced over her shoulder and grinned when she saw me lingering in the doorway.

"Did Father upset you?" she asked, studying my expression.

"No," I lied smoothly. "He was just asking about Oliver’s studies."

She nodded thoughtfully before turning back to her task. "Here, try this," she said, tossing me a white cropped top and a pair of high-waisted jeans.

I took them into the bathroom and changed. The clothes were a little snug—Victoria was smaller than me—but they fit well enough and were surprisingly stylish. I slipped my shoes back on, then freed my hair from its tight ponytail, running my fingers through the waves. A splash of cold water and a spritz of Victoria’s vanilla body spray later, I stepped out, feeling refreshed.

Victoria’s eyes lit up when she saw me. "You look amazing," she breathed. "Just toss your dirty clothes in the hamper. The maids will take care of them."

I hesitated but eventually did as she said, dropping my clothes into the woven basket near her closet. Victoria looped her arm through mine, beaming.

"Come on," she said, tugging me toward the door.

We descended the stairs just in time to see Sebastian speaking to his driver, Frederick, by the front entrance. Victoria’s smile faltered as she crossed her arms.

"What are you doing?" she demanded, narrowing her eyes at her father.

"Frederick will take you girls into the city," he replied smoothly.

"I was going to take my new car," Victoria huffed, crossing her arms defiantly.

"This isn't up for debate," Sebastian snapped, his tone leaving no room for argument.

I bit my lip, wondering if his irritation stemmed from our earlier conversation. Deciding not to push him further, I turned to Victoria, who was practically seething. It was clear she didn’t want Frederick driving us, but she also knew she had no choice in the matter.

After a tense moment, she finally relented and followed Frederick outside. I hesitated briefly, glancing back at Sebastian, who was watching me with an unreadable expression. His cold demeanor sent a nervous flutter through my stomach. Without a word, I turned and hurried after Victoria.

We climbed into the backseat while Frederick settled into the driver’s seat.

"Frederick, close the partition," Victoria commanded sharply.

Frederick met our eyes briefly in the rearview mirror before pressing the button that raised the tinted glass between the front and back seats, granting us privacy. Victoria exhaled heavily, as if she’d been holding her breath the entire time.

"Everything alright?" I asked after a long stretch of silence.

She turned to me, and the frustration in her gaze was unmistakable.

"I just wanted to escape," she murmured. "Away from all of it—the expectations, the watchful eyes. But my father makes sure I’m never alone. Not even for a second."

"It’s just Frederick," I pointed out. "He barely counts as supervision."

She rolled her eyes. "If you think it’s only him, you’re delusional. Look behind us."

I twisted in my seat and spotted the sleek black SUV trailing us. My brows shot up when I recognized the driver—one of the elite guards from the Silver Crescent pack. His companion was another high-ranking warrior.

"Are those Gammas?" I asked, impressed despite myself.

She sighed. "Yes. My father never lets me go anywhere without an escort. I was hoping that since I was with you, he’d ease up. But apparently not."

"So that’s why you wanted me to come along?" I asked, a pang of disappointment settling in my chest. I had thought she wanted my company, but it seemed I was just a convenient excuse to slip past her father’s security.

She frowned at me, her expression softening slightly. "It’s not just that. I do want you here."

But the hesitation in her voice told me otherwise.
###Chapter 93 Forgive me

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting golden streaks across the bedroom. Lillian stirred beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming with the remnants of last night’s passion. Beside her, Sebastian Blackwood lay sprawled, his muscular frame taking up most of the bed. His dark lashes fanned against his cheekbones, his breathing slow and even.

She should have felt content—blissful, even. But the weight of unspoken truths pressed against her chest like an anchor.

He still doesn’t know.

The thought gnawed at her as she slipped out of bed, careful not to wake him. The marble floor was cool beneath her bare feet as she padded to the window, gazing out at the sprawling estate below. The gardens were immaculate, the fountains glistening under the morning light. A perfect illusion of peace.

A knock at the door startled her.

"Miss Lillian?" Giselle Beaumont’s voice was soft but firm. "Breakfast is ready. Alpha Sebastian requested your presence in the dining hall."

Lillian swallowed hard. "Tell him I’ll be down shortly."

She dressed quickly, choosing a simple emerald-green dress that hugged her curves. The mirror reflected a woman who looked every bit the Lycan Alpha’s mate—except for the shadows in her eyes.

Downstairs, the scent of freshly baked croissants and rich coffee filled the air. Sebastian sat at the head of the table, his sharp gaze lifting as she entered.

"You’re late," he remarked, though his tone held no real bite.

"Forgive me," she murmured, sliding into the seat beside him. "I lost track of time."

His fingers brushed against hers beneath the table, sending a jolt of warmth through her. "You’ve been distracted lately."

Lillian forced a smile. "Just tired."

Sebastian studied her, his dark eyes probing. Before he could press further, Oliver bounded into the room, his cheeks flushed with excitement.

"Papa! Did you see? The new foal was born last night!"

Sebastian’s expression softened as he turned to his son. "I did. A strong one, just like his sire."

Oliver beamed, then glanced at Lillian. "You should come see, Lillian! He’s so tiny!"

She opened her mouth to reply, but a sharp pain lanced through her abdomen. She gasped, her fingers digging into the tablecloth.

Sebastian was on his feet instantly. "Lillian?"

The world tilted. The last thing she saw was his panicked face before darkness swallowed her whole.

When she came to, she was lying in a plush bed, the scent of antiseptic thick in the air. Dr. Langford stood nearby, her expression unreadable.

Sebastian loomed over her, his jaw clenched. "What the hell happened?"

Dr. Langford hesitated, then spoke carefully. "Miss Lillian is pregnant."

Silence.

Sebastian’s face went utterly still. Then, slowly, his gaze dropped to Lillian’s stomach.

Oh no.

Because the truth was far worse than he realized.

This child wasn’t his.

It was Donovan’s.

"No," Victoria murmured, her voice softening as she turned to me. "Honestly, I just wanted to spend time with you. I needed someone to talk to—someone who could help me sort through my thoughts and reassure me that I'm not losing my mind." She bit her lower lip, her gaze dropping to her fidgeting hands.

"What's bothering you?" I asked gently.

"Not here," she said after a brief pause, shaking her head. "Let's just enjoy the evening first. We can talk over dinner." I studied her for a moment before nodding. If she wasn't ready to open up now, I wouldn't push her. She clearly needed a distraction, something to ease the tension coiling inside her.

Thirty minutes later, we arrived in the heart of the bustling city. Frederick parked the sleek black car in front of an upscale department store, but unlike I expected, he didn’t step out with us. Instead, the two guards from the trailing vehicle emerged, dressed casually but with the unmistakable bulk of concealed weapons beneath their jackets. They kept a discreet distance, though their presence was impossible to ignore.

I appreciated their effort to remain unobtrusive, but I doubted Victoria cared. Her irritation was palpable as she shot them a sharp glare before turning away. "Let’s go in here," she declared, gesturing toward a high-end boutique I had only ever admired from afar. Even during my family’s wealthier days, I’d never dared step inside. But for Victoria, this was just another stop in her world of luxury.

"Pick out anything you like," she called over her shoulder as she disappeared between racks of designer clothing. "It’s on me."

"You really don’t have to—" I started, but she was already gone, swallowed by the sea of silk and chiffon.

Sighing, I wandered through the boutique, my fingers brushing against fabrics that cost more than my monthly rent. The opulence was overwhelming—gowns that belonged on red carpets, tailored suits fit for royalty. I couldn’t help but wonder what it must be like to live as Victoria did, where money was never an obstacle, where every desire was just a swipe of a credit card away.

Then my gaze snagged on the jewelry counter.

Among the glittering displays, one piece stood out—a necklace with a deep ruby pendant, its crimson hue rich and hypnotic. The delicate chain was pure gold, and tiny diamonds encircled the gemstone, making it shimmer under the boutique’s soft lighting. It was breathtaking. Without thinking, I reached out, my fingertips hovering just above the ruby—

The display case snapped shut with a sharp click.

I barely yanked my hand back in time. My pulse spiked as I looked up into the furious eyes of the boutique clerk.

"What do you think you're doing?" she hissed through clenched teeth.

My throat went dry. "I—I was just looking—"

"You couldn't even afford the air in this boutique, let alone lay a finger on this necklace. Keep your filthy hands off!"

My face drained of color as my wolf snarled inside my head. She despised this woman’s condescending tone.

"Excuse me?"

"You should be excused," she sneered. "How dare you waltz into my boutique and think you have the right to touch anything here? You don’t belong."

"I’m a paying customer—"

She let out a sharp, mocking laugh, cutting me off.

"Oh, please. You couldn’t afford a single thread from our socks, much less actual jewelry," she drawled, eyeing me with disdain. Her gaze raked over my outfit, and her nose wrinkled in disgust. "Just look at you—dressed like some back-alley escort. Is that how you make your living? Must be exhausting, selling yourself for scraps."

"You have no idea what you're talking about," I snapped.

"I can’t believe you were about to tarnish a five-million-dollar necklace," she hissed, shaking her head as she carefully placed the piece back on display. "You’re lucky you didn’t ruin it—I’d have made you pay for every scratch. Now, spare yourself further humiliation and get out."

A deep, authoritative voice cut through the tension. "What’s going on here?"

A tall man in an immaculate designer suit stepped forward, his polished shoes clicking against the marble floor. The woman behind the counter immediately straightened, her lips curling into a sycophantic smile.

"Sir, she nearly damaged the Isabella Fontaine ruby necklace," the woman tattled, pointing at me like I was a criminal.

The man’s cold eyes swept over me, assessing me from head to toe before narrowing.

"Do you have any comprehension of how much that necklace costs?" he demanded. "As the manager of this establishment, I enforce one simple rule: if you can’t afford what we sell, you don’t belong here. Unless you’re prepared to make a purchase, I suggest you leave."

The woman smirked. "Look at her—she couldn’t afford a hairpin from this place. She’s pathetic. Should I call security to escort her out, sir?"

Before the manager could respond, a familiar voice spoke from behind me, smooth and commanding.

"No need for security. I’m sure we can resolve this civilly."
###Chapter 94 Lillian's POV

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting golden streaks across the bedroom. Lillian stirred beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming with the remnants of last night’s passion. Beside her, Sebastian Blackwood lay sprawled, his muscular frame taking up most of the bed. His dark lashes fanned over his cheeks, his breathing deep and even.

She studied him, her heart swelling with a mix of awe and disbelief. How had she ended up here? Mated to the most powerful Lycan in the country, tangled in a web of politics, danger, and desire.

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," she murmured, pulling the sheet higher.

The door creaked open, and Oliver peeked inside, his bright blue eyes wide with excitement. "Lillian! Dad! Breakfast is ready!"

Sebastian groaned, rolling onto his back. "Five more minutes."

Lillian chuckled, ruffling Oliver’s hair. "We’ll be down soon, sweetheart."

The boy grinned before darting off, his footsteps echoing down the hall.

Sebastian cracked one eye open. "That child has more energy before dawn than I do all day."

Lillian smirked. "Maybe if you didn’t keep me up half the night—"

He pulled her against him, his lips brushing her ear. "Regrets?"

Heat flooded her cheeks. "Never."

A satisfied growl rumbled in his chest before he finally sat up, stretching. "We should get moving. Marcus has been texting me nonstop about the meeting with Alpha Voss."

Lillian’s smile faded. The tension between their pack and Maximilian Voss’s had been escalating for weeks. "Do you think he’ll actually agree to the truce?"

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "If he knows what’s good for him."

She traced the scars along his shoulder, remnants of battles fought long before she’d entered his life. "Be careful."

He caught her hand, pressing a kiss to her knuckles. "Always."

Downstairs, the dining room buzzed with activity. Oliver chattered animatedly to Beatrice, who sipped her coffee with an amused smile. Theodore, the ever-efficient butler, set a plate of steaming pancakes in front of Lillian.

"Morning, Miss Lillian."

"Thank you, Theodore."

Sebastian took his seat at the head of the table, his phone already in hand. "Marcus, update me."

Lillian tuned out the business talk, focusing instead on Oliver’s enthusiastic retelling of his latest soccer game. But her peace was short-lived.

A sharp knock at the front door sent a ripple of tension through the room.

Theodore excused himself, returning moments later with a grim expression. "Alpha Blackwood, you have… unexpected guests."

Sebastian’s eyes darkened. "Who?"

Before Theodore could answer, the door burst open.

Evelyn stood in the doorway, her designer dress wrinkled, her face streaked with tears. Behind her, Donovan loomed, his expression thunderous.

Lillian’s fork clattered onto her plate.

"Sebastian," Donovan snarled. "We need to talk."

The air thickened with hostility.

Sebastian rose slowly, his voice dangerously calm. "You have exactly ten seconds to explain why you’re in my home."

Evelyn stepped forward, her hands trembling. "It’s Victoria. She’s missing."

Lillian’s blood ran cold.

Sebastian’s grip on the table tightened, the wood groaning under the pressure. "What do you mean, missing?"

Donovan’s gaze locked onto Lillian, his lips curling into a sneer. "She disappeared last night. And we both know who’s responsible."

The accusation hung in the air like a guillotine.

Lillian’s heart pounded. This wasn’t happening.

Sebastian’s growl shook the room. "Choose your next words very carefully."

Oliver whimpered, clutching Beatrice’s arm.

Lillian stood, her voice steady despite the storm inside her. "I had nothing to do with this."

Donovan’s laugh was bitter. "Funny. Because the last person she was seen with? Was you."

The room spun.

No.

This was a setup.

And she was walking right into it.

"Ugh, you brought your grubby little friend along? This isn't a charity shop," the woman sneered, her lip curling in disgust. "I'm calling secur—"

Before she could finish, the manager seized her arm and jerked her back so hard she nearly toppled over. Her startled gaze flickered around the room before landing on her boss.

"S-sir?" she stammered, struggling to regain her composure.

"Have you lost your damn mind?" he snarled. "Do you even know who you're speaking to?"

Victoria stepped beside me, arms crossed, her icy glare pinning them both in place. The air around her crackled with barely restrained fury, and for a moment, I considered inching away—her presence was overwhelming. But I stood my ground, rooted by sheer disbelief.

Her.

The manager forced a tight smile. "This is Victoria Blackwood," he muttered under his breath.

The woman—Maggie—went pale at the name. She whirled toward Victoria, bowing her head in a hasty, panicked gesture. "Miss Blackwood, I—I didn’t recognize you. My deepest apologies. It’s an honor to meet you," she gushed, her voice trembling.

Victoria didn’t so much as blink.

Ignoring Maggie completely, she turned to the manager.

"Is this how you train your staff, Vincent?" Her voice was lethally soft. "Do you honestly think my father would tolerate this kind of behavior?"

Vincent Moreau swallowed hard, his face draining of color. "Of course not," he said with a nervous laugh. "Maggie hasn’t been well lately—her judgment is impaired. I assure you, this won’t happen again."

Maggie, desperate, blurted, "I wasn’t trying to disrespect you—it was her!" She jabbed a finger at me. "She doesn’t belong in a place like this—"

"This woman," Victoria cut in, her voice sharp as a blade, "happens to be my dearest friend."

Maggie gasped, staggering back as if struck.

"Any insult toward her," Victoria continued, stepping forward, "is an insult to me."

"I—I had no idea—"

"And that excuses it?" Victoria snapped, her voice rising.

I’d never seen her like this—usually so composed, so effortlessly regal. But right now? She was every inch the ruthless heiress, and it was terrifying.

Not that they didn’t deserve it. The way they’d treated me was vile. Still, standing beside her while she burned this place down with her fury left me feeling… strange. Like I didn’t belong in her world, even as she fought to drag me into it.

"N... no, of course not," Maggie stammered, her eyes darting downward as her body trembled uncontrollably.

Victoria turned to the boutique manager, Vincent, her expression icy and unreadable.

"If you don’t handle this situation immediately, I’ll have no choice but to call my father," she said, her voice dripping with calculated menace. "And trust me, you won’t like the consequences if he has to step in."

Vincent swallowed hard, his Adam’s apple bobbing visibly. His face hardened as he turned his glare onto Maggie, his patience clearly at its limit.

"P-please," Maggie begged, her voice breaking. "I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to be disrespectful. I can change—I swear!"

Vincent’s expression didn’t soften. "It’s too late for apologies, Maggie. You’ve crossed a line, and this time, you’ve insulted the wrong people. Consider this a lesson—one you won’t forget. I can’t keep you employed here any longer. Finish their transactions, ensure they receive everything they’ve purchased, and then gather your belongings. You’re done."

Maggie’s breath hitched. "What?!"

Victoria tilted her head, feigning innocence with a saccharine smile. "I believe he just fired you. Don’t make this any more humiliating than it already is."

Maggie’s face twisted in shock, but she knew better than to argue. Any protest would only worsen her situation. Her gaze flickered toward me, and the sheer venom in her eyes sent a chill down my spine. Instinctively, I took a step back.

Then, as if flipping a switch, Victoria turned to me, her features softening instantly. The cold, ruthless heiress was gone, replaced by the warm, familiar girl I knew.

###Chapter 95 The Accusation

The morning sun filtered through the heavy drapes of Sebastian Blackwood's private study, casting golden streaks across the antique mahogany desk where Lillian sat fidgeting. Her fingers traced the intricate carvings on the armrests of the leather chair that smelled faintly of sandalwood and power.

Across from her, Donovan leaned against the bookshelf with practiced nonchalance, but his knuckles whitened around the book he pretended to read. The tension between them was thicker than the ancient Lycan texts lining the walls.

"You're telling me you never felt the mate bond?" Lillian's voice came out sharper than intended, her wolf bristling beneath her skin. The scent of peppermint and betrayal clung to Donovan's tailored suit.

Sebastian entered without knocking, his imposing frame filling the doorway. "We have more pressing matters," he said, tossing a sealed envelope onto the desk. The Blackwood crest shimmered ominously under the lamplight.

Lillian's breath hitched as she recognized Evelyn's looping handwriting on the envelope addressed to Donovan. The paper smelled of jasmine and deceit.

Beatrice burst in moments later, her usually perfect curls disheveled. "You need to see this," she panted, shoving her phone toward Lillian. The screen displayed a gossip blog's headline: "Lycan Heiress Victoria Blackwood's Engagement in Jeopardy?"

Sebastian's growl rattled the crystal decanters on the sidebar. "Marcus," he barked, and his Beta appeared instantly in the doorway. "Handle this. Now."

Lillian's phone buzzed with a notification from Oliver's school. Headmaster Wellington requested an urgent meeting regarding "inappropriate supernatural displays" during recess. Her stomach dropped. The seven-year-old had been struggling to control his shifting since Victoria moved back into the mansion.

Donovan finally spoke, his voice dripping with false concern. "Maybe you're not cut out for this life, Lillian. A college student playing house with a Lycan chairman?" His smirk didn't reach his cold eyes. "The boy needs his real family."

Sebastian moved faster than humanly possible, pinning Donovan against the bookshelf. Ancient tomes clattered to the floor. "Finish that sentence," he challenged, his canines elongating.

The doorbell chimed melodically through the tense silence. Theodore Whitmore's measured footsteps echoed down the hall, followed by an unfamiliar female voice asking for "Mr. Blackwood" in clipped British tones.

Lillian's wolf stirred anxiously. The scent wafting from the foyer was all wrong—bergamot and ambition with an undercurrent of something metallic. Blood? Magic? She couldn't tell.

Beatrice grabbed her arm. "That's Isabella's perfume," she whispered urgently. "My sister never visits unannounced."

The pieces clicked together with terrible clarity. Lillian met Sebastian's gaze across the room as the same realization dawned on him. This wasn't a social call. The Fontaine models only made house visits for one reason—to deliver messages too sensitive for phones or emails.

And judging by Donovan's suddenly pale complexion, he knew exactly what message was coming.

"Are you alright?" Victoria asked, her voice laced with concern.

I blinked rapidly, disoriented by the abrupt shift in atmosphere.

"I think so," I murmured, though my fingers tightened around the shopping bags. "But can we leave now?"

Her lips pursed into a frown. "Not until we've shopped until we drop," she declared, looping her arm through mine. "Let's give them something to really keep up with."

Every fiber of my being screamed to escape this place, but I swallowed my protests. An hour later, we emerged with arms laden with designer bags. Mercifully, Frederick still waited by the curb, and we offloaded our purchases into the car before diving back into the boutiques. By the time we finished, exhaustion gnawed at my bones and my stomach growled loudly.

"Could you two perhaps take a walk for an hour while we dine?" Victoria addressed her guards with a honeyed tone.

The men exchanged wary glances.

"Our orders are to remain with you—" one began.

"I'm well aware of the orders," she cut in sharply, then softened her voice. "But surely dinner doesn't require an armed escort? Just... give us some breathing room."

The second guard scratched his jaw. "Where exactly are we supposed to go?"

"Stay here with Frederick," Victoria suggested with a dismissive wave. "That way you'll be close if anything happens."

After a tense silence, they relented with stiff nods.

"One hint of trouble and we're extracting you immediately," the taller guard warned, crossing his muscular arms.

Victoria rewarded them with a dazzling smile before striding toward an intimate bistro, gesturing for me to follow. The hostess—a willowy blonde who clearly recognized Victoria—greeted her by name with obsequious enthusiasm, barely acknowledging my presence.

We settled at a corner table where Victoria ordered two glasses of crisp Sauvignon Blanc and sparkling lemon water. As we perused the menu, the weight of unspoken words hung between us. I finally selected a truffle-infused BLT with artisanal slaw while Victoria chose a Mediterranean salad with grilled octopus.

The silence stretched as we sipped our wine, the clink of cutlery against porcelain echoing in the quiet space. Victoria's fingers drummed an erratic rhythm against the tablecloth, her gaze darting toward the entrance twice before I cleared my throat.

"You mentioned wanting to talk," I prompted gently.

She worried her lower lip between her teeth before leaning in. "It's about Donovan," she whispered, casting a furtive glance around the restaurant.

My chest constricted—I'd known this conversation was inevitable, yet the mention of his name still sent ice through my veins. The unspoken words hovered between us like storm clouds, heavy with implications I wasn't ready to face.

I leaned back against the plush leather seat, my fingers tightening around the armrest as I studied Victoria's nervous expression. The air between us grew thick with tension, making each breath feel heavier than the last.

"Go on," I urged cautiously, my voice barely above a whisper.

She twisted her hands in her lap, her perfectly manicured nails digging into her palms. "I don't know how to phrase this properly, and I'm mortified to even ask..." Her words tumbled out in a rushed whisper. "But is there... something happening between you and Donovan?"

My eyebrows shot up so fast they nearly disappeared into my hairline. "Excuse me?" The words slipped out before I could stop them.

Her cheeks flushed crimson as she blurted, "Are you two... intimate?"

The question hit me like a physical blow. My entire body jerked as if electrocuted, and only sheer willpower kept me from leaping to my feet. Instead, I sat frozen, my mouth slightly agape as I struggled to process her accusation. What possible reason could she have for thinking that? Had we been careless with our interactions?

When my silence stretched too long, Victoria flinched. "Please understand, I have to know - are you sleeping with my fiancé, Lillian?"

"Absolutely not!" The denial tore from my throat in a harsh whisper. "What would make you even consider such a thing?" My fingers curled into fists against my thighs.

She worried her lower lip between her teeth, leaving faint indentations in the glossy pink surface. "Because there's this... tension between you two," she admitted quietly. "You get all stiff whenever he's near, and Donovan... Donovan can't stop watching you when you're in the room."

Heat flooded my cheeks at her observation. I hadn't realized we'd been so obvious.

"I swear to you, nothing inappropriate has happened," I said firmly, leaning forward to emphasize my words. "I barely know the man. We met through mutual acquaintances before your introduction, but that's all. I would never cross that line with someone who's committed to another person."

The words tasted bitter on my tongue, but they needed to be said. Victoria studied my face with an intensity that made my pulse race, searching for any hint of deception. I held her gaze steadily, praying my expression revealed only sincerity.

###Chapter 96 He’s gathering allies

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s sprawling estate. Below, the gardens stretched in meticulous perfection, a stark contrast to the storm brewing inside her.

She tightened her grip on the railing, her knuckles turning white. Last night’s confrontation with Donovan still burned in her mind—his cold dismissal, Evelyn’s smug smirk, the way he had so easily discarded their past.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

“Lillian?” Beatrice’s voice was tentative as she peeked through the half-open door. “You’ve been out here for hours. Are you okay?”

Lillian forced a smile. “Just needed some air.”

Beatrice hesitated before stepping closer. “I heard what happened. That bastard doesn’t deserve you.”

Lillian exhaled sharply. “It’s not about deserving. It’s about choices. And he made his.”

The door creaked again, and this time, Sebastian himself appeared, his towering frame casting a shadow across the balcony. His silver eyes flickered with something unreadable.

“We need to talk,” he said, his voice low and commanding.

Beatrice shot Lillian a sympathetic glance before slipping away, leaving them alone.

Sebastian didn’t waste time. “Donovan’s been spotted near the northern border. He’s not just here for you—he’s making moves against the pack.”

Lillian’s pulse spiked. “What?”

“He’s gathering allies. And if he succeeds, this won’t end well for any of us.”

She swallowed hard. “What do you want me to do?”

Sebastian’s gaze bore into hers. “I need you to be ready. Because when the time comes, you’ll have to face him—not as his ex-mate, but as my Luna.”

The weight of his words settled over her like a cloak. This wasn’t just about heartbreak anymore. It was war.

And Lillian would be damned if she let Donovan walk away unscathed.

Victoria lifted her gaze to meet mine, studying me intently for what felt like an eternity. Her piercing blue eyes searched for any hint of deception, as if she could unravel the truth just by staring long enough.

"Really?" she finally breathed, her voice laced with cautious hope.

"Absolutely," I reassured her, offering a small smile. "And let’s be honest—your father would have my head if I stepped out of line."

A smirk tugged at her lips before she shrugged, the tension in her shoulders easing slightly. "He is ridiculously overprotective," she admitted with a sigh. "But I just don’t understand Donovan lately. He’s so… distant. Unreadable."

"From what I remember, he’s always been like that," I said carefully. "Don’t take it personally, Victoria. He loves you. He chose you."

Something in my words must have struck a chord because her expression softened, a genuine smile finally breaking through. She nodded, some of the weight visibly lifting from her.

The waitress arrived with our meals, and we fell into easy conversation as we ate. But despite the lighthearted chatter, guilt gnawed at me. Lying to her about my past with Donovan—about the fact that he didn’t truly love her—left a bitter taste in my mouth. He was using her, and when she found out, it would shatter her.

As dinner ended, Victoria suddenly grabbed my arm before I could push through the front door.

"Let’s go out the back," she whispered, mischief dancing in her eyes.

I raised an eyebrow. "Why?"

"Because the guards are out front, and I want just a little more freedom before they herd me back into my gilded cage," she said, peeking toward the entrance. "Come on, let’s take a walk."

I didn’t argue. We slipped out the back door, weaving through a grimy alley until we emerged onto the street. In the distance, Frederick’s car and the guards’ vehicle were still parked near the restaurant’s front entrance. Victoria spotted them too, and with a shared grin, we bolted in the opposite direction.

Laughter bubbled up as we ran, the thrill of rebellion making me feel like a teenager sneaking out past curfew. Victoria was giggling too, both of us breathless and clutching our sides as we rounded a corner. I leaned against the brick wall of a nearby building, certain we’d put enough distance between us and the guards to catch our breath.

"We can’t avoid them forever," I chuckled.

"I know," she sighed, still grinning. "But it was fun while it lasted."

I looped my arm through hers. "I get it. Maybe we can do this again sometime?"

Her face lit up like I’d just handed her the moon. "Really?"

I had to admit—I liked spending time with her. She was warm, uncomplicated, effortlessly lovable. No wonder Donovan wanted her and not me. It wasn’t just her status—it was her. And she deserved so much better than him.

I hated lying to her. Every word of reassurance felt like another betrayal. Gavin was wrong to keep the truth from her.

"Come on," she said, tugging me forward. "Let’s head back before they send out a search party."

I followed, but with each step, my resolve wavered. I needed to tell her the truth—Gavin’s warnings be damned.

Just as I opened my mouth to speak, a white van screeched to a halt beside us. The doors flew open, and masked men poured out, surrounding us in seconds.

Their sickly-sweet cologne mixed with something metallic—wolfsbane? My muscles tensed, falling into a defensive stance, but the odds were impossible. One against so many.

Victoria’s face paled. She opened her mouth to scream—

Then collapsed as a syringe plunged into her neck.

"Victoria!" I lunged for her, but a sharp sting pierced my own skin. Strong arms caught me as the world blurred, then faded to black.

###Chapter 97 Lillian's POV

The morning sun filtered through the curtains of Lillian's bedroom, casting golden patterns across the silk sheets. She stretched languidly, her werewolf senses immediately picking up the faint scent of lavender and leather that always lingered around Sebastian Blackwood.

Downstairs, the mansion buzzed with unusual activity. Lillian could hear Beatrice's excited chatter mingling with Oliver's laughter, while the clinking of silverware suggested Giselle Beaumont was overseeing breakfast preparations with military precision.

As Lillian descended the grand staircase, she nearly collided with Marcus Grayson, who was carrying an armful of files. "Careful there," the Beta chuckled, steadying her with one hand. "The Chairman's been waiting for you in his study."

Her pulse quickened at the mention of Sebastian. Ever since that night at the gala when he'd publicly claimed her as his mate, their relationship had shifted into something deeper, more intense.

The study door stood slightly ajar. Lillian knocked softly before entering. Sebastian stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, his broad shoulders silhouetted against the morning light. He turned, his golden eyes darkening when they landed on her.

"Sleep well?" His voice was rough, sending shivers down her spine.

Before she could answer, Theodore Whitmore entered with a silver tray bearing two steaming cups. "Your coffee, sir. And for Miss Lillian, chamomile tea with honey—just as you prefer."

Lillian accepted the cup, her fingers brushing against Sebastian's as he took his own. The brief contact sent sparks through her system, making her wolf stir restlessly.

"We have a situation," Sebastian said abruptly, setting down his untouched coffee. "Victoria's engagement party is tonight."

Lillian nearly dropped her cup. "So soon? I thought Donovan was still—"

"Exactly." Sebastian's jaw tightened. "Which is why we're attending. I need you close to me all evening. No wandering off, no distractions."

A knock interrupted them. Beatrice burst in without waiting for permission, her cheeks flushed. "You'll never guess who just arrived!" she exclaimed. "Isabella Fontaine! And she brought that French journalist—what's his name—Nathaniel Whitlock!"

Sebastian's expression darkened further. "Perfect timing," he muttered. "Just what we needed."

Lillian's phone buzzed with a text from Oliver: Dad's being extra grumpy today. Did you forget to kiss him good morning? She stifled a laugh, but when she looked up, Sebastian was watching her with an intensity that stole her breath.

"Tonight changes everything," he said quietly, for her ears only. "Whatever happens, remember—you're mine."

The possessive growl in his voice should have alarmed her. Instead, it ignited something primal within her. As Beatrice dragged her away to help choose a dress for the party, Lillian couldn't shake the feeling that this night would alter their lives forever.

The murmurs nearby pulled me from unconsciousness. My head throbbed like I'd downed an entire bottle of whiskey, but I barely had a sip of wine at dinner—certainly not enough to leave me like this. My last memory was hazy, fractured. I didn’t even remember closing my eyes.

My fingers twitched as awareness crept in. Cold concrete pressed against my skin, sending sharp aches through my body. Worse—the biting sting of silver chains around my wrists. The metal burned, a werewolf’s curse. Even before opening my eyes, I knew I was cut off—no wolf, no mindlink, no way to call for help.

I was trapped.

A fragmented memory surfaced—running, laughter, Victoria beside me. Was she here too? Had she betrayed me? Maybe she never believed me when I swore nothing happened between Donovan and me. Maybe this was her plan all along—lure me away, let the rogues take me, and finish what she started.

Then another flash—Victoria collapsing, a man driving a syringe into her neck. She dropped like a stone. My pulse spiked, breath hitching. I forced myself to steady it. If they thought I was still out, I had an advantage.

Whispers slithered through the darkness. I strained to listen, but without my wolf, the voices were muffled. As footsteps neared, the words sharpened.

"We were only paid for one girl." A rough voice, edged with irritation.

"Then we’ll demand double." A darker chuckle followed. "Who the hell are these people anyway?"

"Don’t know, don’t care. Money talks." A third voice, gruff. "Let’s eat. They’ll be out for hours with that much wolfsbane in them."

Their footsteps faded, a door creaking open, then slamming shut. A lock clicked.

Three voices. But I remembered more—shadows moving in the alley before everything went black.

I cracked my eyes open. Darkness. A cellar, damp and reeking of mildew. My head pounded as I lifted it, taking in the rusted bars surrounding me—a cage. Fury coiled in my chest.

Without my wolf’s night vision, the room was a blur of shapes. But one thing was clear—I wasn’t alone.

My stomach twisted into knots as I took in Victoria's unconscious form beside me. A deep gash marred her forehead from the fall, her usually vibrant complexion now ghostly pale.

"Victoria..." My voice cracked as I dragged myself toward her.

The silver cuffs seared into my wrists, making me hiss in pain. When my trembling fingers touched her icy cheek, panic clawed at my throat. I pressed two fingers to her neck—there. A weak but steady pulse. The breath I'd been holding rushed out in relief.

Gently, I pushed her blood-matted hair away from her face.

"Wake up," I murmured, my lips barely moving. "We need to get out of here."

But how? That was the real question. One thing was certain—our captors thought I was still unconscious. They wouldn't make their move until we were both awake, which meant I had to play dead when they returned.

Leaning against the damp concrete wall, I inhaled sharply, coughing at the musty air thick with dust. I didn't understand how I'd shaken off the wolfsbane's effects so fast, but Victoria would likely be out for hours. Slowly, I pulled her closer until her head rested in my lap. My fingers combed through her tangled hair as I hummed an old lullaby under my breath. She shouldn't wake up alone in this nightmare.

Time lost meaning in the windowless cell. Could've been minutes. Could've been days. My eyelids grew heavy, my chin dipping toward my chest, when the sharp click of dress shoes echoed down the hallway.

In one fluid motion, I eased Victoria back onto the cold floor, arranging her as I'd found her before flopping beside her and going limp. My breathing slowed to a shallow rhythm just as the heavy door creaked open.

###Chapter 98 Third Person POV

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood's estate. The sun had barely risen, casting golden streaks across the sprawling grounds below. She tightened the silk robe around her, the fabric whispering against her skin.

Inside, the mansion buzzed with quiet activity. Giselle Beaumont, the head maid, directed a team of servants preparing breakfast, while Lucien Dubois, the flirtatious head chef, hummed a French tune as he arranged delicate pastries on silver trays.

Lillian's thoughts drifted to Donovan—her ex-fated mate—and the bitter sting of betrayal still fresh in her mind. She had trusted him, loved him, only for him to discard her like yesterday’s news for Evelyn. The memory twisted her stomach, but she refused to let it break her.

A soft knock interrupted her reverie.

"Lillian?" Beatrice’s voice was muffled through the door. "Are you awake? Sebastian wants to see you before breakfast."

Lillian sighed, running a hand through her tousled hair. "I’ll be right there."

Downstairs, Sebastian sat at the head of the dining table, his sharp blue eyes scanning documents. Oliver, his seven-year-old son, was already digging into a stack of pancakes, syrup dripping down his chin.

"You wanted to see me?" Lillian asked, lingering in the doorway.

Sebastian glanced up, his expression unreadable. "We have a situation."

Her pulse quickened. "What kind of situation?"

"Victoria," he said, his voice low. "She’s missing."

Lillian’s breath hitched. Victoria—Sebastian’s daughter and Donovan’s fiancée—had vanished overnight.

"Are you sure she didn’t just—"

"She left no note, no message," Sebastian interrupted. "And Julian Mercer, her assigned guard, was found unconscious in the gardens."

A cold dread settled over Lillian. This wasn’t a coincidence.

Beatrice stepped forward, her face pale. "You don’t think… Donovan had something to do with this?"

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "I intend to find out."

Lillian swallowed hard. If Donovan was involved, this wasn’t just about Victoria. It was personal.

And she would make sure he regretted it.

"Are they still out there?" One of the rogues whispered, peering into the dimly lit cage.

"Seems like it," his companion grumbled, rubbing his tired eyes. "It's getting late. Maybe we should just finish this tomorrow."

"The boss was clear—he wants it done tonight," the first rogue argued, though his voice lacked conviction.

"Yeah, but he also said she needs to be awake. He wants her to know why she’s dying. Wants it recorded as proof," the second reminded him, shifting uncomfortably.

"And the other one?"

"Consider it a bonus," the rogue chuckled darkly. "Let’s get some rest and come back at dawn."

Their footsteps faded as they left, the heavy door creaking shut behind them. Only then did I dare open my eyes, releasing a shaky breath I hadn’t realized I was holding.

I glanced down at Victoria, still unconscious beside me. Her breathing was slow, her face pale. I counted the seconds, waiting for any sign of her waking. When her fingers twitched against my side, relief washed over me. Finally. I wouldn’t have to face this nightmare alone.

Gently, I shifted her head onto my lap as she stirred. It took agonizing minutes—soft groans, fluttering lashes, the slow return of awareness. She probably felt like she’d been hit by a truck.

Then, her eyes opened.

"Lillian?" Her voice was barely a whisper, rough with confusion. "W-what… what happened?"

"Don’t panic," I murmured, but the tremor in my voice betrayed me.

She lifted her head—then gasped, jerking back as the silver cuffs seared her skin. Her wide, terrified eyes locked onto mine.

"W-why—?" she stammered, her breath coming too fast.

"I told you not to freak out," I said, trying to sound calm.

But it was too late. She took in the rusted bars, the damp concrete floor, the suffocating darkness beyond. Tears welled in her eyes.

"What’s happening?" she choked out.

"We’ll figure it out," I promised, though I had no idea how. "We’ll get out of here."

Her whole body trembled as she sat up, wiping furiously at her tears. "H-how? Why would anyone—?"

"I don’t know," I admitted, hugging my knees to my chest. "But they’re waiting until morning."

Her breath hitched. "For what?"

I swallowed hard. "I think… they want to kill us."

Donovan had instructed his subordinate to arrange for thugs to abduct Lillian and hold her captive—just enough to instill some fear in her. His grand scheme was to swoop in as the hero, rescuing her in the nick of time. Overwhelmed with gratitude, she would surely agree to become his mistress, granting him everything he desired.

But what Donovan didn’t know was that his subordinate had other plans.

He had always despised Lillian—the perfect little princess at school, the one who outshone him in every exam and humiliated him during combat training. Instead, he had formed an unlikely alliance with Cassandra, bonding over their mutual loathing for Lillian. Both wanted her gone, and now, he had the perfect opportunity to make it happen.

Donovan believed Lillian was safe—just a pawn in his game—but his subordinate had secretly hired rogues to eliminate her and stage it as an accident. He even demanded video proof, knowing Cassandra would relish watching the footage. It was the perfect crime—no blood on his hands, and all blame would fall on the rogues.

Unaware of the betrayal, Donovan assumed his packmates were handling the job. By the time he realized rogues had taken Lillian and rushed to "rescue" her the next evening, it would be too late. She’d already be dead, and the rogues would take the fall.

Meanwhile, Sebastian Blackwood waited impatiently for his daughter’s return. But when his guards and Frederick Hastings came back without Victoria, his blood ran cold.

"Where is my daughter?" Sebastian demanded, rising to his full height, his glare sharp enough to cut steel. The men exchanged uneasy glances.

"We thought she took an Uber or something," Frederick stammered. "She insisted the guards stay outside the restaurant while she and Miss Lillian dined. They never came out."

"What?!" Sebastian’s roar shook the walls, his fury palpable.

"After a while, we checked inside," one guard admitted, voice trembling. "The hostess said they left through the back door. We assumed they were trying to ditch us and took a ride home."

Frederick frowned. "She hasn’t returned?"

Sebastian saw nothing but red.

A deafening growl erupted from his chest, vibrating through the villa, echoing for miles.

"WHERE THE HELL IS MY DAUGHTER?!"
###Chapter 99 Lillian's POV

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the cobblestone path leading to Blackwood Manor. Her heart pounded against her ribs, a mixture of anticipation and unease coiling in her stomach. Today was the day she would finally confront Donovan—the man who had once been her fated mate, the man who had betrayed her in the cruelest way possible.

Sebastian Blackwood stood by the grand oak doors, his piercing silver eyes watching her approach. The Lycan chairman’s presence was as commanding as ever, his broad shoulders accentuated by the tailored black suit he wore. Beside him, little Oliver clung to his father’s leg, his curious gaze darting between Lillian and the imposing figure of Marcus Grayson, Sebastian’s ever-loyal beta.

"You don’t have to do this," Sebastian murmured, his deep voice laced with concern.

Lillian lifted her chin. "Yes, I do."

The doors swung open, revealing the opulent foyer of Blackwood Manor. The scent of polished mahogany and fresh roses filled the air, but Lillian barely noticed. Her attention was immediately drawn to the figure standing near the fireplace—Donovan, his golden hair catching the flickering firelight. Beside him, Evelyn smirked, her fingers entwined possessively with his.

"Lillian," Donovan greeted, his voice smooth but devoid of warmth. "I didn’t expect you to come."

Her fingers curled into fists. "You didn’t think I’d let you get away with what you did, did you?"

Evelyn scoffed. "Oh, please. You’re just bitter because he chose me."

Sebastian stepped forward, his presence radiating dominance. "Enough. This ends today."

A tense silence settled over the room. Then, from the shadows, Victoria emerged—Sebastian’s daughter, her engagement ring glinting ominously on her finger. "Father," she said coolly, "you’re making a mistake."

Lillian’s breath hitched. Victoria had always been a wildcard, but siding with Donovan? That was unexpected.

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "Victoria, step aside."

She didn’t move. Instead, she smirked. "Or what?"

The air crackled with tension. Then, Beatrice burst into the room, her cheeks flushed. "Lillian! You need to see this!"

She thrust a crumpled letter into Lillian’s hands. The moment her eyes scanned the contents, her blood ran cold.

"If you want the truth about your mother’s disappearance, meet me at midnight. Alone."

The signature at the bottom sent a shiver down her spine.

—Archibald Winslow.

Lillian’s gaze snapped to Donovan, but his expression was unreadable. Had he known about this?

Sebastian’s voice cut through her thoughts. "Lillian, what is it?"

She swallowed hard. "I think I just found my mother’s killer."

And with that, the game had changed.

"Kill us?? W-why would they want to kill us?" Victoria's voice trembled, her wide eyes reflecting sheer terror. "What did we even do?"

"Victoria, listen to me," I murmured, shifting closer while carefully avoiding the sharp sting of the silver cuffs around my wrists. "You need to stay calm. If they realize we're awake, they might come back sooner—and we can't let that happen. Right now, surprise is our only advantage."

The damp, musty air of the basement clung to my skin as I strained to listen. Footsteps creaked on the floorboards above us, and I held my breath, praying they wouldn't descend.

"So we just... pretend to be unconscious?" Victoria whispered, tears glistening in her lashes.

"Until we figure out a way out, yes," I replied firmly.

She hugged herself tightly but gasped when the cuffs seared her skin. A choked sob escaped her as tears traced down her ashen cheeks.

"My father will find us," she whispered, more to herself than to me. "He's the strongest Lycan in the world. He has to."

I wanted to believe her. But the gnawing dread in my gut refused to fade. I couldn't admit to Victoria that I was just as terrified. My entire life had been spent training as a Gamma warrior—yet now, faced with real danger, my instincts felt useless.

The basement had no windows, trapping us in suffocating darkness. My gaze flicked upward, spotting a ventilation grate on the ceiling. A fleeting thought crossed my mind—could we escape through it? But with these cuffs, the idea was nearly impossible.

Victoria curled into herself, burying her face against her knees as she took a shuddering breath. "We will get out of here," she repeated under her breath, like a desperate mantra. "We have to."

Third Person POV

Donovan smirked as his phone lit up with a message from his subordinate. Everything is set.

Perfect.

Lillian had been taken by a few harmless pack members—nothing more than pawns in his game. They'd bound her with silver and wolfsbane, keeping her weak but unharmed. Not that she knew that. No, she believed she was in mortal danger, and that was exactly what he wanted.

He planned to let her stew in fear for a full day before swooping in as her savior. By then, she'd be so desperate, so grateful, that she'd do anything he asked—even become his mistress.

The thought sent a rush of heat straight through him, his body reacting instantly. His mind conjured images of Lillian in that expensive lingerie he'd bought just for her, and his grip tightened around his phone.

He scrolled to Victoria's contact, his lips curling into a dark smile.

Soon.

Donovan's fingers hovered over Victoria's contact. He needed an escape, and confronting his fiancée seemed like the perfect solution.

When the call went unanswered, his jaw tightened. He tried again.

Still nothing.

What the hell? She never ignored his calls.

Frustration simmering, he switched to texting.

Donovan: Where are you?

Minutes ticked by with no reply. His grip on the phone turned white-knuckled before he exhaled sharply and stood. Fine. If Victoria was going to play games, he’d drag her out of hiding himself.

Ignoring him? Unacceptable.

Storming out of his penthouse, he slid into his sleek black sports car and peeled toward the Blackwood Estate. One hand on the wheel, he fished out his phone again. Might as well check on the other loose end while he drove.

His men had assured him Lillian was secured, but he wanted confirmation straight from the source. He tapped the contact labeled Cleanup Crew and held the phone to his ear.

The engine roared as he merged onto the highway, the city lights blurring past. Victoria’s silence gnawed at him. Was she with him? That thought alone made his foot press harder on the accelerator.

He’d get answers tonight—one way or another.
###Chapter 100 What do you need?

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the cobblestone path leading to the Blackwood estate. Her heart pounded with a mixture of anticipation and dread. Today was the day she would finally confront Donovan—the man who had once been her fated mate, the man who had betrayed her in the cruelest way possible.

She tightened her grip on the strap of her bag, her knuckles turning white. The memory of Donovan’s smug face as he paraded Evelyn around campus still burned in her mind. But she wasn’t the same weak, naive girl anymore. The past few months under Sebastian Blackwood’s guidance had hardened her, sharpened her instincts. She was no longer prey.

The grand gates of the estate loomed ahead, guarded by two imposing warriors. They nodded at her in recognition, stepping aside to let her pass. Lillian exhaled sharply, steeling herself. Inside, the mansion was alive with activity—maids bustling about, the distant clatter of dishes from the kitchen, the low murmur of voices.

She found Sebastian in his study, his broad frame silhouetted against the floor-to-ceiling windows. He turned as she entered, his piercing gaze locking onto hers. "You’re late," he remarked, though there was no real reprimand in his tone.

Lillian lifted her chin. "I had something to take care of."

A smirk tugged at the corner of his lips. "Let me guess. Donovan?"

She didn’t answer, but the fire in her eyes was confirmation enough.

Sebastian crossed the room in long strides, stopping just inches from her. His presence was overwhelming, a force of nature that demanded attention. "You’re not going alone," he stated, his voice leaving no room for argument.

Lillian bristled. "I don’t need a babysitter."

"This isn’t about needing one," he countered smoothly. "It’s about sending a message. If Donovan thinks he can toy with what’s mine, he’s sorely mistaken."

The possessive edge in his words sent a shiver down her spine. She opened her mouth to protest, but the determined set of his jaw told her it was futile.

"Fine," she relented. "But I do the talking."

Sebastian’s smirk deepened. "We’ll see."

As they stepped out into the fading sunlight, Lillian couldn’t shake the feeling that this confrontation would change everything. The game was far from over—and this time, she wasn’t playing by Donovan’s rules.

"Boss," one of the men spoke hesitantly into the phone. "What do you need?"

"Send me a picture of Lillian," Donovan demanded, his voice sharp with impatience.

"Lillian?" The man hesitated. "Lillian Dumont?"

Donovan's jaw clenched. "Yes, the one you were supposed to take earlier. I want proof she's unharmed. Not a single scratch on her."

A heavy silence stretched between them before the man cleared his throat.

"Sir... we don’t have her."

"What the hell do you mean you don’t have her?" Donovan snarled, his grip tightening on the phone. "You were supposed to grab her in the city!"

"We got a text with a location to meet her," the man explained quickly. "But she never showed. We waited, then left. Thought you’d called it off."

"You’re telling me Lillian isn’t with you?" Donovan’s chest tightened, panic clawing up his throat.

"Never saw her," the man confirmed.

The phone nearly cracked under Donovan’s grip. He swerved the car to the side of the road, slamming it into park.

"Send me the damn location where you were supposed to meet her," he ordered, forcing his breaths to steady.

"Yes, sir."

The call ended, and Donovan waited, pulse hammering, until the coordinates flashed on his screen. His stomach dropped—he knew that place.

Tires screeched as he sped toward the location, dread coiling inside him. If his own men didn’t have Lillian, then who did? Where was she? And why the hell wasn’t Victoria answering her phone?

He arrived in minutes, throwing the car door open before the engine fully died. The faint trace of Lillian’s scent lingered, but it was stale—she hadn’t been here for hours. His gaze snapped to the security cameras mounted outside nearby businesses.

Just as he moved toward one of the buildings, the door swung open. Donovan barely had time to duck behind the wall before Sebastian Blackwood and several of his men stepped out, the shop owner trailing behind them.

"Beta Grayson," Sebastian’s voice carried, sharp with command. "Run this license plate. We pulled footage from the security cameras—kidnappers, likely rogues. I want them found."

Kidnapping? Were they talking about Lillian?

Why the hell was Sebastian looking for her?

Donovan’s blood ran cold.

Donovan's stomach twisted into knots at the mere thought. Lillian was his to rescue, and he'd be damned if he let anyone—especially not Sebastian Blackwood—steal the glory of saving her.

He relayed the license plate to Marcus Grayson, but something nagged at Donovan. That number... it rang a bell. He snatched his phone, fingers flying through his notes. Where had he seen it before?

Then it hit him.

Years ago, he'd singlehandedly dismantled a string of break-ins. He'd scribbled down the plates of the rogues involved, tracking a few to a derelict house deep in rogue territory. Most had slipped away, but he remembered that crumbling house, the rusted car parked out front. A low growl rumbled in his chest. Those bastards had dared to return—and now they'd taken what was his.

Not for long.

The good news? He already knew their hideout. The bad? Getting there wouldn’t be easy. These rogues weren’t just hiding—they’d want his blood.

Sebastian looked ready to bolt, but Donovan had to reach her first. Even in wolf form, it’d take hours to cross into rogue territory. Every second counted.

Shifting, Donovan bared his teeth in a silent snarl. Hold on, Lillian. His claws dug into the earth as he launched forward. I’m coming.

###Chapter 101

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains, rousing Lillian from her restless sleep. She blinked against the light, her mind still foggy from the events of last night—Donovan’s betrayal, the humiliation in front of the entire pack, and the way Sebastian Blackwood had stepped in like a storm, shielding her with his authority.

She sat up, rubbing her temples. The scent of lavender and cedar still clung to her skin—Sebastian’s scent. It was everywhere, as if he had marked her in some intangible way.

A soft knock sounded at the door.

"Lillian?" Beatrice’s voice was hesitant. "Are you awake?"

Lillian sighed. "Come in."

Beatrice slipped inside, her dark curls bouncing as she shut the door behind her. "You look like hell."

"Thanks," Lillian muttered, dragging a hand through her tangled hair.

Beatrice plopped onto the bed beside her. "So. What’s the plan?"

Lillian frowned. "Plan?"

"You can’t just hide in here forever. Donovan’s parading around with Evelyn like he didn’t just publicly reject you. And Sebastian—"

"Sebastian what?" Lillian’s pulse spiked.

Beatrice smirked. "Oh, nothing. Just that the whole pack saw how he looked at you. Like you were the only person in the room."

Lillian’s cheeks burned. "He was just being polite."

"Polite?" Beatrice snorted. "Since when is the Lycan Chairman polite?"

Before Lillian could argue, her phone buzzed. A message from an unknown number lit up the screen:

"Meet me in the gardens. We need to talk. —S.B."

Beatrice peeked over her shoulder and let out a low whistle. "Well, well. Looks like someone’s got a date."

Lillian shoved her away. "It’s not a date."

But her heart hammered against her ribs as she typed out a reply.

"Fine. Give me ten minutes."

She had no idea what Sebastian wanted. But one thing was certain—nothing about this man was simple. And if last night had taught her anything, it was that her life was about to get a lot more complicated.

The gardens were lush, vibrant with early summer blooms. Lillian hesitated at the entrance, scanning the winding paths until she spotted him.

Sebastian stood beneath an ancient oak, his broad shoulders outlined by the dappled sunlight. He turned as she approached, his golden eyes locking onto hers with an intensity that made her breath catch.

"You came," he said, his voice low.

Lillian crossed her arms. "You said we needed to talk."

A faint smirk tugged at his lips. "So defensive."

She lifted her chin. "What do you want, Sebastian?"

His expression darkened. "I want to know why Donovan rejected you."

The question hit like a slap. Lillian stiffened. "That’s none of your business."

Sebastian stepped closer, his presence overwhelming. "It is now."

She swallowed hard. "Why?"

"Because," he murmured, his gaze dropping to her lips, "I don’t believe in wasted potential. And you, Lillian, are far too interesting to let slip away."

Her pulse roared in her ears.

This wasn’t just a conversation.

It was a challenge.

And she had no idea if she was ready for what came next.

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian hurried across the bustling campus. Her backpack weighed heavily on her shoulders, filled with textbooks and the weight of her recent heartbreak. Donovan had rejected her—publicly, cruelly—leaving her to face the whispers alone.

She ducked into the coffee shop, seeking refuge. The rich aroma of espresso wrapped around her like a comforting embrace.

"Hey, Lillian!" Gabrielle Rousseau, the barista, flashed her a warm smile. "The usual?"

Lillian nodded, forcing a small smile. "Thanks, Gabrielle."

As she waited, her phone buzzed. A message from Beatrice: "You okay? I heard what happened."

Lillian exhaled sharply. Of course, the whole school knew. Donovan and Evelyn had made sure of that.

Before she could reply, the café door swung open, and a hush fell over the room.

Sebastian Blackwood strode in.

Tall, commanding, with piercing amber eyes that seemed to see right through her. The Lycan chairman rarely visited campus, and his presence sent a ripple of tension through the room.

Lillian froze, her pulse quickening.

He stopped in front of her.

"Lillian," he said, his voice deep and smooth. "We need to talk."

Her breath hitched. What could he possibly want with her?

Around them, whispers erupted.

"Isn’t that the girl Donovan dumped?"

"Why is Chairman Blackwood here?"

Sebastian ignored them, his gaze never leaving hers. "Now."

Lillian swallowed hard.

This wasn’t just a conversation.

This was the beginning of something far bigger than she could imagine.

The night dragged on endlessly, each second stretching into an eternity. Despite my desperate attempts, I couldn’t devise any viable escape plan. Not that I truly believed we could break free, but I had hoped to at least find some weakness in the cage—some flaw to exploit before dawn arrived. Without windows, time became a nebulous concept, impossible to track.

Victoria slumped against me, exhausted from hours of silent sobbing, and eventually drifted into an uneasy sleep. But sleep eluded me entirely. I remained wide awake, every nerve on high alert. When the creaking of footsteps echoed from the floorboards above, I gently nudged Victoria onto the cold ground, lying beside her, feigning unconsciousness. Maybe, just maybe, they’d leave us alone if they thought we were still out.

Whoever had orchestrated this wanted us terrified. They wanted our fear captured on film, our reactions documented. Well, I refused to give them the satisfaction. I squeezed my eyes shut, forcing my racing heart to slow. If I was going to pull this off, I needed to stay calm.

The footsteps grew louder, the basement door groaning open. The stench of rogue wolves flooded the air, thick and suffocating, making my stomach churn. Muffled voices drifted closer as they descended the stairs, their heavy boots thudding against the concrete.

"Still out cold?" one of them grunted. "How much sedative did you pump into them?"

"Enough to keep them down for hours. They should’ve woken up by now."

"You think they’re faking?" a third voice chimed in.

"Go check."

My entire body tensed at the command. They were coming inside the cage. If Victoria stirred, if she realized they were near us—what would they do to her?

The metallic clang of the cage door unlocking sent a jolt of dread through me. Heavy footsteps approached, and then icy fingers pressed against the back of my neck, searching for a pulse.

"She’s alive," the rogue muttered, his breath hot against my ear. I suppressed a shudder, my skin crawling at his proximity.

His fingers trailed down my neck, skimming over my exposed shoulder. The touch burned, revolting in its intimacy.

"Damn, she’s pretty," he rasped, his voice thick with barely restrained hunger. "Might as well have some fun before we finish the job."

"Take turns," another suggested from somewhere behind him.

I fought the urge to snap my eyes open, to see how many of them surrounded us. But I couldn’t risk it—not yet.

The rogue touching me chuckled darkly before pulling away.

"Check the other one," someone ordered.

I listened, barely breathing, as his footsteps moved toward Victoria. Every second stretched into agony. What would they do to her?

And what would I do if they tried?
The metallic scent of blood filled the air as I kept my breathing shallow, feigning unconsciousness. I needed them to think I was still out cold—just long enough to examine Victoria and leave us be. At least until I could devise an escape plan. Sebastian had to know something was wrong by now. We'd been missing all night, and surely he'd be searching for his daughter.

I doubted he'd spare a thought for me, but Victoria was his flesh and blood. He wouldn't abandon her.

"Damn, this one's a real beauty," the rogue murmured, his voice dripping with hunger. "We hit the jackpot with these two." My fingers twitched, the silver cuffs searing into my skin with every movement. If not for these cursed restraints, I could've taken him down in seconds.

Then—my stomach lurched—Victoria stirred.

"Oi, the little dove's waking up!" the rogue crowed to his companions.

"W-where am I?" Victoria's voice trembled.

My pulse spiked.

"Oh, she's definitely awake," he purred, excitement darkening his tone. "This just got interesting."

"No! Get off me!" Victoria shrieked, scrambling backward.

I couldn't keep up the act any longer. My eyes snapped open, taking in the scene: two more rogues leering outside the cage, and a hulking brute inside, pinning Victoria down. She thrashed, her screams piercing my skull.

"Get your hands off her!" I roared, lashing out with a kick.

"Look alive, boys—the feisty one's up!" Another rogue lunged for me, grappling to keep me from reaching Victoria.

A sharp crack echoed as the rogue backhanded Victoria. Her sob of pain sent white-hot fury through me. The cuffs burned deeper with every struggle, but I fought anyway, twisting, kicking—useless.

The rogue's filthy hands groped at Victoria's clothes.

I snarled, "Touch her again, and I'll rip your throat out!"

Laughter.

They thought I was powerless.

They were wrong.
###Chapter 102

The crisp morning air carried the faint scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s luxurious estate. The sun had barely risen, casting a golden hue over the sprawling gardens below. She wrapped her arms around herself, the silk robe fluttering slightly in the breeze.

Inside, the mansion buzzed with quiet activity. Giselle Beaumont, the head maid, directed the staff with practiced efficiency, while Lucien Dubois, the flirtatious head chef, hummed a tune as he prepared breakfast. The scent of freshly baked croissants and rich coffee wafted through the halls.

Lillian’s thoughts drifted to the events of the previous night—Donovan’s sudden reappearance, the way his cold gaze had lingered on her before he disappeared into the shadows. A shiver ran down her spine. She had thought she was free of him, but fate had other plans.

A soft knock interrupted her musings. "Miss Lillian?" Theodore Whitmore, Sebastian’s ever-dutiful butler, stood at the door, his expression unreadable. "Mr. Blackwood requests your presence in his study."

Lillian nodded, tightening the sash of her robe. "I’ll be right there."

Sebastian’s study was a sanctuary of dark wood and leather-bound books. He stood by the window, his broad shoulders silhouetted against the morning light. When he turned, his piercing gaze locked onto hers, sending a familiar thrill through her.

"We have a problem," he said without preamble.

Lillian arched a brow. "Donovan?"

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "He’s not acting alone. There are whispers of an alliance forming—one that could threaten everything we’ve built."

Lillian’s pulse quickened. "Who else is involved?"

Before he could answer, the door burst open. Oliver, Sebastian’s seven-year-old son, rushed in, his cheeks flushed with excitement. "Papa! Aunt Penelope is here!"

Sebastian’s expression darkened. "Now?"

Penelope, his late wife’s sister, swept into the room, her designer heels clicking against the hardwood floor. Her sharp eyes flicked from Sebastian to Lillian, a smirk playing on her lips. "Am I interrupting something?"

Lillian forced a polite smile, though her instincts screamed danger. Penelope had never hidden her disdain for her, and her sudden appearance couldn’t be a coincidence.

Sebastian’s voice was icy. "What do you want, Penelope?"

She tilted her head, her smile widening. "Can’t a sister-in-law visit family?" Her gaze slid to Lillian. "Unless, of course, I’m not welcome."

The tension in the room thickened. Lillian clenched her fists, her wolf stirring beneath her skin. Something was coming—something far worse than Donovan’s petty schemes.

And Penelope was right in the middle of it.

"Bloody hell, she's insufferable," the rogue growled, glaring at Victoria. "Need to shut her up. Hand me that wolfsbane syringe. Another dose should knock her out cold again. She was far more tolerable unconscious."

"No! Stop!" Victoria shrieked, tears streaking down her face as she thrashed against her restraints.

Lillian jerked her head back sharply, smashing it into the rogue holding her. A satisfying crunch echoed as his nose broke, blood gushing down his face. He howled in pain, and she smirked—until his fist slammed into her gut in retaliation. The force sent her doubling over, bile rising in her throat before she retched onto the filthy ground. He kicked her aside like discarded trash, his boot connecting with her ribs.

"Lillian!" Victoria sobbed.

Another rogue tossed a syringe, and the first caught it midair before jamming it into the base of Victoria's neck. Her struggles weakened, her screams fading into whimpers before her body went slack, collapsing limply against the dirt.

The rogue standing over her smirked, wiping his hands before turning his dark, predatory gaze on Lillian. His lips curled in a cruel, knowing smile.

"Why don’t we just slit their throats and be done with it?" the rogue she’d headbutted snarled, pressing a filthy rag to his still-bleeding nose. His eyes burned with fury. Lillian’s skull throbbed, pain radiating through her temples, but she refused to cower.

"You heard the boss," the rogue looming over her said. "They’re not to die until he gets here. Another hour, tops."

"So what do we do with them until then? This one’s got fire," another sneered, nudging Lillian with his boot.

"Go to hell," she spat, lifting her chin defiantly.

His fist moved faster than she could blink. The impact cracked against her cheekbone, sending white-hot pain exploding through her face. Blood filled her mouth instantly, metallic and thick, and she slumped back, gasping.

"Shut your damn mouth," he hissed.

"Not as loud as the other one," one muttered. "But she’s got spirit."

"She’s got more than that," another leered, his voice dripping with hunger. "I’ve got a better idea." He vanished briefly while the others continued their crude remarks, their eyes raking over her with disgusting intent. Lillian spat blood onto the ground, rolling onto her side, forcing herself to breathe through the agony. The wolfsbane-laced cuffs around her wrists burned, her healing slowed to a crawl. Worse—she couldn’t feel her wolf at all. The silence in her mind terrified her.

The rogue returned, triumphantly holding up another syringe. Lillian’s stomach twisted.

"Oh, hell yes," the one who’d punched her grinned, snatching it.

"What is that?" Lillian rasped, her voice raw. "Get that away from me—"

I twisted beneath him, desperate to break free, but another rogue planted his boot on my abdomen, pressing down with crushing force. The air rushed from my lungs in a pained gasp, leaving me no choice but to go still—unless I wanted him to cave my ribs in. His weight was suffocating, his smirk cruel as he leaned closer, the glint of the syringe in his hand making my pulse spike.

"Behave, little wolf," he purred, his voice dripping with malice. The needle pierced my neck before I could react, the sting sharp and sudden.

Fire flooded my veins.

At first, it was just heat—a searing, relentless burn that made my muscles lock. But this wasn’t wolfsbane. If it had been, I’d already be convulsing like Victoria had. No, this was something far more insidious.

The heat twisted, morphing into something deeper, something hungry. It coiled low in my stomach, spreading like liquid fire between my thighs. My vision blurred, the faces of the three rogues looming over me distorting into wicked grins. I clenched my legs together, but the friction only made it worse—an unbearable ache that demanded relief.

I needed—

Gods, I needed—

"Let me go," I rasped, but the plea came out breathless, weak. My body wasn’t listening to me anymore. It was listening to them.

The rogue crouched beside me, trailing a finger down my cheek. "Not until you beg."

###Chapter 103

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s estate. The sun had barely risen, casting a golden hue over the sprawling gardens below. She tightened the silk robe around her, the fabric whispering against her skin.

Last night’s events replayed in her mind—Donovan’s sudden reappearance, the venom in his words, the way his new mate, Evelyn, had smirked at her with undisguised triumph. Lillian’s fingers curled into fists. She had thought she was past this, past the pain of betrayal. But seeing them together had reopened old wounds.

A soft knock at the door startled her.

“Lillian?” Beatrice’s voice was muffled through the wood. “Are you awake?”

Lillian exhaled, forcing her shoulders to relax. “Come in.”

The door creaked open, and Beatrice slipped inside, her dark curls tousled from sleep. She carried a tray with steaming coffee and fresh pastries. “Thought you might need this,” she said, setting it down on the bedside table.

Lillian managed a small smile. “Thanks.”

Beatrice studied her for a moment before plopping onto the bed. “You look like you didn’t sleep at all.”

“I didn’t.” Lillian turned back to the balcony, watching as a pair of sparrows darted between the trees. “I keep thinking about what Donovan said. About how I was never enough.”

Beatrice scoffed. “Please. That idiot couldn’t recognize a diamond if it hit him in the face.” She grabbed a croissant and took a defiant bite. “You’re better off without him.”

Lillian sighed. “Logically, I know that. But it still hurts.”

A comfortable silence settled between them, broken only by the distant chirping of birds. Then Beatrice’s phone buzzed. She glanced at the screen and groaned. “Ugh. Cassandra’s at it again.”

Lillian raised a brow. “What now?”

Beatrice rolled her eyes. “She’s spreading rumors that you only got into the advanced combat class because of Sebastian.”

Lillian’s jaw tightened. Of course she was. Cassandra had been relentless ever since Lillian had outperformed her in the last sparring session.

“Ignore her,” Beatrice said, waving a hand. “She’s just jealous.”

Lillian nodded, but the words still stung. She had worked hard to prove herself, to show that she wasn’t just some helpless werewolf clinging to the Lycan chairman’s coattails.

A sudden knock at the door made them both turn.

“Miss Lillian?” Theodore Whitmore’s deep voice filtered through. “Mr. Blackwood requests your presence in his study.”

Lillian exchanged a glance with Beatrice. What could Sebastian want this early?

“I’ll be right there,” she called.

As Theodore’s footsteps faded, Beatrice smirked. “Maybe he wants to whisk you away to some secret Lycan retreat to escape all this drama.”

Lillian swatted her with a pillow. “Shut up.”

But as she dressed, she couldn’t help the flutter in her chest. Whatever Sebastian wanted, she had a feeling it was about to change everything.

Even in his wolf form, it took Donovan nearly the entire night to reach the rogue hideout—a decrepit house swallowed by the wilderness. Several rogue villages dotted the area, but the most dangerous ones never mingled with the rest. They thrived in isolation, free to indulge in their twisted desires. The mere thought of those filthy rogues laying a finger on what belonged to him sent molten rage coursing through his veins.

He would rip out their throats one by one. Make them choke on their own blood for daring to touch Lillian Montague.

Rational thought vanished as his wolf seized control. The beast was still bound to Lillian by their mating bond, making her scent as easy to track as a beacon in the dark. Donovan had a rough idea of the rogues' location, but once he drew close, the terrain blurred into an indistinguishable haze. His wolf, however, had no such trouble. Lillian’s scent—sweet, intoxicating—guided him unerringly to a rotting shack buried deep in the fog-choked forest.

The place reeked of rogue filth. A stagnant swamp festered nearby, its stench mingling with the sour tang of unwashed bodies. Donovan’s stomach churned, bile rising in his throat, but he swallowed it down. No guards stood watch outside—foolish, but he wasn’t about to complain.

He crashed through the front door, claws scraping against warped floorboards as he tore through the house, nostrils flaring. Then—there. Her scent. Thick. Wrong.

His wolf nearly buckled beneath the weight of it.

Desire. Heat.

Holy hell.

Lillian was in heat.

Around unmated rogues.

A snarl ripped from his throat as laughter echoed from the basement—crude, triumphant.

"That aphrodisiac worked fast," one of them crowed. "I call first dibs."

"Relax," another sneered. "We’ll all get a turn with her."

Rage turned Donovan’s vision red. He didn’t want to imagine Lillian’s breathless whimpers, her pleas for release, wasted on these animals. He’d slaughter every last one of them.

"Shit! There’s a wolf!"

A rogue at the stairwell gaped at him.

"Fuck—an Alpha!"

One shifted instantly, lunging, but Donovan dodged with lethal grace. His jaws clamped around the rogue’s throat, tearing through flesh with a sickening crunch. Blood sprayed as the body collapsed.

"Fuck!" The last rogue—standing too close to Lillian—snarled, positioning himself between her and Donovan.

Mistake.

The challenge only enraged Donovan’s wolf further. He lunged—only for another rogue to intercept, slamming into his side. The two wolves clashed, teeth bared, claws slashing.

"I mindlinked the others!" the rogue near Lillian taunted. "They’ll be here any second!"

Donovan didn’t care. He twisted, snapping his opponent’s neck with a brutal jerk. The body hit the floor with a thud.

The last rogue shifted back, eyes wide—then ran.

Donovan gave chase, but the stench of approaching rogues hit him at the top of the stairs.

They were out of time.

###Chapter 104

Shit! They were closing in, and Donovan had no idea how many rogues were coming. He needed to get Lillian out—now. Spinning on his heel, he raced back down to the basement, his pulse hammering. The sight of Lillian writhing on the cage floor hit him like a punch to the gut. Her skin was flushed, her heat scent thick in the air, calling to his wolf with an almost unbearable pull.

He forced the shift back to human form before his instincts could override his logic. Nakedness meant nothing among shifters, but the urgency of the situation did. Just as he reached for Lillian, a pained groan cut through the heavy silence.

His blood ran cold.

Victoria.

She lay unconscious in the same cage, her breathing shallow, her pulse erratic under his fingertips. Wolfsbane. Damn it.

"Fuck!" Donovan dragged a hand through his hair, torn between the two women.

He could only save one before the rogues arrived.

Victoria was his ticket to power—Sebastian Blackwood’s gratitude, the Alpha title, everything he’d schemed for. But Lillian… Lillian was fire in his veins, the one he craved beneath him, the one his wolf howled to claim.

A heartbeat of hesitation. Then he made his choice.

Scooping Victoria into his arms, he bolted for the stairs.

"Donovan—" Lillian’s voice, weak but unmistakable, stopped him dead.

He turned.

Her half-lidded eyes locked onto his, lips parted as she fought for breath. The need to kiss her, to mark her all over again, nearly choked him. But he couldn’t. Not now.

"I’ll come back for you," he lied, the words ash in his mouth.

Then he was running, Victoria’s dead weight in his arms. He just needed to get her to safety first. Then he’d return.

(If there was time.)

(If the rogues hadn’t already found her.)

The basement door burst open under his shoulder. Moonlight blinded him for a split second—before the growls registered.

Cars screeched to a halt. Wolves poured out, their snarls ripping through the night. And at the center of them all, a massive Lycan with a presence that screamed dominance.

Sebastian Blackwood.

The Alpha’s golden eyes burned into Donovan’s soul.

And Donovan knew—he was out of time.

The crisp night air bit at my fur as I raced through the dense forest, my powerful paws tearing through the underbrush. My muscles burned with the relentless pace, but I didn’t slow—not when we were this close.

"Alpha, we found the house," Marcus's voice echoed through the mindlink, sharp with urgency.

My Gammas had been scouring the territory all night, tracking down the rogue’s hideout after tracing the license plate to this remote region. Ten grueling hours of searching, following the faintest traces of Victoria’s scent, had finally led us here.

A few of my warriors remained in vehicles, ready to transport anyone if needed, but the rest of us had shifted, relying on our heightened senses to guide us.

I skidded to a halt beside Marcus and the others, my golden eyes narrowing on the decrepit shack barely standing in the clearing. The wood was rotted, the roof sagging under the weight of neglect. But the scent—her scent—was unmistakable.

Victoria had been here.

The air was thick with it, mingled with the metallic tang of blood and something darker, something that made my hackles rise.

She’s inside. Or she had been.

My claws dug into the damp earth, my wolf surging forward with a snarl. If that bastard had hurt her—

"Surround the perimeter," I ordered through the link, my voice a low growl. "No one leaves alive unless I say so."

The Gammas moved like shadows, fanning out in silence.

Tonight, blood would be spilled.

And I would make sure it wasn’t hers.

###Chapter 105

The morning sun cast golden rays through the sheer curtains of Lillian's bedroom, stirring her awake. She stretched languidly, her muscles still sore from last night’s training session with Marcus. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted up from the kitchen, signaling that Sebastian was already awake.

Downstairs, the mansion buzzed with quiet activity. Giselle, the head maid, directed the staff with practiced efficiency, while Lucien, the flirtatious head chef, hummed a French tune as he prepared breakfast. Oliver sat at the dining table, swinging his legs as he scribbled in his notebook—some elaborate plan for a school project, no doubt.

Lillian padded into the kitchen, her bare feet silent against the marble floor. Sebastian stood by the counter, his broad shoulders tense as he scrolled through messages on his phone. The moment he sensed her presence, his gaze lifted, and the tension in his jaw eased.

"Morning," he murmured, his voice still rough with sleep.

"Morning," she echoed, reaching for the coffee pot.

Before she could pour herself a cup, Sebastian intercepted, his fingers brushing against hers as he took the pot from her hands. "Let me."

The simple gesture sent warmth curling through her chest. She watched as he filled her cup, his movements precise, deliberate.

"Did you sleep well?" he asked, his eyes flickering over her face.

"Better than expected," she admitted.

A comfortable silence settled between them, broken only by Oliver's excited chatter about his latest adventure with Victoria. Lillian smiled into her coffee, savoring the domesticity of the moment.

But the peace was short-lived.

Theodore, Sebastian’s butler, entered the kitchen with a grim expression. "Sir, we’ve received word from the northern border. There’s been another breach."

Sebastian’s grip tightened around his cup. "How many this time?"

"Three. All from the Darkmoon pack."

Lillian’s stomach twisted. The Darkmoon pack—led by Alpha Maximilian—had been testing their borders for weeks, growing bolder with each incursion.

Sebastian set his coffee down with deliberate calm. "Call Marcus. We’ll need to reinforce the patrols."

Theodore nodded and retreated, leaving behind a heavy silence.

Oliver, sensing the shift in mood, looked up from his notebook. "Dad?"

Sebastian forced a smile. "Nothing to worry about, son. Just pack business."

But Lillian knew better.

She met Sebastian’s gaze, and in that moment, an unspoken understanding passed between them. The fragile peace they’d been clinging to was unraveling.

And war was coming.

The moment I burst through the clearing and rejoined my Gammas and Marcus, my entire body locked up at the sight before me. Donovan stood there, completely bare, cradling an unconscious Victoria in his arms as he sprinted from the derelict house.

His steps faltered when he spotted us, our collective glares pinning him in place. My wolf snarled viciously, the primal rage in my chest coiling tight. Something about this scene was wrong—deeply wrong.

"I—I found her," Donovan panted, shifting Victoria slightly in his grip. His voice was strained. "She was drugged. Wolfbane, I think. And she’s been hurt." My gaze snapped to my daughter’s face, the bruises darkening her pale skin sending a fresh wave of fury through me. The steady thrum of her heartbeat reached my Lycan hearing, and relief warred with suspicion.

How the hell had Donovan gotten here before us? Had he known where she was? Was he involved? My wolf’s growl deepened, a warning vibrating in my chest. I wouldn’t let him take another step.

"Rogues incoming, Alpha," Marcus’ voice cut through the mindlink.

Sure enough, a pack of snarling rogues broke through the tree line, their yellowed fangs bared. But the moment their eyes landed on me, their bravado shattered. Even the most desperate rogue wasn’t suicidal enough to challenge a Lycan—let alone a Chairman.

A single, thunderous growl ripped from my throat, and they scattered like leaves in a storm, vanishing back into the woods. I jerked my chin at my men, and most of them gave chase, leaving Marcus and a handful of Gammas with me.

All of us kept our focus locked on Donovan.

Marcus shifted first, his voice sharp. "Explain. Now."

Donovan swallowed hard. "She wasn’t answering my calls. I overheard you mention her location and came straight here. When I found her, rogues were attacking her. I got her out, but one escaped."

"You let one get away?" Marcus’ eyes narrowed.

"I had to get Victoria to safety," Donovan snapped, his grip tightening around her. "More were coming. I couldn’t risk her."

Marcus glanced back at me, silently gauging my reaction. I studied Donovan for a long moment, then my daughter’s limp form in his arms.

With a sharp exhale, I relented—for now.

But this wasn’t over.

"Get her out of here," I commanded, my voice sharp with urgency. "Take one of the SUVs. My gammas will escort you to the pack hospital under the guise of an emergency."

"Yes, Alpha," Donovan responded immediately, his movements swift as he rushed toward the nearest vehicle.

But then—another scent.

Rich, intoxicating, and utterly distracting. My wolf surged forward, my instincts snapping to attention. A low, involuntary growl rumbled in my chest before I could suppress it.

"Wait," I barked, halting Donovan mid-step. "Is there someone else here?"

He froze, his expression tightening before he muttered a curse under his breath.

"Yes," he admitted reluctantly. "Lillian."

The name sent a jolt through me. My jaw clenched, my wolf bristling beneath my skin.

Lillian.

Of course it was her.

And now, she was about to become a complication I couldn’t afford.
###Chapter 106

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s sprawling estate. The sun had barely risen, casting a golden hue over the dense forest that bordered the property. She tightened the silk robe around her, the fabric whispering against her skin.

Inside, the mansion was already stirring to life. The clinking of silverware echoed from the dining room, where Oliver was undoubtedly piling his plate high with pancakes. The sound of Victoria’s laughter drifted down the hallway, mingling with the low murmur of Theodore Whitmore giving instructions to the staff.

Lillian’s fingers curled around the railing. Last night’s confrontation with Donovan still burned in her mind—his cold dismissal, the way Evelyn had clung to his arm, smirking as if she’d already won. The memory made her stomach twist.

A soft knock at the door pulled her from her thoughts.

“Lillian?” Beatrice’s voice was hesitant. “You’ve been out here for ages. Are you okay?”

Lillian forced a smile. “Just needed some air.”

Beatrice stepped onto the balcony, her brow furrowed. “Don’t lie to me. I know you’re thinking about him.”

Lillian exhaled sharply. “It’s not just Donovan. It’s everything. The pack politics, the way people look at me like I’m some kind of interloper—”

“You’re not,” Beatrice cut in, gripping her hand. “Sebastian chose you. That means something.”

Lillian bit her lip. Did it? Sebastian had been distant lately, buried in meetings with rival Alphas and business deals. She barely saw him outside of formal dinners.

A sudden rustling in the trees below caught her attention. A shadow moved—too quick, too deliberate to be an animal.

Lillian’s pulse spiked. “Did you see that?”

Beatrice frowned. “See what?”

Before Lillian could respond, a sharp crack split the air. A bullet whizzed past, embedding itself in the wooden railing inches from her hand.

Beatrice screamed.

Lillian’s wolf surged forward, her vision sharpening. Another shot rang out, this time shattering the glass door behind them.

“Get down!” Lillian yanked Beatrice to the ground as more gunfire erupted.

The door burst open. Sebastian stormed onto the balcony, his eyes blazing gold. “Lillian!”

She barely had time to register his presence before he was hauling her up, shielding her with his body. Marcus Grayson and Julian Mercer charged outside, weapons drawn.

“Alpha, we’ve got hostiles in the east tree line!” Marcus barked.

Sebastian’s grip on Lillian tightened. “Get her inside. Now.”

As Julian dragged her away, Lillian caught a glimpse of the attackers—figures in black, their faces obscured. But one stood taller than the rest, his stance eerily familiar.

Her breath hitched.

Donovan.

The realization struck like a physical blow. He hadn’t just rejected her.

He wanted her dead.

My instincts overrode rational thought—my body moved before my mind could process. Every fiber of my being pulled me toward Lillian with undeniable urgency. I tore through the mansion, my feet pounding against the hardwood floors as I descended into the basement. Her scent hit me like a tidal wave, thick and intoxicating, making my wolf claw at my insides with primal need.

And then I saw her.

Lillian was curled on the cold concrete floor of the cage, her body writhing in distress. Her clothes were shredded, barely clinging to her frame, but thankfully, she was still untouched. Her cheeks burned crimson, her lips parted in ragged breaths. She rolled onto her back, thighs pressing together as a whimper escaped her swollen lips. The scent of her arousal was overwhelming, saturating the air, and my wolf nearly lost control.

If any unmated male caught even a hint of her heat—

I stepped into the cage, my muscles taut with restraint. Her eyelids fluttered open, revealing pupils blown wide with lust. She didn’t recognize me—not truly. All she knew was that I was male, and I could give her what her body was screaming for.

"Please..." Her voice was raw, desperate. She reached for me, fingers trembling. "I can't—I need—"

Her hips arched off the ground, and the dampness glistening between her thighs sent a violent growl rumbling through my chest. She clawed at her ruined shirt, tearing it further, exposing the flushed peaks of her breasts. My control frayed.

Marcus. I mindlinked my Beta, my voice a barely restrained snarl. Get the car ready. Now. And clear every unmated Gamma from the premises.

"What happened?" Marcus demanded.

My gaze never left Lillian as she whimpered, her fingers dragging down her own stomach. "She's in heat."

A sharp curse. "I'll handle it."

Marcus was mated—thank the gods—but the others? They’d turn into ravenous beasts the second they scented her. I couldn’t risk it.

"They're gone," Marcus confirmed moments later. "The mated warriors stayed behind to secure the area. The rest are returning to the packhouse."

Good.

Now I just had to get Lillian out of here before I lost the last shred of my restraint.


"Alright, we're on our way," I said before cutting the link and turning my attention back to Lillian, who was clutching at my ankle. Completely bare, having shifted here in my wolf form—nudity wasn’t exactly taboo among shifters, but my arousal was unmistakable, and I hated how easily she could see it.

Her gaze was hazy, locked onto my hardened length, her tongue darting out to wet her lips as if she were staring at the most delicious thing she’d ever seen.

Touching her was going to be agony, but I had to get her to safety.

"Lillian," I murmured, bending to scoop her into my arms. Her skin burned against mine, searing me with a heat I’d never felt before. She wound her arms around my neck, pressing her bare chest flush against me, a breathy moan escaping her lips.

"I need you..." she whispered against my ear, her voice laced with desperation, sending a wave of fire straight through me.

"You’re drugged," I told her firmly, though my control was fraying. "I won’t take advantage of you, Lillian."

"Please..." she whimpered, writhing against me, her need growing more urgent. I could feel the slick heat between her thighs against my arm as I held her bridal-style, and it was torture—for both me and my wolf. The beast inside me snarled, demanding I claim her right here, right now, but I clenched my jaw and held him back with everything I had.

"Sebastian..."

Hearing my name on her lips made my heart stutter.

So, she knew it was me holding her? I wasn’t sure why that sent a rush of satisfaction through me. It shouldn’t have mattered. She was just Oliver’s tutor—nothing more. And yet, a faint smirk tugged at my lips as I pulled her tighter against me, her body molding perfectly to mine. She buried her face in the crook of my neck, inhaling deeply, as if she wanted to drown in my scent.

###Chapter 107

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the Blackwood estate, painting the marble floors in warm hues. Lillian stretched beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming with the lingering traces of last night’s passion. Beside her, Sebastian slept soundly, his muscular arm draped possessively over her waist.

A soft knock at the door interrupted the peaceful silence.

"Miss Lillian?" Sophia’s voice floated through the wood. "Breakfast is ready. Alpha Blackwood requested you join him in the dining room."

Lillian bit her lip, glancing at Sebastian’s sleeping form. She didn’t want to wake him—he had been working late into the night, dealing with pack disputes. But the mention of his father’s summons sent a prickle of unease down her spine.

"Tell him I’ll be down shortly," she whispered.

Sophia’s footsteps retreated, and Lillian carefully slipped out of bed, padding to the ensuite bathroom. The reflection in the mirror showed a woman with flushed cheeks and tousled hair, her lips slightly swollen from last night’s kisses. She splashed cold water on her face, trying to shake off the remnants of sleep—and the growing sense of dread.

Sebastian stirred as she re-entered the bedroom, his golden eyes flickering open. "Where are you going?" His voice was rough with sleep, but his grip on her wrist was firm.

"Your father wants to see me," she admitted.

A shadow passed over his face. "I’ll come with you."

She shook her head. "No. He asked for me."

Sebastian’s jaw tightened, but he didn’t argue. Instead, he pulled her down for a searing kiss, his fingers tangling in her hair. "Don’t let him intimidate you," he murmured against her lips. "You’re my mate. That means something."

Lillian nodded, though her stomach twisted as she dressed in a simple blouse and slacks. The walk to the dining room felt longer than usual, each step weighed down by unspoken tension.

Alpha Harrison sat at the head of the table, his piercing gaze fixed on her the moment she entered. The spread before him—fresh fruit, pastries, and steaming coffee—remained untouched.

"Lillian," he greeted, his voice cool. "Sit."

She obeyed, folding her hands in her lap to hide their trembling.

"I’ve received word from the Winslow pack," he began, swirling his coffee absently. "Evelyn is pregnant."

The words hit like a physical blow. Lillian’s breath caught, her nails digging into her palms. Donovan’s child.

Harrison studied her reaction with detached interest. "This complicates things. The alliance between our packs was already fragile. Now, with an heir on the way, the Winslows will push for more concessions."

Lillian forced herself to breathe. "What does this have to do with me?"

His lips curled into a humorless smile. "Everything. Because if you don’t produce an heir soon, Sebastian’s position—and yours—will be in jeopardy."

The threat hung in the air, suffocating.

Before she could respond, the doors burst open. Sebastian stood there, his expression thunderous. "Enough."

Harrison arched a brow. "This doesn’t concern you."

"The hell it doesn’t." Sebastian crossed the room in three strides, pulling Lillian to her feet. "She’s not a broodmare. And if you think I’ll let you pressure her like this, you’re mistaken."

The Alpha’s eyes flashed with warning. "You forget your place."

"No," Sebastian growled, his grip tightening on Lillian’s hand. "You forget yours. She’s my mate. And I won’t let anyone—not even you—treat her like a pawn."

The tension crackled between them, a silent battle of wills.

Then, with a sharp exhale, Harrison leaned back. "Fine. But remember this, boy—power is fleeting. And without an heir, yours will crumble."

Sebastian didn’t flinch. "We’ll see about that."

With that, he led Lillian out of the room, his steps purposeful.

Outside, beneath the morning sun, she finally found her voice. "Sebastian—"

He turned, cupping her face. "I meant what I said. No one dictates our future but us."

But as he kissed her, Lillian couldn’t shake the gnawing fear.

Because in their world, power was everything.

And without an heir, theirs was already slipping away.

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stretched her arms above her head, her bare feet sinking into the plush carpet of Sebastian Blackwood's master suite. Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, painting golden stripes across the rumpled silk sheets where they'd spent the night.

A contented sigh escaped her lips as she traced the fading bite marks along her collarbone - Sebastian's claiming marks from their passionate reunion. The memory sent delicious shivers down her spine. After weeks of separation during the pack wars, their mating bond had burned hotter than ever.

"Stop thinking so loud, mate." Sebastian's sleep-roughened voice came from behind her as strong arms circled her waist. His warm breath tickled her neck as he nuzzled the sensitive spot beneath her ear. "I can hear your heartbeat racing from here."

Lillian turned in his embrace, her fingers automatically tangling in his tousled dark hair. "Maybe I'm just plotting how to keep you in bed all day," she teased, nipping at his lower lip.

Before Sebastian could respond, a frantic knock shattered the moment. "Alpha! Urgent message from the northern border!" Marcus Grayson's voice held uncharacteristic tension.

Sebastian growled low in his throat but released Lillian, reaching for his discarded pants. "What now?" he muttered, striding toward the door.

Lillian quickly pulled on one of Sebastian's dress shirts, the fine cotton swallowing her petite frame as she followed. The sight that greeted them in the hallway made her blood run cold.

Marcus stood rigid, his usually impeccable uniform torn and bloodied. Behind him, two wounded warriors leaned against the wall, their faces pale with pain. "Rogues," Marcus spat. "Dozens of them, attacking the perimeter. They're... they're wearing Winslow colors."

Lillian's stomach dropped. The Winslows - Donovan's family - had been suspiciously quiet since their failed attempt to reclaim her. This smelled like retaliation.

Sebastian's eyes flashed gold as his Lycan surged forward. "Gather the warriors. Full lockdown protocol." His gaze snapped to Lillian. "You stay here with Oliver and Victoria."

"But I can help-" Lillian started.

"No." The word carried the full weight of his Alpha command. "Not with..." His eyes dropped meaningfully to her still-flat stomach where their unborn pup grew.

Lillian opened her mouth to argue when a sudden, searing pain lanced through her mating mark. She gasped, clutching her neck as waves of foreign magic crashed over her senses. Across the bond, she felt Sebastian stagger under the same assault.

Then the world exploded.

The mansion shook violently as an enormous fireball erupted from the east wing. Lillian barely had time to register Beatrice's scream before the ceiling collapsed between them, cutting her off from Sebastian completely.

Smoke filled her lungs as she crawled toward where she'd last seen him. "Sebastian!" she screamed, her voice raw with terror. But all she heard in response was the ominous crackle of flames and the distant howls of approaching enemies.

Somewhere in the chaos, a familiar voice slithered through the smoke: "Did you really think you could steal what's mine, mutt?" Donovan's laughter sent ice through her veins. "I always collect my debts."

As the smoke cleared just enough to reveal Donovan's smirking face and the armed warriors at his back, Lillian realized with dawning horror - this wasn't just an attack.

It was a coup.

The intoxicating scent of vanilla and lavender mixed with the raw heat of her arousal filled my senses as I carried Lillian up the stairs. Relief washed over me when I confirmed the rogues hadn’t returned. Outside, a sleek black car idled at the curb, Marcus Grayson leaning casually against the door. The moment his gaze landed on Lillian, his posture stiffened, his nostrils flaring as he caught her scent. His face drained of color.

"Hell, you weren’t kidding," he muttered under his breath.

"Just open the damn door," I growled, striding toward the car. Marcus obeyed without hesitation, swinging the back door open. I settled Lillian onto the leather seat before sliding in beside her, pulling her flush against my side. She curled into me, her arms winding around my torso, her feverish skin radiating heat through my clothes. Her face pressed against my chest, her breath coming in shallow, needy gasps.

"Should we take her to the hospital?" Marcus asked as the engine purred to life, the car pulling away from the abandoned hideout.

"No," I snapped. "Take us to Blackwood Manor."

His eyes flicked to mine in the rearview mirror, hesitation clear in his expression. "Are you sure that’s wise?"

A low, warning rumble vibrated in my chest, and he wisely shut his mouth, focusing on the road. The drive felt endless, Lillian’s restless movements and soft whimpers testing the last shreds of my control. By the time we arrived, she had succumbed to exhaustion, her body limp in my arms. I dismissed Marcus with a curt nod before carrying her inside.

The staff froze as we passed, their eyes wide. Theodore Whitmore, my ever-loyal butler, gaped at us, his wolf stirring at the scent of an unmated she-wolf in heat. A single glare from me had him bowing his head in submission instantly. Even a male consumed by mating instincts knew better than to challenge a Lycan’s claim.

Upstairs, in the sanctuary of my suite, Lillian stirred awake, her body writhing against mine once more.

"It’s so hot…" she whimpered, her lips brushing the sensitive skin of my neck. The contact sent a jolt of electricity down my spine, my restraint fraying dangerously.

I carried her into the bathroom, setting her gently on the marble counter before turning the faucet on, cold water rushing into the tub. Her eyes fluttered open, heavy-lidded with desire, her chest rising and falling rapidly. The flush of heat painted her skin from head to toe, her peaked nipples begging for attention. A possessive growl tore from my throat before I could stop it.

Lillian’s lips curled into a drowsy, knowing smile.

"Sebastian…" she breathed, her fingers curling around my wrist, tugging me closer.

I was losing this battle. And I wasn’t sure I wanted to win.

"You were drugged," I murmured, my fingers tracing the delicate curve of her neck before settling on her shoulders with a gentle but firm grip. "I won't take advantage of you..."

"Please..." Lillian whispered, her teeth sinking into her plush lower lip, drawing my gaze to those swollen, parted lips—an invitation I couldn't resist. "I need you..."

Her teeth grazed my lip, and just like that, my self-control shattered.

I crushed my mouth against hers, claiming what I'd been desperate for. My tongue slid between her lips, exploring with a hunger so fierce it bordered on primal. The wolf inside me raged, wild with need—it was as if I were the one in heat. My body molded against hers, our forms fitting together as though made for each other.

A soft, breathy moan escaped her as she deepened the kiss, her hands tangling in my hair, pulling me closer. I lifted her effortlessly, and her legs wrapped around my waist, her heat pressing against me even through the thin fabric of her shorts. The evidence of her desire was unmistakable, slick against my skin as I traced the sensitive skin of her inner thighs.

I sucked her bottom lip between my teeth, nipping lightly until it swelled further beneath my touch. I needed her—now. My lips trailed down her throat, marking every inch of her with possessive bites and lingering kisses.

"Sebastian—" she gasped, her voice trembling as I lowered her slightly, only to capture her lips again.

Then—

A sharp yelp tore from her as the icy spray of the shower drenched her overheated skin.
###Chapter 108

The evening air was thick with tension as Lillian stood frozen in the dimly lit hallway of Sebastian Blackwood’s mansion. Her heart hammered against her ribs, each beat echoing the dread that coiled in her stomach.

She had overheard Donovan’s hushed conversation with Evelyn moments ago—words that confirmed her worst fears.

"It’s time to end this," Donovan had murmured, his voice laced with something dark and final. "She’s becoming a liability."

Lillian’s fingers trembled as she pressed them against the cold wall, steadying herself. She had known Donovan was ruthless, but hearing him speak so casually about her demise sent a chill down her spine.

A floorboard creaked behind her.

She whirled around, pulse spiking, only to lock eyes with Marcus Grayson, Sebastian’s beta. His sharp gaze flickered over her pale face, then narrowed.

"Lillian?" His voice was low, cautious. "What are you doing here?"

Her throat tightened. She couldn’t tell him the truth—not yet. Not when Donovan still had allies in the pack.

"Just... needed some air," she lied, forcing a weak smile.

Marcus studied her for a long moment, his expression unreadable. Then, with a slow nod, he stepped aside. "Be careful. The halls aren’t safe tonight."

The warning sent another shiver through her.

As she hurried away, her mind raced. She needed to find Sebastian. If Donovan was making his move, she had to warn him—before it was too late.

But when she reached his study, the door was ajar. Inside, the room was empty, the fireplace casting flickering shadows over the polished desk.

A note lay atop it.

Her breath hitched as she recognized Sebastian’s handwriting.

"Gone to meet Alpha Harrison. If I don’t return by dawn, trust no one."

Lillian’s blood ran cold.

Alpha Harrison—the same alpha who had tried to take advantage of her weeks ago. The same man Donovan had been secretly meeting.

This wasn’t a coincidence.

It was a trap.

And Sebastian was walking right into it.

She grabbed the note, crumpling it in her fist. There was no time to waste. If she didn’t act now, she’d lose him—and possibly her own life.

But as she turned to leave, a figure stepped into the doorway, blocking her path.

Evelyn smirked, her arms crossed. "Going somewhere, Lillian?"

Behind her, Donovan leaned against the frame, his golden eyes gleaming with predatory amusement.

Lillian’s stomach dropped.

She was out of time.

Cold.

The shock of icy water jolted me back to reality. My heart pounded violently, my entire body numb from the sudden chill. I wrapped my arms around myself, shivering as the freezing water lapped at my skin. Blinking through the haze, I took in my surroundings—an unfamiliar bathroom, tiled walls gleaming under harsh lights.

Where was I?

Fragmented memories surfaced—kidnapped, trapped in a cage with Victoria.

Victoria.

Where was she?

My breath hitched as I realized I was nearly naked, clad only in a torn tank top and shorts. Then, warmth. A pair of hands pressed against my back, steady and grounding. A rich, intoxicating scent filled my senses, making my pulse stutter.

I looked up.

Sebastian Blackwood sat beside the tub, his fingers tracing slow, soothing circles along my spine. The heat of his touch seeped through the numbness, thawing the ice in my veins.

And then it all came rushing back.

The heat. The desperation.

I threw myself at him.

Mortification burned through me. My fingers flew to my swollen lips, recalling the bruising pressure of his kisses. Tears pricked my eyes.

What had I done?

Why had I needed him so badly? Why had I been so out of control that I would have clung to anyone?

"Hey." His voice was soft, fingers skimming my shoulders. "Breathe. It's over."

As if he could read my spiraling thoughts.

"How... how did we get here?" I whispered.

"I brought you."

"But—the rogues. The basement." My voice cracked. "Victoria—"

"She's safe. Donovan took her to the hospital."

Donovan.

Another memory slammed into me—his arrival, the fight, the way he'd looked right past me, as if I were nothing. He'd chosen her. Left me there, writhing in agony.

"He abandoned me," I choked out, staring at the rippling water. "That bastard left me."

Sebastian didn't answer. His fingers continued their slow path along my back, the cold water doing little to ease the fire still simmering beneath my skin.

"I'm still in clothes," I muttered, tugging at my damp tank top. Despite the chill, my body hummed with restless energy.

Sebastian exhaled, his grip tightening slightly. "You're safe now. That's all that matters."

But was it?

Because right now, all I could think about was how much I still ached for him.

And that terrified me more than anything.
###Chapter 109 
At this point, I didn’t care if Sebastian saw me naked. I had already made a complete fool of myself, and as a shifter, modesty had never been my strong suit.

With a sharp tug, I ripped off the remains of my tank top and tossed it onto the edge of the tub. My shorts and underwear followed, landing in a damp heap beside it.

Sebastian discarded his ruined clothes and disappeared into his room, returning with a fresh shirt just as I finished rinsing off. I stood, water sluicing down my body, and nearly lost my footing as I stepped out of the tub.

But Sebastian was there in an instant, his strong arms wrapping around me, pulling me flush against his bare chest. My gaze dropped instinctively, and my breath hitched. He was… impressive.

A shiver ran through me, though not from the cold. My mouth went dry, and I swallowed hard, my pulse thundering in my ears. He lifted me effortlessly from the tub, setting me down carefully, his hands lingering just long enough to ensure I was steady.

The moment his touch left me, I felt the loss like a physical ache, my skin suddenly too sensitive, too exposed. He grabbed a towel and draped it over my shoulders, cocooning me in its warmth.

But I couldn’t tear my eyes away from him.

Sebastian Blackwood was devastatingly handsome, his presence almost painful in its intensity. The fever might have broken, but the heat between us hadn’t faded—if anything, it simmered deeper, a slow burn that threatened to consume me whole.

And I wasn’t sure I wanted to resist it.

The morning sun filtered through the heavy velvet curtains of Sebastian Blackwood's private study. Lillian stirred awake on the leather couch where she'd fallen asleep waiting for him. Her neck ached from the awkward position, but the scent of freshly brewed coffee and warm croissants made her sit up abruptly.

"Good morning, sleeping beauty," Sebastian's deep voice rumbled from behind his mahogany desk. His piercing blue eyes held amusement as he watched her scramble to straighten her wrinkled blouse. "I trust you found my couch comfortable?"

Lillian's cheeks burned. "I didn't mean to fall asleep. I was just—"

"Waiting to ambush me about Oliver again?" Sebastian interrupted, his smile fading. He pushed a silver tray toward her. "Eat. We'll talk after."

The clink of fine china echoed in the tense silence. Lillian nibbled on a buttery croissant while studying Sebastian's tired face. Dark circles shadowed his eyes, and his usually immaculate shirt showed signs of being worn all night. Whatever business had kept him out until dawn, it hadn't been pleasant.

"Victoria came by earlier," Sebastian said suddenly, flipping through a stack of documents. "She mentioned seeing you with Donovan at the university café."

Lillian nearly choked on her coffee. "It wasn't like that! He cornered me after class. I was trying to—"

"I know what you were trying to do." Sebastian's knuckles whitened around his fountain pen. "But playing with fire only gets you burned, little wolf."

Before Lillian could respond, the study door burst open. Beatrice stormed in, her usually perfect curls disheveled and her phone clutched in a death grip.

"Lil! You need to see this!" Beatrice shoved her phone forward. On screen, a gossip blog displayed blurry photos of Donovan leaving a high-end hotel with Evelyn... and Victoria watching from a parked car.

Sebastian was on his feet in an instant. "When was this taken?"

"Last night," Beatrice whispered. "Right after Victoria told everyone she was visiting her grandmother."

The air in the room turned electric with tension. Lillian's wolf bristled at the implications. Victoria had lied. Donovan had lied. And Evelyn... she'd played them all.

Sebastian's phone rang, the shrill tone cutting through the silence. He answered tersely, his expression growing darker with each passing second. When he hung up, his voice was dangerously calm.

"That was Marcus. Donovan's been making unauthorized withdrawals from the pack accounts. Substantial ones."

Lillian's stomach dropped. "How much?"

"Enough to buy a small country," Sebastian said grimly. He grabbed his suit jacket from the back of his chair. "Stay here. Both of you. I need to handle this before—"

The study window shattered inward as a silver-tipped arrow embedded itself in the wall inches from Sebastian's head.

"Too late," Beatrice breathed as chaos erupted outside.

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the lavish bedroom as Lillian stirred beneath the silk sheets. Her body ached from the previous night’s events, but the warmth beside her made her pulse quicken. Donovan’s scent still lingered in the air, a cruel reminder of what had once been.

She sat up abruptly, her fingers gripping the edge of the mattress. How could he do this to me?

A soft knock interrupted her spiraling thoughts. The door creaked open, revealing Beatrice’s concerned face. "Lil, you okay?"

Lillian exhaled sharply, running a hand through her tangled hair. "Define okay."

Beatrice stepped inside, shutting the door behind her. "I heard what happened. That bastard Donovan—"

"Don’t," Lillian cut her off, her voice brittle. "I don’t want to talk about him."

Beatrice hesitated before nodding. "Fine. But you need to get up. Sebastian’s waiting downstairs."

Lillian’s breath hitched. Sebastian. The name alone sent a shiver down her spine. The Lycan chairman had been an unexpected force in her life—protective, commanding, and dangerously alluring.

She swung her legs over the bed, wincing at the soreness. "What does he want?"

Beatrice smirked. "Wouldn’t you like to know?"

Downstairs, the mansion buzzed with quiet efficiency. The scent of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the faint aroma of lavender from the gardens. Lillian descended the grand staircase, her bare feet sinking into the plush carpet.

Sebastian stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, his broad shoulders silhouetted against the morning light. He turned as she approached, his piercing gaze sweeping over her. "You look like hell."

Lillian scoffed. "Gee, thanks."

A ghost of a smile tugged at his lips. "I didn’t say it was a bad look."

Her cheeks warmed, but she forced herself to meet his eyes. "What do you want, Sebastian?"

His expression darkened. "We have a problem. Evelyn’s been spreading rumors about you."

Lillian stiffened. Of course she has. Donovan’s new mate had made it her mission to ruin her reputation. "What kind of rumors?"

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "The kind that could get you expelled."

Her stomach dropped. "You’re joking."

"I don’t joke." He stepped closer, his voice lowering. "But I do protect what’s mine."

The possessive edge in his tone sent a thrill through her. Before she could respond, the front door burst open.

Victoria stormed in, her face flushed with fury. "Father! You can’t seriously be considering—"

Sebastian’s glare silenced her. "Not now, Victoria."

Victoria’s eyes flicked to Lillian, her lip curling. "This is her fault!"

Lillian crossed her arms. "What did I do now?"

"You know what you did!" Victoria spat. "You’re ruining everything!"

Sebastian stepped between them, his voice a growl. "Enough."

The tension in the room thickened, suffocating. Lillian’s heart pounded. What the hell is going on?

Then, the phone rang.

Sebastian snatched it up, his expression unreadable. After a tense moment, he hung up and turned to Lillian. "Pack your things. We’re leaving."

Her pulse spiked. "Where?"

His eyes gleamed with something dangerous. "Somewhere no one will find us."

"Keep looking at me like that, and I won't be responsible for what happens next," Sebastian murmured, his voice thick with desire, sending shivers down my spine.

"Then don’t hold back," I breathed before my brain could catch up with my reckless words. Closing the distance between us, I crushed my lips against his, pouring every ounce of my pent-up longing into the kiss. For a heartbeat, he froze—stunned—and I braced myself for rejection. But then his strong arms wrapped around my waist, pulling me flush against him. He lifted me effortlessly, my legs instinctively winding around his torso as the towel slipped away, forgotten.

My tongue traced the seam of his lips, begging for entry, and when he yielded, a rush of triumph and heat flooded me. He wanted this just as desperately as I did.

Carrying me into the bedroom, he laid me down on the plush expanse of his king-sized bed, his scent enveloping me—dark, intoxicating, and undeniably male. How had I never noticed how intoxicating he smelled before? His teeth grazed my bottom lip before his mouth trailed down my neck, sucking and nipping at the sensitive skin until I arched against him with a breathy moan.

His lips blazed a path lower, pausing to lavish attention on my breasts, his tongue swirling around each peak until I gasped, fingers tangling in his hair. A low growl rumbled in his chest as he pulled away, capturing my mouth again in a searing kiss that left me dizzy.

"I need to taste every inch of you," he growled against my lips, his hands roaming possessively over my body.

"Please," was all I could manage, my thoughts dissolving into liquid fire.

His mouth descended once more, teasing and tormenting until he reached the apex of my thighs. The heat of his breath against my core made me tremble, desire pooling deep inside. Under any other circumstances, I might have been mortified—no man had ever been this close, this intimate. Donovan and I had never gone beyond chaste kisses; I’d been determined to wait until we were properly mated.

Yet here I was, surrendering to Sebastian without hesitation.

Rationality had long since fled. There was only this—this all-consuming need, this fire that only he could quench.

When his tongue finally found me, I cried out, fingers clutching the sheets as pleasure surged through me. His satisfied groan vibrated against my skin, sending another wave of ecstasy crashing over me. I writhed beneath him, chasing that sweet, unbearable edge, my entire body alight with sensation.

He teased me mercilessly, his mouth working magic until my vision blurred and my back arched off the bed. "Sebastian!" I gasped, teetering on the brink.

With one final, devastating flick of his tongue, I shattered, my climax crashing over me like a tidal wave.

I’d experienced pleasure before—solitary, fleeting—but nothing like this. This was earth-shattering.

The morning sun filtered through the heavy velvet curtains of Sebastian Blackwood's private study. Lillian stirred awake on the leather couch where she'd fallen asleep waiting for him. Her neck ached from the awkward position, and she blinked against the golden light now illuminating the room.

"Good morning, little wolf," Sebastian's deep voice rumbled from across the study. He stood by the window, already dressed in his signature black suit, the morning light casting dramatic shadows across his chiseled features. "I didn't have the heart to wake you."

Lillian sat up quickly, smoothing her wrinkled blouse. "What time is it? Did you sleep at all?" She noticed the half-empty whiskey glass and scattered documents on his desk.

"Time enough," he evaded, his golden eyes tracking her movements with predatory focus. "We need to talk about what happened with Donovan."

A cold shiver ran down Lillian's spine at the mention of her former mate. The memory of Donovan's cruel rejection still burned fresh, even after all these months. "What about him?"

Sebastian moved with unnatural Lycan grace to sit beside her. "He's petitioned the Council to challenge our mating bond." His large hand covered hers, warm and reassuring. "But I won't let him take you from me."

Downstairs, the sound of Oliver's laughter floated up from the garden where Victoria was playing with him. The domestic normalcy contrasted sharply with the tension in the study.

Lillian swallowed hard. "What does this mean? I thought the rejection was final."

"Not according to Lycan law," Sebastian growled, his fingers tightening around hers. "There's a loophole if the rejected mate can prove coercion or improper bonding."

"But that's ridiculous! You saved me from—"

A sharp knock interrupted them. Theodore Whitmore entered without waiting for permission, his usually composed face strained. "Sir, urgent news from the Winslow estate. Evelyn has gone into early labor."

Sebastian's expression darkened. "How convenient."

Lillian's heart pounded. Evelyn, Donovan's new mate, pregnant with his child. The timing couldn't be worse. "We should go," she said before she could stop herself.

Sebastian's golden eyes flashed. "Absolutely not. That's exactly what Donovan wants."

"But if something happens to Evelyn or the baby—"

"Then it's on Donovan's head, not yours," Sebastian cut in sharply. He turned to Theodore. "Send Marcus to monitor the situation. Discreetly."

As Theodore bowed and exited, Lillian stood abruptly. "I can't just sit here while—"

Sebastian moved with lightning speed, caging her against the bookshelf. His scent—dark spice and something uniquely Sebastian—wrapped around her. "You're mine," he growled low in his throat, the primal claim vibrating through her bones. "And I protect what's mine."

The intensity in his gaze stole her breath. In that moment, Lillian understood the true power of the Lycan chairman—not just his political influence, but the raw, untamed force of nature that lurked beneath his polished exterior.

A second knock, more urgent this time. "Sir!" Marcus Grayson's voice carried through the door. "The Winslows are demanding Lillian's presence at the birth. They're claiming it's pack law."

Sebastian's growl sent vibrations through Lillian's body where they touched. "This is a trap."

Lillian placed a trembling hand on his chest, feeling the rapid beat of his heart. "Then we spring it together."

###Chapter 110

"Do we need protection?" Sebastian murmured against my lips, his breath hot and uneven.

"I'm on birth control," I gasped, my fingers tangling in his dark hair.

His eyes darkened instantly, a low growl rumbling from his chest. "Why?" The intensity in his voice caught me off guard, but the heat pooling low in my stomach left no room for hesitation.

"My cycles are unbearable," I admitted breathlessly. "My doctor prescribed it to regulate them."

Some of the tension left his shoulders as he kissed me again, slow and deep. The taste of myself on his lips sent a fresh wave of desire through me. Even after the most intense climax of my life, I still craved more—needed to feel him inside me, claiming me completely.

As if sensing my thoughts, he positioned himself between my thighs, his kiss shifting from demanding to tender. "Are you sure?" he whispered, his voice rough with restraint.

I nodded without hesitation, pulling him closer, deepening the kiss in answer.

He entered me slowly, pausing when he met resistance. My breath hitched—once he broke through that barrier, there was no going back. I would no longer be untouched, and Sebastian would have taken something I'd once guarded so carefully.

His teeth grazed my earlobe, his ragged breaths and quiet groans sending shivers down my spine. Then he pushed forward, breaching that final barrier. A sharp gasp escaped me at the sudden sting.

He was so much bigger than I'd imagined. For a fleeting second, I wondered if he'd even fit. Sensing my discomfort, he stilled, his gaze searching mine. "Are you okay?" Concern laced his voice.

I nodded, swallowing hard. "Just—give me a moment."

"Take all the time you need," he murmured, pressing soft kisses along my jawline.

After a few steadying breaths, I finally nodded. "Okay," I whispered. "Keep going."

He pushed deeper, stretching me impossibly further. Just when I thought I couldn't take any more, he withdrew suddenly—only to surge back into me with a force that made me cry out. The initial pain faded almost instantly, replaced by a pleasure so intense my body arched against his.

Fully sheathed inside me, he captured my lips in a searing kiss, his tongue exploring my mouth with a rhythm that matched the relentless pace of his hips. I wrapped my arms around his neck, my legs locking around his waist as he drove into me, each thrust sending me spiraling closer to the edge.

The world narrowed to just him—Sebastian Blackwood—consuming every thought until my mind was nothing but a haze of desire. Never in my life had I felt so utterly complete, so perfectly matched, and I couldn’t help but wonder if he felt the same dizzying pull.

My body tightened around him, the friction sending sparks of pleasure coursing through me. I was close—so close—but I wanted him with me when I fell. I bit my lip, holding back, savoring the delicious tension coiling inside me.

Sebastian seemed to sense it. His pace quickened, each thrust deeper, more deliberate, until I felt him swell inside me, his control unraveling. His fingers found my clit, stroking with just the right pressure, and I gasped as pleasure crashed over me in waves.

"Come for me, Lillian," he murmured, his voice rough with need, sending my heart into a frantic rhythm.

That was all it took.

I shattered around him, crying out his name as my body convulsed in ecstasy. A few more desperate thrusts, and he followed, his release filling me as he captured my lips in a searing kiss. In that moment, we were fused together—body, breath, soul—and I knew, without a doubt, that this was the most exquisite experience of my life.


###Chapter 111

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s sprawling estate. The sun had barely risen, casting a golden hue over the dense forest that bordered the property. She inhaled deeply, the tension in her shoulders easing slightly.

Last night had been a disaster.

Donovan’s sudden appearance at the gala, his smug smirk as he paraded Evelyn around like some prized possession—it had taken every ounce of Lillian’s self-control not to shift right then and there. The memory still made her claws itch beneath her skin.

A soft knock at the door pulled her from her thoughts.

“Lillian?” Beatrice’s voice was muffled through the wood. “You awake?”

Lillian sighed, rubbing her temples. “Yeah, come in.”

The door creaked open, and Beatrice slipped inside, her dark curls bouncing as she crossed the room. She held two steaming mugs, the rich aroma of coffee filling the space between them.

“Thought you could use this,” Beatrice said, handing her one.

Lillian took it gratefully, the warmth seeping into her fingers. “Thanks.”

Beatrice leaned against the railing beside her, studying her face. “You look like hell.”

Lillian snorted. “Feel like it too.”

Silence settled between them, comfortable but heavy with unspoken words. Beatrice had always been the one person who could read her like an open book.

“He’s not worth it, you know,” Beatrice finally said, her voice softer now. “Donovan, I mean.”

Lillian’s grip tightened around the mug. “I know.”

But knowing and believing were two different things.

The sound of footsteps echoed from the hallway, followed by the cheerful chatter of Oliver, Sebastian’s seven-year-old son. The boy bounded into the room, his bright eyes alight with excitement.

“Lillian! Beatrice! You’re both up!” He grinned, his small frame practically vibrating with energy. “Dad says we’re going riding today! You’re coming, right?”

Lillian forced a smile, pushing her dark thoughts aside. “Of course we are.”

Oliver whooped in delight before dashing off, likely to spread the news to the rest of the household.

Beatrice smirked. “Kid’s got more energy before breakfast than I do all day.”

Lillian chuckled, but her amusement faded as her gaze drifted back to the forest. Somewhere out there, Donovan was probably gloating about how he’d moved on so effortlessly.

And yet, despite everything, a part of her still ached.

Beatrice nudged her shoulder. “Hey. Forget about him. Today’s a new day.”

Lillian took another sip of coffee, the bitterness grounding her. “Yeah. A new day.”

But as she glanced toward the stables where Sebastian was already waiting, she couldn’t shake the feeling that something—or someone—was about to change everything. Again.

The sound of running water pulled me from sleep. I blinked, disoriented, before reality crashed back—I was naked in Sebastian Blackwood’s bed.

Last night had been a blur of exhaustion and reckless abandon. I’d collapsed into sleep without a second thought, only to wake up feeling more rested than I had in months. And then there were the orgasms—earth-shattering, mind-numbing, unlike anything I’d ever experienced. My body still hummed with the aftershocks, every nerve alight with the memory of his touch.

I glanced at the empty space beside me. The sheets were rumpled, still warm where Sebastian had lain. A traitorous smile tugged at my lips before I could stop it.

This was wrong.

Sebastian was my boss. Worse, he was the father of my ex-mate’s fiancée. Every logical part of my brain screamed that this was a disaster waiting to happen. And yet… I couldn’t bring myself to regret it.

But it couldn’t happen again.

My life was already a wreck. My father was in prison. Donovan was blackmailing me. Evelyn wanted to befriend me. And now I’d slept with her father.

Perfect.

The shower shut off. Panic flared, and I scrambled from the bed, grabbing the nearest blanket to cover myself. It was ridiculous—shifters had no real modesty, and Sebastian had seen every inch of me last night—but the morning light made everything feel too raw, too exposed.

The bathroom door swung open, steam rolling out like a scene from a fantasy.

And oh, what a fantasy he was.

Sebastian stepped into the room, a towel slung low around his hips, water glistening on his sculpted torso. My mouth went dry. His abs were a work of art, droplets trailing down the ridges before vanishing beneath the towel. My gaze dipped lower, catching the unmistakable outline of his arousal.

How—?

Had last night not been enough? Or was that just… him?

My cheeks burned as my eyes traveled back up, lingering on the dark hair dusting his chest, still damp from the shower. I wanted to run my fingers through it, taste the water on his skin—

A deep chuckle snapped me back to reality.

"Enjoying the view?" Sebastian’s voice was rough with amusement, one brow arched as he caught me staring.

Heat flooded my face.

"Or," he continued, stepping closer, "do you need a closer look?"

His smirk was pure sin.

And damn it all, I was tempted.

His words struck me like a physical blow, leaving me speechless. How could he tease me so casually? Didn’t he see the turmoil inside me? He had taken something irreplaceable—my innocence. And I had let him.

The weight of that realization crashed over me like a tidal wave. I would never be able to offer my purity to a future mate, not anymore. That choice had been stolen from me the moment I surrendered to him. My legs trembled beneath me, threatening to give way, as if they had turned to stone.

"Last night was a mistake," I whispered, more to myself than to him. But of course, with his heightened Lycan hearing, Sebastian caught every word.

His piercing gaze darkened, and for a fleeting second, I thought I glimpsed something raw—hurt, maybe?—before his expression shuttered completely.

"I asked you if you were sure," he reminded me, his voice low and controlled.

"And I was," I admitted quickly, desperate to clarify. "But now I realize this can’t happen again. You’re my boss. And Donovan’s future father-in-law."

At the mention of Donovan, his jaw tightened. Was it the thought of his daughter’s engagement, or just the reminder of my past with him? I couldn’t tell, and I wasn’t about to ask.

"We should pretend this never happened," I continued, forcing myself to meet his eyes. "From now on, we keep things strictly professional."

For a long moment, he just stared at me, his expression unreadable. Then, with a sharp exhale, he nodded. His face turned cold, distant—like a door slamming shut between us.

"Fine," he finally said, his tone clipped. "But you’re not leaving like that."

He turned away, rummaging through a drawer before pulling out a plain black T-shirt—his size, which meant it would swallow me whole. He tossed it to me without another word, then grabbed his own clothes and disappeared into the bathroom, leaving me standing there, clutching the fabric like a lifeline.

The silence that followed was deafening.
###Chapter 112

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the cobblestone path leading to the Blackwood estate. Her heart pounded against her ribs, a mix of anticipation and unease coiling in her stomach. Today was the day she would finally confront Donovan—her former fated mate—and the woman he had chosen over her, Evelyn.

Sebastian Blackwood stood at the grand entrance, his broad shoulders framed by the towering oak doors. His piercing gaze softened as he caught sight of her, a silent reassurance that steadied her nerves. "You're not alone in this," he murmured, his deep voice laced with quiet authority.

Lillian nodded, gripping the strap of her satchel tighter. "I know."

Inside, the opulent foyer buzzed with tension. Evelyn perched on the edge of a velvet chaise, her fingers twisting the delicate lace of her dress. Donovan stood beside her, his jaw clenched, eyes darting between Lillian and Sebastian.

"You shouldn't have come," Donovan snapped, his voice sharp with irritation.

Lillian lifted her chin. "I have every right to be here."

Evelyn's lips curled into a smirk. "Still clinging to the past, I see."

Before Lillian could retort, Beatrice burst into the room, her cheeks flushed. "Lillian! You won't believe what I just heard—" She stopped short, taking in the scene. "Oh. Bad timing?"

Sebastian exhaled through his nose, his patience thinning. "Out with it, Beatrice."

Beatrice hesitated, then blurted, "Victoria's engagement to Donovan is off. She just announced it at the council meeting."

Silence.

Lillian's breath hitched. Donovan's face drained of color. "What?"

Sebastian's expression darkened. "Explain."

Beatrice fidgeted. "She said she won't marry someone who still pines for his ex." Her gaze flicked to Lillian. "And she may have implied that Donovan isn't fit to lead a pack."

Evelyn shot to her feet. "That little—"

Sebastian raised a hand, cutting her off. "Enough." His voice was steel. "Donovan, you will answer for this."

Lillian's pulse raced. The game had just changed.

And she wasn't sure if she was ready for what came next.

The door slammed shut without a word, without even a backward glance. Just like that, I was left alone with the weight of my thoughts.

Sebastian’s POV

I couldn’t focus today. Not on work, not on anything. My mind kept drifting back to Lillian—the way she had moaned my name last night, the way her body had responded to mine. The memory alone was enough to make my control slip. I’d spent most of the day seated at my desk, unwilling to let anyone see the evidence of my relentless arousal.

When she’d insisted on keeping things professional between us, I knew she was right. This couldn’t continue. But the thought of never touching her again? It didn’t sit well with me—or with my wolf. The beast had been restless all day, growling and clawing at me to go back, to claim her again. I shut him down every time, but it didn’t make the craving any easier to ignore.

This morning, when I stepped out of the bathroom, she was already gone. A part of me was relieved. If she had still been there, in my space, smelling like desire and sleep-warmed skin, I wasn’t sure I could have stopped myself from taking her again. But her scent lingered on my sheets, intoxicating and impossible to ignore. I considered sleeping in another room until it faded—but even the idea of that felt like a surrender I wasn’t ready to make.

Marcus, my Beta, had pestered me all day with knowing smirks. “So,” he’d drawled, leaning against my desk, “anything interesting happen after I dropped you two off last night?”

I shot him a warning glare. He knew. Of course he knew. But I wasn’t about to indulge his nosiness. What happened between Lillian and me was no one’s business but ours.

“You’re distracted,” Marcus remarked, pulling me from my thoughts. “Wouldn’t have anything to do with a certain unmated she-wolf, would it? Maybe the one tutoring your son?”

A low growl rumbled in my chest, and he wisely shut his mouth. He was my oldest friend, but even he knew better than to push me too far.

Swallowing hard, Marcus turned away. “Message received,” he muttered.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, I decided to call it a day. I rarely left the office this early, but tonight, I was eager to get back to the villa. Glancing at the clock, I noted that Lillian’s tutoring session with Oliver would be ending soon. I wasn’t sure why that mattered—but it did. And suddenly, I was in a hurry.

After a quick farewell to Marcus and the rest of the staff, I strode out to where Frederick, my driver, waited. The moment the car pulled up to the villa, her scent hit me—stronger than usual, richer, as if last night had somehow intensified it. I inhaled deeply, my pulse quickening.

Inside, I found her standing near the entrance, speaking softly to Oliver. Victoria descended the stairs with Nathaniel trailing behind her.

Nathaniel.

How could I have forgotten about Nathaniel? Lillian's eyes widened when she noticed him, and I wondered if she had forgotten about him too. He didn't seem to catch her startled reaction, though, as he rushed forward to embrace her. A low, involuntary growl rumbled in my chest—one I didn’t even realize I was capable of making. I stepped back, forcing myself to regain control before I did something reckless.

Nathaniel murmured something to her that I couldn’t hear, and Lillian let out a soft, breathy laugh in response.

"I'll see you all tomorrow," she said, waving at Victoria and Oliver before turning to leave.

Her gaze flickered to mine, and for a heartbeat, the world narrowed to just the two of us. Her lips parted slightly, as if she wanted to say something, but no words came. Instead, a delicate flush spread across her cheeks, painting them the softest shade of pink. Then, with a quick, almost shy nod, she hurried out of the villa.

"Dinner will be served shortly," one of the maids announced from the kitchen doorway.

"Oh, good. I'm starving," Victoria said.

She and Oliver headed toward the dining room, but Nathaniel lingered behind. I had no intention of speaking to him—not when every instinct in me screamed to keep my distance before I lost control. But as I moved past him, his hand shot out, gripping my arm.

"Uncle Sebastian," he said, his voice low. "I heard about what happened last night."

My entire body tensed. Did he know? Had he heard us? Or worse—had Lillian told him? Denial was my only option.

"I'm not sure what you're referring to—"

"You saved Lillian's life," he finished, cutting me off. The breath I hadn’t realized I was holding rushed out. He was talking about the attack, not… the other thing.

"It was nothing," I muttered, eager to end this conversation.

"It was everything, Uncle," Nathaniel insisted, his voice thick with gratitude. "I don’t know what I’d do if I lost her. Thank you."

"I didn’t do it for you," I snapped, my canines lengthening before I could stop them.

He released my arm instantly, taking a cautious step back.

"No, I know that," he said quickly. "I’m just… relieved you were there. I really care about her, and I think I’m going to ask her to be my girlfriend. Do you think she’d say yes?"

The question hit like a blade to the ribs.

###Chapter 113

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the campus quad. Her fingers tightened around the strap of her backpack, her mind still reeling from the confrontation with Donovan the night before. The memory of his cold dismissal sent a sharp pang through her chest, but she refused to let it show.

Beatrice, ever observant, nudged her shoulder. "You okay? You look like you’ve been wrestling with a ghost."

Lillian forced a smile. "Just tired. Late-night study session."

Beatrice arched a brow but didn’t press further. "Well, snap out of it. Professor Sinclair’s class starts in five, and you know how he gets about tardiness."

Lillian groaned. The last thing she needed was another strike from the notoriously strict professor.

As they hurried toward the lecture hall, a familiar figure leaned against the doorway—Nathaniel, his dark eyes tracking her with quiet intensity. He pushed off the wall as she approached, a smirk playing on his lips. "Running late, Lillian?"

She ignored the flutter in her stomach. "Not if I make it in the next thirty seconds."

Nathaniel chuckled, falling into step beside her. "I’ll walk you in. Wouldn’t want you getting another lecture."

Beatrice shot her a knowing look before slipping inside. Lillian exhaled, steeling herself. "You don’t have to—"

"Actually, I do." His voice dropped, low and serious. "Donovan was at the bar last night. With Evelyn."

Lillian’s breath hitched. She had known, of course, but hearing it confirmed still stung. "Not my problem anymore."

Nathaniel studied her, his expression unreadable. "If you say so."

Before she could respond, the classroom door swung open, revealing Professor Sinclair’s stern face. "Miss Whitaker, Mr. Whitlock. Are you joining us, or should I mark you absent?"

Lillian ducked inside without another word, but Nathaniel’s presence lingered like a shadow at her back.

The lecture passed in a blur. Lillian barely registered the words on the board, her thoughts spiraling. Donovan’s betrayal, Evelyn’s smug smile, and now Nathaniel’s sudden interest—it was all too much.

When the bell finally rang, Beatrice grabbed her arm. "Spill. What did Nathaniel say?"

Lillian hesitated. "Nothing important."

Beatrice scoffed. "Yeah, and I’m the Queen of England."

Lillian opened her mouth to protest when her phone buzzed. A message from Sebastian Blackwood lit up the screen:

"Pack meeting. My office. Now."

Her stomach twisted. Whatever this was, it couldn’t be good.

Beatrice frowned. "Trouble?"

Lillian pocketed her phone. "Always."

Sebastian’s office was eerily quiet when she arrived. The Lycan chairman sat behind his desk, his piercing gaze locked onto her the moment she stepped inside. Marcus Grayson stood at his side, arms crossed.

"You’re late," Sebastian said coolly.

Lillian swallowed. "I came as soon as I got your message."

Sebastian leaned forward, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "Donovan’s been spreading rumors. About you. About us."

Her blood ran cold. "What kind of rumors?"

Marcus exchanged a glance with Sebastian before answering. "That you’re using the chairman’s influence to manipulate the pack. That your rejection of Donovan was staged."

Lillian’s nails dug into her palms. "That’s ridiculous."

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "I know. But rumors have a way of spreading. Especially when they’re fueled by spite."

A knock at the door interrupted them. Theodore Whitmore entered, his expression grim. "Sir, Alpha Harrison is here. He’s demanding an audience."

Sebastian’s eyes darkened. "Of course he is."

Lillian’s pulse spiked. Alpha Harrison had tried to take advantage of her once before. What did he want now?

Sebastian stood, his voice cutting through the tension. "Stay here. Both of you."

As he strode out, Marcus turned to Lillian. "This isn’t just about Donovan anymore. Someone’s playing a bigger game."

Lillian’s breath came short. "Who?"

Marcus’s lips thinned. "That’s what we need to find out."

The door clicked shut behind Sebastian, leaving her with a sinking feeling.

The storm was coming. And she was right in the middle of it.

There was something endearingly naive about my nephew—a youthful optimism that made me hesitate to shatter his illusions. Yet, I couldn’t bring myself to fuel his hopes either. Whether Lillian chose to be with him or not shouldn’t matter to me. She was her own woman, free to make her own choices. And it was painfully obvious she didn’t see me that way—she wanted to keep things strictly professional. Maybe that was for the best.

But the mere thought of another man touching her sent a surge of possessive fury through me. I clenched my jaw, forcing the image away. It wasn’t my place. She had made her decision, and now I had to live with mine.

"I can’t speak for her," I finally said, my voice carefully neutral. "You’ll have to ask her yourself." With that, I turned on my heel and strode into the kitchen, leaving Nathaniel standing there.

Victoria and Oliver were already seated at the dining table when I entered, and Nathaniel followed moments later. I took my place at the head of the table while he settled beside Victoria.

"I’m so glad you could join us for dinner, Dad. I didn’t expect you to be here," Victoria said, her smile warm but tired.

"I’m surprised you’re not with Donovan," I remarked, unfolding my napkin onto my lap.

She shrugged, her fingers brushing against her phone where it lay beside her plate.

"He’s been busy today," she murmured. "After I got back from the hospital, he had work to catch up on. He stayed with me the entire night, though. He was… perfect."

I studied her face. The bruise had faded significantly, and she looked far better than she had this morning when I’d seen her at the hospital—exhausted, shaken. Spending time with Donovan must have helped soothe her nerves.

"He was so heroic last night, Daddy," Victoria continued, her voice softening with admiration. "I wish I could remember him fighting off those rogues, but I blacked out. I still can’t believe he came for me… He must really love me." She sighed, twirling a strand of hair around her finger. "I can’t believe I ever doubted him."

"You doubted him?" Nathaniel asked, eyebrows lifting.

"Only for a second," she admitted, her cheeks flushing. "I thought… maybe he had feelings for someone else. But I was just being paranoid."

"Who else could he possibly want?" Nathaniel pressed. "Who could compare to you, Victoria?"

She ducked her head, staring at her empty plate. "It doesn’t matter now."

I knew exactly who she was thinking of. Before the conversation could continue, the maids entered with trays of food, the rich aromas filling the room.

"This looks amazing!" Victoria exclaimed, perking up.

"I’m starving," Nathaniel added with a grin.

"Dig in," I announced as the final dishes were placed on the table. I waited politely until everyone had served themselves before beginning my own meal.

"Have you heard about the masquerade ball this weekend?" Victoria asked, her eyes sparkling as she glanced at me. "It's the social event of the season - absolutely everyone important will be there." I gave a knowing nod.

"I already have invitations for you and Donovan," I informed her.

She let out an excited squeal, clapping her hands together. "Oh father, that's wonderful!"

Nathaniel cleared his throat, pausing between bites. "Would it be possible to get two additional tickets? I'd love to invite Lillian as my date."

"What a splendid idea!" Victoria chimed in, her enthusiasm bubbling over. "We could make a day of it - I'll take her shopping and we'll have the most marvelous girls' outing!" She suddenly froze under my sharp glare, offering a sheepish smile. "With extra security, of course. We won't go anywhere without guards."

"You'll take double the usual guards and Marcus will accompany you," I stated firmly, leaving no room for negotiation.

"Yes, father," she replied obediently, suddenly finding her plate very interesting.

Nathaniel cleared his throat again, drawing my attention back to him. I didn't particularly want to give him an opportunity to take Lillian out, but refusing outright would require explanations I wasn't prepared to give.

"So... about those tickets?" he pressed.

I exhaled slowly. "Fine," I conceded. "I'll see what I can arrange."

"Thank you, Uncle," Nathaniel said with a satisfied smile before returning to his meal.

Victoria continued chattering excitedly about the upcoming event as we ate. My gaze drifted to Nathaniel, lingering longer than appropriate. The smile playing at his lips told me exactly who occupied his thoughts - the same woman who currently filled my own mind.

Lillian's POV

"Two words. Masquerade Ball!" Beatrice practically screamed, shoving a glossy invitation in my face as I sat beneath the ancient oak tree in the university quad. I'd been deeply engrossed in my textbook when my best friend appeared out of nowhere like an excitable tornado.
###Chapter 114

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s estate. The sun had barely risen, casting golden streaks across the sprawling gardens below. She tightened the silk robe around her, the fabric whispering against her skin.

Last night’s confrontation with Donovan still burned in her mind. His betrayal had been a knife to the heart, but she refused to let it break her. Not again.

A soft knock at the door pulled her from her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, turning to see Beatrice stride in, her usual bubbly demeanor replaced by a rare seriousness.

"You look like you haven’t slept," Beatrice observed, handing her a steaming cup of coffee.

Lillian accepted it gratefully, the warmth seeping into her fingers. "Couldn’t."

Beatrice sighed, leaning against the railing. "I heard what happened. Donovan’s a fool."

Lillian’s grip tightened around the cup. "He made his choice. Evelyn can have him."

But even as she said it, the lie tasted bitter. Donovan had been her first love, her fated mate. Letting go wasn’t as simple as she pretended.

Beatrice studied her for a long moment before speaking. "Sebastian’s called a pack meeting. He wants you there."

Lillian frowned. "Why?"

"Something about Alpha Harrison’s recent movements. Rumor has it he’s been sniffing around our borders again."

A chill ran down Lillian’s spine. Alpha Harrison was dangerous—a predator who saw weakness as an invitation. And right now, she felt anything but strong.

"I’ll be there," she said, squaring her shoulders.

Beatrice nodded approvingly. "Good. Because whether you believe it or not, you’re not alone in this."

As her friend left, Lillian turned back to the sunrise. The world was waking up, and so was she.

She had a pack to stand with.

And a war to face.

I snatched the glossy invitation from Beatrice's hands, my brows knitting together as I studied it. Of course, I knew about the Moonlight Gala—the most exclusive event in the werewolf elite's social calendar. Held every few years, it was the kind of affair where only the wealthiest and most influential packs mingled under crystal chandeliers. Celebrities, alphas, and high-ranking officials flew in from across the continent just to be seen there. And the catch? You had to be personally invited.

"Only the crème de la crème will be there," Beatrice sighed dreamily, her fingers tracing the embossed lettering.

I scoffed, tucking a loose strand of hair behind my ear. "And since when are we the crème de la crème?"

She shot me a knowing look. "Not we. You."

I exhaled sharply.

"Fine. Since when am I the crème de la crème?" I rephrased, crossing my arms.

Beatrice smirked, nudging me with her elbow. "Oh, I don't know—maybe since you started dating the most sought-after Lycan bachelor this side of the continent?"

I rolled my eyes so hard it almost hurt.

"That’s a bit of an exaggeration," I muttered. "Nathaniel and I have only been on, like, two dates. I wouldn’t exactly call us serious. Definitely not serious enough for him to drag me to this."

"You kissed," she reminded me, wiggling her eyebrows suggestively.

Yeah, we kissed. But it wasn’t the kind of kiss that made my knees buckle and my thoughts scatter—not like the one I shared with Sebastian. My cheeks warmed at the memory, and I bit my lip, praying Beatrice wouldn’t notice.

Too late.

"You’re blushing," she teased, grinning like the Cheshire cat. "Admit it. You like him."

I shrugged, feigning nonchalance. "He’s… alright, I guess."

"Alright?" She gasped dramatically. "Lillian, he’s gorgeous. Half the girls on campus would sell their souls for a chance to be in your shoes. If he invites you, you have to say yes."

I stuffed my books into my backpack with more force than necessary. "If he asks, then sure. But I’m not holding my breath."

Beatrice sighed, leaning back against the oak tree as she stared wistfully at the invitation. "I wish I had your luck."

Standing, I slung my bag over my shoulder and shot her a sarcastic smile. "Don’t worry. I’ll send you pictures."

"You better," she called after me as I walked away.

I shook my head, laughing under my breath. The idea of Nathaniel inviting me was absurd. And even if he did, would he actually go? I wasn’t about to voice those doubts to Beatrice, though. No need to crush her romantic fantasies.

After exchanging goodbyes, I started walking toward the front of the campus. I doubted Sebastian would pick me up for our tutoring session this afternoon, so I was about to call an Uber. But just as I stepped out, a sleek black luxury car pulled up in front of me, and I froze.

The window rolled down, revealing Victoria’s grinning face behind the wheel. Another car idled behind hers—undoubtedly the Gamma warriors.

"Get in, sweetheart. We’re going shopping!" she teased.

I arched a brow. "Didn’t we just go shopping?" I asked, sliding into the passenger seat.

She nodded, mischief dancing in her eyes. "Oh, but this is different."

Before I could even fasten my seatbelt, the car sped away from campus.

I glanced at the rearview mirror. "I see the Gammas are following us."

Victoria smirked. "She has no choice."

A deep male voice suddenly spoke from the backseat, making me shriek and whirl around. There, lounging casually, were Marcus Grayson and Julian Mercer. Both looked startled by my reaction.

Once my racing heart settled, Marcus offered a sheepish grin. "Didn’t mean to scare you."

"Probably should’ve warned you we were here," Julian added with a chuckle.

Victoria laughed, clearly enjoying my shock. "Not taking any chances this time."

Shaking my head, I relaxed into my seat, laughing along. "Alright, so what are we shopping for this time?"

Her grin widened, and my stomach twisted with nervous anticipation.

"We’re dressing you for the Gala!" she announced triumphantly. "It’s this weekend, and you’re going as Nathaniel’s date!"

###Chapter 115

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s estate. The sun had barely risen, casting a golden hue over the sprawling gardens below. She tightened the silk robe around her, the fabric whispering against her skin.

Last night had been… unexpected.

Her fingers traced the faint mark on her neck—Sebastian’s claiming bite. The memory of his lips against her skin sent a shiver down her spine. She had never imagined being bound to the Lycan chairman, especially not after Donovan’s betrayal.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

“Lillian?” Beatrice’s voice was muffled through the door. “Are you awake?”

Lillian turned, forcing a smile. “Come in.”

Beatrice pushed the door open, her eyes widening as she took in Lillian’s disheveled appearance. “Oh my goddess. You look like you’ve been—”

“Don’t say it,” Lillian groaned, rubbing her temples.

Beatrice smirked, tossing a small velvet box onto the bed. “Sebastian sent this for you. Said you’d need it after last night.”

Lillian hesitated before opening it. Inside lay a delicate silver bracelet, its surface engraved with intricate Lycan runes—protection, loyalty, and something else she couldn’t decipher.

“He marked you, didn’t he?” Beatrice whispered, her playful tone gone.

Lillian nodded, her throat tight. “I don’t know what this means, Bea. He’s not my fated mate. Donovan was, and look how that turned out.”

Beatrice squeezed her hand. “Fate’s a tricky thing. Maybe it’s giving you a second chance.”

Before Lillian could respond, a sharp knock echoed through the room. The door swung open, revealing Victoria, Sebastian’s daughter, her icy gaze locked onto Lillian.

“Father wants you downstairs,” she said coolly. “There’s been… a development.”

Lillian’s stomach twisted. “What kind of development?”

Victoria’s lips curled into a smirk. “Donovan’s here. And he’s not alone.”

The grand hall was eerily silent when Lillian descended the stairs. Sebastian stood at the center, his broad shoulders tense, his golden eyes burning with restrained fury. Across from him, Donovan lounged in a chair, his arm draped possessively around Evelyn’s waist.

But it wasn’t them that made Lillian freeze.

It was the woman beside them—Isabella Fontaine, Beatrice’s estranged sister, her crimson lips curved in a mocking smile.

“Ah, Lillian,” Isabella purred. “How lovely to see you again. Though I must say, you’ve certainly… upgraded.” Her gaze flicked to Sebastian, lingering a second too long.

Sebastian’s growl reverberated through the room. “Enough games. Why are you here?”

Donovan leaned forward, his smirk widening. “We’ve come to negotiate. You see, Isabella has information—information about your late wife’s death.”

Lillian’s breath hitched. Sebastian’s entire body went rigid.

“And in exchange?” Sebastian gritted out.

Donovan’s eyes gleamed. “We want Lillian back.”

The room erupted into chaos.

Lillian barely registered Beatrice’s gasp or Victoria’s furious snarl. All she could see was Sebastian’s face—the raw, unchecked rage twisting his features.

Then, his voice cut through the noise like a blade.

“Over my dead body.”

Isabella laughed, the sound like shattering glass. “Oh, Sebastian. That can be arranged.”

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the lavish Blackwood estate as Lillian stirred beneath silk sheets. Her body ached from the previous night's training session with Donovan, but the pain was nothing compared to the storm brewing in her heart.

Downstairs, the scent of freshly brewed coffee mingled with Lucien Dubois' signature croissants. Giselle Beaumont, the head maid, moved with practiced efficiency, arranging breakfast with military precision. "Miss Lillian," she called up the grand staircase, "Mr. Blackwood requests your presence in his study before your morning classes."

Lillian groaned, rolling out of bed. The marble floor was cold beneath her bare feet as she padded to the ensuite bathroom. The mirror reflected dark circles under her hazel eyes—evidence of another sleepless night spent replaying Donovan's cruel rejection.

She dressed quickly in a tailored blazer and knee-length skirt, the Blackwood Academy uniform clinging to her curves. As she descended the staircase, the portrait of Sebastian's late wife, Penelope, seemed to follow her with judgmental eyes.

Sebastian's study door stood ajar. Inside, the Lycan chairman sat behind his mahogany desk, his piercing blue gaze locked on a stack of documents. Oliver, his seven-year-old son, perched on the edge of the desk, swinging his legs.

"You're late," Sebastian remarked without looking up.

Lillian bristled. "Your summons wasn't exactly scheduled."

Oliver giggled, earning a warning glance from his father. "Beatrice called," Sebastian said, sliding a sealed envelope across the desk. "She claims it's urgent."

Lillian's fingers trembled as she broke the wax seal. The note contained three words in Beatrice's messy scrawl: He's watching you.

A chill ran down Lillian's spine. She crumpled the paper. "Where's Victoria?"

"With her fiancé," Sebastian said darkly. "Where she belongs."

The words hung between them like a challenge. Lillian's wolf stirred, sensing the unspoken tension. Before she could respond, Theodore Whitmore appeared in the doorway. "Sir, Alpha Harrison is here. He insists on speaking with Miss Lillian about... last night's incident."

Sebastian's knuckles whitened around his pen. "Tell him she's unavailable."

"But sir—"

"Now, Theodore."

As the butler retreated, Oliver tugged at Lillian's sleeve. "Don't be sad," he whispered. "Daddy's just grumpy before coffee."

Sebastian's glare could have melted steel. "Oliver. Go find Maria."

The boy scampered off as Lillian squared her shoulders. "What aren't you telling me?"

Sebastian stood abruptly, his imposing frame casting a shadow across the room. "Donovan's been spotted near campus with Evelyn. They're petitioning the council to nullify your mating bond."

The air left Lillian's lungs. "They can't do that."

"They can," Sebastian growled, "and they will—unless we prove he violated werewolf law first." He rounded the desk, stopping inches away. His cedarwood scent enveloped her. "Tell me everything about the night he rejected you. Every detail."

Lillian's pulse raced. That night was a blur of tequila and betrayal, but one memory stood clear: Donovan whispering to Evelyn in the club's VIP section while Cassandra spiked her drink.

As she opened her mouth to confess, the study window shattered.

A silver-tipped arrow embedded itself in the wall behind Sebastian's head.

Lillian's wolf surged forward as a familiar voice echoed from the gardens: "Did you miss me, sweetheart?"

Donovan stepped through the broken window, his golden eyes gleaming with malice. Behind him, Evelyn smirked, twirling another arrow between her fingers.

Sebastian shifted instantly, his massive black wolf knocking Lillian aside as Donovan lunged.

The last thing she saw before chaos erupted was Oliver's terrified face peeking through the doorway—and the glint of silver in Evelyn's palm as she took aim at the child.

"He didn't invite me to the Gala, Victoria," I told her, my brows knitting together in frustration.

Her grin only widened, as if she knew something I didn’t.

"Oh, but he will," she assured me, her voice dripping with confidence. "Trust me. He just asked my father for an invitation for you."

My chest constricted at her words, a mix of dread and something else I couldn’t quite name.



"He asked Sebastian?" I blurted, then immediately caught myself, remembering who was present. Clearing my throat, I tried again, more composed. "He asked your father?"

She nodded enthusiastically.

"Yeah, and he's getting you both tickets," she confirmed. "We'll be going together as a double date. You and Nathaniel, and Donovan."

Donovan.

Of course, I would be stuck with Donovan for the entire night. There was no escaping this, and my stomach twisted into knots at the thought. To make matters worse, Sebastian would likely be there too. So, not only would I have to endure Donovan and Nathaniel all evening, but I’d also have to face him. Could this night get any more unbearable?

"I don’t really do Galas, Victoria," I admitted, biting my lower lip. "I’ve never been to anything like this before."

"It’s so much fun," she insisted, her eyes sparkling with excitement. "You’re going to love it. And it’s not like you’ll be alone—I’ll be right there with you!"

Despite her infectious enthusiasm, I wasn’t convinced. Sighing, I leaned back in the seat and let her drive us the rest of the way into the city.

She parked outside an upscale boutique, and instead of waiting in the car, Gamma Julian and Beta Marcus followed us inside while the other Gammas took positions outside. Sebastian wasn’t taking any chances this time—not that I blamed him. His daughter had nearly been killed by rogues. Honestly, I was relieved for the extra security, even though I knew they were here for Victoria, not me.

"Miss Blackwood, lovely to see you again," the boutique clerk greeted as we stepped inside. She was a young woman with fiery red curls and striking emerald eyes. "Are you shopping for the Gala this weekend?"

"Hello, Felicity," Victoria replied smoothly. "Yes, I am. This is my friend, Lillian. She’ll be attending the Gala as well—as my cousin’s date."

Felicity’s eyes lit up at the mention of Nathaniel.

"Nathaniel is in town?"

"Yes," Victoria answered simply. "Would you be able to help her find the perfect gown?"

"Of course!" Felicity beamed. "We just received a few new dresses this morning. One, in particular, I think you’ll absolutely adore."

Victoria glided toward the exclusive rack of designer gowns tucked behind the boutique's cashier counter. With practiced elegance, she withdrew the most breathtaking silver dress Lillian had ever laid eyes on.

"Are those genuine diamonds?" Victoria breathed, her fingers tracing the delicate embellishments with reverence.

"Naturally," Felicity replied with a sparkling smile. "This is an original Genevieve Laurent creation. There's only one in existence. When I say it's new, I mean it's never even been breathed on before." Victoria's eyes gleamed as she stepped closer to inspect the gown's intricate craftsmanship.

"Genevieve Laurent's work is always impeccable. This is extraordinary. The diamonds add just the right amount of glamour, and the fabric is so light—it would be ideal for the Gala," she murmured.

"It's also the priciest piece in the store," Felicity cautioned.

"Cost has never been a concern," Victoria mused. She glanced at the price tag without so much as a blink before frowning at the size.

"It's a bit too large for me, though," she noted. "I wouldn't want it altered unless Genevieve herself could do it."

"I heard Genevieve Laurent will be attending the Gala this weekend, but she won't arrive until Friday evening," Felicity said, her brow furrowing. "Her schedule is packed, so I doubt she'd have time for alterations. But we do have excellent in-house designers who could—"

"I wouldn't trust anyone else to handle a Genevieve Laurent gown except Genevieve herself," Victoria interrupted, raising a hand.

She stepped back, then turned her gaze to Lillian.

"It looks like it might fit you, though. Why don't you try it on and see?" she suggested.

Lillian gaped at her in disbelief. Try on this exorbitant, one-of-a-kind masterpiece? Was Victoria insane?

"I... uh... I don't think that's a good idea," Lillian stammered.

"This dress deserves to be seen at the Gala, Lillian," Victoria insisted. "Please, just try it on."

With a reluctant sigh, Lillian finally gave in.

Felicity accompanied her to the dressing room, carefully helping her into the gown without disturbing its delicate structure. The moment the zipper glided up and the seams settled into place, Lillian felt transformed. The dress embraced her curves with effortless grace, as if it had been tailored just for her.

When she turned to face Felicity, the boutique clerk gasped, her face lighting up with awe.
###Chapter 116

The crisp morning air carried the faint scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s sprawling estate. The sun had barely risen, casting golden streaks across the sky, but her mind was already racing.

Last night’s confrontation with Donovan still burned in her memory—his cold dismissal, the way he had looked at her as if she were nothing. And Evelyn, standing smugly beside him, her fingers curled possessively around his arm. The rejection had stung more than she cared to admit.

A soft knock at the door pulled her from her thoughts.

"Lillian?" Beatrice’s voice was gentle, laced with concern. "You’ve been out here for ages. Are you okay?"

Lillian exhaled sharply, gripping the railing. "I’m fine. Just needed some air."

Beatrice stepped beside her, leaning against the railing. "Don’t lie to me. I know you’re not fine."

Lillian clenched her jaw. "What’s there to say? Donovan made his choice. He chose Evelyn. End of story."

Beatrice frowned. "But it’s not the end, Lil. You’re stronger than this. And honestly? He doesn’t deserve you."

Lillian scoffed. "Tell that to my wolf. She’s still convinced he’s our mate."

Beatrice hesitated before speaking again. "What about Sebastian?"

Lillian stiffened. "What about him?"

"You can’t tell me you haven’t noticed the way he looks at you."

Lillian’s pulse quickened. Sebastian Blackwood was an enigma—powerful, commanding, and dangerously attractive. But he was also her professor, her pack’s Lycan chairman. And then there was Oliver, his seven-year-old son, who had already wormed his way into her heart.

"It doesn’t matter," Lillian muttered. "I’m not getting involved with another man who’s already promised to someone else."

Beatrice arched a brow. "You mean Victoria?"

Lillian nodded. "She’s his fiancée, Beatrice. Or did you forget?"

Beatrice smirked. "Funny, because I heard they called off the engagement last night."

Lillian’s breath hitched. "What?"

"Marcus told me. Apparently, Sebastian ended things. Something about not being able to commit to a woman he doesn’t love."

Lillian’s heart pounded. Was it possible? Had Sebastian really broken things off with Victoria?

Before she could process the revelation, her phone buzzed. A message from an unknown number lit up the screen:

"Meet me at the old oak tree in an hour. We need to talk. —D."

Lillian’s stomach twisted. Donovan.

Beatrice peered over her shoulder. "What is it?"

Lillian swallowed hard. "Donovan wants to meet."

Beatrice’s eyes narrowed. "Don’t go. He’s just playing games."

But Lillian’s wolf stirred, restless. "What if he has a reason?"

"Or what if it’s a trap?" Beatrice countered.

Lillian hesitated, then squared her shoulders. "I have to know."

Beatrice sighed. "Fine. But I’m coming with you."

Lillian shook her head. "No. This is something I need to do alone."

As she turned to leave, Beatrice grabbed her wrist. "Be careful, Lil. If anything feels off, run."

Lillian nodded, determination hardening her gaze. Whatever Donovan wanted, she would face it head-on.

But as she stepped into the forest, a familiar scent wrapped around her—dark, intoxicating, unmistakably Sebastian’s.

Her breath caught.

He was here.

And he was watching.

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains, stirring Lillian awake. She stretched lazily, her muscles still sore from yesterday’s intense training session. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted into her room, a clear sign that Sophia, the ever-efficient maid, was already up and preparing breakfast.

Lillian’s phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Beatrice lit up the screen:

"Girl, you won’t believe what just happened! Meet me at the café in 20. It’s urgent!"

Frowning, Lillian quickly dressed in a simple yet stylish outfit—a fitted blouse and dark jeans—before heading downstairs. The mansion was unusually quiet, save for the faint clinking of silverware in the dining room.

Sebastian sat at the head of the table, engrossed in a stack of documents. His sharp eyes flicked up as she entered. "Morning," he murmured, his deep voice sending an involuntary shiver down her spine.

"Morning," she replied, pouring herself a cup of coffee. "Where’s Oliver?"

"Already at school. Victoria took him early."

Lillian nodded, sipping her coffee. The rich, bitter taste grounded her. She hesitated before speaking again. "I’m meeting Beatrice. She sounded… frantic."

Sebastian’s expression darkened slightly. "Be careful. Donovan’s been spotted near campus."

Her grip tightened around the mug. "I can handle him."

Sebastian’s lips twitched, almost like a smirk. "I know you can. But humor me—take Marcus with you."

She rolled her eyes but didn’t argue. Marcus, Sebastian’s ever-loyal Beta, was more than capable.

The café was bustling with students, the air thick with the aroma of espresso and pastries. Beatrice waved her over from a corner booth, her face flushed with excitement.

"You look like you’re about to explode," Lillian remarked, sliding into the seat across from her.

Beatrice leaned in, lowering her voice. "Okay, so remember Evelyn? Donovan’s new mate?"

Lillian’s stomach twisted. "What about her?"

"She was at a club last night—completely wasted. And guess who she was with?"

Lillian’s pulse spiked. "Donovan?"

"Worse." Beatrice’s eyes gleamed. "Dominic Reeves."

Lillian blinked. "Walter’s subordinate? The future Beta?"

Beatrice nodded vigorously. "And get this—they were arguing. Like, full-on screaming match. Something about a deal gone wrong."

Lillian’s mind raced. If Dominic was involved, this wasn’t just some petty drama. It was pack business.

Before she could respond, her phone buzzed again. An unknown number.

"Meet me at the old library. Alone. We need to talk.—D."

Her breath hitched. Donovan.

Beatrice frowned. "What’s wrong?"

Lillian pocketed her phone, forcing a smile. "Nothing. Just… pack stuff. I’ll catch up with you later."

As she stood, Marcus materialized beside her, his expression unreadable. "Problem?"

Lillian hesitated. "Change of plans. I need to make a quick stop."

Marcus’s jaw tightened. "Where?"

She met his gaze squarely. "Somewhere I have to go alone."

The air between them crackled with tension. Finally, Marcus exhaled sharply. "Fine. But if you’re not back in an hour, I’m coming after you."

Lillian smirked. "Wouldn’t expect anything less."

With that, she strode out of the café, her heart pounding. Whatever Donovan wanted, it couldn’t be good. But she was done running.

This time, she would be the one controlling the game.

"It's breathtaking," Victoria gasped, her eyes sparkling as she took me in.

I glanced down at the dress, suddenly self-conscious. "You don't think it's too extravagant?" I asked hesitantly.

"Oh, heavens no!" She waved a hand dismissively. "Not for the Gala. Lillian, you have to show Beatrice." She flung open the dressing room door, and I stepped into the soft glow of the boutique lights.

Beatrice stood nearby, flipping through a rack of new arrivals, but the moment she heard me step out, she turned—and froze. Her lips parted in shock, her eyes widening as they swept over me.

"Wow," she breathed. "You look... incredible." There was a flicker of something in her gaze—something I couldn't quite place—but it vanished as quickly as it appeared. For a second, I thought it might have been envy, but I dismissed the idea immediately. Beatrice was effortlessly stunning; there was no way she’d be jealous of me.

"We have to get you that dress," Victoria declared. "Nathaniel is going to lose his mind when he sees you." She grinned mischievously. "Now, I'm off to find my own. I’ll come find you when I’m done." With that, she disappeared into the sea of gowns.

I turned toward the full-length mirror beside me, and my breath caught. The dress clung to my curves in all the right places, the delicate fabric shimmering under the lights. I barely recognized myself—elegant, radiant, beautiful.

Beatrice would freak if she saw me like this.

Smiling to myself, I turned to head back to the dressing room—only to collide with someone.

"Ugh, watch where you're going," a sharp, familiar voice snapped.

I looked up to find Penelope glaring down at me, arms crossed over her chest, her lips curled in distaste. We’d only met once before—when I’d dined with Sebastian to discuss my contract—and it hadn’t been pleasant.

Her gaze dropped to the dress I wore, and she took a deliberate step back, studying it with narrowed eyes. Then, a slow, calculating smile spread across her face.

"That dress is perfect. I’ll take it," she announced, snapping her fingers at Felicity.

Felicity hesitated, glancing between us awkwardly. "I’m sorry, Miss Baldwin, but this dress has already been claimed."

Penelope’s smile twisted into a sneer. "I’m Penelope Baldwin, heiress to the Baldwin fortune. I get whatever I want—and I want that dress." She leaned in, voice dropping to a venomous whisper. "I could ruin you with a single phone call."

Felicity paled, biting her lip nervously. Before she could respond, I stepped forward.

"As you can see, Miss Baldwin," I said coolly, "the dress is already mine."

Her eyes flashed with fury, but I held her gaze, refusing to back down.

This wasn’t just a dress.

It was a statement.

Penelope's lips curled into a mocking smirk as she looked Lillian up and down, her eyes dripping with disdain.

"Honestly, do you really think you can pull off a dress like this?" she sneered, crossing her arms over her chest. "Don’t embarrass yourself. Here—I’ll pay you to take it off." She reached into her purse, pulling out a sleek checkbook and a gold-plated pen.

"How much do you want? A thousand?" When Lillian didn’t respond, just staring at her in disbelief, Penelope scoffed. "Fine. Five thousand, then. That should be more than enough for someone like you."

Lillian clenched her jaw. "I’m not giving you this dress."

Penelope’s eyes narrowed into venomous slits. "This gown deserves someone with real elegance. Clearly, that’s not you." Her gaze lingered on Lillian’s face, suspicion flickering in her eyes. "Wait… you look familiar. Have we met before?"

Then, realization struck.

"Oh, right," she drawled, a cruel laugh escaping her lips. "You’re that desperate little nobody who won’t stop clinging to Sebastian. Let me save you the trouble—he doesn’t do relationships. You were just a one-night distraction. Nothing more." She leaned in, her voice dripping with malice. "But my sister? That’s a different story. And after the Gala tonight, things are going to change."

Lillian’s chest tightened, though she refused to let the words wound her.

"Take. It. Off," Penelope demanded, her tone icy.

Just then, Victoria stepped forward, her presence sharp and commanding.

"Aunt Penelope?"

Penelope froze, her face draining of color. "V-Victoria? What are you doing here?"

Victoria’s eyes darkened. "I’m helping my friend Lillian find a dress for the Gala." She tilted her head, voice dangerously soft. "Did I just hear you say you’re planning to seduce my father?"

###Chapter 117

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s estate. The sun had barely risen, casting a golden hue over the sprawling gardens below. She tightened the silk robe around her, the fabric whispering against her skin.

Last night had been… unexpected.

Her fingers traced the faint mark on her neck—Sebastian’s claiming bite. The memory of his lips, his hands, his possessive growl sent a shiver down her spine. She had never imagined their bond would deepen so quickly, especially not after everything with Donovan.

A soft knock at the door pulled her from her thoughts.

“Lillian?” Beatrice’s voice was muffled through the wood. “Are you awake?”

Lillian sighed, turning away from the view. “Come in.”

The door creaked open, revealing Beatrice’s wide-eyed expression. She clutched a steaming cup of tea, her gaze darting from Lillian’s disheveled hair to the rumpled sheets behind her.

“So,” Beatrice drawled, a smirk tugging at her lips. “You and the Lycan Chairman, huh?”

Lillian groaned, burying her face in her hands. “It’s not what it looks like.”

“Oh, please.” Beatrice plopped onto the bed, handing her the tea. “The entire pack heard his declaration last night. ‘Mine.’ Very dramatic. Very… possessive.”

Lillian’s cheeks burned. She took a sip of the tea, the warmth doing little to soothe her nerves. “It’s complicated.”

“Complicated?” Beatrice snorted. “You’re his fated mate, Lil. That’s about as straightforward as it gets.”

Lillian opened her mouth to argue when another knock interrupted them. This time, it was Theodore Whitmore, Sebastian’s ever-composed butler.

“Miss Lillian,” he said smoothly, bowing slightly. “Alpha Blackwood requests your presence in his study.”

Beatrice’s eyebrows shot up. “Ooh, summoned by the big bad wolf himself.”

Lillian shot her a glare before nodding at Theodore. “I’ll be right there.”

As the butler retreated, Beatrice leaned in, lowering her voice. “You know what this is about, right?”

Lillian hesitated. “His claim?”

“No,” Beatrice said, her expression turning serious. “The council. They’ve been questioning his judgment ever since he took you in. If they find out he’s marked you without their approval…”

Lillian’s stomach twisted. She hadn’t considered the political ramifications. Sebastian was already under scrutiny for protecting her—a rogue werewolf with a target on her back.

“I have to go,” she murmured, setting the tea aside.

Beatrice caught her wrist. “Be careful, Lil. The game’s changed now.”

Lillian nodded, squaring her shoulders as she stepped into the hallway. The walls of the estate seemed to loom taller, the air heavier with unspoken tension.

She had no idea what awaited her in Sebastian’s study. But one thing was certain—nothing would ever be the same again.


"You know your father and I have a long history," Penelope said, forcing an awkward laugh.

Victoria nodded thoughtfully.

"Yes, his fated mate—my mother—was your sister," Victoria replied coolly. "Unfortunately, my father isn’t exactly in the market for dating right now."

Penelope pressed her crimson lips into a thin line, her sharp gaze narrowing at Victoria. Even she knew better than to say anything reckless in front of Sebastian Blackwood’s daughter.

"Of course, we’re just friends," Penelope said through a tight, insincere smile. "Don’t read too much into it." Her eyes flicked toward me, raking over my outfit with disdain before curling her lip. "That dress is far too tacky for my taste. I’ll find something else," she muttered, spinning on her heel and strutting away.

I exhaled sharply, unaware I’d been holding my breath. The moment Penelope was out of sight, Victoria’s polite mask dropped.

"I loathe that woman," she muttered under her breath.

Surprised by her bluntness, I relaxed instantly, a soft laugh escaping me. Victoria nudged me toward the changing room with a playful smirk. "Go change. We’ll grab lunch before heading back. I know you have tutoring later."

"Sounds perfect," I agreed.

As much as I adored the dress, slipping back into my usual clothes was a relief. Felicity swiftly took the gown and packaged it for me while Victoria selected a stunning dress for herself. At the counter, Felicity rang up our purchases.

"For Lillian, the dress is three million. For Victoria, one million," she announced, glancing up.

My jaw dropped. Three million? For one dress? I hadn’t expected such an exorbitant price.

Without hesitation, Victoria pulled out a sleek black card and handed it over. "Charge both to this," she said, already checking her phone.

I gaped at her, stunned by how casually she spent that kind of money. Felicity, however, looked thrilled as she processed the payment. Once approved, she handed the receipt and card back to Victoria before carefully passing us each an elegant box.

Marcus and Julian—who had been lingering so discreetly in the background I’d nearly forgotten they were there—stepped forward to take them from us.

I flashed Marcus a grateful smile, and he nodded in acknowledgment.

Thankfully, we left the boutique without another encounter with Penelope and headed to lunch. This time, we invited Marcus and Julian to join us—I didn’t want to be alone for even a second.

After lunch, we returned to the Blackwood Villa so I could tutor Oliver.

"Mind if I steal you away for a moment?" Nathaniel asked during the combat training session.

Oliver was engrossed in perfecting his stance, barely noticing our exchange, so I nodded. Nathaniel slipped his arm through mine, guiding me a short distance away before stopping to face me.

"So, I don’t know if you’ve heard," he began, his words tumbling out in a rush, "but the masquerade gala is this weekend." My cheeks warmed, and I bit my lip, nodding. "I managed to get a couple of tickets," he continued, his gaze hopeful. "I was wondering… would you be my date?"

A strange urge to decline flickered through me, but the memory of the extravagant three-million-dollar gown hanging in my closet silenced it.

"I’d love to," I replied, forcing a smile. "It sounds like fun." His shoulders relaxed, and he exhaled in relief.

"Perfect. I’ll pick you up at eight on Saturday," he said, then leaned in to press a soft kiss to my cheek.

I nodded. "I’ll see you then."

As he walked away, I noticed the extra spring in his step. A pang of guilt twisted in my chest—I just hoped I wouldn’t be the one to wipe that smile away.

Third Person POV

Saturday arrived swiftly, and Victoria spent most of the day preparing for the gala. Excitement thrummed through her at the thought of showcasing her dazzling gown and having her striking fiancé, Donovan, on her arm. He had promised to pick her up at eight that evening before meeting Nathaniel and Lillian. They had arranged to share a limousine for the event, and the idea thrilled her beyond measure.

Her father, Sebastian, would also be attending, though he had opted to go alone. Victoria had urged him to bring a companion, but he’d refused. Truthfully, she didn’t want him arriving unattended—not when Penelope would be there, single and undoubtedly hoping to catch Sebastian’s eye. The thought of her aunt worming her way back into their family made her skin crawl. She couldn’t stand Penelope and wanted her as far from them as possible.

###Chapter 118

The morning sun cast golden rays through the sheer curtains of Lillian's bedroom, painting delicate patterns across the silk sheets. She stretched lazily, her muscles still aching from yesterday's intense training session with Professor Montclair. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted up from the kitchen, mingling with the crisp autumn air that seeped through the slightly ajar window.

Downstairs, Sebastian Blackwood was already seated at the dining table, his sharp gaze scanning through a stack of documents. Oliver, his seven-year-old son, was enthusiastically recounting his latest adventure at school, his tiny hands gesturing wildly as he spoke.

"Papa, guess what? I beat Dominic in the race today!" Oliver declared proudly, his eyes sparkling with triumph.

Sebastian's lips curved into a rare smile. "That's my boy," he murmured, ruffling Oliver's hair affectionately.

Lillian descended the stairs, her bare feet padding softly against the polished wood. She hesitated at the doorway, watching the tender moment between father and son. A pang of longing shot through her—she had never known such warmth growing up.

Sebastian sensed her presence immediately, his piercing gaze lifting to meet hers. "Good morning, Lillian," he said, his deep voice smooth as velvet.

"Morning," she replied, forcing a small smile.

Oliver turned in his seat, beaming at her. "Lillian! You have to come see the drawing I made for you!"

Before she could respond, the front door burst open, and Victoria stormed in, her usually composed demeanor shattered. Her face was flushed, her breathing ragged.

"Father," she gasped, clutching a crumpled letter in her trembling hands. "It's Donovan. He's—he's demanding the engagement proceed immediately, or he'll expose everything."

The air in the room turned frigid. Sebastian's expression darkened, his grip tightening around his coffee cup. Lillian's heart pounded—Donovan's threats were escalating, and she knew he wouldn't stop until he got what he wanted.

But what exactly did he want?

And more importantly—what was Sebastian willing to do to stop him?

The tension was suffocating, the unspoken questions hanging heavily between them.

Then, a sharp knock at the door shattered the silence.

Marcus Grayson, Sebastian's beta, stepped inside, his face grim. "Alpha, we have a problem. The Darkmoon pack has crossed our borders."

Sebastian's eyes flashed dangerously. "Prepare the warriors," he ordered, rising from his seat.

Lillian swallowed hard. War was coming.

And she was right in the middle of it.

Victoria knew her father was sharp enough to see through Penelope's schemes, so she tried not to worry too much.

"How do I look?" Nathaniel asked, leaning casually against the doorframe of Victoria's bedroom. She turned to face him, and her expression brightened instantly. He looked dashing in his tailored suit, the silver mask accentuating his sharp features and complementing his ensemble perfectly. It made her grin wider.

"Like my father," she admitted with a soft laugh. "Did you get a haircut?"

He nodded, running his fingers through his freshly trimmed hair. "Yeah. I wanted to clean up for tonight, so I thought a fresh cut would be nice."

"Well, you look incredibly handsome, Nathaniel. Lillian is one lucky woman," Victoria remarked thoughtfully.

Nathaniel shrugged, his gaze dropping to the floor for a brief moment. "If anything, I'm the lucky one," he murmured. "I really like her, Victoria. I think... I'm going to ask her to be my girlfriend tonight."

Victoria's smile faltered slightly. "Don't you think it's too soon?"

His frown mirrored hers. "I know it might seem that way, but I just... I feel like she's the one for me," he confessed, his voice low but certain.

"But she's not your fated mate," Victoria pointed out gently.

Nathaniel arched a brow. "And Donovan isn't yours. Yet you're still marrying him because you know he's right for you."

The reminder made Victoria blush, and she bit her lower lip. "You're right," she conceded. "I just don’t want anyone getting hurt."

"I would never hurt her," Nathaniel said firmly. "If she doesn’t want to move to France with me, then I’ll consider staying here permanently. I could start my own business, build a new life here."

Victoria's eyes widened. "You'd do that for her? After just a few dates?"

A faint pink tinged his cheeks. "I think I might be falling in love with her," he admitted. "Those few dates were enough to make me sure. Tonight, I’ll find out if she feels the same, and we’ll go from there."

Victoria’s expression softened, and she stepped forward to embrace him. "I’m so happy for you, Nathaniel," she whispered.

Lillian stepped back and adjusted Nathaniel's mask on his face.

"Do we have more masks?" she inquired.

He nodded.

"Yes, one of the maids brought in an entire box of them," he replied.

She gave a small nod and moved past him, leaving her room behind. Descending the grand staircase, she reached the foyer where the box of masks sat. Sebastian stood there, scrutinizing them with his usual stern expression—ironic, given how much the silver mask resembled Nathaniel's. The resemblance between them was uncanny, a testament to their shared bloodline.

"Choosing a mask?" Lillian asked him.

He glanced up at her and nodded.

"Not sure which one complements my suit best," he mused, turning each mask over in his hands.

Her gaze swept over the box until she spotted one nearly identical to Nathaniel's. "Nathaniel went with this silver one," she said, lifting it to Sebastian's face. "It pairs well with the dark blue of your suit."

Sebastian studied his reflection for a moment before securing the mask over his eyes. The transformation was startling—he could have been Nathaniel’s twin. Lillian blinked rapidly, momentarily disoriented.

"Alright," Sebastian finally conceded. "This one will do."

Lillian nodded and selected a mask that matched her gown. Just then, Theodore opened the front door, and Donovan strode into the foyer, a bouquet of roses in hand and a charming smile on his lips.

Lillian gasped at the flowers, pressing a soft kiss to his cheek as he murmured about how breathtaking she looked. Sebastian removed his mask, tucking it into his pocket just as Nathaniel descended the stairs.

"I sent a car for Beatrice. Has she arrived yet?" Nathaniel asked.

Theodore peeked outside. "She just pulled up," he announced.

Nathaniel’s breath hitched as he waited for Beatrice to step inside. Moments later, she appeared in the doorway, radiant. Her hair cascaded in perfect waves, half-up, half-down, framing her face like a portrait. The gown she wore was nothing short of a masterpiece, hugging her curves as though crafted just for her. She was ethereal, breathtaking—every eye in the room locked onto her.

An awkward smile touched her lips as she took in the silent admiration around her. Donovan stood with his arm around Lillian, yet his jaw nearly dropped at the sight of Beatrice.

Nathaniel’s eyes burned with unmistakable admiration, making her cheeks flush. But it wasn’t their reactions that held her attention—it was Sebastian’s. He stood apart from the others, his gaze unwavering, drinking her in with an intensity that sent a shiver down her spine.

There was something unsettling in his gaze that Lillian couldn't quite decipher—a shadow lurking beneath the surface, dark and unreadable. His eyes, usually so sharp and calculating, were now clouded with an emotion that sent a shiver down her spine. It wasn't just desire—it was something deeper, something possessive, almost predatory.

The way Donovan looked at her now was nothing like the cold indifference he'd shown when they'd first met. No, this was different. This was raw.

Lillian swallowed hard, her pulse quickening. She knew she should step back, put distance between them, but her feet refused to move. The air between them crackled with tension, thick and suffocating.

Was this what it felt like to be hunted?

She had seen that look before—in the eyes of wolves stalking their prey. But she had never expected to see it directed at her. Not by him.

Not after everything.

Her breath hitched as Donovan took a slow step forward, his lips curling into a smirk that didn’t reach his eyes.

"Running already?" he murmured, his voice low and rough.

Lillian clenched her fists, forcing herself to hold her ground.

She wouldn’t let him see her fear.


###Chapter 119

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse suite. Lillian stretched lazily in the king-sized bed, the silk sheets cool against her bare skin. The scent of freshly brewed coffee and warm croissants drifted in from the adjoining dining area, making her stomach growl.

She turned her head to find Sebastian already dressed in a tailored navy suit, his dark hair slightly tousled from sleep. He was scrolling through messages on his phone, his sharp jawline set in concentration.

"Morning," Lillian murmured, her voice still thick with sleep.

Sebastian glanced up, his piercing silver eyes softening as they landed on her. "Good morning, little wolf." He set his phone aside and leaned down, pressing a lingering kiss to her forehead. "Sleep well?"

"Mm. Too well." She smiled, stretching again before sitting up. The events of last night—the gala, the whispered threats from Donovan, the way Sebastian had pulled her possessively against him—flashed through her mind.

Sebastian’s expression darkened as if reading her thoughts. "Donovan won’t be a problem for long."

Lillian bit her lip. "He’s still your daughter’s fiancé."

"For now." His tone was icy, promising retribution.

A knock at the door interrupted them. "Alpha, your car is ready," Marcus Grayson’s deep voice called from the other side.

Sebastian straightened, adjusting his cufflinks. "We’ll discuss this later. For now, I have a meeting with Alpha Harrison."

Lillian frowned. "The one who tried to—"

"Yes." His jaw clenched. "And he’ll regret it."

She shivered at the lethal promise in his voice.

Sebastian turned back to her, his gaze softening again. "Stay here today. Rest. I’ll have Sophia bring you breakfast."

Lillian nodded, though unease prickled at her. Something felt off.

As Sebastian left, she reached for her phone, scrolling through messages. One from Beatrice stood out:

"Lil, we need to talk. Meet me at the café. It’s urgent."

Lillian’s pulse quickened. Beatrice never used the word urgent lightly.

She dressed quickly, opting for a simple sundress and sandals. Just as she was about to leave, Sophia Delacroix entered with a tray of food.

"Miss Lillian, the Alpha insisted you eat before—"

"I’ll eat later," Lillian interrupted, grabbing a croissant. "Tell Sebastian I had to meet Beatrice."

Sophia hesitated but nodded.

The moment Lillian stepped outside, the hairs on the back of her neck rose.

Someone was watching her.

She scanned the street, her werewolf senses on high alert. A shadow moved in the alley across from the building—too fast for a human.

Lillian’s grip tightened on her phone.

Donovan?

Or someone worse?

She quickened her pace, heart pounding. Whatever Beatrice needed to tell her, it couldn’t wait.

And neither could the danger stalking her.

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse suite, illuminating the scattered papers on his desk. His fingers drummed impatiently against the polished mahogany surface, his wolf restless beneath his skin.

Lillian had been avoiding him since their last argument—the one where he’d foolishly let his temper get the better of him. He shouldn’t have snapped at her, shouldn’t have let his frustration over the pack’s politics bleed into their conversation. But the moment she’d mentioned Donovan’s name, something inside him had snapped.

A sharp knock at the door interrupted his brooding.

“Enter,” he growled.

The door swung open to reveal Marcus Grayson, his Beta, looking unusually tense. “Alpha, we have a situation.”

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. “What now?”

“Donovan’s been spotted near the university. He was seen talking to Evelyn near the west gate.”

A low, dangerous rumble escaped Sebastian’s throat. His claws lengthened, digging into the arms of his chair. “And Lillian?”

Marcus hesitated. “She was there. She saw them.”

Sebastian was out of his seat before the words fully registered. His wolf surged forward, demanding action. If Donovan thought he could slink back into Lillian’s life, he was sorely mistaken.

“Gather the guards,” Sebastian ordered, already striding toward the door. “I want eyes on her at all times.”

Marcus nodded sharply. “Already done. But, Alpha—”

Sebastian paused, his hand gripping the doorframe. “But what?”

“She left campus in a hurry. Looked upset. Beatrice tried to follow, but Lillian took off before she could catch up.”

Sebastian’s blood ran cold. If Donovan had said something to her—if he’d dared to hurt her again—

“Find her,” he commanded, his voice a lethal whisper. “Now.”

Lillian didn’t know where she was going.

Her feet carried her blindly through the city streets, her pulse roaring in her ears. The sight of Donovan and Evelyn together—laughing, touching—had sent a sharp, unexpected pain through her chest.

Why did it still hurt?

She had Sebastian now. She had a mate who cared for her, who protected her, who—

Who you just ran away from without a word.

Guilt twisted in her gut. She should’ve stayed. Should’ve talked to him. But the moment she’d seen Donovan’s smug face, something inside her had shattered.

A familiar scent hit her nostrils—warm spice and cedarwood.

Sebastian.

She spun around, her breath catching as she found him standing mere feet away, his golden eyes blazing with barely restrained fury.

“Running away again?” His voice was rough, edged with something raw.

Lillian swallowed hard. “I wasn’t running. I just—needed air.”

Sebastian closed the distance between them in two strides, his hands gripping her shoulders. “Don’t lie to me.”

She flinched at the intensity in his gaze. “I saw Donovan.”

His grip tightened imperceptibly. “I know.”

“He was with Evelyn.”

Sebastian’s jaw clenched. “And?”

Lillian exhaled shakily. “And nothing. It shouldn’t matter. But it does.”

For a long moment, Sebastian said nothing. Then, with a growl, he pulled her against his chest, his arms wrapping around her in a possessive embrace.

“It matters,” he murmured against her hair, “because you still care. But he’s not your mate anymore. I am.”

Lillian buried her face in his shirt, breathing him in. “I know.”

Sebastian tilted her chin up, his gaze fierce. “Then prove it.”

And before she could respond, his lips crashed down on hers in a kiss that left no room for doubt—no room for anyone else.

Not even Donovan.

The Gala was even more breathtaking than I had envisioned—and impossibly crowded. The moment our limousine rolled up to the grand entrance, where a line of elegantly dressed guests waited, the paparazzi swarmed us like vultures. Camera flashes exploded in my face, nearly blinding me, and Nathaniel had to grip my hand tightly to guide me through the chaos.

Reporters shouted questions about Victoria’s gown, but when they caught sight of me, one particularly sharp-eyed journalist recognized Genevieve Laurent’s signature design and immediately turned their attention to me.

I opened my mouth, ready to answer, but Victoria swiftly intervened.

"Don’t engage with them," she murmured under her breath, her grip on my arm firm. "They’ll twist your words into something scandalous before you can blink."

I pressed my lips together and nodded, swallowing my response.

We approached the security checkpoint, where Donovan presented the invitations for himself and Victoria. The guard scrutinized them for a moment before stepping aside with a respectful nod.

Nathaniel handed over our tickets next, and after a brief inspection, the guard motioned for us to proceed. With a charming smile, Nathaniel offered me his arm, and I looped mine through his, my pulse fluttering at the warmth of his touch.

Inside, the ballroom was a dazzling spectacle—crystal chandeliers cast shimmering light over masked guests in glittering gowns and tailored suits. The music swelled, a rich symphony that vibrated through the floor. I couldn’t recognize a single face behind the elaborate masks, though I doubted I’d know anyone even without them.

"This place is… incredible," I breathed, craning my neck to watch the ribbons of light dancing across the vaulted ceiling. "Like something out of a dream."

"First time at a Gala?" Nathaniel asked, arching a brow in amusement.

I flushed. "Is it that obvious?"

His lips quirked. "Guess we’re both new to this, then."

I blinked in surprise. "You’ve never been to one either?"

He shrugged, the movement effortlessly casual. "Not an American one. I’ve attended a few in France, but nothing quite this… extravagant." His gaze flicked over the opulent surroundings before returning to me. "Work keeps me too busy for social events most of the time."

"So, what exactly are we supposed to do here besides stand around looking decorative?" I teased.

Nathaniel smirked. "We drink expensive champagne and pretend to enjoy small talk with the elite."

I laughed, and his grin widened.

"Speaking of drinks," he said smoothly, "can I get you something?"

"Please," I said. "Anything but champagne."

His brows lifted. "Not a fan?"

I wrinkled my nose. "Too bubbly. Makes me sneeze."

Nathaniel chuckled, the sound low and warm. "Noted. I’ll find you something better."

As he disappeared into the crowd, I exhaled, my fingers brushing the delicate fabric of my gown. The night had only just begun—and already, it felt like anything could happen.

"Not exactly," I replied, my voice barely above a whisper.

He gave a slow, knowing nod before flashing me a mischievous grin. "I'll be sure to keep that in mind," he murmured, winking before turning on his heel and striding toward the bar.

Victoria materialized beside me, looping her arm through mine with practiced ease. "There you are, Lillian," she chimed, her tone dripping with false sweetness. "Come, we have a reserved table."

My gaze flickered past her, landing on Donovan already seated at the table, his piercing eyes locked onto me. A bitter taste flooded my mouth as I forced my legs to move, trailing behind Victoria like a reluctant shadow.

This was going to be an excruciatingly long night.

Sebastian's POV

"Mr. Blackwood, how generous will your donation be this year?"
"Mr. Blackwood, who tailored your suit?"
"Are you accompanied by anyone special tonight?"

The paparazzi's questions blurred into white noise as I strode past them, my expression unreadable. The security guard barely glanced at me before stepping aside, well aware of who I was.

Pausing just inside, I reached into my pocket and retrieved my mask, securing it over my face before continuing into the gala.

These events were nothing short of tedious, but as the primary benefactor, my presence was non-negotiable. The staff scurried about, balancing trays of champagne and hors d'oeuvres while guests in their finest attire mingled beneath the glittering chandeliers.

Women preened as I passed, their lashes fluttering, their postures deliberately accentuating their curves. I ignored them all, my focus elsewhere.

The bar was my first stop—until I spotted Nathaniel ordering drinks. If he was here, then Lillian was too.

Instinctively, my eyes found her.

She sat stiffly at a table with Donovan and Victoria, looking as though she'd rather be anywhere else. Victoria was chattering away, oblivious to Lillian's discomfort, while Donovan’s gaze never wavered from her.

A surge of irritation burned through me. His attention should be reserved for my daughter—not her.

Was I really going to have to remind him of that again?

And what was Lillian thinking? Wearing that dress, knowing full well this place would be crawling with unmated males—and her ex-fated mate, no less. It was almost as if she wanted his eyes on her.

"Uncle?" Nathaniel's voice snapped me back to reality.

I turned my sharp gaze on him, offering nothing more than a curt nod.

He hesitated, then smiled tentatively. "I'm glad you came. I hope you don’t mind that I brought Lillian. I know you have reservations about staff relationships, but she’s different. I really like her. I might even be..." He swallowed. "In love with her."

The words hit me like ice water.

Falling Hard?

Could Lillian truly be falling for someone like Nathaniel? The thought sent a shiver down her spine.

Nathaniel had a reputation—one that preceded him like a shadow. He fell fast, fell hard, but his affections were as fleeting as summer storms. One moment he was whispering sweet nothings, the next, his attention had already wandered to someone new.

And yet...

Lillian's pulse betrayed her, quickening at the mere memory of his stupid, charming grin.

Pathetic.

She clenched her fists, nails biting into her palms. How could she—a girl who prided herself on her sharp instincts—be so blind? Falling for a man who treated love like a revolving door?

But the heart, it seemed, had a will of its own.

And hers?

Hers was a traitor.
###Chapter 120 

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the lavish bedroom as Lillian stirred beneath the silk sheets. Her body ached from the previous night’s events—Donovan’s betrayal still fresh in her mind, the sting of his rejection lingering like a phantom wound.

She rolled onto her side, her gaze landing on the empty space beside her. The scent of Sebastian Blackwood still clung faintly to the pillows, a reminder of the unexpected comfort he had offered.

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, her voice hoarse from exhaustion.

The door creaked open, revealing Beatrice, her best friend, balancing a tray of steaming coffee and pastries. "Rise and shine, sleeping beauty," she teased, setting the tray on the bedside table. "You look like you wrestled a bear."

Lillian groaned, rubbing her temples. "Feels like it, too."

Beatrice smirked, perching on the edge of the bed. "Well, you’re the talk of the pack. Everyone’s buzzing about how you stood up to Donovan last night."

Lillian scoffed, reaching for the coffee. "Yeah, real heroic. Standing there like a fool while he flaunted Evelyn in front of me."

Beatrice’s expression softened. "You’re not a fool. He’s the idiot for not seeing what he lost."

Lillian took a slow sip, the bitter warmth grounding her. "Doesn’t matter now. I just need to focus on finishing school and getting out of here."

A mischievous glint sparked in Beatrice’s eyes. "Or… you could focus on a certain Lycan chairman who seems very interested in you."

Lillian nearly choked on her coffee. "Sebastian? Don’t be ridiculous. He’s just being… polite."

Beatrice arched a brow. "Since when do Lycan alphas play nursemaid to heartbroken werewolves?"

Before Lillian could retort, her phone buzzed. A message from an unknown number flashed on the screen:

"Meet me at the old oak tree at noon. We need to talk. – D."

Her stomach twisted. Donovan.

Beatrice snatched the phone, her lips curling in disgust. "Oh hell no. Delete it."

Lillian hesitated, her fingers hovering over the screen.

A second message followed:

"It’s about your mother."

Her breath hitched.

Beatrice’s grip on the phone tightened. "Lil, don’t. It’s a trap."

Lillian met her friend’s worried gaze, conflict warring in her chest.

She had sworn she was done with Donovan.

But if this was about her mother…

She grabbed the phone.

"I have to go."

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the marble floors of Blackwood Manor as Lillian tiptoed past Sebastian's study. Her bare feet made no sound against the cold stone, her breath shallow with anticipation. Today was the day she'd finally confront Donovan about his betrayal.

A sudden crash from the kitchen made her jump. "Merde!" Lucien's accented curse carried through the hallway, followed by the clatter of pans. Lillian pressed herself against the wall, her heart pounding like a trapped bird. The last thing she needed was the flirtatious chef discovering her secret mission.

"Miss Lillian?" Giselle's crisp voice cut through the tension. The head maid rounded the corner, her uniform immaculate as always. "You're up early." Her sharp eyes took in Lillian's rumpled pajamas and the envelope clutched in her trembling hands.

"Just... getting some water," Lillian lied, tucking the damning photographs behind her back. The images of Donovan and Evelyn at that seedy motel burned against her fingertips.

Giselle's lips pursed. "Monsieur Blackwood requested your presence in the east garden. Immediately." She emphasized the last word with a pointed look at Lillian's disheveled state.

Lillian's stomach dropped. Sebastian never summoned her this early unless something was wrong. Had he discovered her plans? Or worse - had Donovan gotten to him first?

The east garden smelled of jasmine and impending rain. Sebastian stood by the koi pond, his broad shoulders tense beneath his tailored suit. When he turned, his storm-gray eyes held none of their usual warmth. "We need to talk about your little investigation," he said without preamble.

Lillian's throat went dry. "How did you—"

"Marcus saw you following Donovan last night." Sebastian closed the distance between them in three strides. "Do you have any idea how dangerous that was?"

The photographs slipped from Lillian's grasp, scattering across the cobblestones. Sebastian's gaze flicked to the incriminating images, his expression darkening. "This changes everything," he murmured, scooping up one that showed Evelyn handing Donovan a familiar silver pendant - the same one Victoria always wore.

A thunderclap split the sky as the first raindrops fell. Lillian barely noticed the cold water soaking through her clothes. Because in that moment, she realized the terrifying truth: Donovan wasn't just cheating. He was stealing from his own fiancée. And if he'd go that far for money...

"What else is he capable of?" she whispered.

Sebastian's hand found hers, his grip firm. "That's what we're going to find out. Together." His phone buzzed with an incoming call from Marcus. The beta's frantic voice carried even through the rain: "Boss, we've got a problem. Victoria's missing."

The pendant glinted mockingly in the grass as the storm broke overhead.

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the campus quad. Her fingers tightened around the strap of her backpack, her thoughts still tangled from last night’s confrontation with Donovan. The memory of his cold dismissal burned in her chest, but she refused to let it show.

Beatrice, ever perceptive, nudged her shoulder. "You’re brooding again," she teased, though her dark eyes held concern.

Lillian forced a smile. "Just thinking about Professor Sinclair’s assignment."

Beatrice snorted. "Liar. But fine, keep your secrets."

Their banter was interrupted by the sudden appearance of Cassandra, flanked by her usual entourage. The blonde smirked, her gaze raking over Lillian with deliberate disdain. "Look who’s still pretending she belongs here."

Lillian’s jaw clenched, but before she could retort, a deep voice cut through the tension.

"Is there a problem?"

Sebastian Blackwood stood a few feet away, his presence commanding immediate silence. His piercing gaze flickered between them, lingering on Lillian just long enough to make her pulse stutter.

Cassandra paled. "N-no, Alpha Blackwood. Just chatting."

Sebastian’s expression remained unreadable. "Good. Then move along."

As Cassandra scurried away, Beatrice whistled low under her breath. "Damn. That never gets old."

Lillian exhaled, her shoulders relaxing slightly. "Thanks," she murmured, meeting Sebastian’s eyes.

He inclined his head, his voice dropping to a near whisper. "Meet me at the pack house tonight. We need to talk."

Before she could respond, he turned and strode off, leaving her heart racing.

Beatrice arched a brow. "What was that about?"

Lillian swallowed hard. "I have no idea."

But the weight in his tone told her it wasn’t good.

That evening, Lillian stood outside the Blackwood estate, her nerves frayed. The grand double doors swung open before she could knock, revealing Theodore Whitmore, Sebastian’s ever-composed butler.

"Miss Lillian," he greeted warmly. "Alpha Blackwood is expecting you in his study."

She followed him through the opulent halls, her mind racing with possibilities. Had Donovan caused more trouble? Or worse—had Sebastian discovered the truth about her past?

The study door creaked open, and Sebastian turned from the window, his expression grim. "Sit."

She obeyed, her fingers knotting in her lap.

He didn’t mince words. "Donovan’s been making moves against my pack. And he’s using Evelyn to do it."

Lillian’s breath hitched. "What?"

Sebastian’s eyes darkened. "He’s planning something. And I need to know if you’re still loyal to him—or if you’re ready to stand with me."

The challenge hung in the air, heavy and unyielding.

Lillian met his gaze, her voice steady despite the storm inside her. "I’m not his anymore."

Sebastian studied her for a long moment before nodding. "Good. Because war is coming."

And just like that, the fragile peace shattered.

When I remained silent, Nathaniel took the hint and walked away to rejoin Lillian and the others. I stood rooted to the spot, my jaw clenched in quiet fury. Then, a delicate hand landed on my shoulder. I turned to find Penelope standing behind me, her lips curved in a knowing smile. She wore a shimmering gold dress that clung to her every curve, the neckline daringly low, leaving little to the imagination. A golden mask adorned with silver filigree framed her face, but I recognized her instantly.

"I'm so glad you came," she murmured, her smile widening. "Buy me a drink." It wasn’t a request—it was a command. I arched a brow, and she merely fluttered her lashes at me in response.

With a resigned sigh, I asked, "And what would you like?"

"Champagne," she replied without hesitation.

I strode to the bar and ordered two glasses, handing one to Penelope.

"You look absolutely dashing tonight, Sebastian," she remarked, her gaze lingering. "I see you didn’t bring a date."

"You know I don’t usually bring dates to these events," I reminded her coolly.

She nodded thoughtfully, taking a sip of her wine. "What about that girl you were seeing? Lillian, wasn’t it?"

"That’s none of your concern," I ground out.

Penelope let out a light, airy laugh. "This probably isn’t her scene anyway. I can’t imagine someone so… ordinary fitting in here."

"Enough," I snapped, downing the rest of my champagne and turning to leave. She caught my arm, halting me.

"I didn’t mean to offend," she said, her brows knitting together in feigned concern. "But you deserve someone of your own standing. As an heiress, I’d be perfect for you." When I didn’t respond, she seized the opportunity to step closer, her body nearly pressed against mine.

"Dance with me," she purred.

I was about to refuse when my gaze snagged on Lillian across the room, wrapped in Nathaniel’s arms on the dance floor. She looked entirely at ease, her body molded against his. My lips pressed into a thin line as I turned back to Penelope and gave a curt nod.

Taking her hand, I led her onto the dance floor, where she immediately wound her arms around my neck, pressing herself against me. As we moved, my eyes kept drifting toward Lillian. How could she let another man touch her like this after what had happened between us? Did she truly have no shame?

Penelope chattered away about something I couldn’t be bothered to listen to. I offered vague responses, pretending to be engaged, though my mind was miles away.



I stole another glance at Lillian and my blood boiled when I saw Nathaniel pressing his lips to her cheek before claiming her mouth. She allowed it—eyes closed, body pliant—but her lips remained still. It was a dutiful kiss, devoid of passion. Nothing like the way she had kissed me that night, with a hunger that seared through my veins, as if my touch was the very air she needed to breathe. The memory alone made my cock twitch, and I had to remind myself harshly: She isn’t yours.

Not tonight.

Nathaniel murmured something against her ear, and she nodded stiffly. He kissed her once more—brief, possessive—before releasing her and striding toward the restroom. Left alone, Lillian looked uncomfortable, returning to the now-empty table. Victoria had dragged Donovan onto the dance floor, leaving her isolated.

"Sebastian?" Penelope’s voice cut through my thoughts, her fingers brushing my arm.

I turned, offering her a stiff nod. "Excuse me."

No explanation. No courtesy.

Her mouth fell open as I walked away, her protests fading into the music. I didn’t look back. My focus was singular—her.

Lillian startled when I reached the table, her doe eyes widening. "I thought you were going to the—?"

She thought I was Nathaniel.

Good.

I didn’t speak. Instead, I seized her wrist, pulling her to her feet in one swift motion. The moment our skin connected, electricity crackled between us, sharp enough to make my wolf snarl in anticipation. A gasp escaped her lips—she felt it too.

I didn’t give her time to resist.

The dance floor swallowed us, my arms locking around her waist, dragging her flush against me. Her scent—jasmine and something uniquely her—wrapped around me like a drug, soothing the beast beneath my skin. For the first time all night, the tension in my shoulders eased.

We moved slowly, her body molding to mine as if we were made for this. Her breath hitched when my fingers traced the delicate seams of her dress, skating up her spine. She was breathtaking tonight—lips pink and parted, begging to be claimed properly. Not the chaste, half-hearted kiss Nathaniel had given her.

No. She deserved fire.

Her tongue darted out, wetting her bottom lip. "Nathaniel, I—"

I didn’t let her finish.

My mouth crashed onto hers in a kiss that burned through every pretense, every lie. This wasn’t duty. This was need.

And gods help me, she kissed me back.

The scent of pine and damp earth filled Lillian's senses as she stepped onto the moonlit path. Her fingers trembled against the rough bark of the ancient oak she leaned against, the night air carrying whispers of danger. Somewhere in the shadows, Donovan was watching - she could feel his predatory gaze like physical fingers tracing her spine.

"Show yourself," she demanded, her voice steadier than she felt. The forest held its breath.

A twig snapped to her left. Lillian spun, her claws extending instinctively as Donovan emerged from the darkness. Moonlight caught the cruel twist of his lips, the predatory gleam in his eyes that once made her heart race for entirely different reasons.

"Still playing hard to get, little wolf?" His voice dripped with false amusement. "You know how this ends."

Behind her, another presence materialized - Evelyn, her perfect blonde curls bouncing as she stepped into the clearing with a smirk. The two moved with synchronized precision, flanking Lillian like hunters cornering prey.

Lillian's pulse hammered against her ribs. She'd been foolish to come alone, but after what they'd done to Beatrice... Her claws dug deeper into the tree bark. "You won't get away with this."

Donovan's laugh was a dark, ugly sound. "Who's going to stop us? Your precious Sebastian?" He feigned a look of mock sympathy. "He's too busy cleaning up your messes to save you this time."

The snap of branches underfoot had all three turning toward the new disturbance. Lillian's breath caught as a familiar broad-shouldered silhouette emerged from the trees, moonlight glinting off silver-streaked hair.

"Actually," Sebastian Blackwood's deep voice cut through the tension like a blade, "I always make time for what's mine." His golden eyes burned with barely restrained fury as he stepped protectively in front of Lillian. "Shall we discuss how you've been threatening my mate?"

The forest seemed to hold its breath as Marcus Grayson and several warriors materialized from the shadows, surrounding Donovan and Evelyn. The smug confidence drained from their faces, replaced by dawning realization of their miscalculation.

Lillian felt Sebastian's hand find hers, his grip warm and reassuring. The silent message was clear - this wasn't just her fight anymore. It never had been.

Evelyn's shrill voice broke the silence. "This isn't over!"

Sebastian's smile was all sharp edges. "Oh, but it is." His gaze locked onto Donovan's. "Run."

As their enemies scrambled into the darkness, Lillian turned to Sebastian, questions burning on her tongue. But the look in his eyes promised answers - and so much more. The real game was just beginning.
###Chapter 121

The moment his lips met mine, the world around us blurred into nothingness. My heart hammered wildly against my ribs, a frantic rhythm that drowned out the music and chatter of the party. I had never expected Nathaniel to kiss like this—so fiercely, so possessively—yet here I was, melting into his embrace as if I belonged there.

But then, something shifted.

The way his mouth moved against mine felt achingly familiar, as if I were kissing Sebastian instead.

Why was I thinking about him again?

It was infuriating how he haunted my thoughts, even now. When we finally broke apart, I gasped for air, my cheeks burning and my pulse racing. I opened my mouth to speak, but before I could utter a word, he stepped back—his eyes dark with desire, yet shadowed with something unreadable.

"Nathaniel—"

He was gone before I could finish, vanishing into the crowd as swiftly as he had appeared.

I stood there, stunned, my fingers brushing my swollen lips. They tingled from the intensity of the kiss, and I knew they must be flushed red.

"Are you alright?" Victoria’s voice snapped me back to reality. She stood beside me, frowning in the direction Nathaniel had disappeared.

"I—uh—" I stammered, still dazed. "Do you know where Nathaniel went?"

"Nathaniel?" She blinked, then glanced over her shoulder toward the table. "He just sat back down."

My blood ran cold.

What?

Slowly, I turned, my stomach twisting as I saw Nathaniel—my Nathaniel—chatting with Donovan as he took his seat. His gaze swept the room until it landed on me, and he grinned, waving me over.

I froze.

If that was Nathaniel… then who the hell had just kissed me?

I whipped my head back toward the crowd, but the mysterious stranger was nowhere to be seen. My hands trembled, my palms slick with sweat. A complete stranger had just given me one of the most electrifying kisses of my life—one filled with the same raw passion and longing I had only ever felt with Sebastian.

But it couldn’t have been him.

Sebastian would never kiss me so recklessly in public. He had too much self-control, and we had both agreed—what happened between us that night was a mistake. A one-time lapse in judgment.

So if it wasn’t Nathaniel, and it wasn’t Sebastian…

Who was it?

"Your face is all red," Nathaniel murmured as I finally reached the table, his brows knitting together. "Everything okay?"

I couldn’t tell him the truth.

So I forced a smile. "Yeah. Just… tired."

We’d been here for hours, and as fun as the party was, exhaustion was creeping in. The alcohol didn’t help—my head felt fuzzy, my thoughts sluggish.

"Here." He handed me a glass of water. "Drink."

I took it gratefully, gulping down the cool liquid as it soothed my parched throat. But even as I smiled at him, my mind raced.

Because whoever that stranger was…

He had tasted like fire and danger—and I wasn’t sure I wanted to forget it.
"Thank you," I murmured, my voice dripping with honeyed sweetness as I gazed up at Nathaniel.
He rose smoothly, his strong arm encircling my waist in a possessive hold. The brush of his lips against my cheek sent an unexpected shiver down my spine—his scent, crisp and woodsy, was nothing like the intoxicating musk of the stranger who'd spun me across the dance floor moments ago. My mind reeled, a tempest of confusion, while my wolf clawed at my consciousness, torn between the urge to chase after that mysterious man and the raw agony of seeing our mate with another woman. The conflict was maddening, a wildfire scorching through my veins.

"Let's step outside," Nathaniel suggested, his thumb tracing idle circles on my hip. "There's something I've been meaning to discuss with you."

I nodded mutely, letting him lace our fingers together as we bid a curt farewell to Victoria. Donovan's glare burned into my back, but I refused to acknowledge him—not when every nerve in my body was already frayed. Nathaniel led me through the gilded doors onto the moonlit terrace of the Gala Hall.

The night was a masterpiece: a sliver of crescent moon hung like a jewel in the inky sky, its glow rivaled only by the diamond-bright stars scattered across the heavens. A crisp breeze nipped at my bare arms, and I hugged myself, regretting my choice of a sleeveless gown.

Nathaniel shrugged off his tailored jacket before I could protest, draping it over my shoulders with a tenderness that made my pulse stutter. "Thanks," I whispered, inhaling the faint trace of his bergamot cologne.

"Always," he murmured, pulling me snug against his side. His warmth seeped into me, a stark contrast to the chill in the air.

"It's... breathtaking out here," I managed, desperate to fill the silence thickening between us.

His chuckle was low, velvet-rough. "Not half as breathtaking as you."

Heat flooded my cheeks. I sidestepped his embrace, putting a sliver of distance between us as I turned to face him. His lips quirked downward at the motion, but I pressed on. "So? What did you want to talk about?"

With deliberate slowness, he lifted his masquerade mask away, revealing eyes dark with unspoken conflict. Belatedly, I remembered my own disguise and tugged it free, clutching the satin in my trembling hands. The way he studied me—jaw tight, throat working—sent a prickle of unease down my spine. Whatever he was about to say, he was wrestling with it. Hard.

###Chapter 122

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the campus quad. Her fingers tightened around the strap of her backpack, the weight of her textbooks grounding her. The morning sun cast long shadows, painting the world in hues of gold and amber.

She hadn’t slept well.

Images of Donovan’s cold smirk and Evelyn’s triumphant gaze haunted her dreams. The rejection still stung, a raw wound beneath her ribs. But today, she refused to let it define her.

"Lillian!" Beatrice’s voice cut through her thoughts, bright and cheerful. Her best friend bounded toward her, auburn curls bouncing with each step. "You look like you wrestled a ghost and lost. What happened?"

Lillian forced a smile. "Just a rough night."

Beatrice looped an arm through hers, steering her toward the coffee cart. "Well, caffeine fixes everything. And maybe some gossip." She wiggled her eyebrows. "Oliver told me Sebastian’s been asking about you."

Lillian nearly tripped. "What?"

"Mm-hmm. Apparently, the great Lycan chairman has been subtly inquiring about your schedule." Beatrice smirked. "Very unsubtly, according to Oliver."

Her pulse jumped. Sebastian Blackwood—powerful, enigmatic, and entirely out of her league. The man who’d saved her from humiliation at the gala, whose presence alone made her skin prickle with awareness.

"Why would he—"

"Because he’s into you, obviously." Beatrice rolled her eyes. "Even Nathaniel noticed, and he’s denser than a brick."

Lillian’s cheeks burned. She opened her mouth to argue, but a familiar laugh froze her in place.

Donovan.

He stood near the humanities building, arm slung around Evelyn’s shoulders. They looked like a perfect couple—golden and untouchable. Evelyn’s gaze locked onto Lillian, her lips curling in a smirk.

Look what you lost.

Beatrice squeezed her hand. "Ignore them. They’re not worth it."

Lillian inhaled sharply. "I know."

But the ache in her chest said otherwise.

Then her phone buzzed. An unknown number.

Meet me at the oak grove. 7 PM. —S

Her breath hitched.

Sebastian.

Beatrice peeked over her shoulder and gasped. "Is that—?"

Lillian snapped her phone shut. "No idea what you’re talking about."

But her traitorous heart raced.

What did the Lycan chairman want with her?

And why did the thought send a thrill down her spine?

"Nathaniel?" I asked after what felt like an eternity of silence.

He blinked rapidly, clearing his throat before meeting my gaze with that boyish grin of his—the one that made girls swoon.

"I like you, Lillian," he blurted out, making my eyebrows shoot up. "No—I really like you. I think... I could fall in love with you."

My heart plummeted. Any woman would kill to hear those words from Nathaniel Whitlock. With his tousled dark hair, sharp jawline, and that effortless charm, he was every girl's fantasy. And yet... I didn't feel that spark. To me, he was just a friend—a good one—but nothing more. And the last thing I wanted was to hurt him.

"So, I wanted to ask you..." He hesitated, his eyes shining with hope. "Would you be my girlfriend?"

My stomach twisted with guilt.

Fidgeting with my fingers, I thought about that impulsive kiss on the dance floor—and worse, the fact that I had slept with his uncle just days ago. Heat rushed to my cheeks, and I bit my lower lip.

"Nathaniel..." I exhaled slowly.

That single word was enough. His face fell slightly, but he stayed quiet, giving me space to continue.

"You're an incredible guy," I said, forcing myself to meet his eyes. "Any girl would be lucky to have you. But I'm not in the right place for a relationship. You know my fated mate is marrying someone else, and my wolf is... broken because of it."

"I'm not like him," Nathaniel insisted, suddenly grabbing my wrist, startling me. "I would never hurt you. Just give us a chance. You could learn to love me—your wolf could too."

I shook my head, trying to pull away.

"Nathaniel, you're amazing, and I'm so sorry. I don't want to hurt you, but I don’t feel the same way. I tried—I really did—but—"

"Then try harder!" His grip tightened painfully. "We have fun together. There’s chemistry between us, Lillian."

"As friends," I corrected, keeping my voice low to avoid drawing attention.

"That’s bullshit, and you know it!" His voice rose. "We kissed!"

"Let go of me. You're hurting me," I pleaded, struggling against his hold. His coat slipped to the ground in the scuffle, but his fingers only dug deeper into my skin—hard enough to bruise.

"You led me on!" he hissed, anger flashing in his eyes. "You made me think there was something here!"

His expression was wild, unhinged—something I'd never seen before. It sent a chill down my spine.

"Please, Nathaniel..."

"You're nothing but a whore," Nathaniel snarled, his grip tightening on my arm. "I should have known better than to trust you. No wonder Donovan left you for Evelyn!"

Before I could stop myself, my palm connected with his cheek in a sharp crack. The force of it startled him enough to release me. I stumbled back, my chest heaving with fury, my entire body burning with indignation.

"Don’t you ever speak to me like that again," I hissed, jabbing a finger at him. "Yes, I hurt you, but that doesn’t give you the right to act like a complete bastard!"

For a moment, his anger flickered. He dragged a hand through his hair, regret flashing in his eyes.

"Fine. You're right. I went too far," he muttered. "But I don’t get it, Lillian. You came here as my date. You let me kiss you—more than once. And now you're saying we're just friends? That doesn’t add up." His voice dropped, suspicion creeping in. "Did something happen? I saw you with that guy earlier… Is he the reason?"

My stomach twisted.

He’d seen me with him? Had he witnessed the kiss? My silence must have been answer enough because his expression darkened, his jaw clenching.

"It is him, isn’t it?" Nathaniel growled. "Something happened between you two. Tell me the truth."

"Nathaniel—"

His fingers dug into my arm again, harder this time, his breath ragged. "You really are a slut," he spat. "I wish I’d never laid eyes on you, Lillian Montague!"

"Let me go!" I wrenched against his hold, adrenaline surging. "You don’t get to touch me like this! I don’t want you—just leave me alone!"

The sharp sting across my cheek silenced me. The metallic tang of blood bloomed on my tongue before I even registered the blow. My vision swam as I stared up at him, his hand still raised, his knuckles red from the impact.

He’d just hit me.

###Chapter 123

The morning sun filtered through the heavy drapes of Lillian's bedroom, casting golden patterns across the silk sheets. She stretched languidly, her werewolf senses immediately picking up the scent of freshly brewed coffee and warm croissants from the kitchen below.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. "Miss Lillian? Mr. Blackwood requests your presence in the study," came Harper's polite voice through the door.

Lillian's pulse quickened at the mention of Sebastian. Ever since their last encounter in the moonlit garden, every interaction with the Lycan chairman sent electric currents down her spine.

She dressed quickly, choosing a simple emerald green dress that complemented her auburn hair. As she descended the grand staircase, the sound of raised voices reached her ears.

"...completely unacceptable!" Sebastian's deep baritone vibrated through the closed study doors.

Lillian hesitated, her hand hovering over the doorknob. The scent of Donovan's cologne mixed with something darker - the metallic tang of anger.

Before she could decide whether to enter, the door swung open violently. Donovan stood framed in the doorway, his usually perfect hair disheveled, eyes flashing gold with barely contained rage.

"You," he spat, his gaze locking onto Lillian. "This is all your fault."

Sebastian materialized behind Donovan, his massive frame radiating protective energy. "Enough," he growled, the command laced with Alpha power that made even Lillian's wolf whimper in submission.

Donovan's jaw clenched, but he stepped back. "Mark my words, Lillian. You'll regret choosing him." With that ominous warning, he stormed down the hall, nearly colliding with Oliver who was coming from the opposite direction.

"Daddy?" The little boy's voice trembled as he clutched a sketchbook to his chest. "Why is Uncle Donovan so angry?"

Sebastian's expression softened as he knelt to his son's level. "Nothing for you to worry about, champ. Did you finish your drawing?"

Oliver nodded eagerly, holding up the sketchbook to reveal a surprisingly detailed portrait of Lillian in wolf form. "I wanted to show Lillian!"

Lillian's heart swelled at the child's innocent admiration. She took the sketchbook gently. "It's beautiful, Oliver. You've captured my wolf perfectly."

The moment was shattered by the shrill ring of Sebastian's phone. He glanced at the screen, his face hardening. "I have to take this. Oliver, why don't you show Lillian your new comic books?"

As Sebastian disappeared into his study, Lillian noticed the way Oliver's small shoulders slumped. "He's always working," the boy muttered.

Lillian squeezed his hand. "How about we make cookies with Lucien? I heard he got fresh chocolate chips from Paris."

Oliver's eyes lit up, but before they could move toward the kitchen, Victoria appeared at the top of the stairs, her designer heels clicking sharply against the marble.

"There you are," she sneered, her cold gaze sweeping over Lillian. "Father wants to see you immediately. Something about your little... indiscretion last night."

Lillian's blood ran cold. What had Donovan told Sebastian?

As she turned to follow Victoria, Beatrice burst through the front door, her face flushed with excitement. "Lil! You'll never guess who just arrived at the—" She froze, taking in the tense atmosphere. "Oh. Bad timing?"

Victoria rolled her eyes dramatically. "Ugh, more peasants in my house. Father really needs to screen his guests better."

Beatrice opened her mouth to retort, but Lillian shook her head subtly. Now wasn't the time for another confrontation.

"Bea, can you take Oliver to the kitchen? I'll join you shortly."

As Beatrice led the confused boy away, Lillian squared her shoulders and followed Victoria toward Sebastian's study, her mind racing with possibilities. Whatever awaited her behind that door would change everything - she could feel it in her bones.

The sting on my cheek was unbearable, the skin swelling beneath my fingertips. The coppery taste of blood filled my mouth, the cut on my lip throbbing with each heartbeat. When Donovan saw the crimson streak on my face, his expression twisted with horror. He released me instantly, stumbling back, his hands raised in surrender.

The moment his hands lifted, I flinched—hard. The hurt that flashed in his eyes only made the ache in my chest worse.

"Lillian, I—"

"Don’t touch me," I hissed, my voice raw, foreign even to my own ears.

His face crumpled. "I’m... I’m so sorry," he choked out, dragging his hands down his face. "I never meant to hurt you—"

"Just leave," I whispered, biting back the sob clawing its way up my throat. I wouldn’t break. Not yet.

He didn’t argue. Without another word, he turned and fled. The second he disappeared around the corner, my knees buckled. Tears spilled over, hot and relentless, searing the wound on my lip. I pressed trembling fingers to my swollen cheek and winced.

Thankfully, the patio was empty. No witnesses. But I couldn’t stay—couldn’t risk someone seeing me like this. I bolted toward the front of the building, my entire body shaking.

Nathaniel had been my ride, but there was no way in hell I was going to find him now. I fumbled for my phone in my purse, fingers slick with sweat. Just as I pulled it out, a familiar voice froze me in place.

"Lillian?"

My breath hitched. I knew that voice like my own heartbeat. And right now, I couldn’t face him. Not like this. But the tears wouldn’t stop. I kept my back turned, refusing to let him see me so broken.

A car door opened, then slammed shut. The next second, warmth enveloped me—his scent, his presence, his hands gripping my shoulders. Electricity sparked beneath my skin at his touch, and I hated how my body responded to him.

"What happened?" Sebastian’s voice was low, dangerous.

He didn’t even need to see my face to know I was shattered. How did he always know?

When I didn’t answer, he spun me around. His gaze locked onto my injuries—the swelling, the blood—and his concern morphed into something darker. Fury.

"Who did this to you?" he growled, his grip tightening.

"It doesn’t matter," I whispered, swiping at my tears. "I just want to go home."

Sebastian ignored me. His jaw clenched. "Was it my nephew?"

The accusation hung between us, sharp as a blade.

When I remained silent, Sebastian let out a low, frustrated growl. He didn’t need me to say it—he already knew the answer. His fingers brushed against my chin, tilting my face up until my eyes locked with his. The intensity in his gaze sent a shiver down my spine.

"I will never let him hurt you again."

His words were deliberate, each syllable weighted with a promise that made my heart stutter. I searched his eyes, losing myself in the storm of emotions swirling within them. After what felt like an eternity, I gave a small, hesitant nod.

Then his lips were on mine.

The moment our mouths touched, my entire world narrowed to that single point of contact. My heart skipped wildly, and my wolf surged forward, electrified by his nearness. His kiss was achingly familiar, yet it carried a depth that left me breathless.

This was the man I had kissed in the dark.

The realization struck me like lightning. If he had still been wearing that mask, he might have resembled Nathaniel—but the resemblance was only superficial. How had I not seen it before?

Sebastian’s tongue traced my bottom lip, a silent request for more. I parted my lips without hesitation, surrendering to the heat between us. His arms tightened around my waist, pulling me flush against him as if he couldn’t bear even an inch of distance. He kissed me like a man starved, like his very existence depended on it.

The pain from my bruised cheek and split lip faded—whether from his healing touch or my wolf’s frantic energy, I didn’t know. And in that moment, I didn’t care. All I knew was that I needed more.

Sebastian’s POV

After kissing Lillian on the dance floor, I had no desire to stay at the gala any longer—not after watching her walk away hand-in-hand with Nathaniel.

I found the hostess, handed her my donation check, and made my exit. My driver had already left, assuming I’d stay much later, but I knew Marcus would be nearby. One call, and he’d arrive faster than my chauffeur ever could.

True to form, Marcus pulled up within minutes. He knew better than to ask questions—his silence was one of the many reasons I trusted him.

Just as we were about to drive off, I spotted her.

Lillian.

She stumbled down the sidewalk, arms wrapped tightly around herself, her body trembling. Even from this distance, I could see the tear tracks glistening on her cheeks.

My wolf snarled inside me.

I wasn’t leaving without her.
###Chapter 124

The morning sun cast golden rays through the sheer curtains of Lillian's bedroom, stirring her awake. She stretched languidly, the events of last night still fresh in her mind—Donovan's unexpected reappearance, the tension in the air, and the way Sebastian's grip had tightened around her waist as if silently declaring his claim.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, sitting up.

The door creaked open, revealing Beatrice, her best friend, balancing a tray of breakfast in one hand and a steaming cup of coffee in the other. "Morning, sleepyhead. Thought you might need this after last night."

Lillian groaned, rubbing her temples. "Ugh, don’t remind me. I still can’t believe Donovan had the nerve to show up."

Beatrice set the tray down on the bedside table, plopping onto the edge of the bed. "And with Evelyn, no less. That woman has the subtlety of a sledgehammer."

Lillian snorted, reaching for the coffee. "Tell me about it. The way she clung to him like a limpet—honestly, it was pathetic."

Beatrice smirked. "Jealous?"

Lillian shot her a glare. "Please. I’m just annoyed he’s still trying to play games."

A mischievous glint sparked in Beatrice’s eyes. "Well, Sebastian certainly didn’t seem thrilled either. The way he looked at Donovan? I thought he was going to shift right then and there."

Lillian’s cheeks warmed at the memory. Sebastian’s protective instincts had been on full display, his dominance radiating like a storm cloud. It had been... unexpectedly thrilling.

Before she could respond, her phone buzzed. A message from Victoria flashed on the screen:

"We need to talk. Meet me at the café in an hour."

Lillian frowned. Victoria had been distant since the engagement was called off, and now she wanted to talk?

Beatrice peeked over her shoulder. "Trouble in paradise?"

Lillian sighed. "I guess I’m about to find out."

The campus café was unusually quiet, the mid-morning lull leaving only a few students scattered at the tables. Victoria sat in the corner, her posture rigid, fingers tapping impatiently against her coffee cup.

Lillian slid into the seat across from her. "You wanted to talk?"

Victoria’s gaze flicked up, sharp and assessing. "You need to stay away from Donovan."

Lillian blinked. "Excuse me?"

Victoria leaned forward, her voice dropping to a whisper. "He’s not who you think he is. There are things you don’t know—things that could get you hurt."

A chill ran down Lillian’s spine. "What are you talking about?"

Victoria hesitated, then shook her head. "Just trust me. If you care about Sebastian, if you care about yourself—stay away."

Before Lillian could press further, Victoria stood abruptly, tossing a few bills onto the table. "I’ve said what I needed to say."

And with that, she was gone, leaving Lillian with more questions than answers.

What the hell was going on?

Sebastian’s office was dimly lit, the scent of aged leather and cedar filling the air. Marcus stood before him, his expression grim.

"We’ve got a problem," Marcus said, sliding a file across the desk. "Donovan’s been making moves behind the scenes. He’s been meeting with Alpha Harrison."

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "Harrison? That slimy bastard wouldn’t dare."

Marcus nodded. "And yet, here we are. Rumor has it they’re planning something big—something that could destabilize the entire territory."

Sebastian’s fingers curled into fists. "Find out what they’re up to. And keep an eye on Lillian. If Donovan’s involved, she’s in danger."

Marcus hesitated. "You think he’d hurt her?"

Sebastian’s eyes darkened. "I think he’s capable of anything."

Lillian’s phone buzzed again as she stepped out of the café. Another message—this time from an unknown number:

"You’re being watched. Don’t trust anyone."

Her breath hitched.

Who the hell was sending this? And more importantly—who was watching her?

The game had just gotten a lot more dangerous.

The moment I laid eyes on Lillian's swollen cheek and the cut marring her perfect lips, my vision turned crimson. Blood or not, my nephew Nathaniel would pay dearly for daring to lay a finger on her.

Kissing her hadn’t been part of the plan, but the second my lips met hers, the storm inside me—and my wolf—settled into a dangerous calm. The taste of copper from her wound lingered briefly before her skin began knitting itself back together beneath my touch. Was it her wolf healing her… or was it me?

I dragged her flush against me, every delicious curve of her body molding perfectly to mine as I guided her toward the car. My mouth never left hers, not until we reached the vehicle and I had to rap sharply on the window, forcing Marcus to lower it with an infuriatingly knowing smirk. Reluctantly breaking the kiss, I took in Lillian’s flushed face—her lips no longer split from injury but swollen from my claiming.

"Out," I ordered Marcus. "Wait here."

"Of course, Alpha," he replied, amusement dancing in his eyes as he stepped out and shut the door behind him. The second we were alone, I yanked open the back door and guided Lillian onto the seat.

She reclined, watching me with heavy-lidded anticipation as I crawled over her, sealing us inside. Gods, she was breathtaking—her dress clinging to every sinful curve, my wolf nearly rabid with the need to tear it off her. My lips traced the delicate column of her throat, and she gasped when I nipped at the sensitive juncture where her shoulder met her neck. A soft moan escaped her as her fingers tangled in my hair, sending electric sparks down my spine.

Slowly, I peeled the straps of her dress down, baring her perfect breasts to my hungry gaze. Her peaked nipples begged for my touch, and I obliged, swirling my tongue around one before drawing it into my mouth. Her breath hitched, her back arching as I teased her relentlessly until she was writhing beneath me.

"Sebastian…" she gasped.

Heat radiated from her skin, searing into me, and I smirked against her flesh. I loved how responsive she was—how easily she unraveled under my hands. A sharp tug of my teeth had her crying out, her hips lifting instinctively. The scent of her arousal thickened the air, and my wolf snarled with hunger.

I trailed lower, kissing a path down her stomach until I reached the hem of her dress. Pushing the fabric up, I growled at the sight of black silk panties.

Had she worn these for Nathaniel? The thought sent fury licking through my veins.

I’d make her forget his name. The only one she’d scream tonight would be mine.

With a rough flick of my fingers, I pushed the lace aside, revealing her glistening core. She was exquisite—soaked and trembling, her scent intoxicating. Without warning, I buried my face between her thighs.

She shrieked my name, her thighs clamping around my head as I feasted. She tasted even better than she smelled, and my cock throbbed painfully in response.

I’d ruin her for anyone else.

And I was just getting started.

I captured her sensitive bud between my lips, swirling my tongue in slow, teasing circles until her thighs trembled uncontrollably. A desperate cry tore from her throat—my name, raw and breathless—but I didn’t stop. Not until her body arched off the bed, pleasure rendering her limp and boneless beneath me.

With one last lingering kiss to her swollen clit, I dragged my mouth back up to hers, claiming her lips in a searing kiss. My tongue plunged deep, letting her taste herself on me. She responded with equal hunger, teeth grazing my lower lip before she laughed breathlessly when I retaliated with a sharp nip to hers—now fully healed.

Her fingers traced a blazing path down my torso, exploring the hard planes of my abdomen through the thin fabric of my shirt. A wicked little smirk curled at the corner of her lips—approval. I made it easier for her, unbuckling my belt and yanking down my zipper in one smooth motion. Her hands wasted no time, wrapping around my throbbing length with a confidence that nearly made me lose control right then.

Every stroke was electric, her fingers gliding from the sensitive tip down to the base, wringing a guttural groan from me.

"I need to be inside you," I growled against her lips, my voice rough with need.

Her eyes darkened with desire as she nodded.

"Take me..." she whispered, the words a plea.

But I needed more.

"Tell me you're mine," I demanded, barely recognizing the possessive edge in my own voice. Where this primal need came from, I didn’t know—but I needed to hear it.

For a heartbeat, she just stared at me, the fire in her gaze burning hotter before she closed the distance between us. Her lips crashed against mine in a searing kiss, and just as I thought I might lose my mind, her breathless whisper shattered me.

"I'm yours."

###Chapter 125

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s estate. The sun had barely risen, casting a golden hue over the sprawling gardens below. She tightened the silk robe around her, the fabric whispering against her skin.

Last night’s events replayed in her mind—Donovan’s sudden reappearance, the venom in his words, the way Evelyn clung to his arm like a trophy. Lillian’s fingers curled around the railing, her knuckles whitening. She had thought she was over him, but the sting of betrayal still lingered like a phantom ache.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

“Lillian?” Beatrice’s voice was muffled through the door. “Are you awake?”

Lillian exhaled sharply, forcing her shoulders to relax. “Come in.”

The door creaked open, revealing Beatrice in a rumpled T-shirt and pajama bottoms, her dark curls a wild halo around her face. “You’ve been out here forever. Did you even sleep?”

“Not much,” Lillian admitted, rubbing her temples.

Beatrice flopped onto the plush chaise lounge, kicking her feet up. “Ugh, men. They’re like bad hangovers—just when you think you’re done with them, they come back to ruin your morning.”

A reluctant laugh escaped Lillian. “Tell me about it.”

Beatrice grinned, mischief sparking in her eyes. “So, what’s the plan? Because I refuse to let Donovan and that snake Evelyn ruin our weekend.”

Lillian turned back to the view, the first rays of sunlight painting the sky in shades of pink and orange. “I don’t know. Avoid them, I guess.”

“Boring.” Beatrice rolled her eyes. “We should make them regret showing up. You’re the future Luna of this pack, remember? Time to remind everyone why Sebastian chose you.”

Lillian’s pulse quickened at the mention of Sebastian. The Lycan chairman had been nothing but patient with her, his quiet strength a balm to her fractured heart. But the thought of facing Donovan again—of seeing the smug satisfaction on his face—made her stomach twist.

“Maybe,” she murmured.

Beatrice sat up, suddenly serious. “Lil, you can’t let him win. Not again.”

Lillian’s jaw tightened. Beatrice was right. She had spent too long running from her past. It was time to stand her ground.

A sharp rap at the door startled them both.

“Lillian?” Sebastian’s deep voice sent a shiver down her spine.

Beatrice waggled her eyebrows. “Speak of the devil.”

Lillian shot her a glare before calling out, “Yes?”

The door opened, and Sebastian stepped inside, his broad frame filling the doorway. Dressed in a tailored black suit, his silver eyes gleamed with an intensity that made her breath hitch.

“We need to talk,” he said, his gaze flickering to Beatrice. “Alone.”

Beatrice hopped up with an exaggerated sigh. “Fine, fine. I’ll go find Oliver. Kid owes me a rematch in Mario Kart.” She winked at Lillian before slipping past Sebastian.

The moment the door clicked shut, the air between them thickened. Sebastian closed the distance in three strides, his fingers brushing her cheek. “You look exhausted.”

Lillian leaned into his touch, the warmth of his palm seeping into her skin. “I had a lot on my mind.”

His thumb traced the curve of her jaw. “Donovan?”

She nodded, unable to meet his eyes.

Sebastian’s grip tightened slightly. “He doesn’t get to dictate your life anymore, Lillian. You’re mine.” The possessiveness in his voice sent a thrill through her.

Before she could respond, his lips crashed onto hers, fierce and demanding. Lillian melted against him, her fingers tangling in his hair. The world outside ceased to exist—there was only Sebastian, his scent, his touch, the way he made her forget everything but him.

When they finally broke apart, breathless, Sebastian rested his forehead against hers. “Tonight, at the gala, you stand by my side. Let them see what they lost.”

Lillian’s heart pounded. “And if they try something?”

A slow, dangerous smile curved his lips. “Then they’ll learn why crossing a Blackwood is the last mistake they’ll ever make.”

The promise in his words sent a shiver down her spine. For the first time since Donovan’s return, Lillian felt something other than dread.

Anticipation.

Because tonight, the game changed.

And she was done playing the victim.

The words tumbled from my lips before I could process their weight. Yet, they seemed to shatter Sebastian's restraint entirely. In the next breath, he was buried deep inside me, and my voice broke as I cried out his name—every thought, every lingering pain from our failed mating, obliterated in an instant.

Each thrust sent electric shocks through my body, his movements hitting that perfect spot that made my legs tremble and my wolf howl in ecstasy. Even she, usually so restless with grief, was lost in pure bliss, surrendering completely to him.

Sebastian’s lips crashed back onto mine, his teeth grazing my bottom lip before sucking it gently. I smiled into the kiss, craving more—needing him closer, deeper, as if our bodies could fuse together. My fingers tangled in his dark, silken hair, pulling him down to me, refusing to let him go until I was utterly satisfied. He didn’t resist. Instead, he let me take what I wanted, his breath ragged against my skin.

"Lillian..." His voice was rough, my name a sinful whisper on his lips. The sound sent a thrill through me, and I wanted to hear it again, to drown in it.

I could feel him swelling inside me, his control fraying, but he held back, determined to drag out my pleasure. His thumb found my clit, circling and teasing until I was gasping, my body tightening around him. With one final cry of his name, I shattered, and he followed right after, his release filling me as we collapsed into a tangled, panting mess.

We stayed like that for a long moment, our breaths slowly steadying, before he finally pulled away and helped me sit up. My fingers combed through my tousled hair, my cheeks burning with embarrassment. This wasn’t how I’d expected the night to end—not in the back of his car, not with Marcus standing just outside, undoubtedly having heard everything.

Yet Sebastian didn’t seem fazed. He adjusted his clothes with effortless grace, as if we hadn’t just been lost in each other. A smirk curled his lips as he brushed his thumb over my swollen bottom lip, then tucked a stray lock of hair behind my ear. The tender kiss he pressed to my forehead made my pulse stutter.

He gave me a moment to straighten my dress before rolling down the window. Marcus stood there, his face flushed crimson. Mortification clawed at me, but Sebastian merely arched a brow.

"Take us back to the Blackwood Estate," he commanded.

Marcus nodded quickly, hurrying into the driver’s seat and sealing the partition shut, granting us privacy once more.

I blinked up at Sebastian, surprised. "You’re not taking me home?"

His gaze darkened. "Do you want to go back?"

I hesitated—then shook my head.

The hum of the car engine filled the silence as we sped through the night. My thoughts were a whirlwind. Why had Sebastian kissed me again? And why had we given in to passion when we both knew it shouldn't happen? The agreement between us had been clear—this couldn't continue. Yet he seemed utterly unbothered by breaking it. If anything, he looked pleased with himself, that infuriating smirk playing on his lips like he'd just claimed some grand prize.

But this wasn't winning. If anything, I was probably complicating his already chaotic life.

Where did this leave us now? Employer and employee? Alpha and pack member? The lines had blurred beyond recognition. And Nathaniel... Goddess above. Nathaniel.

How could I have forgotten about him? My fingers instinctively rose to my cheek, expecting to find the sting of his slap still lingering. But the skin was smooth—no swelling, no tenderness. Had I imagined the pain? Or had it miraculously healed after Nathaniel struck me?

"You don't need to worry about him anymore," Sebastian said suddenly, as if reading my thoughts. His grip tightened on the steering wheel. "He'll never lay a hand on you again."

I swallowed hard. "W-what do you mean?"

"I'll deal with him," he stated, his voice like steel. "What he did was unacceptable. I've already mindlinked Marcus—he's retrieving the security footage from the patio as we speak."

My breath caught. "There were cameras?"

Sebastian's eyebrow arched, that arrogant expression returning. "Of course there were." His golden eyes flashed dangerously in the dim light. "He'll pay for touching you. I'll make sure of it."

The finality in his tone sent shivers down my spine. This wasn't just a promise—it was a vow. And when Sebastian Blackwood made vows, the world trembled.
###Chapter 126

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, painting the marble floors in warm hues. Lillian stretched beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming from the intensity of last night. The scent of Sebastian—rich, intoxicating, and undeniably alpha—lingered on her skin, a silent reminder of the bond they now shared.

She turned her head, expecting to find him beside her, but the bed was empty. A note rested on his pillow in elegant script:

"Emergency meeting. Don’t leave the penthouse. I’ll be back soon."

Lillian sighed, running a hand through her tousled hair. Of course. Even after everything, duty still came first.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. Beatrice’s name flashed across the screen.

"Girl, where are you?! The whole campus is talking!"

Lillian frowned. "Talking about what?"

"About you and Sebastian Blackwood! Someone saw you leaving the gala together last night. The rumors are wild—some say you’re his new mistress, others say you’re blackmailing him!"

Lillian groaned. "It’s not like that."

"Then what is it like? Because from where I’m standing, it looks like you just landed yourself in the middle of a Lycan power play."

Before Lillian could respond, the penthouse door clicked open. Heavy footsteps echoed down the hall.

Sebastian strode into the bedroom, his tailored suit immaculate, his expression unreadable. But his scent—sharp with tension—betrayed him.

"We have a problem," he said, his voice low.

Lillian sat up, the sheets pooling around her waist. "What kind of problem?"

"Evelyn."

The name sent a chill down her spine. Donovan’s new mate. The woman who had replaced her.

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "She’s filed a formal complaint with the council. Claims you’re interfering with her mating bond."

Lillian scoffed. "That’s ridiculous! I haven’t even spoken to Donovan since—"

"It doesn’t matter if it’s true," Sebastian cut in. "What matters is that she’s using it to pressure the council into revoking your enrollment at the academy."

Lillian’s stomach dropped. The academy was her only chance at a future outside pack politics. Without it, she’d be forced back into the shadows—or worse, into Donovan’s control.

Sebastian’s phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, his expression darkening further.

"They’ve called an emergency hearing. Tonight."

Lillian’s pulse spiked. "What do we do?"

Sebastian’s golden eyes burned with quiet fury. "We fight back."

My cheeks burned at his words. I never expected Sebastian Blackwood to care about such matters, especially not when it involved me.

"You shouldn't be too harsh on him. He’s your nephew..."

"That makes it worse," Sebastian muttered, his voice low and edged with disapproval. "Family doesn’t raise a hand against women. He won’t go unpunished."

I knew arguing was pointless. Biting the inside of my cheek, I dropped my gaze to my hands, fidgeting with the hem of my sleeve.

"He asked me to be his girlfriend," I admitted in a whisper, feeling Sebastian tense beside me. "I said no. He didn’t take it well... said some cruel things."

"Why did you refuse him?" His tone wasn’t accusatory—just curious, as if he was genuinely trying to understand. My heart fluttered at the thought that maybe, just maybe, he cared for me... even a little.

"I didn’t feel the same way about him," I confessed. "I didn’t want to hurt him, but... I didn’t like him like that."

Sebastian nodded, his expression softening slightly. "And he got angry," he murmured. It wasn’t a question, but I nodded anyway.

"Yes," I confirmed quietly. "He did."

Without another word, Sebastian wrapped an arm around me, pulling me against his side. His warmth enveloped me, and despite everything, I felt my body relax almost instantly, the tension melting away.

A thought suddenly surfaced, and before I could stop myself, I blurted out, "I thought we agreed that night was a mistake—that we’d pretend it never happened."

"You decided that."

I lifted my brows, meeting his gaze. "And that’s not what you wanted?"

His jaw tightened slightly before he admitted, "I wasn’t thinking clearly then."

"And now?"

For a moment, he was silent. I almost thought he wouldn’t answer, but then he exhaled sharply, as if steeling himself.

"Now," he said, his voice firm, "I think we should be together."

My heart stopped. My lips parted in shock.

"I’m sorry... what?"

Even after hearing it twice, I still couldn't believe my ears. My breath hitched as I stared up at him, completely frozen. Was this some kind of joke? Should I laugh it off? Agree immediately? Did I even want this? He was Victoria's father—my ex's former father-in-law.

And oh right, my damn boss.

This was a disaster waiting to happen.

A slow, knowing smirk curled his lips before he leaned down, brushing the lightest kiss against my mouth. The contact sent sparks skittering down my spine.

"I'm not proposing marriage. Or even mating," Sebastian murmured, his lips grazing the bridge of my nose. "Just... us. Together. It gets Cassandra and Penelope off my back, and Donovan and Nathaniel off yours. Plus..." His thumb traced my lower lip. "We already know how well we fit in other ways."

My brows shot up as realization dawned.

"You want a pretend relationship?"

His chuckle was dark velvet. "I'd call it... mutually beneficial companionship." He tucked a loose strand of hair behind my ear, fingers lingering. "With very generous benefits. You can't deny the chemistry between us."

A teasing smile tugged at my lips. "You're admitting you're attracted to me?"

He rolled his eyes, but amusement glittered in his gaze. "Focus, little wolf," he chided, tapping my forehead with his knuckle.

The raw honesty in his next words stole my breath. "It's been years since I've done this. I'm out of practice." His voice dropped to a husky whisper. "But after tasting you... I can't pretend I don't crave more."

Heat flooded my cheeks as his words curled around me like smoke. I bit my lip, peering up through my lashes.

This would end badly. I knew it.

Yet when his storm-gray eyes held mine, I found myself nodding.

"Okay," I breathed. "Let's try."

His grin flashed bright before turning serious. "This stays between us. No media. No rumors. Can you handle that?"

The words stung more than they should have. He'd saved me from being Donovan's dirty secret... only to make me his.

My chest ached, but I lifted my chin. "Yeah. I can handle it."

The lie tasted bitter on my tongue.

The morning sun filtered through the heavy drapes of Lillian's bedroom at Blackwood Manor. She stretched lazily, her werewolf senses immediately picking up the faint scent of freshly brewed coffee and warm croissants from the kitchen below. The digital clock read 8:17 AM - she'd slept later than usual after last night's intense training session with Sebastian.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. "Miss Lillian? Mr. Blackwood requests your presence in his study when you're ready," came Harper's polite voice through the door.

Lillian's pulse quickened. Sebastian rarely summoned her formally like this. "Thank you, Harper. I'll be down shortly."

She dressed quickly in dark jeans and a cashmere sweater, running a brush through her chestnut hair before heading downstairs. The mansion buzzed with its usual morning activity - maids polishing silver, Lucien shouting orders in the kitchen, and Oliver's laughter echoing from the breakfast room.

Sebastian's study door stood slightly ajar. Lillian knocked lightly before entering, finding him seated behind his massive mahogany desk, documents spread before him. He looked up, those piercing silver eyes making her stomach flutter.

"Good morning," he said in that deep, velvety voice. "I have news."

Lillian perched on the edge of the leather chair opposite him. "Good news or bad?"

Sebastian's lips twitched. "That depends on your perspective." He slid a cream-colored envelope across the desk. "You've been invited to the annual Lycan Summit in Geneva."

Her breath caught. The Summit was the most prestigious gathering of werewolf leaders worldwide. "But...I'm just a college student. Why would they invite me?"

Sebastian leaned back, studying her. "Because you're my mate, and whether we've completed the bond or not, the council recognizes our connection." His gaze darkened. "There's more. Donovan will be attending with Evelyn."

Lillian's fingers tightened on the envelope. Of course her ex-fated mate would be there, flaunting his new relationship. "When do we leave?"

"Three days." Sebastian stood, rounding the desk to stand before her. "This won't be easy. The Summit is as much about politics as it is about werewolf affairs. There will be challenges, both social and...physical."

She met his gaze steadily. "I can handle it."

A slow, approving smile curved his lips. "I know you can." He reached out, tucking a stray lock of hair behind her ear, his fingers lingering just a moment too long. "Pack for cold weather. Geneva in December is unforgiving."

As Lillian turned to leave, Beatrice burst into the study without knocking. "Lil! You'll never guess what just—" She stopped short upon seeing Sebastian's raised eyebrow. "Oh. Sorry, Alpha."

Sebastian sighed. "What is it, Beatrice?"

Beatrice grinned, waving her phone. "Isabella just texted! She's flying in tonight with that designer, Genevieve. They want to take Lillian shopping for Summit outfits!"

Lillian groaned. Shopping with her best friend's glamorous model sister sounded exhausting. But one glance at Sebastian's amused expression told her she had no choice. The Summit would be her debut into high werewolf society, and apparently, she needed to look the part.

As she followed Beatrice out, Lillian couldn't shake the feeling that this trip would change everything. Between Donovan's presence, the political maneuvering, and whatever unspoken tension simmered between her and Sebastian, Geneva promised to be anything but a peaceful winter getaway.
###Chapter 127 Lillian's POV

I blinked awake the next morning, momentarily disoriented. The unfamiliar opulence of the room made my pulse spike—until I felt the warmth beside me. Turning my head, I found Sebastian Blackwood still asleep, his dark lashes casting shadows over his sharp cheekbones.

Memories of last night flooded back—the Gala, his whispered promise of dating (whatever that meant between us), and the way he’d carried me to his villa, where we’d burned through the hours tangled in his silk sheets. I’d fallen asleep in his arms, and apparently, he hadn’t let me go.

A flush crept up my neck as I took in his bare torso, the sheets slipping low enough to reveal the hard planes of his abdomen. My fingers itched to trace them, but I bit my lip, scolding myself for the impulse.

Carefully, I tried to slip away, but his hand snapped around my wrist like a manacle. My breath hitched as his eyes—dark and predatory—locked onto mine.

"Running already, little wolf?" His voice was rough with sleep, sending heat pooling low in my stomach.

Before I could answer, he yanked me against him, flipping us until his weight pinned me to the mattress. I gasped, but the sound was swallowed by his mouth crashing onto mine. Even at dawn, he tasted like sin and something addictively his.

"Were you really going to sneak out?" he murmured against my lips, teeth grazing my bottom one.

"I have class," I protested weakly, though my hands were already fisting in his hair. "I need to shower and change—"

"My shower works just fine," he countered, kissing down my jaw. His lips found the pulse at my throat, and I arched into him. "And I’ll have Victoria’s closet raided for you. She won’t miss a few things."

A shiver raced down my spine as his mouth explored lower. "Where is Victoria?" I asked, half to distract myself.

Sebastian nipped my shoulder, drawing a yelp from me. To my surprise, he chuckled—a rare, rich sound that made my chest tighten. In one fluid motion, he rolled us again until I straddled him.

"Haven’t you had enough, Alpha Blackwood?" I teased, leaning down to kiss him first this time. His groan vibrated against my lips as he deepened the kiss, his tongue sweeping possessively into my mouth. When he pulled away too soon, I whimpered, chasing his lips.

His smirk was pure arrogance. "Never."

"When I've had enough of you, I'll let you know," Sebastian murmured against my skin, his lips trailing fiery kisses down the nape of my neck.

The mere thought of him ever growing tired of me sent an uneasy shiver down my spine, but I swallowed the feeling, burying it deep. I patted his chest lightly, my fingers tracing the hard planes of muscle beneath his shirt.

"I really do have to get dressed," I insisted, my voice breathier than I intended.

He exhaled dramatically, releasing me with obvious reluctance.

"Fine," he grumbled, though his eyes darkened with mischief. "But I'm showering with you."

"Wha—" I barely got the word out before he hoisted me effortlessly over his shoulder, carrying me like a sack of stolen treasure toward the bathroom as I shrieked in protest.

"You have to tell me everything about the Gala!" Beatrice demanded the moment we met in the student lounge.

After surviving two morning classes on barely three hours of sleep, the sight of the steaming coffee cup waiting for me on the table nearly brought tears to my eyes.

"You’re an angel," I groaned, snatching the cup and taking a long, desperate sip.

She smirked, leaning back in her chair. "Had a feeling you’d need it. Galas always run late." She nudged me with her elbow. "So? Spill."

"It started off fine," I admitted, swirling the coffee in my cup. "But then… things got complicated."

Her playful grin faltered, replaced by concern as she studied my face. "What do you mean?"

I hesitated, taking another slow sip, debating how much to reveal. Beatrice was my best friend—I hated keeping secrets from her. But Sebastian had asked for discretion, and I owed him that much.

"Nathaniel asked me to be his girlfriend," I finally confessed.

Her jaw dropped.

"What?! That’s huge, Lillian!" she squealed—before immediately narrowing her eyes. "Wait… you don’t look happy."

I shook my head, offering her a weak shrug.

"I’m not," I muttered. "I told him I wasn’t ready for that. That I only see him as a friend." My chest tightened at the memory of his wounded expression. "I never meant to hurt him… but he was upset."

The silence stretched between us, heavy with unspoken questions. Beatrice’s gaze bore into me, as if she could see right through my half-truths.

"There’s more, isn’t there?" she pressed.

I bit my lip.

"Always."
###Chapter 128

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse suite, painting the room in warm hues. Lillian stretched lazily beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming from the intensity of last night’s full moon. Beside her, Sebastian slept soundly, his sculpted chest rising and falling in a steady rhythm.

She traced the faint scars along his shoulder—remnants of battles fought long before she had entered his life. A small smile tugged at her lips. Even in sleep, he exuded power, the aura of a Lycan Alpha impossible to ignore.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand, shattering the peaceful silence. Beatrice’s name flashed across the screen.

"Emergency. Meet me at The Den in 20. Don’t tell Sebastian."

Lillian’s pulse spiked. Beatrice never panicked. Something was wrong.

She slipped out of bed, careful not to wake Sebastian, and dressed quickly in black jeans and a fitted leather jacket. The Den was their usual spot—a discreet café near campus where they could talk without prying ears.

The moment she stepped inside, Beatrice grabbed her wrist and dragged her into a secluded booth. Her best friend’s usually vibrant eyes were shadowed with worry.

"Donovan’s back," Beatrice whispered.

Lillian’s blood ran cold. "What?"

"He was spotted near the university last night. And Evelyn’s missing."

A sharp inhale. Evelyn—Donovan’s new mate—wasn’t just anyone. She was the daughter of Alpha Harrison, one of the most ruthless Alphas in the region. If Donovan had done something to her…

Lillian’s claws pricked at her fingertips. "Does Sebastian know?"

Beatrice shook her head. "Not yet. But we need to find Evelyn before this turns into a bloodbath."

Lillian’s mind raced. Donovan had been exiled, stripped of his title, and left to rot. His return could only mean one thing—revenge.

And she was his prime target.

The café door swung open, and a familiar scent hit her—dark, smoky, laced with fury.

Sebastian stood in the doorway, his golden eyes burning with barely restrained rage.

"Lillian," he growled. "We need to talk."

Her stomach twisted. He knew.

And if the storm in his gaze was any indication, this wasn’t just about Donovan.

Something far worse was coming.

She was quiet for a moment as she took a sip of her own coffee.

"There's nothing wrong with being friends," Beatrice said, her voice softening. "I mean, he has to understand that your fated mate abandoned you for another woman not long ago. You're still healing, Lillian. Your wolf is fragile right now." She gave me a pointed look. "You can't punish yourself for needing time, and neither should he."

I bit my lip, staring down at the dark liquid in my cup, my cheeks warming at the memory.

"Why do I feel like there's more to this?" she suddenly asked, studying my expression.

"Because there is," I murmured, peeking up at her through my lashes. "He was furious, Bea. I was terrified. I tried to get away, but... things escalated. Words were said. Boundaries were crossed."

"Boundaries?" Her grip tightened around her cup. "Did he hurt you?"

I chewed the inside of my cheek, unable to voice it.

"Oh, Goddess above!" she nearly shrieked, slamming her cup down. "He did, didn't he?!"

"Beatrice, lower your voice!" I hissed, grabbing her wrist to stop her from standing. "I don’t want this spreading."

"I swear, I'm going to rip that bastard apart—"

"Sebastian is already handling it," I blurted.

She froze, her eyes widening.

"Sebastian? Sebastian Blackwood?" she whispered, as if saying his name too loud might summon him.

I nodded.

"He saw me walking last night and stopped to give me a ride." It was a half-truth—I wasn’t ready to tell her everything. "He figured out what happened. And he promised Nathaniel wouldn’t touch me again."

Her brows shot up, and then, slowly, a smirk curled at the corner of her lips.

"Alpha Sebastian Blackwood is protecting you?" she asked, her tone dripping with implication.

My face burned, and I dropped my gaze to my hands.

"Yes," I admitted, unable to meet her eyes.

"Why do I feel like there's way more to this—"

"I have to get to my next class," I cut in abruptly, jumping to my feet. "Thanks for the coffee."

I snatched my bag and my half-finished drink, hurrying toward the door before she could pry further.

"Fine, but this conversation isn’t over!" she called after me.

I waved without looking back, my pulse racing as I rushed to my next lecture.

By the time my last class ended, I was drenched in sweat and utterly drained. The exhaustion was almost a relief—at least it drowned out everything else.

I didn't run into Beatrice as I made my way toward the school's front gates. Just as I pulled out my phone to call a ride, a sleek black car rolled to a stop in front of me, making my breath hitch.

The tinted window lowered, revealing Sebastian Blackwood's smirking face.

"Get in," he commanded, his voice low and firm.

I hesitated, glancing around to ensure no one was watching. The last thing I needed was gossip spreading about me and the Lycan chairman.

His eyes darkened. "Don’t make me ask twice, Lillian."

My pulse jumped, but I obeyed, sliding into the plush leather seat. Before I could even fasten my seatbelt, his arm snaked around my waist, pulling me flush against him. His lips crashed onto mine in a kiss so deep and possessive, my thoughts scattered.

Third Person POV

Weeks had passed since the gala, and Victoria was still inconsolable. Donovan struggled to keep up with her emotional outbursts.

"I can’t believe he just vanished without a word!" Victoria sniffled, curling into Donovan’s side as they lay in bed. "He left the country like I meant nothing to him!"

Donovan sighed, rubbing her back half-heartedly. "I’m sure it was urgent. He’ll reach out when he can."

But his mind wasn’t on Victoria’s distress. It was on Lillian.

She had been… different lately. Radiant.

Every time Donovan saw her, she was either training with Oliver under Sebastian’s watchful gaze or laughing softly with the Lycan chairman himself. He noticed the way her cheeks flushed when Sebastian’s fingers brushed hers, the way his smirk deepened whenever their eyes met.

Sometimes, Donovan would catch them whispering in corners, their voices too low to hear—until they noticed him. Then, the conversation would shift abruptly to pack business, leaving Donovan with a gnawing unease.

That evening, he had planned to take Victoria out, hoping to distract her from Nathaniel’s sudden departure. But as he approached the back doors of the training hall, he froze.

There, in the dimming light, stood Sebastian and Lillian.

She was breathless from training, her hair slightly tousled. Sebastian reached out, tucking a loose strand behind her ear with a tenderness that made Donovan’s stomach twist.

It was such a simple gesture.

Yet so undeniably intimate.

Had Lillian really moved on… with him?

###Chapter 129

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood's mountain retreat. Below her, the training grounds buzzed with activity as warriors prepared for the upcoming trials. Her fingers tightened around the railing when Donovan's familiar scent drifted up from the courtyard.

"Still watching him?" Beatrice appeared beside her, handing over a steaming mug of chamomile tea. "You'd think after everything, your wolf would stop reacting to that scent."

Lillian accepted the cup, letting the warmth seep into her palms. "It's not attraction, Bee. It's... caution." Her gaze tracked Donovan as he demonstrated a defensive maneuver to a group of younger pack members. Evelyn stood nearby, her proud smile visible even from this distance.

The sliding glass door opened behind them. "Ladies." Sebastian's deep voice sent an involuntary shiver down Lillian's spine. He joined them at the railing, his imposing frame casting a shadow across the balcony. "We leave for the summit in two hours. Are you prepared?"

"As I'll ever be," Lillian murmured, watching Oliver dart between the training warriors with his wooden practice sword. The boy's laughter floated up to them, mingling with the clang of steel.

Sebastian's phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, his expression hardening. "Victoria's flight was delayed. She won't arrive until after the opening ceremonies."

Beatrice snorted. "Convenient timing, given who's presiding over them."

Lillian's teacup clattered against the saucer. "Donovan's giving the welcome address?"

Sebastian's jaw tightened. "A last-minute change by the council. Apparently, his recent... contributions to inter-pack relations warranted the honor."

The three fell silent as Donovan's voice carried up from below, correcting a young warrior's stance with surprising patience. Lillian's wolf stirred uneasily. This new version of Donovan - composed, respected, mated to Evelyn - was far more dangerous than the volatile man she'd once known.

Beatrice's phone chimed. "Oh goddess," she breathed, showing them the screen. A gossip site displayed a photo of Victoria and Julian Mercer at an upscale restaurant, their heads close together. The caption speculated about wedding plans.

Sebastian's grip on the railing made the metal groan. "That boy is playing with fire."

Lillian touched his arm. "She's an adult, Sebastian. And Julian's a good man."

The sliding door opened again, revealing Theodore Whitmore. "Sir, Alpha Harrison's party has arrived early. They're demanding to inspect the training facilities before the other delegations."

Sebastian's eyes flashed gold. "Of course they are." He turned to Lillian. "You should stay out of sight. Harrison still hasn't forgiven you for that incident at the gala."

As Sebastian strode inside, Beatrice squeezed Lillian's hand. "You okay?"

Lillian watched Donovan help Evelyn adjust her sparring pads, their movements synchronized. "I will be," she said softly. "Once this summit is over and we're back home."

But even as she said it, the wind shifted, carrying the faintest trace of a familiar, expensive perfume. Lillian's head snapped toward the main gates just as a sleek black limousine pulled through them.

"Is that—" Beatrice began.

"Celeste Devereaux," Lillian finished, her stomach dropping. The famous actress stepped out of the car, her silver-blonde hair catching the sunlight. She stretched, then turned expectantly toward the house.

Right toward their balcony.

Right toward where Sebastian had just disappeared inside.

Beatrice whistled low. "Well. This summit just got a whole lot more interesting."

Lillian set down her untouched tea. "Or dangerous."

Below them, Donovan looked up, his gaze locking with Lillian's for one charged moment before Celeste's laughter rang out across the courtyard, drawing all attention her way.

And just like that, the game began anew.

"Hey, Dad! Are you coming to watch us train again today?" Oliver asked excitedly as Sebastian joined us in the parlor.

It had been weeks since our arrangement, and things were going far better than I'd ever imagined. A few close calls with Donovan had taught us to be more cautious—keeping our affection discreet, especially during daylight hours. Still, Sebastian continued to pick me up from college and bring me to his estate. At least twice a week, I slept in his bed, though he always made sure I left before dawn to avoid suspicion.

The only noticeable change in front of others was Sebastian’s newfound involvement in Oliver’s training—both outside and during our academic sessions. Oliver adored it, and seeing the joy on his face made my heart swell. Since Sebastian started paying more attention to him, Oliver hadn’t gotten into trouble at school. His confidence had soared.

"Would that be all right?" Sebastian asked, settling into a nearby chair.

"Yes!" Oliver beamed, his excitement contagious.

Sebastian smiled at him before his gaze flicked to mine, sending my pulse racing.

"And you?" he asked, arching a playful brow. He loved teasing me, watching the flush rise to my cheeks. "Would I be intruding?"

"I don’t mind, Mr. Blackwood," I said, winking as I stood. "But I might put you to work." Turning to Oliver, who was grinning ear to ear, I asked, "Want to show your dad what we practiced?"

He leapt up with a laugh. "Yes!" Grabbing my hand, then Sebastian’s, he tugged us both to our feet. "Let’s go!"

We let him lead us outside, his small hands pulling us along. I glanced at Sebastian, catching the rare, relaxed smile on his lips. It did something warm and fluttery to my insides.

Once we reached the training grounds, Oliver released us and dashed to the weapon chest.

"So, what exactly did you teach him?" Sebastian murmured beside me.

I smirked, crossing my arms. "You’ll see."

Oliver snatched up a handful of daggers and faced a towering oak. Sebastian and I both looked up as, one by one, Oliver hurled the blades—each strike sending pinecones and acorns raining down around us. Sebastian sidestepped, baffled, just as Oliver suddenly lunged. A swift punch to the stomach sent Sebastian stumbling back—then Oliver’s foot pressed against his throat, pinning him to the ground.

Sebastian's eyes widened in shock as the arrow tip came dangerously close to his nose. A burst of laughter escaped my lips before I could stop it.

"I taught him the art of surprise attacks," I explained with a smirk. "And the perfect pressure point to bring down even the strongest opponents. Works like a charm every time."

Sebastian arched an eyebrow, glancing between Oliver and me before breaking into a wolfish grin. In one swift motion, he grabbed Oliver's ankle and yanked him off balance. The boy yelped as Sebastian expertly flipped him onto the grass, careful to cushion the fall but making sure his dominance was clear.

Oliver gasped when Sebastian effortlessly twisted the practice bow from his grip, but instead of frustration, the boy erupted into giggles as Sebastian pinned him playfully. The sight of them wrestling like cubs in the meadow sent warmth flooding through my chest - this was the father-son bond I'd always dreamed of witnessing.

So absorbed was I in their playful sparring that I didn't notice Donovan's approach until his fingers clamped around my wrist like a steel trap, jerking me backward with enough force to make my teeth rattle.

###Chapter 130

The morning sun filtered through the heavy velvet curtains of Sebastian Blackwood's private study, casting golden streaks across the antique mahogany desk where Lillian sat fidgeting with her pen. The scent of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the faint aroma of leather-bound books that lined the walls.

"Stop chewing on that pen, darling," Sebastian murmured without looking up from his documents, his deep voice sending shivers down Lillian's spine. "You'll ruin another one."

Lillian immediately released the chewed plastic from between her teeth, her cheeks flushing. Across the room, Oliver giggled from where he was sprawled on the Persian rug, coloring in his sketchbook. The seven-year-old had become her constant shadow since she'd moved into the Blackwood estate.

A sharp knock at the door interrupted the peaceful moment. Marcus Grayson entered, his usually composed face tight with tension. "Alpha, we have a situation."

Sebastian's golden eyes flicked up immediately. "Report."

"It's Donovan Winslow," Marcus said, his jaw clenching. "He's been spotted at the border with Evelyn and a contingent from the Winslow pack. They're demanding to speak with Lillian."

Lillian's stomach dropped. The pen she'd been holding clattered to the desk. After everything that had happened—the betrayal, the public humiliation—why would Donovan show his face here now?

Sebastian was on his feet in an instant, his protective instincts flaring. "Under no circumstances is Lillian to—"

"No," Lillian interrupted, surprising even herself with the steel in her voice. She stood, smoothing her sweater. "I'll see him. But on my terms."

Sebastian's eyes darkened with concern. "Lillian—"

"I need to do this," she insisted, meeting his gaze steadily. "For closure."

After a tense moment, Sebastian gave a curt nod. "Very well. But I'll be right outside." His fingers brushed against hers as he passed, the brief contact sending warmth through her body.

The walk to the front gates felt endless. Lillian could hear the raised voices before she even reached the entrance. Donovan stood just beyond the Blackwood territory line, his new mate Evelyn clinging to his arm possessively. Behind them stood a dozen Winslow warriors, their postures aggressive.

Donovan's eyes lit up when he saw her. "Lillian! You look—"

"State your business, Donovan," Lillian cut him off coldly, crossing her arms. The once-familiar face of her former fated mate now stirred nothing but disgust in her chest.

Evelyn sneered. "Still playing the ice queen, I see. You always were—"

"I wasn't speaking to you," Lillian snapped, her wolf rising to the surface. The power in her voice made Evelyn flinch back.

Donovan held up his hands placatingly. "We came to warn you. My father is planning something—something big against the Blackwood pack. Against you specifically."

Lillian's breath caught. Archibald Winslow had never accepted her rejection of his son. But why act now?

Before she could respond, a chorus of growls erupted from the Blackwood guards as Sebastian appeared at her side, his presence commanding immediate silence. "If this is some pathetic attempt to—"

"It's not a trick," Donovan insisted, his eyes darting nervously between them. "My father has allied with Alpha Maximilian Voss. They're planning to challenge your claim to the Lycan Council seat at the next full moon gathering."

The air thickened with tension. A challenge like that could only mean one thing—a fight to the death.

Sebastian's hand found the small of Lillian's back, steadying her. "Is that all?" he asked coolly.

Donovan hesitated, then added, "There's more. They've... they've taken your mother, Lillian. Vivienne is being held at the Winslow estate as leverage."

The world tilted. Lillian's knees buckled, but Sebastian's strong arm caught her around the waist. Her mother—the only family she had left—was in danger because of her.

Sebastian's voice turned deadly quiet. "Marcus, prepare the warriors. We leave within the hour."

As Donovan and his party retreated, Lillian turned to Sebastian, her eyes burning with determination. "I'm coming with you."

Sebastian opened his mouth to protest, but the fire in her gaze silenced him. After a long moment, he nodded. "Together then."

Oliver came running up just then, his small face creased with worry. "Lillian? Are you okay?"

She knelt to hug him tightly, inhaling his comforting childlike scent. "Everything will be fine, sweetheart," she whispered, praying it wasn't a lie.

As they prepared for battle, Lillian couldn't shake the ominous feeling that this confrontation had been inevitable from the moment she'd rejected Donovan's mark. The past was coming to collect its dues—with interest.

"Donovan, what the hell are you doing?" I gasped as he pulled me further away from Sebastian and Oliver.

He stopped when we reached a secluded grove, the dappled sunlight filtering through the leaves. Without warning, he caged me against the rough bark of an ancient oak, his arms bracketing me in.

"What am I doing?" His voice was a low, dangerous growl. "What the hell do you think you're doing? What’s going on between you and Sebastian Blackwood?"

I gaped at him, my pulse hammering in my throat. "Are you out of your mind?" I snapped. "What right do you have to question me? You’re engaged to another woman!"

I shoved against his chest, but he didn’t budge. Instead, he leaned in closer, his body pressing me harder against the tree. Once, his nearness would have sent shivers down my spine—now, it only made my skin crawl.

"And weren’t you just dating another man not too long ago?" His breath was hot against my cheek. "What happened there? Did you drive him away because you couldn’t get enough of Sebastian?"

"Let go, Donovan," I hissed, twisting in his grip. "You have no right to interrogate me! Go back to your fiancée!"

His lips curled into a sneer. "I never thought you were such a slut."

"You’re the shameless one here, Mr. Winslow," I spat. "Leave me alone. My relationship with Sebastian is none of your business. We’re over."

His grip tightened. "You’re still mine, Lillian Dumont. Don’t ever forget that."

"In your dreams," I whispered, my voice dripping with venom.

Just as he opened his mouth to retort, a blur of motion wrenched him away from me. Donovan gasped as he was spun around—only to come face-to-face with a furious Sebastian.

Before Donovan could react, Sebastian’s fist collided with his stomach, sending him crumpling to the ground. My breath caught as Sebastian hauled him up by the collar and slammed him back against the tree.

"Why can’t you behave?" Sebastian snarled, his golden eyes blazing. "Every time I turn around, you’re causing trouble for Lillian! You’re engaged to my daughter—do I need to be concerned about your loyalty to her?"

"N-no, Alpha! Of course not!" Donovan stammered, his face flushing crimson. "I love Evelyn. I meant no disrespect—we were just talking!"

"It didn’t look like talking to me," Sebastian growled. "You had her pinned against a tree. The next time I catch you near Lillian, I’ll make sure you never become an Alpha. Do I make myself clear, Donovan Winslow?"

"Y-yes, Alpha," he choked out, his bravado crumbling.

Sebastian released him, and Donovan slumped against the tree, defeated. Then Sebastian turned to me, his expression unreadable—but his eyes burned with something dark and possessive.

"Donovan, what the hell are you doing?" I gasped as he dragged me further away from Sebastian and Oliver.

He stopped abruptly when we reached a secluded grove, his arms caging me against the rough bark of an ancient oak.

"What am I doing?" His voice was a low, dangerous growl. "What the hell do you think you're doing? What's going on between you and Sebastian Blackwood?"

I gaped at him, shock rendering me momentarily speechless.

"Are you insane?" I finally managed, my voice trembling with fury. "You have no right to interrogate me! You're engaged to another woman!" I shoved against his chest, but he didn’t budge—his body pressed closer, pinning me harder against the tree. Once, his proximity would have sent my pulse racing, but now, it only made my skin crawl.

"And weren’t you just dating someone else not long ago?" he sneered. "What happened there? Did he leave because you were too busy chasing after Sebastian?"

"Let me go, Donovan," I hissed, twisting in his grip. "You lost any claim over me the second you chose Evelyn. Go back to your fiancée!"

His grip tightened. "I never took you for such a whore."

The insult burned through me. "You’re the shameless one, Mr. Winslow," I spat. "This is none of your business. My relationship with Sebastian is mine to define. We’re over."

His eyes darkened. "You’ll always be mine, Lillian Dumont. Don’t you dare forget that."

"In your delusions," I shot back, my voice dripping with venom.

Just as he opened his mouth to retaliate, a powerful force yanked him away from me. Donovan gasped as he was spun around to face a furious Sebastian. Without hesitation, Sebastian drove his fist into Donovan’s stomach, sending him crashing to the ground.

My heart lodged in my throat as Sebastian hauled Donovan up by his collar and slammed him back against the tree.

"When will you learn?" Sebastian snarled, his voice laced with barely restrained rage. "Every time I turn around, you’re harassing Lillian! You’re engaged to my daughter—should I be questioning your loyalty to her?"

"N-no, Alpha! Of course not!" Donovan stammered, his face flushing crimson. "I love Victoria. This—this was just a misunderstanding!"

Sebastian’s grip tightened. "Misunderstanding? You had her pinned against a tree. If I ever catch you near her again, I’ll strip you of your rank and ensure you never become Alpha. Am I clear, Donovan Winslow?"

"Y-yes, Alpha," Donovan choked out, his bravado crumbling.

Sebastian released him with a shove, and Donovan slumped against the tree, defeated. Sebastian turned to me, his expression—

"Are you alright?" Donovan's voice was low, laced with concern.

I nodded, though my entire body trembled uncontrollably. The adrenaline still coursed through me, making my fingers twitch.

He grasped my arm firmly, pulling me closer. His warmth was a fleeting comfort. "Go inside and clean up," he murmured, his tone softer than I expected.

I swallowed hard and glanced over his shoulder at Oliver, who stood frozen, his wide eyes locked on us.

"Did Oliver see?" I whispered, my voice barely audible. "He must be terrified."

"I'll handle it," Donovan assured me, his grip tightening briefly before releasing me. "Meet me in my room. Make sure no one notices you."

I nodded, gratitude swelling in my chest. "Thank you," I breathed.

He smirked, winking before I quickly slipped away, offering Oliver a hurried wave before disappearing inside.

Victoria’s POV

Victoria had been about to step outside when she paused at the back door, her hand hovering over the handle. Through the window, her gaze snagged on the distant figures—Donovan and Lillian, pressed against a tree.

Her breath hitched.

The way his body molded against hers, the way his fingers tangled in her hair—it wasn’t just casual. It was intimate.

Her heart splintered instantly.

She’d suspected something between them, but she’d believed them when they swore it was nothing.

Now, the truth was undeniable.

And it destroyed her.

###Chapter 131

The morning sun cast golden rays through the sheer curtains of Lillian's bedroom, stirring her awake. She stretched languidly, her muscles still sore from yesterday’s intense training session with Professor Montclair. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted upstairs, courtesy of Lucien, the ever-charming head chef of the Blackwood estate.

Downstairs, the mansion buzzed with activity. Sebastian Blackwood sat at the head of the dining table, his piercing gaze scanning the morning reports Marcus Grayson had handed him. Oliver, his seven-year-old son, was enthusiastically recounting his latest adventure in the gardens to Victoria, who listened with a fond smile.

Lillian entered the dining room, her presence immediately drawing Sebastian’s attention. His eyes darkened with an unreadable emotion as she took her seat beside him.

"Sleep well?" he murmured, his voice low and rough.

Lillian nodded, though the truth was, she hadn’t slept much at all. Dreams of Donovan and Evelyn had plagued her, a constant reminder of the past she couldn’t escape.

Before she could respond, Beatrice burst into the room, her cheeks flushed with excitement. "You won’t believe what just happened!" she exclaimed, waving her phone in the air.

Lillian raised an eyebrow. "What now?"

Beatrice grinned. "Isabella just confirmed she’s coming to visit next week! And she’s bringing her new designer friend, Genevieve Laurent!"

Sebastian’s expression remained impassive, but Lillian caught the subtle tightening of his jaw. The mention of Genevieve—a woman rumored to have once been close to him—clearly unsettled him.

Lillian forced a smile. "That’s great. I’ve always wanted to meet her."

Beatrice, oblivious to the tension, continued chattering about the upcoming visit while Oliver tugged at Lillian’s sleeve.

"Will you play with me later?" he asked, his big eyes hopeful.

Lillian ruffled his hair. "Of course. But first, I have a meeting with Professor Sinclair."

Sebastian’s gaze sharpened. "About?"

Lillian hesitated. "Just some research I’ve been working on."

She didn’t mention that the research involved Donovan’s recent movements—or that she had reason to believe he was planning something dangerous.

As breakfast concluded, Theodore Whitmore approached Sebastian with a discreet whisper. The Lycan chairman’s expression darkened, and he stood abruptly.

"We’ll continue this later," he said to Lillian before striding out of the room.

Beatrice leaned in. "What was that about?"

Lillian shook her head, her stomach twisting with unease. "I don’t know. But something tells me it’s not good."

Her phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number. The screen displayed a single, chilling sentence:

"You can’t hide from me, little wolf."

Lillian’s blood ran cold.

Donovan had found her.

How utterly foolish she had been to trust them. A seething rage and gnawing jealousy churned in Victoria's stomach like a storm. She bit down on her lip hard enough to draw blood, refusing to let a single tear fall. Her gaze remained fixed as her father, Sebastian, stormed toward the pair, wrenching Donovan away from Lillian and delivering a brutal punch to his gut.

Victoria's feet felt rooted to the ground. Every instinct screamed at her to rush to Donovan’s side, to ensure he was unharmed—but she couldn’t move. She was paralyzed, her heart shattering as she stared at the man she had loved with reckless abandon.

So consumed by her turmoil, she barely registered Lillian slipping back into the house until the other woman spoke.

"Victoria..." Lillian exhaled, her voice laced with false surprise. "I didn’t realize you were here..."

"Hello, Lillian," Victoria forced out, her smile brittle. "I was just looking for Donovan. Have you seen him?"

Lillian’s gaze flickered toward the door before she turned back, her own smile a perfect imitation of warmth. "I think he’s speaking with your father," she said, shifting uncomfortably. "Is everything alright?"

Victoria studied her, the betrayal cutting deeper. She had considered Lillian a friend. How wrong she had been. Was Lillian really going to stand there and lie to her face? The thought of what might be happening between Lillian and her fiancé made her chest ache so fiercely she could barely breathe.

She had sacrificed everything for Donovan—her pride, her dignity. She had fought tooth and nail to be with him, even at the cost of her father’s respect. And now, it was all unraveling before her eyes, leaving her powerless.

"Everything’s fine," Victoria lied, forcing another hollow smile. She felt more isolated than ever. "Actually... Donovan’s family is hosting their annual barbecue tomorrow night. I’ve never met them before, so I’m a bit nervous."

Lillian nodded, though unease flickered in her eyes. "They’re... particular. They never liked me," she admitted, drawing Victoria’s full attention. "But my family attends every year."

A spark of realization ignited in Victoria’s mind. If she could win over Donovan’s family—if she could prove she was the better choice—then maybe, just maybe, he would finally see the truth. But she needed Lillian there. She needed the comparison to be undeniable.

"That’s a shame," Victoria murmured, feigning sympathy. "Why don’t they like you?"

Lillian stiffened, caught off guard. "Oh, I don’t know. They’re very traditional. If you don’t fit their standards, they’ll never accept you," she said with a dismissive shrug. "It doesn’t matter."

"You’ll be at the barbecue tomorrow, won’t you?" Victoria pressed. "You said your family goes every year."

Lillian hesitated, twisting her fingers. "We might skip this year. Given... recent events with my father."

Victoria seized her hand, desperation bleeding into her voice. "Please, Lillian. I don’t want to face them alone."

"You won’t be alone," Lillian said gently, pulling away. "You’ll have Donovan."

"I need someone who’ll stand by me if things go wrong," Victoria insisted. "We’re friends, aren’t we?"

Silence stretched between them before Lillian finally sighed, relenting with a slow nod.

"Yes," she said softly. "We are."

"So you’ll come?" Victoria’s eyes shimmered with fragile hope.

Lillian forced a smile.

"I’ll be there."

###Chapter 132

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, illuminating the sleek marble floors. Lillian stretched lazily in the king-sized bed, the silk sheets cool against her skin. The scent of freshly brewed coffee and warm pastries drifted in from the kitchen, making her stomach growl.

She had barely opened her eyes when a pair of strong arms wrapped around her waist from behind. Sebastian’s deep voice rumbled against her ear, sending shivers down her spine. "Sleep well, little wolf?"

Lillian turned in his embrace, meeting his piercing amber gaze. "Better than I have in months," she admitted, tracing the sharp line of his jaw with her fingertips.

A playful smirk tugged at his lips. "Good. Because today, we have a meeting with Alpha Harrison."

Her fingers stilled. "What?"

Sebastian’s expression darkened slightly. "He’s been sniffing around our territory again. I won’t tolerate it."

Lillian swallowed hard. The last time she’d encountered Alpha Harrison, he’d tried to take advantage of her when she was drunk. The memory still made her skin crawl.

Before she could respond, the bedroom door burst open, and a small figure launched himself onto the bed. Oliver, Sebastian’s seven-year-old son, grinned up at them, his dark curls tousled from sleep. "Morning, Dad! Morning, Lillian!"

Sebastian sighed, though his eyes softened. "Oliver, what did I say about knocking?"

The boy pouted. "But I was hungry!"

Lillian laughed, ruffling his hair. "Well, we can’t have that. Let’s go eat."

As they moved to the dining room, Lillian’s phone buzzed. A message from Beatrice lit up the screen: "Emergency. Meet me at the café in an hour. It’s about Donovan."

Her stomach twisted. Donovan—her ex-fated mate—had been nothing but trouble since their bond shattered. What could he possibly want now?

Sebastian noticed her tension. "Problem?"

She forced a smile. "Just Beatrice being dramatic. Probably another fashion crisis."

But as she sipped her coffee, unease settled in her chest. Something told her this was far from over.

"You agreed to do what?" Sebastian demanded, his arms crossed tightly over his broad chest as he fixed me with an intense glare. I sat perched on the edge of his bed, my fingers twisting nervously in my lap.

"Victoria asked me to go," I murmured, lifting my gaze just enough to meet his stormy eyes. "She’s my friend, Sebastian. If she needs me there, then I have to be there."

He exhaled sharply, dragging a hand through his dark, tousled hair. The frustration in his expression was palpable, but beneath it, I could see the concern that softened his features.

"Then I’m coming with you," he declared after a tense pause.

I stood abruptly, closing the distance between us in two quick strides. My arms wound around his neck, my fingers tangling in the hair at his nape. As much as I adored his protective instincts, this wasn’t something he could bulldoze his way through.

"And how exactly would we explain that?" I countered, arching a brow. "We’d have to come up with some excuse for why the mighty Sebastian Blackwood is suddenly shadowing me at a pack barbecue. That would raise more questions than answers."

His jaw clenched, but his arms slid around my waist, pulling me flush against him. The warmth of his body seeped into mine, steadying my racing heart.

"I was invited, you know," he muttered against my hair. "Every damn year. I just never go."

That surprised me. I tilted my head back to study his face.

"If you feel like you have to go, then go," I said softly. "But I need to prove to myself—and to everyone else—that I can handle this on my own. Besides, this is Victoria’s night. If you show up, all the attention shifts to you. That’s not fair to her."

He let out a slow breath, then pressed his forehead to mine. His scent—dark cedar and something uniquely him—wrapped around me like a shield.

"You’re right," he admitted grudgingly. "I hate it, but you’re right."

I rose onto my toes, brushing my lips against his. "Mr. Protective," I teased.

He rolled his eyes, but the corner of his mouth twitched. "That’s me," he murmured. "Always the damn protector."

Then his mouth crashed down on mine, fierce and possessive, and the rest of the night dissolved into heated touches and whispered promises before we finally succumbed to exhaustion.

"Where have you been?"

My mother’s sharp voice cut through the quiet of the morning as I descended the stairs. The sun was already high, casting golden streaks across the polished wood floors. I’d slipped back into the house just before dawn, managing a few more hours of sleep before she could notice my absence.

Or so I’d thought.

"I just woke up," I lied, rubbing at my eyes for effect.

"You were not here all night," she snapped, arms folded tightly over her chest. "Don’t think I didn’t hear you sneaking in at sunrise. This has been going on for weeks, Lillian. You disappear all night and slink back in the morning like some—"

She cut herself off, but the unspoken accusation hung heavy between us.

I swallowed hard, my fingers curling into fists at my sides.

If only she knew.

Heat rushed to my cheeks at her words.

So, she had noticed. I gnawed on my lower lip, my gaze dropping to the floor. She studied me for a long moment before her eyes widened in realization.

"Are you seeing someone?" she asked.

"What? No, of course not."

"Is it Donovan?" The sudden question sent ice through my veins. I could see the hope flickering in her eyes. "Did you two reconcile?"

"No, Mom," I said, shattering her illusion. "Donovan is engaged to someone else... remember?"

She sighed, rubbing her temples as if warding off an impending headache.

"Well, I'd hoped, since he's your fated mate, that you both would come to your senses. But I suppose that's not happening." She exhaled sharply. "Anyway, we're going to the Winslow family barbecue tonight, so make sure you’re on your best behavior."

I frowned, crossing my arms over my chest.

"I'm not the one you should be worried about," I muttered.

She rolled her eyes.

"Honestly, Lillian. That attitude is exactly what gets you into trouble," she chided. "I'm going to ask them for help with your father’s debt, so tonight needs to go smoothly."

My mouth fell open.

"Mom, we don’t need their money," I insisted. "I already told you—I’ll handle it."

"And I appreciate that, sweetheart. Truly, I do. But your father can’t stay in that horrible prison another minute. My wolf has been absorbing all his pain, and it’s tearing me apart. We need our mate back—safe. Right now, the Winslows are my last hope. They’re wealthy enough to help us. It doesn’t hurt to ask."

"The Winslows have never been kind to us," I reminded her bitterly. "No matter how much you and Dad tried to win them over, they’ve always treated us like dirt beneath their shoes—like we weren’t even worth the air we breathed."

"That’s not true," my mother countered. "Eleanor has always been kind to me, and so has her mother. They’re friends, Lillian. If we ask, they’ll help."

"You agreed to do what?" Sebastian demanded, his arms crossed tightly over his broad chest as he fixed me with an intense glare. I sat perched on the edge of his bed, my fingers twisting nervously in my lap.

"Victoria asked me to go," I admitted, keeping my voice soft. "She’s my friend, Sebastian. If she needs me there, then I have to be there."

He exhaled sharply, dragging a hand through his dark, tousled hair. "Then I’m coming with you," he declared after a tense pause.

I stood quickly, closing the distance between us before winding my arms around his neck. His protectiveness warmed me, but it wasn’t practical—not for this. His presence would only raise questions we weren’t ready to answer.

"And how exactly would we explain that?" I countered, tilting my head. "You showing up out of nowhere to defend me? People would talk, Sebastian. It’s not a good idea."

His jaw tightened, but he pulled me closer, his hands settling possessively on my waist. "I was invited, you know," he murmured against my hair. "I get an invitation every year. I just never go."

That surprised me. I leaned back slightly to study his face.

"If you want to go, then go," I told him. "But I need to do this on my own. I don’t want to rely on you stepping in every time things get hard. Besides," I added with a small smile, "this is Victoria’s moment. You being there would just steal the spotlight."

He groaned but pressed his forehead against mine in reluctant surrender. "Fine. You’re right—I hate it, but you’re right. But if he gives you even a hint of trouble—"

"I’ll call you," I promised, rising onto my toes to brush my lips against his. "Mr. Overprotective."

A reluctant smirk tugged at his mouth. "That’s me," he murmured, his voice rough. "Always your shield."

Then his lips claimed mine in a searing kiss, and soon, the bed swallowed us both, the night melting away in tangled sheets and whispered promises.

"Where have you been?" My mother’s sharp voice cut through the quiet as I descended the stairs the next morning. The sun was already high, and I had only slipped back into the house a few hours ago after leaving Sebastian’s villa. I’d managed a little more sleep before dragging myself up, hoping to pretend I’d been here all night—but my mother had clearly noticed my absence.

"I just woke up," I lied, rubbing my eyes for effect.

"You weren’t here last night," she accused, arms folded. "Don’t think I didn’t hear you sneaking in at dawn. This has been going on for weeks, Lillian. You disappear all night and only come back in the morning."

I swallowed hard. She wasn’t wrong—but I wasn’t ready to explain. Not yet.

###Chapter 133

The morning sun filtered through the heavy velvet curtains of Lillian's bedroom at Blackwood Manor. She stretched beneath the silk sheets, her werewolf senses immediately picking up the scent of freshly brewed coffee and warm croissants. The digital clock on her nightstand read 8:17 AM - she had slept in later than usual after last night's intense training session with Sebastian.

A soft knock at her door interrupted her thoughts. "Miss Lillian? Mr. Blackwood requests your presence in the study when you're ready," came Harper's polite voice through the door.

Lillian's heart skipped a beat. Sebastian rarely summoned her like this unless it was important. "Thank you, Harper. I'll be down shortly," she called back, already throwing off the covers.

Twenty minutes later, freshly showered and dressed in a simple but elegant navy blue dress, Lillian stood outside Sebastian's study. She could hear muffled voices inside - Sebastian's deep baritone and another voice she recognized as Marcus Grayson, his Beta. Taking a deep breath, she knocked.

"Come in," Sebastian's voice commanded.

The study was bathed in golden morning light, highlighting the rich mahogany furniture and floor-to-ceiling bookshelves. Sebastian stood by the window, his imposing frame silhouetted against the sunlight. Marcus sat in one of the leather armchairs, looking up as she entered.

"Good morning," Lillian said, her voice steady despite the sudden dryness in her throat.

Sebastian turned, his piercing blue eyes locking onto hers. "Lillian. We have a situation."

Marcus stood, handing her a tablet. On the screen was a news article from The Lycan Times with the headline: "Winslow Heir Announces Engagement to Blackwood Daughter Amid Controversy."

Lillian's fingers tightened around the device as she scanned the article. Donovan Winslow and Victoria Blackwood had officially announced their engagement, with the wedding set for next month. What caught her attention was the accompanying photo - Donovan standing beside Victoria, but his eyes were fixed on someone just outside the frame with an intensity that made her stomach clench.

"The Winslows are using this to gain political advantage," Marcus explained. "They're positioning this as a union between two powerful families while subtly undermining Sebastian's authority."

Sebastian moved closer, his presence radiating controlled anger. "More concerning is this." He swiped the screen to show another article - an exclusive interview with Donovan where he hinted at "unfinished business" with his former fated mate.

Lillian's breath hitched. "He's baiting me."

"Precisely," Sebastian growled. "And we can't ignore it. The Council meeting is in three days, and this will affect our standing."

Marcus cleared his throat. "There's more. Our sources say Evelyn has been making inquiries about your class schedule at the university."

A cold shiver ran down Lillian's spine. Donovan's new mate was scouting her movements. This wasn't just political - it was personal.

Sebastian's hand came to rest on her shoulder, warm and reassuring. "We need to be prepared. From now on, you'll have security detail at all times, especially on campus."

Lillian nodded, her mind racing. She met Sebastian's gaze. "What do you need me to do?"

A ghost of a smile touched his lips. "For now, act normal. But be ready. The game has changed, and Donovan just made his opening move."

As she left the study, Lillian's phone buzzed with a text from Beatrice: "URGENT. Meet me at the coffee shop. You won't believe what I just heard about Donovan."

"I don't trust them, Mom," I said firmly, my fingers tightening around the edge of the kitchen counter. "They aren’t good people."

Beatrice sighed, shaking her head as she stirred the salad. "Lillian, darling, I just don’t believe that."

I bit back a frustrated groan. Arguing with her was pointless—once she made up her mind, there was no changing it. After a tense silence, I gave up and focused on finishing lunch. Once we ate, I slipped into a designer skirt and blouse, hoping the Winslows wouldn’t find another reason to sneer at me.

I braided my hair into an elegant twist and dusted my face with light makeup, just enough to accentuate my features. By the time we were ready to leave, my stomach was in knots. Beatrice drove us in her sleek sedan, and within minutes, the towering gates of the Winslow estate loomed ahead.

The manor was massive, flanked by guest houses that looked like miniature palaces. If they wanted to, they could wipe away my father’s debts with a flick of their wrist. But the Winslows didn’t do anything without an ulterior motive. I just prayed my mother wouldn’t agree to something she’d regret.

Beatrice strode through the grand halls like she owned them, her chin high, her designer dress swaying with every confident step. No one would guess she’d spent weeks bedridden—she looked every bit the poised socialite, her hair in a flawless ponytail, her heels clicking against the marble.

We reached the sprawling backyard where the barbecue was in full swing. The Winslows had everything—a manicured garden, a glistening pool, and enough space to flaunt their wealth to the entire pack. Of course, they’d also invited the elite from neighboring packs, including Sebastian Blackwood.

Part of me hoped he’d show up. The other part dreaded it.

This was Victoria’s first official meeting with Donovan’s family, and I wanted it to go well for her. She didn’t deserve the same treatment I’d endured.

"Lillian! You’re here!" Victoria’s voice rang out as she rushed toward me, her golden hair catching the sunlight. She threw her arms around me, her smile radiant. "You look gorgeous."

I forced a smile. "So do you."

And she did. Her black backless dress hugged her curves, her cleavage tastefully on display, her hair cascading in effortless waves. She barely needed makeup—her natural glow was enough to turn heads.

A sharp pang twisted in my chest, and in my mind’s eye, my wolf lowered her head in defeat. This was the woman our mate had chosen.

I’d almost forgotten, tangled up in whatever was happening with Sebastian. But the reminder was brutal. Every time they kissed, every whispered word between them, the mark on my neck burned like a brand. I couldn’t imagine how much worse it would be once they—

"I’ve been here for hours," Victoria chirped, looping her arm through mine. "Donovan’s family is amazing."

I swallowed hard as she pulled me toward the crowd. Beatrice had already vanished, leaving me alone with the woman who’d taken everything from me.

From across the crowded hall, I spotted Donovan deep in conversation with a group of men—among them, his father, Archibald Winslow. The sight made my stomach twist.

Victoria, standing beside me, sighed dreamily. "What do you think of them?" I asked, already bracing for her gushing response.

"Oh, they're absolutely perfect," she breathed, her eyes sparkling. "I can’t imagine them ever being cruel to anyone. Especially Arabella."

I barely suppressed a scoff. Arabella, Donovan’s eighteen-year-old sister, was worse than all of them combined. Still, I was relieved they treated Victoria well—likely because she was a Blackwood. But the bitter truth stung: she fit in effortlessly, while I never had.

I bit the inside of my cheek, forcing myself to stay silent.

Then, a sharp, mocking voice cut through the air. "Well, look what the cat dragged in." A sneer curled the speaker’s lips as they stepped closer. "You’ve got some nerve showing your face here."

The words hung in the air like a challenge. My fingers twitched at my sides, but I kept my expression blank.

This was going to be a long night.
###Chapter 134

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian hurried across the campus quad. Her phone buzzed in her pocket—another message from Donovan. She gritted her teeth, resisting the urge to check it. He had been relentless since their bond shattered, sending her texts at all hours, alternating between venomous accusations and desperate pleas.

Beatrice caught up to her, breathless. "You look like you’ve seen a ghost," she panted, adjusting the strap of her bag.

Lillian forced a smile. "Just another charming message from my ex-fated mate."

Beatrice rolled her eyes. "That man needs a hobby. Preferably one that doesn’t involve harassing you."

Lillian exhaled sharply. "I wish it were that simple."

A sleek black car pulled up beside them, the window rolling down to reveal Sebastian Blackwood’s piercing gaze. "Get in," he said, his voice smooth but edged with urgency.

Lillian hesitated. "What’s going on?"

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "Victoria’s missing."

Her stomach dropped. "What do you mean, missing?"

Beatrice grabbed her arm. "You should go. I’ll cover for you in class."

Lillian nodded and slid into the car, the leather seat cool beneath her. Sebastian’s scent—dark, woodsy, and faintly dangerous—filled the space between them.

"Tell me everything," she demanded.

Sebastian’s fingers tightened on the steering wheel. "She was supposed to meet Evelyn for lunch. Never showed up. Her phone’s dead, and Donovan claims he hasn’t seen her."

Lillian’s pulse quickened. "You think he’s lying?"

Sebastian’s eyes darkened. "I think he’s desperate enough to do something stupid."

The car sped through the city, the world outside blurring into streaks of color. Lillian’s mind raced. If Donovan had taken Victoria, it wasn’t just about revenge—it was a declaration of war.

And she was caught right in the middle.

The Blackwood estate loomed ahead, its gates swinging open as they approached. Theodore Whitmore stood at the entrance, his expression grim.

"Any news?" Sebastian asked, stepping out of the car.

Theodore shook his head. "Marcus is tracking her scent, but it’s faint. Whoever took her knew how to cover their tracks."

Lillian clenched her fists. "We need to move fast."

Sebastian turned to her, his gaze intense. "You’re staying here."

She bristled. "Like hell I am."

A muscle ticked in his jaw. "This isn’t a negotiation."

Lillian met his stare without flinching. "Victoria’s my friend. I’m not sitting this out."

For a moment, the air between them crackled with tension. Then Sebastian exhaled sharply. "Fine. But you follow my lead."

She nodded, determination settling in her bones.

Wherever Victoria was, they would find her.

And Donovan would regret ever crossing them.

"You're such trash, Lillian Dumont. What the hell are you doing at my family's barbecue?" Arabella sneered, crossing her arms over her ample chest, her glossy lips pressed into a thin, disapproving line as she glared daggers at me.

"If I recall correctly, the entire pack was invited, Arabella. So, what's your problem?" I shot back, narrowing my eyes. I wasn't about to let her push me around—especially since I was only here as a favor to Victoria. The last thing I needed was Arabella's drama right now.

"That invitation doesn't include you, slut," she spat.

Was she seriously calling me a slut when Donovan was the one who walked away for someone else? The audacity.

"It's pathetic that you even showed your face here," she continued, her voice dripping with venom. "What, are you here to beg Donovan to take you back? Can't you just let him go and let him be happy? He found someone worthy of his love. Victoria fits perfectly with our family. We've only known her a short while, and she's already the perfect sister-in-law."

"I'm not here for Donovan," I muttered, clenching my fists. "I'm here to support my friend."

"Yeah, right," Arabella scoffed, rolling her eyes. "I highly doubt you're here for anyone but yourself. You're pathetic, Lillian."

"What's going on?" Donovan's deep voice cut through the tension as he stepped beside his sister. "You're not causing trouble again, are you, Bella?"

She huffed, her icy blue eyes narrowing.

"Of course not, Donovan. I'm just looking out for you. I won’t let this bitch weasel her way back into your life when you’ve clearly moved on," she said sourly.

Donovan sighed, running a hand through his dark hair in exasperation.

"I don’t need you to look out for me. I can handle myself," he assured her.

She rolled her eyes dramatically.

"I'm your sister—it's my job to protect you," she whined.

"You're my little sister," he reminded her firmly. "Please, don’t make any more trouble—for either of us."

Arabella scowled, but before she could retort, Victoria stepped in.

"Arabella was only trying to do what she thought was right," Victoria said softly, her tone gentle.

I stiffened. Was she seriously defending Arabella after everything she'd just said to me? I thought Victoria wanted me here because I was her friend, but the way she had Arabella’s back made me question everything.

Donovan wrapped an arm around Victoria’s shoulders, pulling her close. She melted against him as he pressed a kiss to her temple, his gaze flickering toward me for a brief, chilling moment. My blood ran cold.

I shifted uncomfortably in my shoes, trying to avoid his piercing stare, but I could feel it burning into the side of my face like a brand.

"I want to introduce you to some friends," Donovan murmured to Victoria.

She nodded, then glanced at me.

"I'll see you in a bit," she told me.

I forced a smile as she walked away, her hand entwined with Donovan's. He cast one last look over his shoulder before turning his attention to the group gathered across the garden.

"Lillian?" A familiar voice cut through the chatter. I turned to see Eleanor Winslow approaching, her lips pursed in disapproval. When she stopped in front of me, her perfectly arched brows lifted. "I didn’t expect to see you here tonight."

"She’s trying to win Donovan back, so of course she showed up," Arabella sneered, crossing her arms.

"Is that so?" Eleanor’s gaze never wavered from mine. "Well, I’m afraid that won’t be happening. My Donovan is far happier with his fiancée. Victoria is an absolute gem—she fits into our family much better than you ever could."

"That’s exactly what I’ve been telling her," Arabella chimed in, smirking. "Compared to Victoria, Lillian is nothing."

I opened my mouth to defend myself, but the words died on my tongue. They had always treated me this way, ever since I’d known them. It made no sense—why did they despise me so much? Maybe it was because they’d always resented my family, waiting for our downfall so they could finally rise above us. And now that they had, they relished rubbing it in my face, making sure I knew my place.

My chest ached. Donovan was supposed to be my fated mate. I was the one who had been wronged. Yet, they acted as if I were the villain. It was a bitter reminder—to me and to my wolf—that we didn’t belong here. Never had, never would. Even if Donovan accepted me, this would always be my reality.

"Victoria comes from real wealth," Eleanor continued, her voice dripping with pride. "Her father is Sebastian Blackwood. Can you imagine? My Donovan is marrying into the Blackwood dynasty. Our families are now connected. Everything has fallen perfectly into place."

"And let’s not forget how devastatingly handsome Alpha Sebastian is," Arabella purred, making my stomach churn.

"Arabella, enough," Eleanor scolded with a laugh. "He’s old enough to be your father. Still, we invited him tonight, as we do every year. I wonder if he’ll actually come now that his daughter is here. I can’t wait to officially meet him—this will cement our status as the most influential family in the country."


###Chapter 135

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting a golden glow across the room. Lillian stretched lazily, her muscles still sore from last night’s training session. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted up from the kitchen, making her stomach growl.

She padded downstairs, her bare feet sinking into the plush carpet. The mansion was unusually quiet, save for the distant clinking of silverware.

"Good morning, Miss Lillian," Giselle greeted with a warm smile as she set a steaming cup of coffee on the table.

"Morning," Lillian murmured, wrapping her fingers around the warm mug. "Where is everyone?"

"Master Sebastian left early for a meeting with Alpha Harrison," Giselle replied. "And young Master Oliver is still asleep."

Lillian nodded, taking a sip of the rich, dark brew. The bitterness was sharp on her tongue, but it chased away the last remnants of sleep.

Her phone buzzed on the counter. A message from Beatrice lit up the screen.

"Emergency girl talk. Meet me at the café in 20?"

Lillian frowned. Beatrice rarely sounded this urgent. She quickly typed back, "On my way."

The campus café was bustling with students, but Beatrice had secured their usual corner table. Her usually bright expression was clouded with worry.

"What’s wrong?" Lillian slid into the seat across from her.

Beatrice leaned in, lowering her voice. "I overheard Cassandra talking to Professor Sinclair. They’re planning something—something about you."

Lillian’s grip tightened around her cup. "What kind of something?"

"I don’t know the details," Beatrice admitted. "But it sounded serious. They mentioned Donovan’s name."

A chill ran down Lillian’s spine. Donovan had been quiet since their last confrontation, but she knew better than to think he’d given up.

Before she could respond, her phone buzzed again. This time, it was a message from an unknown number.

"You should have stayed away."

Lillian’s breath hitched. The words were simple, but the threat behind them was unmistakable.

Beatrice noticed her reaction. "What is it?"

Lillian turned the screen toward her. Beatrice’s eyes widened.

"We need to tell Sebastian," she said immediately.

Lillian hesitated. Sebastian was already dealing with pack politics and Alpha Harrison’s scheming. She didn’t want to add to his burdens.

But the look in Beatrice’s eyes told her this wasn’t something she could handle alone.

"Fine," Lillian relented. "But let’s wait until tonight. He has enough on his plate right now."

Beatrice nodded, though her frown didn’t ease. "Just promise me you’ll be careful."

Lillian forced a smile. "Always."

But as she glanced back at the ominous message, she couldn’t shake the feeling that danger was closer than she thought.

That evening, Lillian waited in Sebastian’s study, pacing the length of the room. The fire crackled in the hearth, casting flickering shadows across the walls.

The door creaked open, and Sebastian stepped inside, his expression weary but alert. "Lillian? What’s wrong?"

She handed him her phone without a word. His jaw tightened as he read the message.

"This isn’t just a threat," he said quietly. "It’s a warning."

Lillian swallowed hard. "What do we do?"

Sebastian’s eyes darkened with resolve. "We find out who sent this—and we end this before it escalates."

But as the firelight danced across his face, Lillian couldn’t help but wonder—was it already too late?

Lillian clenched her fists as Eleanor and Arabella continued their cruel laughter, their voices dripping with venom. It was as though she had become invisible to them, nothing more than a ghost of her former self in their eyes.

"What is that dreadful stench?" A familiar, icy voice cut through the air, sending a chill down Lillian's spine. She turned slowly to face Margaret Winslow—Donovan's grandmother—her piercing gaze filled with disdain.

"Oh... it's you," Margaret sneered, her lips curling in disgust. "What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be hiding somewhere, licking your wounds? My grandson finally realized his mistake and chose someone worthy. Don’t tell me you’re foolish enough to think he’d ever take you back?"

Lillian forced a polite smile, despite the sting of her words. No matter how cruel Margaret was, she had been raised to respect her elders. "I'm not here for him, Mrs. Winslow."

"Don’t you dare call me that," Margaret hissed, her eyes flashing with fury. "I was never your grandmother, and I never will be. Even when Donovan was foolish enough to marry you, I knew you were beneath him. Your entire family is nothing but trouble. It’s no surprise your father ended up where he belongs."

Lillian’s breath hitched. Margaret had always been civil—even friendly—with her parents. So why the sudden hatred?

Eleanor smirked, crossing her arms. "Honestly, it was only a matter of time before your father got locked up. He was always a snake. I never understood how he climbed so high—now we know he didn’t deserve any of it."

A fire ignited in Lillian’s chest. They could insult her all they wanted, but her family was off-limits.

Arabella giggled, twirling a strand of her hair. "He’s barely even her father, remember? She’s just some adopted stray—unwanted by her real parents, abandoned by everyone. Even Donovan saw how pathetic she was."

Their laughter rang in Lillian’s ears like shattering glass. She hated how much their words affected her. She was training to be a Gamma, for Moon’s sake! But the truth in their taunts cut deep.

She had been abandoned—by her birth parents, by Donovan, by friends who’d once claimed to care. The only constant had been her mother, Evelyn, who had been her rock through everything.

Lillian’s gaze flickered to where Evelyn stood, chatting with a few packmates. She had been lost in grief after her husband’s imprisonment, but lately, she seemed to be finding her strength again.

Then Lillian’s eyes landed on Donovan and Victoria. He was introducing her to his inner circle—the same people who had once welcomed Lillian with open arms. Now, they acted as if she didn’t exist.

The only one who had stayed by her side was Beatrice, who had warned her from the beginning that Donovan wasn’t worth her tears.

I should have listened.

The thought burned in her mind as she turned away, refusing to let them see her pain.

But she would rise from this.

And when she did, they’d regret ever underestimating her.

"He's my fated mate, Beatrice!" I had snapped at her during one of our heated arguments. "I love him. The Moon Goddess herself destined us to be together."

"But something feels off about him, Lillian. Please, just trust me on this. There's something... wrong," she had pleaded. I had brushed her off, stubbornly refusing to listen.

I didn’t realize it then, but that was the exact moment Donovan was secretly courting Victoria behind my back. The memory twisted like a knife in my chest, and I let my shoulders slump just slightly, my fingers curling into fists at my sides.

"Look at her... she knows she’s worthless, and now she’s zoning out," Arabella sneered, her voice dripping with venom. "What, are you going to start crying now?"

I lifted my chin, meeting her cold gaze head-on.

"Shedding tears over someone as heartless and pathetic as your brother would be beneath me," I spat, my voice sharp as steel. "I have too much self-respect to let him ruin my mood. Honestly, I’m glad he’s with someone like Victoria—maybe she can finally fix him. As for you? I doubt anyone could ever fix your rotten soul. Your cruelty disgusts me, and it’s almost laughable that I ever wasted time trying to earn your approval. Thank the Goddess I’m not shackled to your wretched family."

A collective gasp rippled through the room.

"You vile little—!" Eleanor hissed, her face contorted with rage.

Then, the icy splash of red wine hit my face, dripping down my cheeks and staining my blouse. I gasped as the bitter tang of alcohol touched my lips, and when I turned, Arabella stood there, her empty wine glass still raised, her lips curled in a vicious smirk.

Sophia cackled, and Eleanor folded her arms, satisfaction gleaming in her eyes.

"Don’t you ever dare speak to me like that again!" Arabella snarled.

"What exactly is going on here?"

That deep, commanding voice sent a jolt through my entire body, my skin prickling with heat as humiliation burned through me. My wolf stirred instantly, recognizing that voice—because we both knew exactly who it belonged to.

###Chapter 136

The morning sun cast golden rays through the sheer curtains of Lillian’s bedroom, stirring her awake. She stretched lazily, her muscles still sore from last night’s intense training session with Professor Montclair. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted up from the kitchen, signaling that Giselle, the head maid, was already at work.

Lillian’s phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Beatrice lit up the screen: "Emergency brunch meeting. Café Laurent. 10 AM. Wear something cute—Dominic will be there."

She groaned, rubbing her temples. Beatrice had been trying to set her up with Dominic Whitaker for weeks, despite Lillian’s repeated insistence that she wasn’t interested. Still, she couldn’t ignore her best friend’s summons.

Downstairs, Sebastian Blackwood sat at the dining table, reading the morning papers while Oliver, his seven-year-old son, enthusiastically devoured a stack of pancakes. The sight warmed Lillian’s heart—Sebastian had softened so much since she’d first met him.

"Morning," she murmured, pouring herself a cup of coffee.

Sebastian glanced up, his piercing blue eyes locking onto hers. "You’re up early."

"Beatrice has plans," she said, rolling her eyes. "Apparently, my love life is a crisis that needs immediate intervention."

A smirk tugged at his lips. "Should I be concerned?"

Lillian snorted. "Hardly. Dominic is nice, but he’s not exactly..." She trailed off, heat creeping up her neck as Sebastian raised an eyebrow.

"Not exactly what?"

Not you. The thought startled her, and she quickly took a sip of coffee to hide her expression.

Before she could answer, Victoria swept into the room, her designer heels clicking against the marble floor. "Father, we need to talk," she announced, her tone sharp.

Sebastian’s expression darkened. "What is it?"

Victoria’s gaze flickered to Lillian before she spoke. "Donovan is back in town."

The name sent a jolt through Lillian’s body. Donovan—her ex-fated mate, the man who had betrayed her for Evelyn. The man whose rejection had nearly destroyed her.

Sebastian’s grip tightened around his coffee cup. "Where?"

"At the Winslow estate," Victoria said. "And he’s not alone. Evelyn is with him."

Lillian’s stomach twisted. She had moved on—or so she’d thought. But the mere mention of Donovan still stirred something bitter inside her.

Sebastian stood abruptly. "Marcus," he called, summoning his Beta. "Double the patrols around the territory. I want eyes on Donovan at all times."

Lillian swallowed hard. "Why is he back?"

Victoria’s lips curled into a cold smile. "Rumor has it, he’s here to challenge Father’s authority."

A tense silence settled over the room.

Then, Oliver piped up, syrup smeared across his cheek. "Does this mean we get to fight?"

Sebastian exhaled, ruffling his son’s hair. "No, Oliver. It means we stay alert."

But Lillian knew better.

Donovan’s return wasn’t just a coincidence.

It was a declaration of war.

And she was right in the middle of it.

"And just who do you think you are?" Eleanor sneered, arching a perfectly sculpted brow at the man standing behind me.

"This is a private gathering," Margaret cut in, her voice dripping with disdain. "You weren't invited."
"More importantly, this is a pack event, and you are not pack," Eleanor added with an exaggerated eye roll.

Arabella, however, had a different opinion. "He's gorgeous though. Maybe he should stay," she cooed, fluttering her lashes at him. My stomach twisted violently, and I had to bite back the growl rising in my throat.

Then, a warm hand settled on my shoulder, and my entire body reacted instantly—muscles relaxing, breath releasing in a slow exhale I hadn’t realized I was holding.

"Are you alright?" Sebastian murmured, his voice low and intimate. I glanced up, meeting those piercing eyes filled with concern.

I nodded, though my chest felt like it was caving in.

"Oh, please," Arabella laughed, tossing her hair. "Don’t tell me you actually hired an escort for the pack barbecue. That’s a new low, even for you."
"You seriously needed to pay someone to be your date tonight?" Eleanor asked, shaking her head in mock pity. "How pathetic."

"Excuse me?" Sebastian’s voice cut through the air like a blade, his brows lifting in disbelief.

Dressed casually in dark jeans and a fitted shirt, he looked different—softer, yet no less striking. Without his usual tailored suits, he was almost unrecognizable, especially since he’d been keeping a low profile in the media lately. I stayed silent, watching as Donovan’s family dug their own graves with every word.

Sebastian’s expression darkened as he took in their blatant disrespect.

"I can’t believe she even dared to show her face here—but with a rented man?" Margaret scoffed, curling her lip. "You truly have no shame!"

"Is this how you treat your guests?" Sebastian’s voice was dangerously calm, his gaze sharpening. "With this level of disrespect? And who, exactly, is responsible for the wine spilled on her dress?"

"It’s fine," I said quickly, gripping his arm. "Coming here was a mistake. I’d like to leave."

"Not until I find out who did this," he said, his tone leaving no room for argument. A flush crept up my cheeks at the protective edge in his voice.

"She deserved it after what she said to me," Arabella snapped, crossing her arms. "Bet you didn’t know she was engaged to my brother. He didn’t want her—just like her birth parents didn’t. You’re wasting your time with this nobody. She’s an abandoned orphan, and no one in their right mind would ever want her. I’m glad my brother came to his senses. You should do the same."

"Is that so?" Sebastian’s voice dropped to a lethal whisper, sending a shiver down my spine.

The air around us grew thick with tension, and for the first time, I saw a flicker of unease cross Arabella’s face.

Sebastian took a slow step forward, his presence commanding the space effortlessly. "Let me make one thing very clear," he said, his voice deceptively soft. "If any of you ever speak to her like that again, you’ll regret it for the rest of your miserable lives."

A stunned silence fell over the group.

Then, Margaret scoffed. "And who the hell are you to threaten us?"

Sebastian’s lips curled into a cold smile. "The man who owns the land this pack stands on."

Their faces drained of color.

I barely had time to process the shock in their expressions before Sebastian turned to me, his hand sliding down to intertwine with mine. "Let’s go."

As we walked away, the whispers erupted behind us—but for the first time in years, I didn’t care.

Because Sebastian Blackwood had just declared war on my behalf.

And I had a feeling he never lost.

The air crackled with tension as Arabella Winslow twirled a lock of her golden hair around her finger, her crimson lips curling into a predatory smile. "How much is she paying you to be here?" she purred, her gaze raking over Sebastian Blackwood's imposing frame. "I'll double it if you walk away with me right now."

"Arabella Winslow!" Eleanor Winslow snapped, though amusement danced in her cold eyes. "You're barely eighteen, and this man could be your father. You don't need to stoop to Lillian's level—paying for company like some desperate social climber."

Arabella pouted, batting her lashes. "Oh, Mother, look at him. He’s magnificent. He could do so much better than that nobody. Her family is bankrupt—if she promised you anything, it’s a lie. But I can give you cash. Now."

Sebastian's golden eyes darkened, a dangerous smirk playing on his lips. "And you think I need your petty bribes?"

Eleanor stepped forward, her designer heels clicking sharply against the marble floor. "Listen, whoever you are—this is a family matter." She glared at him as if he were nothing more than a stain on her pristine world. "So unless you have business here, we were in the middle of a discussion."

Sebastian's voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "A discussion that involves throwing wine on her?" His aura thickened, the air growing heavy with the promise of violence. I was stunned the Winslows hadn’t sensed it yet—Sebastian was barely restraining himself, his wolf bristling beneath the surface.

Eleanor scoffed, her manicured finger jabbing toward me. "She disrespected our family."

Sebastian’s jaw clenched. "You are the ones who should be begging for forgiveness." His grip on my shoulder tightened, anchoring me in place before him.

Eleanor’s lips pursed, her arrogance faltering for just a second before she lifted her chin. "Sir, I don’t know who you think you are, but—"

"Daddy?"

The voice was soft, trembling.

Victoria Blackwood stepped around the women, her wide eyes locked on Sebastian. The color drained from Eleanor’s face. Arabella’s mouth fell open, her flirtatious smirk vanishing. Margaret Winslow staggered back, clutching her pearls.

All three women stood frozen, their arrogance shattered in an instant.

Sebastian’s gaze softened only slightly as it landed on his daughter. "I was invited," he said coolly. "I came to pay my respects to my daughter’s future in-laws. But it seems I’m not welcome."

His eyes flicked back to Eleanor, who looked as if she might faint.

"I—I’m so sorry," she stammered, her voice barely above a whisper. "Mr. Blackwood, I didn’t—"

"Alpha," he corrected, his voice a growl. His eyes flashed gold, his wolf surging forward. "Only those I respect may address me by name. And right now? You’ve earned none of it."

The room fell deathly silent.


###Chapter 137

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian hurried across the campus quad. Her phone buzzed incessantly—another message from Donovan. She gritted her teeth, resisting the urge to throw it into the nearest fountain.

"You can't ignore me forever, Lillian."

She exhaled sharply, shoving the device into her pocket. Beatrice would kill her if she saw how many unread texts she had.

A familiar voice called out behind her. "Running late again?"

Lillian turned to see Oliver trotting toward her, his backpack bouncing with each step. The seven-year-old grinned up at her, his dark curls tousled from the wind.

"Your dad's going to lecture me if I'm late dropping you off," she muttered, ruffling his hair.

Oliver shrugged. "He lectures everyone. Even Theodore."

Lillian snorted. The image of the stern butler getting scolded by Sebastian Blackwood was almost too amusing.

As they approached the sleek black car waiting at the curb, the door swung open. Sebastian leaned against the frame, arms crossed, his piercing gaze locked onto her.

"You're ten minutes late," he said, voice low.

Lillian swallowed. "Traffic."

One dark brow arched. "You walked."

Oliver snickered, climbing into the car. "She's bad at lying."

Sebastian's lips twitched, but his expression remained unreadable. "Get in. We have things to discuss."

Her pulse spiked. Things to discuss never meant anything good.

The moment the car pulled away, Sebastian turned to her. "Donovan contacted me."

Lillian stiffened. "What?"

"He claims you're avoiding him."

"I am avoiding him," she snapped. "He's engaged to Victoria, remember?"

Sebastian studied her, his golden eyes flickering with something she couldn't place. "He says you're still his fated mate."

A bitter laugh escaped her. "Fate has a terrible sense of humor."

Silence settled between them, thick and heavy. Oliver, sensing the tension, fiddled with his seatbelt.

Finally, Sebastian spoke again. "There's a gala tonight. You're attending."

Lillian blinked. "Since when do I get invited to galas?"

"Since now." His tone left no room for argument. "Wear something appropriate."

She opened her mouth to protest, but the car rolled to a stop outside the Blackwood estate. Sebastian stepped out without another word, leaving her staring after him, heart pounding.

Beatrice was going to love this.

"Father!" Victoria gasped, rushing to his side. "Please, don't be rude to Donovan's family."

"I'm not the one being rude," Sebastian Blackwood growled through clenched teeth.

"It was all a misunderstanding," Margaret Winslow croaked, her voice strained. "We didn't recognize you."

"And that excuses your behavior?" Sebastian arched a brow, his golden eyes flashing with barely contained fury. "Do you address every man who walks through your doors as a call boy? Or am I just special?"

Victoria inhaled sharply, her gaze darting between Margaret and Eleanor Winslow, who stood with her head bowed, trembling like a leaf in the wind. Arabella looked as if she might faint at any moment.

"I'm glad I arrived when I did," Sebastian continued, his lip curling in disgust. "Who knows how much worse this could have gotten?"

"Alpha Blackwood, it was an honest mistake," Margaret pleaded, wringing her hands. "We didn’t realize it was you. Please, don’t take offense."

"How could I not—"

"Father, please!" Victoria cut in, her eyes wide with desperation. "Not here... not like this. Don’t make a scene..."

Only then did I notice the growing crowd of onlookers, their curious gazes burning into us. My cheeks flamed with humiliation. My mother stared at me, her expression unreadable, and I couldn’t bring myself to meet her eyes.

Sebastian looked ready to unleash another scathing remark, but he hesitated. Instead, he straightened his jacket and exhaled sharply.

"I’ll take my leave," he muttered.

"Alpha, you are more than welcome to stay," Eleanor began, but her words were drowned out by a deep, authoritative voice.

"Alpha Blackwood, what an honor to have you here."

I turned to see Archibald Winslow striding toward us, his brow furrowed. A nobleman and supposedly a close friend of my father’s—though after Eleanor and Margaret’s earlier cruelty, I wasn’t sure who to trust anymore.

"Archibald," Sebastian acknowledged coldly. "I was just leaving."

"But you’ve only just arrived," Archibald protested, stopping beside his wife, who suddenly looked impossibly small under his scrutiny. "Dinner is nearly ready. At least let the bartender fix you a drink."

"It seems my presence isn’t appreciated," Sebastian said, his gaze flicking pointedly toward Eleanor.

Archibald’s expression darkened as he turned to his wife.

"What exactly happened?" he demanded, his aura thickening with barely restrained anger. "What did you do?"

"Please, Father. Just let it go. They didn’t mean any harm..." Victoria pleaded, her voice trembling slightly.

"Whatever my wife may have said to you, I’m certain it can be resolved," Archibald said, his piercing gaze still locked onto Eleanor’s face. "I apologize for any discourtesy. Please stay a while longer and enjoy the refreshments."

"It’s alright..." I murmured, low enough for only Sebastian to hear. "You can stay."

He turned to look at me, his eyes narrowing briefly before softening as they met mine.

"I want to take you home," he said quietly, his voice laced with concern.

"I’ll stay for a little while," I assured him. "I just need to clean up."

He studied me for a long moment before giving a curt nod. I didn’t miss the knowing glance exchanged between Eleanor and Arabella, having caught snippets of our conversation.

"I’ll help you," my mother said, slipping her arm through mine. I hadn’t even noticed her approach until she spoke, but her presence was a welcome relief.

I nodded and turned back to Sebastian.

"I’ll see you later, Alpha," I said, louder this time for the benefit of those around us.

He gave me a stiff nod before turning back to Archibald. Their voices faded into the background as we made our way into the Winslow manor and toward the nearest bathroom.

Once inside, my mother shut the door behind us and let out a heavy sigh.

"How could you cause such a scene?" she asked, her tone a mix of exasperation and worry.

"I wasn’t the one making a scene," I muttered under my breath.

She grabbed a hand towel and ran it under warm water before pressing it to the wine stain on my blouse.

"Listen, there’s something you need to know, and I don’t want you to panic," she said, her voice unusually serious.

A knot of unease twisted in my stomach.

"What is it?" I urged, watching her closely.

"I spoke to Donovan’s parents earlier. Archibald went over the details of how much we could get for the house," she explained, her words making my heart plummet.

"Our house?" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

She nodded.

"It would cover a significant portion of your father’s debts. It won’t be enough to secure his release... but it’s a start," she said, her expression strained.

"If you sell the house, where will we live?" I demanded, my fingers tightening around the towel in my hands.

She hesitated, focusing on scrubbing at the stain rather than meeting my eyes.

"Mom?" I pressed when she didn’t answer.

The silence stretched between us, thick with unspoken tension.

She exhaled softly, lifting her gaze to meet mine. Her eyes shimmered with tenderness and regret. "Eleanor and Archibald have offered us their guest room," she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper.

A cold numbness spread through my limbs. "What are you saying?" My words came out sharper than intended, my pulse hammering in my ears.

Her fingers twisted nervously in her lap. "I mean... we'd be staying here. With the Winslow family."

The air between us grew thick, suffocating. My mind reeled, struggling to process the implications. Living under the same roof as them?

A bitter taste coated my tongue. "You can't be serious."

Her expression crumpled. "It's just until—"

"Until what?" I cut in, my voice cracking. "Until they decide they're done playing house with us?"

She flinched, and guilt immediately clawed at my chest. But the anger—the sheer, blinding betrayal—burned hotter.

The Winslows. The very people who had orchestrated my ruin.

And now, we were expected to live as their guests?

The irony was almost laughable.

Almost.

Because beneath the fury, something far more dangerous simmered.

Fear.

Fear of what this arrangement would cost us.

Fear of what it would change.

And most of all—

Fear that once we stepped through those doors, we might never find our way back out.
###Chapter 138

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, illuminating the scattered papers on his desk. Lillian stirred in the massive bed, her limbs tangled in silk sheets, the scent of their mating still lingering in the air.

She stretched, wincing slightly at the soreness in her muscles—a pleasant reminder of last night’s intensity. Her fingers brushed over the mark on her neck, the bond pulsing warmly beneath her skin.

Sebastian was already gone, his side of the bed cold.

Lillian sighed, rolling onto her back. The silence of the penthouse was unnerving. No laughter from Oliver, no quiet murmurs from the staff. Just the distant hum of the city below.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Beatrice.

"You alive? Or did the Lycan Alpha finally wear you out?"

Lillian snorted, typing back. "Barely. Where are you?"

"Café downstairs. Get dressed. We have things to discuss."

Lillian dragged herself out of bed, padding to the walk-in closet. Sebastian’s scent clung to everything—his tailored suits, the cashmere sweaters, even the polished leather of his shoes. She pulled on a simple black dress, one of the few things she’d brought with her, and headed for the door.

The penthouse elevator descended smoothly, opening into the lobby of the luxury high-rise. The café was just outside, a chic little spot with marble tables and ivy crawling up the walls.

Beatrice sat in the corner, two steaming cups in front of her. She raised an eyebrow as Lillian approached.

"Damn. You look like you got hit by a truck."

Lillian slumped into the chair, grabbing the coffee. "Feels like it."

Beatrice smirked. "That good, huh?"

Lillian shot her a glare, but her cheeks warmed. "Shut up."

Beatrice leaned forward, her expression turning serious. "Okay, enough teasing. We have a problem."

Lillian frowned. "What now?"

"Donovan’s back in town."

The name sent a chill down Lillian’s spine. Her ex-fated mate—the man who had betrayed her, humiliated her, and left her for Evelyn.

"Why?" Lillian’s grip tightened around the cup.

Beatrice lowered her voice. "Rumor is, he’s trying to challenge Sebastian’s authority. He’s been gathering allies—disgruntled pack members, rival Alphas. He wants the Lycan throne."

Lillian’s stomach twisted. Donovan had always been ambitious, but this? This was war.

"And Victoria?" she asked quietly.

Beatrice hesitated. "She’s still engaged to him. Publicly, at least. But I don’t think she knows what he’s planning."

Lillian exhaled sharply. "Sebastian needs to know."

Beatrice nodded. "Yeah. But be careful. Donovan’s not playing fair anymore."

Lillian’s phone buzzed again. A message from an unknown number.

"Miss me, little wolf?"

Her blood ran cold.

Donovan.

Beatrice saw her expression and snatched the phone. Her face darkened. "That bastard."

Lillian swallowed hard. "He’s watching me."

Beatrice stood abruptly, tossing cash onto the table. "We’re leaving. Now."

Lillian followed, her pulse racing. The game had just changed.

And Donovan had made the first move.

"Mom, you can't be serious!" I gasped, my voice trembling with disbelief. "How could you agree to this?"

"I know it's not ideal, but—"

"Not ideal?!" I cut her off, my hands clenching into fists at my sides.

"Don't raise your voice at me, Lillian," my mother chided, her tone sharp. "We need the money, and I'm running out of options."

"If the Winslows are so eager for you to sell our house, why not just let us borrow the money? I thought you were going to ask them!" I shook my head, frustration boiling inside me. "This makes no sense."

"I couldn't bring myself to ask them," she admitted, sighing heavily. "Especially after Archibald explained his risky investments and his concerns about the outcome." She twisted the towel in her hands. "Besides, my pride wouldn't allow me to beg for handouts."

"But you have no problem asking Donovan for handouts?" I countered, arching a brow.

"That's different," she murmured, avoiding my gaze. "He was your fated mate. You were supposed to marry him."

"Isn't Eleanor your friend?" I pressed, giving her a pointed look. "Why not ask her for help?"

She bit her lip, her eyes dropping to the floor.

"I just... can't. This is the easiest solution, and I’ll still have my dignity. Living here won’t be so bad. They’ve been kind enough to open their home to us, and I intend to accept."

"Is living here not damaging to your pride?" I challenged.

She sighed, finally meeting my eyes.

"It’s different," she said softly. "I’m sorry for upsetting you, Lillian. But if you can’t get the money from Donovan, then this is our only option. After selling the house, we’ll be closer to helping your father. That’s all that matters right now."

Tears welled in my eyes before I could stop them. I didn’t want to cry—not here, in the Winslow manor. Not at all. But the weight of this decision crushed me.

"I can’t live here, Mom," I whispered, my voice breaking.

"Oh, sweetheart," she soothed, reaching for my hand. "If this is about Donovan and Victoria, they won’t be here. Once he becomes Alpha, they’ll move into the packhouse. You won’t have to see them every day." She squeezed my fingers. "And once he marks and mates with her, your bond will be broken. You won’t have to suffer the pain of a severed connection anymore."

"That’s not what this is about," I said, shaking my head. "His family hates me. They’ll make my life unbearable. I was here for five minutes, and Arabella already dumped wine on me."

She sighed, her shoulders slumping.


"I'm certain it was just an accident. Arabella is a sweet girl—she's still so young," my mother insisted, her voice soft with forced optimism.

"She's eighteen, Mom. Legally an adult," I reminded her, my fingers tightening around the edge of the kitchen counter.

"That's hardly grown," she murmured, avoiding my gaze. "I'm sure she didn't mean any harm."

"She told me Donovan deserved better than me," I whispered, the words scraping against my throat. "That I wasn’t good enough for her brother."

My mother sighed, folding the hand towel neatly before tucking it away. When she turned back to me, her hands settled on my shoulders, warm and steady. I lifted my tear-filled eyes to meet hers, and the worry swimming in her gaze made my chest ache. She was afraid—for us, for our future—and I wasn’t making it any easier for her.

I swallowed hard, wiping away the damp trails on my cheeks with the back of my hand.

"I'm sorry," I whispered. "I don’t mean to sound ungrateful. I know you’re doing your best."

She nodded, exhaling slowly.

"I love you, Lillian," she said softly. "I hate dropping this on you so suddenly. But if you don’t think you can stay here… maybe Beatrice has space for you?"

Her words hit like a physical blow. So, it was either live with the Winslows or find somewhere else to go. My mother had already made her choice—just like everyone else in my life, she wasn’t choosing me. She was leaving, just as Arabella had predicted. Had she known? Was that why she’d thrown those cruel words at me—everyone leaves you?

I bit down on my lower lip, willing the fresh wave of tears to stay at bay. I didn’t want to cry anymore, but the pressure behind my eyes was relentless.

"Let’s just enjoy the rest of the barbecue," she suggested, tilting my chin up gently. Then, as if remembering something, she added, "Oh, by the way… do you know Alpha Sebastian Blackwood? He seemed to recognize you."

My pulse stuttered. I forced myself to shake my head, hating the lie even as it left my lips.

"Not really," I said. "I tutor in his pack sometimes, so we’ve crossed paths. Nothing more than that."

A half-truth—one that settled between us like a fragile truce.


###Chapter 139

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the Blackwood estate, painting the marble floors in warm hues. Lillian stretched beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming from the intensity of last night’s full moon run with Sebastian. His presence lingered in the room—his scent, his warmth, the possessive way his arms had wrapped around her.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Miss Lillian?" Sophia’s voice carried through the door. "Breakfast is ready. Alpha Blackwood requested your presence in the dining room."

Lillian sighed, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. "Thank you, Sophia. I’ll be down shortly."

She dressed quickly, opting for a simple yet elegant emerald-green dress that accentuated her curves. The Blackwood mansion was alive with activity—maids bustling about, the rich aroma of Lucien’s cooking wafting through the halls.

When she entered the dining room, Sebastian was already seated at the head of the table, his sharp gaze flickering up as she approached. Oliver sat beside him, swinging his legs and grinning at her.

"Morning, Lillian!" he chirped.

"Good morning, Oliver," she replied, ruffling his hair before taking her seat.

Sebastian’s fingers brushed against hers beneath the table, sending a shiver down her spine. "Sleep well?" he murmured, his voice low and intimate.

She shot him a knowing look. "As well as one can after running through the woods all night."

His lips curved into a smirk.

Before she could respond, Marcus entered, his expression grim. "Alpha, we have a situation."

Sebastian’s demeanor shifted instantly. "What is it?"

"The Winslows are making moves again. Donovan was spotted near the eastern border last night."

Lillian’s stomach twisted. Donovan. The name alone was enough to sour her mood.

Sebastian’s grip on his fork tightened. "Send Julian and a team to investigate. I want eyes on him at all times."

Marcus nodded and left swiftly.

Oliver, sensing the tension, poked at his pancakes. "Is everything okay?"

Sebastian forced a smile. "Everything’s fine, son. Eat up."

But Lillian knew better. The Winslows—Donovan especially—were never up to anything good. And if they were encroaching on Blackwood territory, it could only mean one thing: war was brewing.

She met Sebastian’s gaze, a silent understanding passing between them.

Whatever was coming, they would face it together.

"He's a ruthless Alpha," my mother warned, her voice barely above a whisper. "Sebastian Blackwood is a Lycan chairman—powerful, dangerous. You must be careful around him. Show him the respect he demands." I nodded, swallowing hard.

My mother finished cleaning up the spilled wine in the bathroom before turning to leave, her footsteps fading down the hall. Alone with my thoughts, I stared at my reflection in the mirror, my chest tight with unease. Just as I reached for the door handle, it swung open before I could turn it.

I froze.

Sebastian stood in the doorway, his towering frame blocking my exit. His dark eyes locked onto mine, unreadable yet intense.

"W-what are you doing in here?" I whispered, my voice trembling.

He stepped inside without a word, shutting the door behind him with a quiet click. The air between us thickened, charged with something unspoken.

"Sebastian—" I started, but he cut me off, pressing me back against the counter. His lips crashed onto mine, hot and demanding, stealing my breath.

Fire ignited beneath my skin, my pulse roaring in my ears. His kiss was relentless, possessive, yet achingly tender—like he couldn’t decide whether to devour me or worship me. When his teeth grazed my bottom lip, a soft whimper escaped me before I could stop it.

Reality snapped back into place.

I pushed against his chest, breaking the kiss with a gasp. "Sebastian, we can’t—not here."

He growled low in his throat, pressing his forehead to mine. "Then let’s leave."

A smile tugged at my lips at his impatience, but guilt quickly smothered it. I couldn’t go—not yet. Not when my mother was still trapped in this viper’s nest.

"I can’t," I murmured. "Not while she’s here. I don’t trust them."

Sebastian pulled back slightly, his frown deepening. "Have they always treated you like this?"

I bit my lip, then nodded.

"They’ve never accepted me."

His aura darkened, a storm brewing in his gaze. "No one disrespects you. Not while I’m here."

I smiled weakly. His protectiveness was intoxicating, but dangerous. "I can handle myself."

"Really?" His voice dripped with skepticism. "Because I recall someone drenched in wine."

"A momentary lapse," I said, lifting my chin. "It won’t happen again."

"Lillian—"

"Please," I begged, my fingers curling into his shirt. "Just let it go."

He studied me for a long moment before exhaling sharply. "Fine. But if they cross the line again, I won’t hold back."

I rose onto my toes, sealing his promise with another kiss. The moment our lips met, my heart stuttered, betraying me. This was supposed to be temporary—just a game to keep others off our backs. But with every touch, every stolen moment, I was falling deeper.

And that terrified me.

Third Person POV

"You humiliated this family in front of Sebastian Blackwood!" Archibald Winslow hissed at his wife, Eleanor. He had just finished smoothing things over with Sebastian before the Lycan chairman excused himself.

"It was an accident," Eleanor protested, though her tone lacked remorse. "I didn’t recognize him."

"And that excuses your behavior?" Archibald’s jaw clenched. "We are nobility. Act like it."

Eleanor scoffed, crossing her arms. "We’re already doing charity by housing the Dumonts. What more do you want?"

The Winslows had taken in Lillian and her mother out of obligation—not kindness. With Vivienne Dumont’s financial ruin, they had no choice but to seek shelter under their former rivals’ roof. Eleanor couldn’t hide her smug satisfaction.

"You’re lucky if I can salvage this," Archibald muttered.

Eleanor didn’t know the extent of Sebastian’s influence—how much their wealth depended on his favor. Crossing him could ruin them.

Her frown deepened.

Why had Sebastian Blackwood appeared at that exact moment? And why did he act as if he knew Lillian? There was something between them—something she intended to uncover.

Because a nobody like Lillian Dumont didn’t belong in Sebastian’s world.

And Eleanor would prove it.
###Chapter 140

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the campus quad, her boots crunching over scattered acorns. The morning sun cast long shadows, painting the world in golden hues. She inhaled deeply, savoring the quiet before the storm of classes began.

Her phone buzzed—a message from Beatrice.

"Meet me at the café. Urgent."

Lillian frowned. Beatrice rarely used the word urgent.

The campus café was bustling, the hum of conversation mingling with the rich aroma of coffee. Beatrice sat in their usual corner, fingers drumming against the table. Her usually bright eyes were shadowed with worry.

Lillian slid into the seat across from her. "What's going on?"

Beatrice leaned in, voice low. "I overheard Cassandra talking to Professor Sinclair. They’re planning something—something about you and Donovan."

A chill slithered down Lillian’s spine. "What exactly did you hear?"

"Not everything," Beatrice admitted. "But they mentioned the upcoming gala. And Donovan’s name came up more than once."

The gala—an annual event hosted by Sebastian Blackwood’s pack. Lillian had been invited as Sebastian’s guest, a fact that had already stirred whispers. If Donovan was involved, nothing good could come of it.

Lillian’s grip tightened around her coffee cup. "I need to warn Sebastian."

Beatrice nodded. "But be careful. If Cassandra’s involved, she won’t make it easy."

As if on cue, Cassandra herself sauntered into the café, flanked by her usual entourage. Her sharp gaze locked onto Lillian, lips curling into a smirk.

"Trouble’s here," Beatrice muttered.

Lillian forced a calm she didn’t feel. "Let’s go."

They stood, but Cassandra intercepted them at the door. "Running away so soon, Lillian?"

Lillian met her gaze evenly. "Just busy. Unlike some people, I have things to do."

Cassandra’s smirk faltered, replaced by a flicker of irritation. "Enjoy your little victory while it lasts. Things are about to change."

The threat hung in the air as Lillian and Beatrice walked away.

"What was that about?" Beatrice whispered.

Lillian exhaled slowly. "I don’t know. But I intend to find out."

The game was far from over. And this time, she wouldn’t be playing by their rules.

The fury that surged through me as I watched Donovan's family torment Lillian was unlike anything I'd ever experienced. It took every ounce of my self-control not to tear them apart right then and there. Staying at this damned barbecue was the last thing I wanted, but Lillian had pleaded with me to let it go—for now. And I wasn’t leaving without her.

My gaze followed her as she stood awkwardly among a group of girls her age, her cheeks flushed pink with discomfort. Tuning out Archibald Winslow’s meaningless chatter beside me, I sharpened my Lycan hearing to eavesdrop on their conversation.

"It must be humiliating watching your fated mate with another she-wolf," one of them sneered.

"Honestly, I’m surprised you even showed up," another added with a mocking laugh.

A low growl rumbled in my chest, startling the entire table. The sudden silence snapped me back to reality, and I forced a tight smile as curious eyes turned toward me.

"Apologies," I said smoothly, rising to my feet. "If you’ll excuse me for a moment."

I didn’t have a plan, but I sure as hell wasn’t going to sit there while they belittled her. Striding toward them, I caught the tail end of their cruel remarks before sliding an arm possessively around Lillian’s shoulders.

"Ladies," I greeted coolly, watching their jaws drop in unison. "Mind if I steal Miss Dumont away?"

"A-Alpha Blackwood?" one stammered, her eyes wide with shock. "I—it’s an honor—"

I ignored her, my expression icy.

The other girl blinked between us, suspicion flickering in her gaze. "I didn’t realize you and Lillian were acquainted."

Lillian opened her mouth to respond, but I cut in.

"My relationship with Miss Dumont is none of your concern," I said curtly. "Now, if you’ll excuse us."

Without waiting for protest, I guided Lillian away, her fingers tense under my touch. She shot me a bewildered look, her face still flushed.

"I could’ve handled that," she muttered, staring at the ground.

"You shouldn’t have to," I murmured back.

We returned to the table, and I nudged a plate of food toward her. She picked at it silently, avoiding eye contact.

"Everything alright?" Archibald asked, glancing between us.

I nodded. "As a Lycan, I’m attuned to everything around me. I overheard some… unpleasant remarks. Thought I’d intervene."

"My apologies, Alpha," he said quickly. "This isn’t the impression I wanted to give. Our pack isn’t usually like this."

I took a slow sip of wine, my gaze sharpening. "If my daughter is to marry into your family, trust must be established. If I can’t trust you to respect packmates, how can I trust you with my blood?"

"You have my word, Alpha," he insisted. "We won’t disappoint you."

"We’ll see," I said quietly.

The next hour passed in tense conversation before guests finally began leaving.

"I’m heading out," Vivienne Dumont told Lillian. "Coming with me?"

Lillian hesitated, her eyes flickering to me briefly before answering. "I have work tonight. I’ll just get an Uber."

Her mother nodded, pulling her into a quick hug. "Think about what we discussed," she whispered. "We’ll talk more later."

Lillian stiffened but nodded, watching her mother leave with an unreadable expression. The lost look in her eyes told me she’d had enough.

"I should go as well," I announced, standing. My gaze locked onto Lillian. "I’ll drive you."

She opened her mouth to refuse, then sighed in resignation. "Thank you," she murmured.

"You’re not leaving with your mother?" Eleanor Winslow asked, brows raised.

"I have work," Lillian explained.

"Oh? What do you do?" Eleanor pressed, skepticism lacing her tone.

"I’m a tutor," Lillian blurted. "For a child in Alpha Blackwood’s pack. That’s why he’s giving me a ride."

Eleanor studied us for a long moment before nodding, though her disbelief was obvious. Not that I cared.

As we walked toward my car, Lillian exhaled shakily. "That was… intense."

I smirked. "Get used to it, little wolf. I don’t tolerate disrespect—especially not toward you."

Her breath hitched, but she said nothing.

Good. She’d learn soon enough—when it came to her, my patience had limits. And Donovan’s family had just crossed them.

"Come on, Lillian," I urged, already turning on my heel to leave. My fingers curled into fists at my sides, the tension in my shoulders betraying my calm facade.

Eleanor Winslow hurried after me, her heels clicking sharply against the marble floor. "Thank you for coming, Alpha. It was truly an honor to meet you." Her voice dripped with false sweetness, the kind that made my skin crawl.

I paused just long enough to glance over my shoulder, my lips twisting into a cold smile. "I wish I could say the same." The shock that flashed across her face was almost satisfying—almost.

Lillian fell into step beside me as we strode toward the exit, her presence a quiet comfort. The air outside was crisp, a stark contrast to the stifling atmosphere inside the Winslow estate.

"," I muttered under my breath, shaking my head. Some offers weren't worth the price.

###Chapter 141

The morning sun cast golden rays through the sheer curtains of Lillian's bedroom, stirring her awake. She stretched languidly, her muscles still sore from yesterday’s intense training session. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted up from the kitchen, signaling that Sebastian was already awake.

Lillian padded downstairs, her bare feet sinking into the plush carpet. The mansion was unusually quiet, save for the faint clinking of silverware. When she entered the dining room, she found Sebastian seated at the head of the table, his sharp features softened by the morning light. Across from him, Oliver was enthusiastically devouring a stack of pancakes, syrup dripping down his chin.

"Good morning," Lillian murmured, sliding into her usual seat.

Sebastian glanced up, his piercing gaze locking onto hers. "Sleep well?"

She nodded, though the truth was, her dreams had been restless—filled with shadows of Donovan and the lingering threat of Evelyn.

Before she could dwell on it further, Beatrice burst into the room, her cheeks flushed with excitement. "You won’t believe what just happened!" she exclaimed, waving her phone in the air.

Lillian arched a brow. "What?"

Beatrice grinned. "Isabella just texted me. She’s coming back from Paris today!"

Lillian’s heart skipped a beat. Isabella Fontaine, Beatrice’s glamorous older sister, was a renowned fashion model who had been traveling Europe for months. Her return meant more than just a reunion—it meant potential trouble. Isabella had always been fiercely protective of Beatrice, and she had never approved of Lillian’s involvement with Sebastian.

Sebastian’s expression remained unreadable, but Lillian caught the subtle tightening of his jaw. "When does her flight arrive?" he asked, his voice deceptively calm.

"Tonight at seven," Beatrice replied, oblivious to the tension. "She wants us to meet her at the airport."

Lillian exhaled slowly. This was going to be interesting.

Just then, Marcus Grayson, Sebastian’s Beta, strode into the room, his expression grim. "Alpha, we have a problem."

Sebastian set down his coffee cup. "What is it?"

Marcus hesitated, his gaze flickering to Lillian before he spoke. "Donovan was spotted near the eastern border last night. He wasn’t alone."

A chill ran down Lillian’s spine. "Who was with him?"

Marcus’s lips thinned. "Evelyn. And from the reports, they weren’t just passing through."

Sebastian’s eyes darkened with barely restrained fury. "Gather the warriors. We’re not taking any chances."

Lillian’s fingers curled into fists. Donovan had made his move—and this time, she wouldn’t let him get away.

As the room erupted into action, one thought echoed in her mind: The game has just begun.

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the lavish bedroom as Lillian stirred beneath silk sheets. Her fingers brushed against the empty space beside her—Sebastian had already left for his early meeting. A faint trace of his sandalwood scent lingered on the pillow, making her heart flutter.

Downstairs, the mansion buzzed with activity. Giselle, the head maid, directed staff with quiet efficiency while Lucien, the flirtatious head chef, winked at the new kitchen assistant. The aroma of freshly baked croissants and espresso filled the air.

Lillian dressed quickly, opting for a simple ivory blouse and tailored slacks. As she descended the grand staircase, Oliver came barreling toward her, his schoolbag swinging wildly. "Lillian! You promised to walk me to school today!" His silver eyes—so like his father's—sparkled with excitement.

"Of course I did," she laughed, ruffling his dark curls. "But first, breakfast. I heard Lucien made your favorite chocolate pancakes."

The dining room was already occupied. Beatrice sat at the table, scrolling through her phone while nibbling toast. "Morning, sleepyhead," she teased. "Sebastian left you a note." She slid an embossed envelope across the table.

Lillian's pulse quickened as she broke the wax seal. The message was brief: "Meeting Alpha Harrison at noon. Stay vigilant. —S" Her grip tightened on the paper. Harrison had been circling their territory like a vulture since the failed alliance with the Winslows.

"Everything okay?" Beatrice asked, noticing her friend's tension.

"Just pack business," Lillian deflected, tucking the note into her pocket. She forced a smile. "Ready, Oliver?"

Outside, autumn leaves crunched underfoot as they walked toward the elite Lycan Academy. Oliver chattered about his science project while Lillian scanned their surroundings—a habit since Donovan's betrayal. Every shadow seemed to conceal threats.

At the school gates, Oliver hugged her tightly. "Will you pick me up too?"

"Wouldn't miss it," she promised, kissing his forehead. As he disappeared inside, her phone vibrated. An unknown number flashed on the screen: "He knows about the moonstone. Watch your back."

Ice flooded her veins. Only three people knew about the ancient artifact hidden in Sebastian's vault—herself, Sebastian, and... Donovan.

A black sedan pulled up abruptly. The window rolled down to reveal Marcus, Sebastian's beta. His expression was grim. "We have a situation. Harrison just challenged Sebastian to a blood duel."

Lillian's claws unsheathed instinctively. "When?"

"Tonight. At midnight." Marcus lowered his voice. "There's more. Victoria was seen entering Harrison's territory this morning."

The world tilted. Sebastian's daughter—Donovan's fiancée—consorting with their enemy? Lillian's phone buzzed again. This time, it was Sebastian: "Meet me at the old chapel. Now. Come alone."

The message didn't sound like him. Too abrupt. No endearment. Her wolf snarled a warning.

Beatrice grabbed her arm. "Lil, your eyes are glowing. What's wrong?"

"Someone's setting a trap," Lillian whispered. "And I think Sebastian just walked into it."

I didn’t wait around to hear another word from them—I was done for the night, and if I had to carry Lillian out of there kicking and screaming, I would. Thankfully, it didn’t come to that. Lillian muttered quick goodbyes, though most were met with silence, before hurrying after me, her head bowed until we were far enough away.

"Thank the Moon Goddess that’s over," she exhaled, tension visibly leaving her shoulders.

"Hmm," I responded, my tone clipped.

We reached the front of the Winslow manor, where Marcus stood beside the car, the back door already open.

"How did it go?" he asked as we approached.

"One more misstep, and I’m withdrawing every cent from his company," I said without hesitation, making Lillian gasp. She likely had no idea I was the silent backer behind Archibald’s empire—that with a single word, I could leave them bankrupt.

"That bad, huh?" Marcus chuckled, amusement lacing his voice. "Where to?"

"The Blackwood Estate," I ordered. "I need to wash this night off my skin."

He nodded, smirking as he waited for us to climb in. I was pleased to see the privacy partition already raised. Marcus shut the door behind us and slid into the driver’s seat.

Soon, the Winslow manor faded into the distance.

Lillian sighed, gazing out the window. The skirt she wore clung to her curves, stopping just above her knees, and the sight of her sent heat coiling low in my gut. I’d wanted her from the moment I saw her tonight, but I’d restrained myself—until now.

Without warning, I unclipped her seatbelt—and mine—then hauled her onto my lap in one swift motion.

"Sebastian!" she yelped as my fingers traced up her inner thigh, goosebumps rising in their wake. "What are you—?"

"What does it look like?" I murmured, my touch teasing higher. Her breath hitched, her body arching into me.

I claimed her lips, swallowing her gasp as my tongue delved deep, tasting her. She moaned, her fingers tangling in my hair, when my hand slipped beneath the lace of her panties.

A part of me was disappointed she’d worn them—but another was relieved. It meant she hadn’t dressed for him.

I nipped at her bottom lip, drunk on her sweetness, her scent wrapping around me like a spell. She was already wet, her arousal soaking through the thin fabric as I circled her clit.

"Sebastian..." she whimpered against my mouth, her hips rocking into my touch.

I tugged her panties aside, sliding two fingers inside her, curling them just right. She cried out, her back arching as pleasure coiled tight within her.

"Oh, Goddess—!" Her voice broke as I added a third finger, her walls fluttering around me.

I could feel her climax building, her thighs trembling, her breath coming in ragged gasps. "Yes—right there—don’t stop—!"

I had no intention of stopping. Not until she shattered.

But then my wolf surged forward with a snarl, "MINE!"

My canines lengthened, my gaze locking onto the delicate curve of her neck—the perfect place to mark her. A growl tore from my throat before I wrestled control back, forcing my wolf down.

I released her abruptly, and she nearly tumbled off my lap, her chest heaving, confusion flashing in her wide eyes.

After a stunned moment, she scrambled back to her seat, putting distance between us.

And I—

I clenched my fists, fighting the beast within.

Because if I didn’t, I’d claim her right here.

And there’d be no going back.

###Chapter 142

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the cobblestone path leading to Blackwood Manor. Her heart pounded in her chest, the weight of recent events pressing heavily on her shoulders. The confrontation with Donovan had left her drained, but she refused to let it break her.

Sebastian stood at the grand entrance, his piercing gaze locking onto hers the moment she appeared. His presence was as commanding as ever, the aura of a Lycan Alpha radiating from him. Yet, there was something softer in his expression now—something that made her pulse quicken.

"You're late," he remarked, though there was no real reproach in his tone.

Lillian exhaled sharply, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear. "Traffic was worse than expected."

A smirk tugged at the corner of his lips. "Excuses already?"

She rolled her eyes but couldn't suppress the small smile that escaped. "I see you're in a charming mood today."

Before he could retort, Oliver came barreling down the hallway, nearly colliding with Lillian in his excitement. "You're here!" he exclaimed, wrapping his arms around her waist.

She laughed, ruffling his hair. "Missed me that much?"

Oliver nodded vigorously. "Dad was being boring again."

Sebastian arched a brow. "Boring?"

"You were just sitting in your office all day," Oliver accused, sticking out his tongue.

Lillian bit back a laugh as Sebastian sighed dramatically. "Betrayed by my own son."

The lighthearted moment was interrupted when Marcus appeared, his expression grim. "Alpha, we have a situation."

Sebastian's demeanor shifted instantly, the playful glint in his eyes replaced by sharp focus. "What is it?"

Marcus hesitated, glancing at Lillian and Oliver. "Perhaps we should discuss this privately."

Lillian instinctively tightened her grip on Oliver's shoulder, sensing the tension. Whatever it was, it couldn't be good.

Sebastian gave a curt nod before turning to her. "Take Oliver inside. I'll join you shortly."

She wanted to argue—wanted to demand answers—but the look in his eyes silenced her. Instead, she nodded and guided Oliver toward the dining hall, casting one last glance over her shoulder as Sebastian and Marcus disappeared down the corridor.

Something was coming.

And she had a feeling it would change everything.

The expression on Donovan's face when Lillian left the party with her father didn't escape Victoria's notice. There was a raw, aching longing in his gaze—like a lost puppy searching for its owner. It twisted Victoria's heart into knots. She bit her lip hard, refusing to let tears fall in front of Donovan's family. She had worked too hard to earn their approval, and she wouldn’t let that slip away now.

"Victoria, sweetheart, don’t let that insignificant girl upset you," Eleanor murmured, offering a reassuring smile. "She’s beneath you."

Arabella scoffed, crossing her arms. "Honestly, the idea of my brother being with her again makes me physically ill."

That single word—again—snagged Victoria’s attention like a fishhook. Her pulse spiked.

"What do you mean, again?" she demanded, her voice sharper than intended.

Arabella blinked, caught off guard. "Huh?"

"You said again," Victoria pressed. "As if they’ve been together before."

Eleanor’s grip tightened around Arabella’s wrist, making her wince. "She didn’t mean anything by it," Eleanor interjected with an overly bright laugh. "Just a slip of the tongue. She’s exhausted, poor thing."

Arabella’s cheeks flushed. "Right. Just a mistake."

Victoria wasn’t buying it.

Her gaze flicked back to Donovan, who was still staring at the empty space where Lillian had vanished. A cold knot formed in her stomach.

They lied to me.

Forcing a polished smile, she turned back to Eleanor and Arabella. "It was lovely meeting you both. We should get together soon—perhaps for brunch?"

Their eyes lit up instantly.

"We’d adore that," Eleanor gushed.

"Perfect. I’ll get your details from Donovan, and we’ll arrange something at the Silver Crescent Country Club," Victoria said smoothly. The club was exclusive—only the elite were granted entry, and an invitation from her was a golden ticket. Their eager nods told her they understood the privilege.

Without waiting for more pleasantries, Victoria strode toward Donovan. He was so lost in thought he didn’t notice her until she gripped his shoulder.

"I’m exhausted," she said flatly. "Take me somewhere to rest."

He blinked, slow to process her words. "Hmm?"

Her nails dug into her palms. "I said, I need to rest."

Finally, he focused on her. His expression was distant, distracted—like she was an afterthought. It stung.

"You can use my old room upstairs," he said after a beat. "I need to stay down here a while longer."

She nodded stiffly.

He led her through the grand manor, up the winding staircase to his childhood bedroom. The space was a time capsule—trophies lining the shelves, faded video game posters on the walls. It should’ve been endearing, but all she felt was a gnawing suspicion.

Then she saw it.

A framed photo on the nightstand.

Donovan stood beside someone—someone who had been cut out of the picture.

Her breath hitched.

Who was it?

Kelsey’s words echoed in her mind. Again.

Her fingers traced the jagged edges of the missing figure.

Was it Lillian?

The betrayal from yesterday resurfaced—Donovan and Lillian pressed against that tree, his hands on her waist. The memory cracked her heart open all over again.

They both lied.

And now, she was going to find out why.

###Chapter 143

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, illuminating the scattered papers on his desk. Lillian stretched lazily in the oversized armchair, her bare feet tucked beneath her as she watched him work. The scent of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the faint trace of his sandalwood cologne, wrapping around her like a comforting embrace.

“You’re staring,” Sebastian murmured without looking up, his fingers flying across the keyboard.

Lillian smirked. “Can’t help it. Watching you brood over financial reports is oddly fascinating.”

He finally lifted his gaze, those piercing silver eyes locking onto hers. “Brooding?”

“Mmm. Very intense. Very Lycan Chairman of you.”

A low chuckle rumbled in his chest, and he leaned back in his chair, stretching his arms behind his head. The movement pulled his shirt taut across his broad shoulders, and Lillian’s pulse quickened.

“If you’re trying to distract me, little wolf, it’s working.”

She grinned, swinging her legs off the chair and padding over to him. “Good.”

Before she could reach him, the door burst open, and Oliver came barreling in, his dark curls bouncing with every step. “Dad! Lillian! You have to see this!”

Sebastian sighed, rubbing his temple. “Oliver, what did we say about knocking?”

The boy barely registered the reprimand, his excitement too overwhelming. “But it’s important! Look!” He shoved his tablet into Sebastian’s hands, the screen displaying a breaking news headline:

"Darkmoon Pack Announces Alliance with Voss Enterprises—Alpha Maximilian Voss to Challenge Blackwood Holdings."

Lillian’s stomach dropped.

Sebastian’s expression darkened as he scanned the article, his jaw tightening. “So, Levi finally made his move.”

Oliver tugged at his sleeve. “Does this mean we’re in trouble?”

Sebastian ruffled his son’s hair, forcing a reassuring smile. “Not a chance. But it seems we’ll have to cut our vacation short.”

Lillian crossed her arms, her mind racing. “What’s his angle? He wouldn’t make a public challenge unless he was confident.”

Sebastian’s phone buzzed—a message from Marcus Grayson. He read it swiftly before locking the screen. “He’s not just challenging me. He’s targeting you.”

Lillian blinked. “Me?”

“He’s calling into question your legitimacy as my mate. Claims our bond is fabricated for political gain.”

A growl rose in her throat. “That bastard.”

Sebastian stood, his presence suddenly dominating the room. “Pack your things. We leave in an hour.”

Oliver looked between them, wide-eyed. “Are we going to fight?”

Sebastian’s lips curled into a dangerous smile. “Oh, we’re going to do much more than that.”

Lillian met his gaze, her own resolve hardening. The game had just changed.

And she was ready to play.

Victoria rose from the bed, restless and unable to settle. Her fingers itched to do something—anything—to distract herself from the gnawing suspicion in her chest. She wandered over to Donovan’s childhood dresser, pulling open the drawers one by one. Inside, she found only old clothes, likely too small for him now. A sigh escaped her lips as she moved to the nightstand, rifling through its contents with little hope.

A half-empty box of condoms and some over-the-counter painkillers were all she found.

Frustration coiled tight in her stomach as she stepped into the adjoining bathroom. She wasn’t even sure what she was searching for—some trace, some proof that Lillian had been here. The only possible clues were an outdated bottle of shampoo, a brand she knew Donovan would never use, and a stick of lavender-scented deodorant that definitely wasn’t his.

Her pulse quickened. Could these belong to Lillian?

She cursed herself for never paying attention to the small details—what kind of shampoo Lillian preferred, what scent she wore. The bathroom had clearly been scrubbed recently, spotless and devoid of even a single stray hair. Victoria groaned, slamming the door shut behind her as she stormed back into the bedroom.

Then she froze.

A leather strap peeked out from beneath the bed.

Her breath hitched as she crouched down, fingers curling around the strap and tugging. A sleek laptop bag slid into view.

Her brows lifted in surprise.

Donovan had been carrying a laptop earlier—she’d seen him tuck it away somewhere. But why hide it under his childhood bed? Unless… unless he didn’t want her to see what was on it.

Her hands trembled slightly as she hauled the bag onto the mattress and unzipped it. The laptop inside was a high-end model, heavier than she expected. The screen flickered to life when she opened it, and she bit her lip, bracing herself.

A password prompt blinked back at her.

She tried Donovan’s birthday first.

Incorrect.

Her own birthday next.

Incorrect again.

A lump formed in her throat. She typed in the date they’d first met, fingers clumsy with nerves.

Nothing.

Tears blurred her vision as she wiped at her cheeks with the back of her hand. There was one last date she could try—one she dreaded entering.

With a shaky breath, she typed in Lillian’s birthday.

The screen unlocked.

Victoria’s heart shattered.

Hot tears spilled down her face as she choked back a sob, teeth sinking into her bottom lip to keep herself quiet. The truth was undeniable now—something had been going on between Lillian and Donovan. They had both lied to her.

How could they?

She swiped angrily at her tears, straightening her spine. If they wanted to deceive her, fine. But she would uncover every last secret they’d kept.

Scrolling through Donovan’s files, she found nothing unusual at first—business documents, Alpha-related forms, all perfectly mundane. Then, her cursor hovered over a hidden folder, its label sending a fresh wave of dread through her.

The folder was locked. Victoria's stomach twisted into knots, a sickening dread creeping up her spine. She already knew she wouldn't like what she found inside. With trembling fingers, she typed in Lillian's birthday—and just like before, the file opened instantly.

Her heart splintered into a thousand jagged pieces as the images loaded.

Nudes. Of Lillian.

There she was, sprawled across Donovan's sheets, her body on full display.

A choked sob escaped Victoria's lips as she scrolled through the photos, each one more devastating than the last. In some, Donovan was there too—his lips pressed to Lillian's neck, her arms wrapped around him, her smile radiant.

Bile burned the back of Victoria's throat.

They had been sleeping together.

For how long?

Why had they lied?

Had it started before or after he met her?

The questions swirled in her mind like a storm, making her vision blur. She needed answers—now—before she lost her mind completely.

Desperate, she clicked into Donovan's browser history, scanning his recent searches. Then she saw it—a tab for his social media. She frowned. She already followed one of his accounts, but what if he had others?

Her breath hitched when a completely unfamiliar social media site loaded. A private account, one she never knew existed. His profile picture wasn't even his face—just some obscure symbol. His name was abbreviated, too, making it impossible to recognize unless you already knew.

She wasn't following this account. Normally, she wouldn’t have been able to see anything—but since she was logged in as him, the entire profile unfolded before her.

Photos. So many photos.

Donovan and Lillian, hand in hand.

Donovan and Lillian, kissing.

Lillian had tagged him in posts—but they stopped abruptly around the time he met Victoria.

And then she noticed something else.

Lillian had deactivated her own account.

Victoria kept scrolling, her pulse roaring in her ears—until one caption made her entire world collapse in an instant.

It was under a photo of Lillian and Donovan, her arms around his neck, her smile blinding.

"Spent the day with my fated mate! Couldn’t be happier!! Love you so much, Donovan!"

And beneath it, his reply:

"You and me forever, babe. Love you more."
###Chapter 144

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood's penthouse, illuminating the spacious living area. Lillian stirred beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming with the remnants of last night's passion. She stretched lazily, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her.

Sebastian was already gone.

A faint scent of his cologne lingered in the air, mingling with the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Lillian sat up, running a hand through her tousled hair as she glanced at the clock. It was later than she thought.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand—a message from Beatrice.

"Girl, where are you? Class starts in twenty!"

Lillian groaned. She had completely forgotten about her morning lecture. Throwing off the covers, she scrambled out of bed, her bare feet hitting the cool marble floor. She grabbed the first outfit she could find—a simple blouse and jeans—before rushing to the ensuite bathroom.

As she splashed cold water on her face, her reflection stared back at her. Dark circles shadowed her eyes, evidence of the sleepless nights she'd spent tangled in Sebastian's arms. A small, satisfied smile tugged at her lips.

She was falling for him. Hard.

And that terrified her.

Because no matter how much she tried to push the thought away, the truth remained—Sebastian Blackwood was dangerous. Not just because he was a Lycan chairman, but because he had the power to destroy her heart.

Her phone buzzed again. Another message from Beatrice.

"Seriously, Lil. Professor Sinclair is already giving me the death glare."

Lillian cursed under her breath. She grabbed her bag and bolted out of the bedroom, nearly colliding with Theodore Whitmore in the hallway.

"Miss Lillian," the butler greeted smoothly, stepping aside with practiced grace. "Breakfast is ready in the dining room."

"No time," Lillian panted, adjusting the strap of her bag. "I'm late for class."

Theodore's lips twitched in amusement. "Mr. Blackwood left instructions for you to eat before leaving."

Lillian hesitated. She knew Sebastian well enough by now to recognize an order disguised as a suggestion. With a resigned sigh, she followed Theodore to the dining room, where a lavish spread awaited her—fresh fruit, pastries, and a steaming cup of coffee.

She ate quickly, her mind racing. Last night had been... intense. Sebastian had been different—softer, almost vulnerable. He'd held her like she was something precious, whispering words against her skin that made her heart stutter.

But then the morning came, and he was gone.

Typical.

Lillian swallowed the last bite of her croissant and stood. "Tell Sebastian—" She paused, unsure what to say. Tell him I miss him? Tell him I'm scared?

Theodore waited patiently.

"Never mind," she muttered, grabbing her coffee. "I'll see him later."

She rushed out of the penthouse, her thoughts a tangled mess. The elevator ride down felt endless, each second stretching like taffy. When the doors finally opened, she sprinted through the lobby, ignoring the curious glances from the staff.

Outside, the city was alive with noise and movement. Lillian hailed a cab, sliding into the backseat with a huff.

"University campus," she told the driver. "Fast."

As the car sped through the streets, Lillian leaned her head against the window, watching the world blur past. She couldn't shake the feeling that something was coming—something big.

And she wasn't sure she was ready for it.

Donovan returned to his room late that night after bidding his family goodnight. He had intended to escort Victoria home, but when he found his room empty, his brow furrowed. There was no trace of her. Pulling out his phone, he checked his messages and saw one from her.

Victoria: Went home. Enjoy your time with your family. See you soon. Love you.

Donovan exhaled sharply and shoved his phone back into his pocket. He couldn’t even pretend to be upset—if anything, he was relieved she had left. It meant he didn’t have to keep up the charade of happiness any longer. The memory of watching Lillian walk away with Sebastian Blackwood sent a cold shiver down his spine. The way Sebastian had defended her, the way Lillian had looked at him like he was her entire world—it made Donovan’s blood boil.

Had she really moved on? They were fated mates, for Moon’s sake. His mark still lingered on her neck. How could she feel nothing for him? The thought twisted his stomach into knots.

He didn’t want to lose Lillian. Marrying Victoria was purely strategic—her status as Sebastian’s daughter could secure him the Alpha position of the Redmoon Pack. But he still wanted Lillian by his side, even if just as his secret. The idea of her in another man’s arms was unbearable.

Instead of going home, he decided to head to the local pub. He needed a drink—or ten—to drown out the image of Lillian with Sebastian. The crisp autumn air bit at his skin as he walked, the night quiet save for the rustle of fallen leaves beneath his boots.

The bar wasn’t crowded at this hour, just a few stragglers lingering over drinks. Some faces he recognized from the pack, who nodded in acknowledgment as he passed. He returned the gesture before sliding onto a stool at the counter.

"What can I get you?" Benedict, the bartender, asked.

"Whiskey," Donovan muttered, slapping his credit card onto the bar. "And keep them coming."

"Rough night?" Benedict arched a brow as he took the card and opened a tab.

"Something like that," Donovan grumbled, dragging a hand through his hair.

Benedict chuckled and poured the drink, sliding it across the bar. Donovan caught it effortlessly and downed it in one go, earning a surprised look from the bartender. Without a word, Benedict poured him another.

Again, Donovan drained the glass and slammed it down, pushing it back for a refill. Benedict obliged—refusing a man like Donovan wasn’t an option.

By his sixth drink, the room was spinning. He barely registered when someone took the seat beside him.

"A classic martini," a smooth, feminine voice ordered.

"Coming right up," Benedict replied.

Donovan lifted his heavy gaze and nearly choked. Sitting beside him was a woman who looked exactly like Lillian—long hair cascading down her back, lips painted a deep red, and dressed in a scandalously short dress. When she glanced at him, she offered a coy smile.

"Lillian…" he breathed, the alcohol making her image blur and sway.

She arched a brow. "Name’s Rosalind," she corrected, her voice dripping with amusement.

He didn’t care. All that mattered was that she looked like her.

"You okay?" Rosalind asked after a beat, sipping her martini while studying him with wary curiosity. Then her eyes widened in recognition. "Wait… I know you. You’re Donovan Cash, aren’t you?"

"Yeah," he admitted. "Has anyone ever told you how stunning you are?"

She laughed, taking another sip. "Daily."

Silence stretched between them before she shifted under his intense stare. "Buy me another drink," she teased, twirling the stem of her glass between her fingers, "and maybe I’ll let you take me home."

Donovan didn’t hesitate. He glanced at Benedict. "Get her another."

Benedict smirked, looking to Rosalind for confirmation. She tilted her head, assessing Donovan before grinning. "Make it two. And put everything on his tab."

"Yes, ma’am," Benedict chuckled.

Several martinis later, Rosalind was loose-limbed and giggly. When Donovan pulled her against him, she didn’t resist. His lips crashed onto hers, tasting of whiskey and desperation. She melted into it, feeding off his weakness. Men like him were easy prey—and she knew exactly how to profit from it.


###Chapter 145

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s estate. The sun had barely risen, casting a golden hue over the sprawling gardens below. She tightened the silk robe around her, the fabric whispering against her skin.

Inside, the mansion was already stirring to life. The clatter of dishes from the kitchen signaled Lucien Dubois, the head chef, preparing breakfast. Giselle Beaumont, the head maid, moved with practiced efficiency, directing the staff with quiet authority.

Lillian’s thoughts drifted to the events of the previous night—the confrontation with Donovan, the way his new mate, Evelyn, had clung to his arm with possessive glee. The memory sent a sharp pang through her chest, but she refused to let it show.

A soft knock at the door pulled her from her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, turning as the door creaked open.

Beatrice Whitaker, her best friend, peeked inside, her dark curls bouncing. "You’re up early," she remarked, stepping into the room. "Couldn’t sleep?"

Lillian sighed, running a hand through her tousled hair. "Too much on my mind."

Beatrice crossed the room, her expression softening. "Donovan?"

Lillian nodded, her jaw tightening. "He’s making it impossible to move on. Every time I think I’m over him, he shows up with Evelyn, flaunting their bond like some twisted trophy."

Beatrice squeezed her shoulder. "You’re stronger than this, Lillian. And you have Sebastian now. He’s ten times the man Donovan could ever hope to be."

Lillian’s lips twitched into a faint smile. "I know. It’s just… hard."

Before Beatrice could respond, another knock sounded—this one firmer, more authoritative.

Sebastian stood in the doorway, his broad frame filling the space. His dark eyes flicked between the two women before settling on Lillian. "We need to talk," he said, his voice low and commanding.

Beatrice shot Lillian a knowing look before slipping out of the room, closing the door behind her.

Sebastian stepped closer, his presence overwhelming in the best way. "What’s wrong?" he asked, his gaze searching hers.

Lillian hesitated, then exhaled sharply. "Donovan was at the pack gathering last night. With Evelyn."

Sebastian’s expression darkened. "I heard."

She crossed her arms, suddenly feeling exposed. "I don’t know why it still bothers me. I thought I was past this."

Sebastian reached out, cupping her face in his hands. His touch was warm, grounding. "Because you loved him," he murmured. "And love doesn’t just disappear overnight."

Lillian leaned into his touch, closing her eyes. "I don’t want to love him anymore."

Sebastian’s thumb brushed her cheek. "Then don’t."

His words were simple, but they carried the weight of truth. Lillian opened her eyes, meeting his steady gaze. In that moment, she realized something—she didn’t have to let Donovan’s shadow linger over her. She had a choice.

And she chose Sebastian.

A sudden commotion downstairs shattered the quiet. Raised voices, the sound of something shattering.

Sebastian’s head snapped toward the door. "Stay here," he ordered, already moving.

But Lillian was right behind him. "Like hell I will."

Together, they raced downstairs, where chaos had erupted in the foyer.

Standing in the center of the room, surrounded by a group of unfamiliar wolves, was Donovan.

His eyes locked onto Lillian’s, burning with something she couldn’t name.

"Lillian," he said, his voice rough. "We need to talk."

Sebastian stepped in front of her, his growl reverberating through the room. "You’re not welcome here."

Donovan’s lips curled into a sneer. "This doesn’t concern you, Blackwood."

Lillian’s pulse pounded in her ears. Whatever Donovan wanted, it wasn’t good.

And she had a sinking feeling their fragile peace was about to shatter.

Lillian wrapped her legs around Sebastian's waist as he deepened the kiss, his teeth grazing her bottom lip in a way that sent shivers down her spine.

"Let's get out of here," he murmured against her lips, his voice rough with desire.

She nodded, breathless, and Sebastian summoned one of his subordinates to pick them up—he was far too intoxicated to drive. They returned to his estate, where passion consumed them until dawn.

Lillian's POV

Pain erupted through my body, radiating from the mark on my neck. My limbs trembled violently, tears streaming down my face. I had felt discomfort before—whenever Donovan kissed Victoria—but never like this.

This was agony.

My nerves burned as if electrified. My wolf howled in anguish, the sound echoing in my skull.

Sebastian rushed from the bathroom, a warm cloth in hand. My scream had startled him. The moment his warmth left me, the torment worsened, but when he returned, the pressure in my chest eased slightly.

"Shh," he soothed, pressing the cloth to my forehead. I clutched his shoulders, dragging him closer. His presence dulled the pain—why?

"It hurts..." My voice broke as my fingers clawed at my neck.

"Stop." He caught my wrist, replacing my nails with the damp cloth. "You'll make it worse."

"I don’t understand," I choked out. "This has never happened before—only when Donovan kisses Victoria, but never this bad."

Sebastian went still, his gaze distant.

"Do you think they’re doing more than kissing?" he finally asked.

My breath hitched. Was that it? Were Donovan and Victoria...? The thought made my wolf whimper. My body shook harder in Sebastian’s arms, and he tightened his hold.

"Breathe," he murmured. "I've got you."

His voice was a balm, and the pain lessened slightly. He dabbed at my mark before his lips found mine, his kiss slow and deliberate. Like magic, the agony vanished. I melted into him, craving more—because somehow, he was the cure.

His fingers tangled in my hair, massaging my scalp, warmth spreading through me. When he pulled away, the ache returned—but duller now. My face burned, my chest heaving. He smirked, pressing a kiss to my nose.

"Better?"

"A little," I admitted.

"Good." He kissed me again. "Hold this to your neck. I’ll mindlink Marcus to see if Victoria returned last night."

I obeyed, but the second his arms left me, the pain flared. A scream tore from my throat. Guilt flashed in his eyes before they glazed over—mindlinking his Beta.

His frown deepened. Just as I nearly passed out from the torment, his arms encircled me again, and relief washed over me.

"That’s strange..." he murmured.

I nodded weakly. "Very."

He blinked, looking down at me.

"What? No—I mean, Victoria returned hours ago. She’s been asleep in her room. No one saw Donovan with her."

My stomach dropped.

If Donovan wasn’t with Victoria... then who was he with?

###Chapter 146

The night was thick with tension as Lillian stood frozen in the dimly lit corridor of the Blackwood estate. Her heart hammered against her ribs, each beat a deafening echo in the silence. She had come here for answers—answers about Donovan, about the twisted fate that had bound them together before tearing them apart.

But she hadn’t expected this.

Sebastian Blackwood loomed before her, his broad frame casting a shadow that swallowed the flickering candlelight. His golden eyes burned with an intensity that made her breath hitch. "You shouldn’t be here," he murmured, his voice a velvet growl that sent shivers down her spine.

Lillian lifted her chin, defiance sparking in her chest. "I have every right to be here. You’ve been keeping secrets, Sebastian. Secrets about him."

A muscle in his jaw twitched. "Donovan is dangerous, Lillian. More than you realize."

She scoffed, crossing her arms. "And yet, you let him walk free. You let him hurt people."

Sebastian stepped closer, the heat of his body radiating against her skin. "I have my reasons."

"Reasons you won’t share," she shot back.

The air between them crackled, charged with unspoken words and unresolved tension. For a heartbeat, neither moved. Then—

A crash echoed from down the hall.

Lillian’s head snapped toward the sound, her pulse spiking. "What was that?"

Sebastian’s expression darkened. "Stay here."

But she wasn’t about to be left in the dark—not again. Ignoring his command, she darted past him, her bare feet silent against the cold marble. The hallway twisted into darkness, the only light coming from the sliver of moonlight slipping through the curtains.

Then she saw it.

A figure—tall, lean, unmistakably familiar—stood at the end of the corridor.

Donovan.

Her breath caught. He shouldn’t be here. Not in Sebastian’s home. Not now.

Donovan turned slowly, his lips curling into a smirk that made her stomach churn. "Miss me, little wolf?"

Before she could react, Sebastian was there, stepping between them like a shield. "Get out," he snarled, his voice laced with barely restrained fury.

Donovan chuckled, the sound dripping with malice. "Or what? You’ll throw me out? Again?"

Lillian’s hands clenched into fists. "What do you want?"

His gaze slid to her, cold and calculating. "You."

A growl ripped from Sebastian’s throat. "Over my dead body."

Donovan’s smirk widened. "If you insist."

And then—chaos.

Sebastian lunged, his form blurring as he shifted mid-motion. Donovan barely dodged, his own transformation swift and brutal. Claws slashed, fangs flashed, and the hallway became a battleground.

Lillian stumbled back, her mind racing. She had to stop this. But how?

Then—a whisper of movement behind her.

She spun, only to come face-to-face with Evelyn, Donovan’s new mate. The woman’s eyes gleamed with cruel amusement. "You really should learn to stay out of things that don’t concern you," she purred.

Lillian’s blood ran cold.

And then—everything went black.

The pain had become my nightly companion, creeping in as the sun dipped below the horizon and lingering until dawn. But with Sebastian by my side, holding me through the worst of it, the agony was bearable. Still, it made no sense. I had seen Victoria around the mansion—always distant, always avoiding me. She barely acknowledged my greetings, as if I were invisible. Most days, she locked herself in her room, and Donovan hadn’t bothered to check on her once.

Then the pain worsened.

The pack doctor confirmed what Sebastian and I had already suspected—my fated mate was betraying me. Every time Donovan slept with another woman, it tore at my body and my wolf, leaving me weaker with each passing night.

By the third day of unbearable torment, Sebastian had enough. He sent Marcus to drag Donovan back to face judgment. The man was cheating on Victoria, and the evidence was undeniable. The only question was whether Victoria knew—and if that was why she had withdrawn into herself.

"We found him," Marcus announced as he strode into the villa, arms crossed. Behind him, two guards hauled in a disheveled Donovan, his clothes rumpled, his eyes glazed. The sight made my stomach churn. How had I ever loved this man?

"He was unconscious at the pub," Marcus explained, his voice tight with disgust.

Sebastian’s lip curled as he glared down at Donovan. "So this is what you do at night? Drink yourself into oblivion and then crawl into bed with some random woman?" His voice was a low growl, vibrating with barely contained fury.

Donovan lifted his head, blinking sluggishly. "Why am I here?" he slurred. "Where’s Seraphina?"

Marcus ran a hand through his hair, visibly uncomfortable. "There was a prostitute with him. Looked like she was about to take him somewhere before we intervened."

My stomach twisted. "A prostitute, Donovan?" I demanded, my voice shaking. "You’re better than this—"

At least, I thought he was. But after everything he’d done, maybe I was wrong. Cheating on Victoria with a paid escort? It was despicable. I turned away, unable to stomach the sight of him any longer.

"How could you do this to her?" My voice cracked as tears welled in my eyes. Victoria didn’t deserve this.

Sebastian’s jaw clenched. "How dare you hurt my daughter," he hissed. "I gave you chance after chance, Donovan Winslow."

Marcus stepped forward. "He might not even know what he’s doing. Look at him—he’s completely out of it."

But that didn’t excuse anything.

And the worst part?

Victoria still had no idea.

The woman didn't seem the least bit concerned, despite being stone-cold sober. If anything, I suspected Donovan was the one being exploited here. His recent extravagant spending spree—no doubt lavished on these women—spoke volumes. This wasn't just reckless behavior; the man was clearly unwell..." Sebastian's piercing gaze bore into Donovan as he scrutinized the slumped figure for an uncomfortably long moment.

"If he intends to keep courting my daughter," Sebastian growled, his voice laced with steel, "he'd better grow a spine and start treating her with the respect she deserves. This drunken disgrace ends now. He either cleans up his act or loses Victoria forever."

Marcus cleared his throat, eyeing Donovan's unconscious form sprawled across the marble floor. "Perhaps this conversation would be more productive when he's coherent, Alpha."

Sebastian exhaled sharply through his nose, the frustration evident in the tense line of his shoulders.

"Take him to the east wing guest suite," he ordered, rubbing his temples. "Have the staff draw a cold bath and bring up detox tea. Victoria mustn't know he's here—not in this state." The unspoken 'again' hung heavy between us.

Marcus bowed slightly. "At once, Alpha." With a sharp gesture, he summoned two armored sentries who hoisted Donovan between them like a sack of grain. As they ascended the grand staircase, Donovan's slurred mutterings echoed down the hall—"The resemblance... uncanny... just like her..."

My forehead creased. Who was he hallucinating about now? Before I could ponder further, Sebastian spun me around with surprising gentleness, his large hands warm on my shoulders.

"The bond pains will cease after tonight's ceremony," he murmured, golden eyes softening. "Once the mating mark takes hold, the severed connection will dissolve completely." I managed a tight-lipped nod, though my stomach churned.

"How can you still sanction this union?" The words burst out before I could stop them. "After days of infidelity? The man needs professional help, Sebastian, not an engagement!" My fingers twisted in the fabric of my dress. "Is this really the future you envision for Victoria?"

The grandfather clock in the hall ticked ominously as Sebastian's expression darkened like gathering storm clouds. Somewhere upstairs, a door clicked shut—the sound of Donovan being locked away with his demons. And his secrets.

The morning sun filtered through the heavy drapes of Sebastian Blackwood's private study, casting golden patterns across the antique mahogany desk where Lillian sat fidgeting with her pen. The scent of freshly brewed coffee mingled with Sebastian's distinctive sandalwood cologne, creating an intoxicating atmosphere that made her pulse quicken.

"Focus, Lillian," Sebastian murmured, his deep voice sending shivers down her spine as he leaned over her shoulder to examine her notes. His warm breath tickled her ear. "The council meeting starts in twenty minutes."

She swallowed hard, acutely aware of how close he was. "I know, I just—" Her words caught in her throat when his hand brushed against hers as he pointed to a line in her notebook.

A sharp knock at the door made them both jump apart. Marcus Grayson entered without waiting for permission, his expression grim. "Alpha, we have a situation."

Sebastian straightened immediately, his playful demeanor vanishing. "What is it?"

"It's Donovan," Marcus said, his gaze flickering to Lillian before continuing. "He's at the gates with Evelyn and... he's demanding to speak with Lillian."

Lillian's stomach dropped. She hadn't seen her former fated mate since their disastrous breakup at the winter ball. The pen slipped from her fingers, clattering against the desk.

Sebastian's jaw tightened. "Tell him—"

"No," Lillian interrupted, surprising even herself. She stood, smoothing her skirt with trembling hands. "I'll see him. This needs to end."

Sebastian's golden eyes darkened with concern. "You don't have to do this alone."

She offered him a shaky smile. "I know. But I need to."

As they walked toward the main entrance, Beatrice appeared from around the corner, her usually cheerful face drawn with worry. "Lil, are you sure about this? That bastard—"

"I'll be fine," Lillian assured her best friend, though her racing heartbeat betrayed her nerves.

The grand foyer was eerily silent when they arrived, the staff having discreetly disappeared. Through the glass doors, Lillian could see Donovan pacing like a caged animal, his new mate Evelyn clinging to his arm with a possessive grip.

Sebastian positioned himself slightly behind Lillian, his presence both comforting and intimidating. "Remember," he whispered, "you hold all the power here."

Taking a deep breath, Lillian pushed open the doors. The morning sunlight blinded her momentarily, but she didn't miss how Donovan's eyes widened at her appearance.

"Lillian," he breathed, taking an involuntary step forward before Evelyn yanked him back.

The sight of them together—Donovan with his new mate—should have hurt more, Lillian realized. But all she felt was... nothing. Just a strange sort of pity.

"What do you want, Donovan?" she asked, proud of how steady her voice sounded.

His expression twisted with something like regret. "We need to talk. Alone."

Before she could respond, Sebastian moved forward, his voice dripping with barely restrained anger. "Anything you have to say to my mate, you can say in front of me."

Donovan's eyes flashed with jealousy. "Your—" He cut himself off, running a hand through his disheveled hair. "Lillian, please. It's about Victoria."

At the mention of Sebastian's daughter, Lillian felt the blood drain from her face. "What about her?"

Evelyn chose that moment to speak, her voice sharp with malice. "She's missing. And we all know who's responsible."

The accusation hung in the air like a guillotine's blade. Lillian's hands curled into fists at her sides. "You think I—"

"Enough!" Sebastian's roar shook the very ground beneath them. His eyes glowed with barely contained fury as he advanced on Donovan. "You dare come to my home and accuse my mate?"

Donovan held up his hands in surrender, but his gaze remained locked on Lillian. "I'm not accusing anyone. I just thought... if anyone knew where she might go..."

Lillian's mind raced. Victoria had been distant lately, but missing? She turned to Sebastian, whose face had gone frighteningly still.

"Marcus," he said quietly, "lock them in the guest quarters. They're not leaving until we find my daughter."

As guards moved to obey, Evelyn shrieked in protest. "You can't do this! We're—"

"You're trespassing on Lycan territory," Sebastian interrupted coldly. "Be grateful I'm not doing worse."

Lillian watched as Donovan was led away, his eyes pleading with her until the doors closed between them. The moment they were gone, she turned to Sebastian.

"We'll find her," she promised, placing a hand on his arm. "Where would she go?"

Sebastian's expression was unreadable. "That's just it, love. I have no idea."

The ominous words settled over them like a storm cloud as they hurried toward the security office, the weight of Victoria's disappearance pressing down with each step. Somewhere out there, a young woman was missing—and the clock was ticking.

###Chapter 147

Sebastian sighed and shook his head.

"Not even slightly... but Victoria... she's delicate," he murmured, his own head shaking in concern. "Taking Donovan away from her would shatter her, and I fear what she might do if that happens. She's my daughter, and her happiness is all that matters to me. I can only hope Donovan changes once they're married, so he never wounds her again." When I remained silent, his expression softened.

"Besides, Victoria is grown now. As much as I wish I could, I can't dictate her choices," he continued.

"You're the Lycan chairman, Sebastian. Not to mention her father," I reminded him sharply. "You have every right to intervene."

"At the cost of losing my daughter?" he countered. "I can't risk that, Lillian. You, of all people, should understand how precious family is."

His words struck deep, and for some reason, they stung. I took a step back, my chest tightening.

"Of course I know how important family is, Sebastian," I said, my voice brittle. "Mine is crumbling, and I'd give anything to fix it—but that doesn’t seem possible, does it?"

His brows furrowed.

"What exactly are you talking about?"

I stared at him, stunned. Did he truly not know? Was he so self-absorbed that he hadn’t noticed how much my family was suffering? The realization hit like a slap. Sebastian didn’t truly care about me—he only cared about his own needs, about keeping his mother satisfied. This was our arrangement, so I shouldn’t have been surprised. Yet, the ache in my chest refused to fade.

I bit my lip, fighting back the tears threatening to spill.

"I should go home," I muttered, turning away. "My mother must be wondering where I’ve been. I don’t want to worry her."

"Are you upset?" Sebastian asked, his voice laced with a frown I couldn’t see.

"No," I lied. "It’s just been a long day. You should be with your family—they need you more than I do."

"Lillian—"

"I’ll see you later, Sebastian," I cut him off, rushing out the villa’s grand doors before he could say more.

Luckily, Frederick was waiting outside. When he saw me hurrying toward the car, he swiftly opened the back door. I managed a weak smile through my blurring vision, grateful for his silent understanding.

"Returning home, Miss Lillian?" he asked gently.

I nodded and slipped into the seat. He closed the door and hurried to the driver’s side. As the car pulled away, I caught a glimpse of Sebastian standing in the doorway, watching. He didn’t follow. The fact that he didn’t even try to stop me twisted the knife deeper.

By the time I reached home, exhaustion weighed me down. I thanked Frederick and stepped out, trudging toward the house. The moment I entered, I froze.

There, on the couch, sat my mother beside Eleanor Winslow—Donovan’s mother. Both held teacups, laughter lingering between them. My stomach dropped when their gazes snapped to me.

"Well, look who finally decided to grace us with her presence," my mother said dryly. "Where have you been? It’s been days."

Heat rushed to my cheeks as I stared at the floor.

"I’ve been staying with Beatrice," I lied.

Both women arched their brows. They’d seen me leave the party with Sebastian that night—and neither had seen me since. They knew. Especially after Sebastian had made such a spectacle of shielding me in front of everyone.

"So, you’ve made your choice then?" My mother’s voice carried a flicker of disappointment.

"You’re moving in with her?"

Honestly, I hadn’t even considered it. I’d completely forgotten about the house being sold.

"I... I’m not sure yet," I admitted, avoiding their eyes.

"What a shame," Eleanor mused, her tone dripping with false sympathy. "We would’ve welcomed you into our home with open arms."

I swallowed hard, my gaze locking onto my mother’s.

"So it’s final? You’re selling the house?"

She sighed, sorrow darkening her eyes as she nodded.

"The deal is done. Eleanor brought the contract today. One of her associates bought it outright. We’re moving in two days..."

###Chapter 148

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian’s mansion. Below, the sprawling estate was alive with activity—warriors training, maids bustling about, and the distant laughter of Oliver playing in the gardens.

She tightened the silk robe around her, the fabric cool against her skin. Last night’s events still lingered in her mind—Donovan’s unexpected appearance at the gala, the way his eyes had darkened when he saw her with Sebastian. The tension had been palpable, thick enough to slice through with a knife.

A knock at the door pulled her from her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, turning as the door creaked open.

Giselle, the head maid, entered with a silver tray bearing a steaming cup of coffee and a plate of freshly baked croissants. "Good morning, Miss Lillian," she greeted with a warm smile. "Alpha Blackwood thought you might appreciate breakfast before the meeting."

Lillian’s lips curved slightly. "Thank you, Giselle."

The maid set the tray on the small table by the window before hesitating. "If I may say, you look radiant this morning."

Lillian chuckled, shaking her head. "You’re too kind."

Giselle’s expression turned serious. "Alpha Blackwood also asked me to remind you that the council will convene in an hour. He said it’s… important."

Lillian’s stomach twisted. The council meeting. She had almost forgotten.

"Of course," she murmured, picking up the coffee. The rich aroma filled her senses, momentarily grounding her. "Tell him I’ll be ready."

Giselle nodded and slipped out, leaving Lillian alone with her thoughts once more.

She took a sip of the coffee, the bitterness sharp on her tongue. The council meeting wasn’t just about pack business—it was about her. About the rumors swirling through the pack, about Donovan’s sudden reappearance, and about the fragile alliance between Sebastian’s pack and the neighboring territories.

A shadow crossed her face. She had spent months building her life here, proving herself as more than just a runaway werewolf. But now, everything felt precarious, as if one wrong move could send it all crumbling down.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Beatrice:

"Heard about the meeting. Stay strong. You’ve got this."

Lillian exhaled, her grip tightening around the phone. Beatrice always knew when she needed reassurance.

Setting the cup down, she strode toward the wardrobe. If she was going to face the council, she’d do it with her head held high.

She pulled out a tailored navy-blue dress—one she had bought specifically for occasions like this. Sophisticated, commanding, but undeniably her.

As she dressed, her mind raced with possibilities. What would Donovan say? What would the council demand? And most importantly—what would Sebastian do?

The thought of him sent a shiver down her spine. He had been her anchor in the storm, but even anchors could be tested.

She fastened the last button and glanced at the mirror. The woman staring back was different from the scared girl who had fled her old pack. Stronger. Wiser.

But was she strong enough for what was coming?

A knock sounded again, this time sharper.

"Lillian?" Sebastian’s deep voice resonated through the door.

She took a steadying breath.

"Coming."

The game was about to begin.

My hand hovered in the air for a second before I finally knocked. This was absurd—I shouldn’t be this tense. But Lillian’s words kept echoing in my mind. Why would I want this for my own daughter? It was painfully clear Donovan wasn’t serious about his bond with her, so why was I even entertaining this farce?

I was Sebastian Blackwood, the Lycan Chairman and one of the most feared Alphas in the territory. If I wanted something, it was mine without question. But the thought of losing Victoria over this made my chest tighten in a way I couldn’t ignore.

I rapped my knuckles against the door again, firmer this time. A few heartbeats later, the door creaked open, revealing Victoria. Her eyes were swollen, her face pale—she’d been crying. The sight twisted something inside me. This is Donovan’s fault. He was the one hurting her, and I’d make sure he regretted it.

"We need to talk," I said before I could second-guess myself.

She exhaled sharply but stepped aside, letting me into her dimly lit room. Clothes were strewn across the floor, dishes piled on the desk—she hadn’t bothered cleaning in days.

"I’m exhausted," she muttered, sinking onto her bed. "Make it quick."

I shut the door behind me and crossed my arms. "It’s about Donovan."

Her entire body stiffened. She lifted her gaze, eyes sharp. "What about him?"

I dragged a hand through my hair. "Are you sure this is what you want, Victoria? He’s making you miserable—"

"He doesn’t make me miserable," she snapped, jumping to her feet. "He’s the only one who makes me happy."

I arched a brow. "Then why are you hiding in your room like a prisoner?"

She rolled her eyes. "I’m just dealing with something. It has nothing to do with him."

Liar. I could see right through her.

"Victoria, whatever it is, you can tell me. I’m your father—"

"Oh, now you want to play the caring dad?" she spat, catching me off guard. "You were never there for me or Oliver. The only reason you’re around now is because you’re obsessed with his tutor. But guess what? I’m an adult now. I don’t need you interfering in my life. I wanted you when I was younger, but you were always too busy. Do you have any idea what it’s like living in your shadow? It’s exhausting."

Her words hit like a blade to the chest.

And for the first time, I had no rebuttal.

Her words struck me like a physical blow, leaving me speechless. I hadn’t realized the depth of her resentment—hadn’t even considered that she might direct it all at me. But there it was, raw and unfiltered, burning in her gaze.

"You’ve never been a real father to me," she choked out, tears spilling down her cheeks. "And now you want to rip away the only happiness I’ve ever had? Do you want me to break completely? Because I swear, if you push me any further, I’ll—"

"Victoria!" I snapped, my voice sharp with warning. "Don’t you dare finish that sentence. You know I don’t want to take anything from you. I’m only trying to protect you. I want what’s best—"

"Donovan is what’s best," she shot back, angrily swiping at her tears. "He’s all I’ve ever wanted, and I won’t let you—or anyone—ruin this for me. He’s mine, and I won’t let you tear us apart!"

The conviction in her voice was absolute, her defiance unwavering. For a long moment, I could only stare at her, the weight of her words pressing down on me. There was nothing left to say.

So I simply nodded.

###Chapter 149

The morning sun filtered through the heavy velvet curtains of Lillian's bedroom, casting golden streaks across the silk sheets. She stirred awake, her werewolf senses immediately picking up the faint scent of lavender and bergamot that always lingered in Sebastian Blackwood's mansion.

"Miss Lillian?" A gentle knock came at the door. "Mr. Blackwood requests your presence in the dining room."

Lillian groaned, rubbing sleep from her eyes. "Tell him I'll be down in fifteen minutes, Sophia."

The maid's footsteps retreated as Lillian dragged herself from the warmth of her bed. The marble floor was cool beneath her bare feet as she padded to the ensuite bathroom. The reflection staring back at her showed dark circles under her eyes - remnants of another sleepless night spent worrying about Donovan's sudden reappearance in her life.

She dressed quickly in a simple emerald green dress that brought out the gold flecks in her hazel eyes. The mirror showed the faint scar along her collarbone - a permanent reminder of her last encounter with Donovan. Her fingers traced the raised skin unconsciously.

The dining room was already bustling when she arrived. Sebastian sat at the head of the long mahogany table, his broad shoulders tense beneath his tailored suit. Little Oliver was chattering excitedly about his upcoming school play while Victoria sipped her tea with practiced elegance.

"There you are," Sebastian said, his deep voice sending an involuntary shiver down Lillian's spine. "We have matters to discuss."

Lillian took her usual seat to Sebastian's right, accepting the coffee Theodore immediately poured for her. "What's happened?"

Victoria set down her teacup with deliberate precision. "Donovan was spotted near the northern border last night. With Evelyn."

The porcelain cup trembled in Lillian's grip. "What were they doing there?"

"Scouting," Marcus Grayson answered from his position near the doorway. "Our patrol caught their scent but lost them near the old mill."

Sebastian's knuckles whitened around his fork. "He's testing our defenses. Again."

Oliver's small hand found Lillian's under the table. She squeezed it reassuringly, though her own pulse was racing. The last time Donovan had breached their territory, people had died.

"We need to—" Lillian began, but was interrupted by the sudden ringing of Sebastian's phone.

The Lycan chairman's expression darkened as he listened to the caller. When he hung up, his golden eyes burned with barely contained fury. "That was the security team at the university. Donovan just walked onto campus with Evelyn, demanding to see Lillian."

The dining room erupted into chaos. Victoria stood so abruptly her chair toppled backward. Oliver began crying. Marcus was already barking orders into his own phone.

Lillian felt the blood drain from her face. After all these months of hiding, of rebuilding her life, Donovan had finally come for her in broad daylight. And he'd brought his new mate with him.

Sebastian's hand closed around her wrist. "You're not going."

"I have to," Lillian whispered. "If I don't, he'll hurt someone. You know how he gets."

The air around Sebastian crackled with barely restrained power. For a terrifying moment, Lillian thought he might shift right there in the dining room. Then his grip loosened.

"Fine. But I'm coming with you. And Marcus. And the entire security team." His voice dropped to a growl. "If he so much as looks at you wrong, I'll tear his throat out."

As they hurried to the waiting cars, Beatrice came sprinting across the lawn, her phone clutched in her hand. "Lil! I just got the alert from campus security! What the hell is Donovan thinking?"

Lillian swallowed hard. "I don't know, Bea. But we're about to find out."

The convoy of black SUVs sped toward the university, each mile tightening the knot in Lillian's stomach. She'd spent months trying to forget Donovan, trying to move on from the toxic bond they'd shared. Now he was back, and he'd brought the war to her doorstep.

As the university gates came into view, Sebastian's phone buzzed again. He listened for a moment before turning to Lillian, his expression unreadable.

"They've taken hostages."

"Alright," I finally murmured after a weighted pause. "We don’t need to discuss this anymore."

"Can you go now?" Victoria whispered, exhaustion lacing her voice. "I just... need to rest."

I gave a stiff nod and turned toward the door, but something made me hesitate. Glancing back at her, I added, "I thought you should know—Donovan is sleeping in one of the guest rooms. We found him unconscious at the bar. Some woman was about to take advantage of him."

Victoria’s face drained of color instantly, her breath hitching audibly. "What?" she gasped, her hands trembling. "Why didn’t you tell me sooner? I have to see him!" She bolted past me toward the hallway.

I didn’t stop her, but as she rushed away, I called out, "Victoria."

She froze, her back rigid.

"I love you," I said, my voice rough. "I hope you know that."

For a heartbeat, she stood there, unmoving. Then, without a word, she hurried off to find Donovan.

I exhaled sharply. There was no reaching her.

The next evening, I was surprised when Lillian showed up to train Oliver. After our last encounter, I’d half-expected her to avoid me entirely. Yet here she was, and despite everything, relief flickered through me. I owed her an apology for my harsh words—words spoken in anger, not truth.

But maybe it wasn’t my place to make her see reason.

I kept my distance, watching from the shadows as she guided Oliver through his drills. My wolf stirred restlessly, urging me closer, but I held my ground. My gaze never left her.

Victoria and Donovan had spent the entire day together, acting as if last night’s disaster had never happened. Donovan seemed blissfully unaware, while Victoria clung to his side like a lifeline.

But something else caught my attention—the tension between Lillian and Victoria. Every time they crossed paths, Victoria’s eyes flicked toward Lillian with unmistakable hostility. A glare, sharp enough to cut.

I frowned. Weren’t they supposed to be friends? What had changed?

Then Lillian’s phone buzzed. She pulled it from her bag, her expression shifting as she read the screen. After murmuring something to Oliver, she stepped away to take the call.

Curiosity gnawed at me. Who was so important that she’d drop everything to answer?

Lillian’s POV

When I saw Beatrice’s name flash on my screen mid-training session, my pulse spiked. We hadn’t spoken in days—no school, no time. I’d left her a message earlier, needing to ask her something urgent.

Now, here she was, calling back.

I excused myself from Oliver and answered.

"Beatrice?"

Her voice was breathless, rushed. "Lillian, you won’t believe what just happened—"

And then she told me.

And my world tilted.

Lillian lived alone in her cozy apartment... which meant I desperately needed to see if I could crash on her couch for a while. At least until I figured out my next move.

"I'll be right back," I told Oliver, ruffling his hair. "Just keep practicing your aim, okay? I need to make a quick call."

He nodded, already adjusting his stance with the focus of a future warrior. "Got it!"

Stepping away from the training field, I pulled out my phone with shaky fingers. Beatrice's contact flashed on the screen. I pressed call and held my breath as it rang.

"What's so urgent?" Beatrice answered, her voice laced with exhaustion. I could practically hear her rubbing her temples—she'd just gotten off another grueling shift.

"Rough day?" I hedged, stalling because the words stuck in my throat.

"Ugh, the worst," she groaned. "Got written up for slapping some creep who thought my ass was part of the lunch menu."

My grip tightened on the phone. "That disgusting pig! I swear, if I'd been there—"

"Yeah, yeah, you'd have ripped his throat out. I know." A tired chuckle. "So? What's up?"

I swallowed hard. Time to ask.


The scent of pine and damp earth filled Lillian's nostrils as she trudged through the dense forest, her boots sinking slightly into the soft ground. Moonlight filtered through the towering trees, casting eerie shadows that seemed to move with malicious intent. She could feel Donovan's presence before she saw him - that familiar, once-comforting scent now turned bitter with betrayal.

"Did you really think you could run from me forever?" His voice slithered through the darkness, sending chills down her spine.

Lillian whirled around, her golden eyes flashing in the dim light. "I wasn't running. I was giving you a chance to reconsider this madness."

Donovan stepped into a patch of moonlight, his handsome features twisted with something ugly. Behind him, Evelyn emerged like a ghost, her lips curled in a triumphant smirk. The sight of them together made Lillian's stomach churn.

Sebastian Blackwood's warning echoed in her mind: "Don't confront them alone." But she'd been too angry, too hurt to listen. Now she stood surrounded by trees and enemies, with only her wits to protect her.

"You've made your choice clear," Lillian said, forcing her voice steady. "But you won't get what you want."

Evelyn's laugh was like shattered glass. "Oh, we already have. While you've been playing house with that Lycan chairman, we've been busy."

A twig snapped somewhere to Lillian's left. Then another. The forest came alive with movement as figures emerged from the shadows - Donovan's new pack members, their eyes glowing with hostility.

Lillian's pulse quickened. She'd walked right into their trap. The realization hit her like a physical blow, but she refused to show fear. Instead, she squared her shoulders and met Donovan's gaze head-on.

"You'll regret this," she promised, her voice low and dangerous.

Donovan's smile didn't reach his eyes. "No, little mate. That honor belongs to you."

As the circle tightened around her, Lillian reached for the small silver dagger hidden in her boot - the one Sebastian had insisted she carry at all times. The cold metal against her palm grounded her, gave her focus.

The first attacker lunged. Lillian moved like lightning, dodging and striking with precision born from months of training under Professor Montgomery. But there were too many of them. For every enemy she felled, two more took their place.

Just as a particularly large werewolf grabbed her from behind, a bone-chilling howl split the night air. Every head turned toward the sound. Even Donovan paled.

The trees at the edge of the clearing shook violently before exploding outward in a shower of splinters. And through the debris stormed Sebastian Blackwood in full Lycan form, his massive body radiating pure fury.

Lillian had never been so relieved to see anyone in her life. But as Sebastian's glowing red eyes locked onto Donovan, she realized with dawning horror that she might have just started a war neither of them could stop.
###Chapter 150

"It's part of the job," Lillian murmured, rubbing her temples. "But exhausting. So, seriously—what's so urgent? You sounded frantic on the phone."

She sighed, fingers tangling in her hair, tugging lightly at the ends.

"My mom is selling the house," she blurted.

Beatrice gasped. "What? Why would she do that? She adores that house. Your parents worked their asses off to get it. She used to tell us all those stories about how they saved for years!"

"I know," Lillian muttered, squeezing her eyes shut. "But somehow, Donovan’s parents convinced her to sell and move in with them until she 'gets back on her feet.'"

"Those scheming snakes," Beatrice hissed. "They planned this!"

"Trust me, I’m aware," Lillian said dryly, rolling her eyes just thinking about it.

"So, what are you going to do?" Beatrice pressed. "You can’t live there. Is your mom really that naive?"

"Apparently," Lillian sighed. "She told me we’re moving in a few days."

"You cannot be serious, Lil," Beatrice groaned. "Living under the same roof as Donovan’s family? That’s emotional suicide."

"I can’t stay there, Bea," Lillian whispered, voice dropping lower. "But Mom’s dead set on it. She said if I don’t agree, I can find my own place."

A heavy silence settled between them before Beatrice exhaled sharply.

"Okay. So what’s the plan?"

Lillian chewed her bottom lip, hesitating.

"I was hoping… maybe I could crash on your couch? Just until I figure something out?" She held her breath, waiting.

Beatrice hesitated, then sighed. "Oh, Lil. I’d love to have you, but my landlord’s a nightmare. My lease says no long-term guests. I’m so sorry…"

Disappointment crashed over her. Beatrice had been her last hope. Now, the only option was moving in with Donovan’s family. Her stomach twisted into knots, and she fought back the sting of tears.

"It’s okay. I get it," she said softly.

"But listen—I’ll ask around, see if anyone’s looking for a roommate. There’s gotta be something," Beatrice assured her, voice warm with sympathy. "We’ll figure this out. Don’t panic yet."

Lillian forced a smile, even as her throat tightened. "Thanks, Bea."

After a quick goodbye, she hung up. Turning to head back to Oliver, she froze—


Sebastian's piercing dark eyes locked onto mine, sending a shiver down my spine. I had been dodging him all morning, the memory of last night's abrupt departure burning with shame in my chest. An apology perched on the tip of my tongue, but the words tangled before I could speak them.

"Hey..." I managed, my voice awkwardly soft. "About last night—"

"Forget that," he cut in, his tone sharp. "Did I hear you say your mother is selling your house?"

My breath hitched. The color drained from my face.

"You were eavesdropping?" I shot back, a mix of defensiveness and embarrassment flaring inside me.

His jaw tightened. "Not intentionally. But is it true?"

I bit my lip. No point in lying now. With a reluctant nod, I admitted, "Yes. It's true. I'll probably have to stay with Donovan's family for a while."

A low, almost imperceptible growl rumbled in his chest. His energy darkened, the air between us thickening with something unspoken. I blinked at the unexpected reaction, and just as quickly, he shook it off, his expression smoothing back into its usual controlled mask.

Silence stretched between us before he finally spoke again.

"There's another option."

My pulse stuttered. "And what's that?"

His gaze held mine, unwavering.

"Move in with me."

###Chapter 151

The morning sun filtered through the heavy drapes of Sebastian Blackwood's bedroom, casting golden streaks across the rumpled sheets where Lillian still lay sleeping. Her dark hair fanned across the pillow like spilled ink, one arm curled protectively around little Oliver who had crawled into their bed during the night.

Sebastian stood by the window, already dressed in his customary black suit, watching the peaceful scene with an unfamiliar warmth in his chest. The sight of his mate and son sleeping so contentedly made something primal within him settle. His phone buzzed silently in his pocket - Marcus Grayson, his Beta, no doubt with the morning security report.

He stepped into the hallway, answering in a hushed tone. "Report."

"All quiet overnight, Alpha," Marcus responded. "Though we did intercept another attempt from Donovan's pack to cross our borders. They were... persistent."

Sebastian's jaw tightened. "Double the patrols. And send Theodore to my office in an hour." He ended the call before Marcus could respond, his mood already darkening at the mention of Donovan.

Back in the bedroom, Lillian was stirring, her sleepy eyes blinking open. "Morning," she murmured, her voice still thick with sleep. Oliver remained curled against her, his small fingers clutching her nightgown.

"Sleep well?" Sebastian asked, sitting on the edge of the bed. He reached out, brushing a stray lock of hair from Lillian's face. The simple domesticity of the gesture still felt foreign to him, yet undeniably right.

Lillian nodded, then frowned as she caught his scent. "You're tense. What happened?"

"Nothing for you to worry about," he deflected automatically, then sighed when she gave him that look - the one that said she wasn't buying his protective bullshit. "Donovan's pack tested our borders again last night."

Lillian sat up carefully so as not to disturb Oliver. "He won't stop, will he?"

Sebastian's hand found hers, their fingers intertwining. "No. But that's my problem to handle, not yours."

"Except it is my problem," Lillian countered, her voice firm. "He was my mate first, remember? And now with Evelyn pregnant..." She trailed off, the unspoken implications hanging between them.

Downstairs, the grandfather clock chimed seven times. Sebastian stood. "We'll discuss this later. You have class at nine, and I have a meeting with the regional Alphas."

Lillian opened her mouth to argue, but Oliver chose that moment to wake up, his sleepy mumble of "Daddy?" derailing the conversation. Sebastian leaned down to press a kiss to his son's forehead, then one to Lillian's lips - a silent promise that they would continue this discussion.

As he strode down the hallway toward his office, Sebastian's mind raced with contingency plans. Donovan was becoming bolder, and with Evelyn's pregnancy, the stakes had escalated. The Winslow family would undoubtedly rally behind their son, especially with Eleanor Winslow's influence.

He paused outside Victoria's room, hearing his daughter's quiet sobs. The engagement to Donovan had been broken months ago, but the wounds clearly still festered. Sebastian clenched his fists. Another reason to make Donovan pay for his betrayal.

Theodore was waiting when Sebastian entered his office, the older man's posture stiff with tension. "Alpha," he greeted formally. "I've compiled the latest intelligence on the Winslow pack's movements."

Sebastian took the offered folder, flipping through the pages with growing unease. "They're mobilizing," he observed grimly. "Preparing for war."

Theodore nodded. "Reginald Winslow has been meeting with Alpha Maximilian Voss. If they form an alliance..."

"Then we'll be fighting on two fronts," Sebastian finished. He closed the folder with a snap. "Call in our allies. And prepare the safe houses - if it comes to war, Lillian and Oliver will be evacuated immediately."

As Theodore left to carry out his orders, Sebastian turned to the window overlooking the training grounds below. Lillian was there now, dressed in workout gear, going through combat drills with Professor Montgomery. Even from this distance, he could see the determination in her movements, the way she threw herself into each strike and block.

His mate was strong - stronger than she knew. But would it be enough when the storm finally broke?

Lillian's POV

My breath hitched as I stared at Sebastian, completely stunned.

"Did I hear you correctly?" My voice came out barely above a whisper.

"I asked you to move in with me," he repeated calmly, those piercing silver eyes never leaving mine.

Even hearing it a second time, my mind refused to process the words.

"You can't be serious..." I murmured, more to myself than to him.

"Deadly serious," he countered.

"You want me to live... here?" I gestured vaguely around the training grounds. "With your family?" His expression darkened slightly as he shook his head.

"No. I own an estate twenty minutes north," he explained. "Fully staffed. I use it when overseeing northern territory affairs." My eyebrows shot up—I hadn't realized he maintained multiple residences within his pack lands. My shock must have been evident because his gaze softened imperceptibly.

"You need proper accommodation," he stated matter-of-factly. "Consider this my offer."

"And you'd be living there too?"

A weighted pause.

"I can't reside there permanently without raising suspicions," he admitted. "But I'm frequently in the north for business. The arrangement wouldn't change much—except now you'd have proper security." His jaw tightened. "Oliver needs stability. I won't abandon him at the main villa."

I nodded slowly, understanding the unspoken implications.

"Can I have time to consider?"

"Take what you need." He checked his watch. "I have meetings. We'll speak later."

As his imposing figure disappeared down the gravel path, I turned back to Oliver, who was still practicing archery with single-minded focus.

"Enough arrows for today," I called, forcing cheer into my voice. "Sword drills next, then I'll make us grilled cheese."

His answering grin could've powered the entire packhouse.

Third Person POV

What private discussion had Lillian and Sebastian been having?

The sight of them speaking intimately made Victoria's stomach churn. She'd spent the last forty-eight hours wrapped in Donovan's arms, him whispering sweet nothings to make up for his past neglect. She hadn't confronted him about his lingering feelings—what mattered was that he'd chosen her, hadn't he?

Then why did Lillian keep appearing wherever Donovan went?

Was the pathetic girl clinging to lost love? Victoria's nails bit into her palms at the thought. Lillian had rejected the bond first—she'd forfeited all rights to Donovan's affection. He belonged to Victoria now, and she'd be damned before letting some washed-up mate steal him back.

Ducking behind a marble pillar, Victoria watched Lillian return to Oliver. Their laughter carried across the courtyard as they transitioned to swordplay. Something about lunch was mentioned.

One thought crystallized in Victoria's mind: Lillian needed to disappear from pack lands. Permanently.

By the time she stormed into the kitchen, her mask of composure was flawless. The staff nodded respectfully—none suspected the tempest beneath her polished exterior. All her life, she'd craved genuine love. Donovan had been her closest taste of it... until Lillian's shadow ruined everything.

The kitchen door creaked open.

"Victoria?" Lillian's hesitant voice cut through her spiraling thoughts.

She whirled around, cheeks flaming.

"Lillian! How long—"

"Just walked in," Lillian said, shutting the door. "You seemed... troubled."

"Perfectly fine," Victoria lied through a saccharine smile.

Lillian moved toward the refrigerator, skepticism written across her features. "It's just... you've been avoiding me lately. Did I do something wrong?"

"Don't be ridiculous," Victoria scoffed, the lie smoother now. "We're sisters, aren't we?"

The way Lillian's fingers paused on the jam jar told Victoria she wasn't convinced. "Making Oliver's favorite," Lillian said lightly. "Strawberry jam sandwiches with potato crisps."

Victoria's gaze tracked Lillian's movements as an idea took root. If subtle hints wouldn't drive Lillian away... more drastic measures might be necessary.

The real question was—how far was she willing to go?

A simple idea could lead to dire consequences if not handled carefully. Lillian was completely absorbed in her sandwich, oblivious to Victoria's movements. Seizing the opportunity, Victoria quietly slipped toward one of the drawers, her fingers brushing against the polished wood as she checked for the item she needed.

Sebastian was meticulous—almost obsessive—about keeping spare Epi-pens in nearly every room of the mansion for Oliver. A precaution, given the boy's severe allergies. Victoria knew this. And right now, that knowledge was her advantage.

Her lips curled into a faint smirk as her fingers closed around the slender device.

###Chapter 152

The scene crackled with tension, though Lillian remained blissfully unaware. The sandwich in her hands was her sole focus, the flavors distracting her from the subtle shift in the air.

Victoria moved like a shadow, her steps silent, her intentions hidden beneath a mask of indifference. The drawer slid open with barely a sound, her fingers deftly locating the Epi-pen.

A small, dangerous victory.

Sebastian’s precautions had always been thorough—but even the most careful plans could be turned against him.

And Victoria was very, very good at turning things to her advantage.

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the grand terrace of the Blackwood estate. Her fingers tightened around the railing, the cold metal biting into her skin. The weight of Donovan’s betrayal still lingered, a shadow she couldn’t shake.

Sebastian’s deep voice broke through her thoughts. “You’re brooding again.”

She turned to find him leaning against the doorway, his piercing gaze locked onto her. The moonlight cast sharp angles across his face, emphasizing the strength in his jaw. “Just thinking,” she murmured.

“About him?” His tone darkened, a growl threading through the words.

Lillian exhaled sharply. “No. About choices.”

Sebastian pushed off the doorframe and closed the distance between them. His presence was overwhelming, a force of nature she couldn’t ignore. “You made yours,” he said, voice low. “And so did I.”

Her pulse quickened. The unspoken promise in his words sent a shiver down her spine.

Inside, the sound of laughter drifted from the dining hall. Evelyn’s high-pitched giggle grated on Lillian’s nerves. She had no right to be here, not after what she’d done.

Beatrice appeared at the door, her expression tight. “Lillian, you need to see this.”

Curious, Lillian followed her inside, Sebastian close behind. The dining table was strewn with papers—photographs, bank statements, and damning evidence of Evelyn’s treachery.

“She’s been working with Alpha Harrison,” Beatrice hissed. “This whole time.”

Lillian’s stomach twisted. Another betrayal. Another knife in the back.

Sebastian’s hand settled on her shoulder, warm and steady. “We end this tonight.”

The determination in his voice was absolute.

But as Lillian reached for the evidence, a sharp knock echoed through the room. The door swung open, revealing Victoria, her face pale.

“Father,” she gasped. “They’ve taken Oliver.”

The world tilted.

Sebastian’s grip on Lillian tightened, his fury palpable. “Who?”

Victoria’s lips trembled. “Alpha Harrison’s men.”

Lillian’s blood ran cold.

This wasn’t just a betrayal.

It was war.

Victoria's fingers trembled slightly as she retrieved the Epi-pen from its usual spot, tucking it swiftly into her back pocket. She knew she'd need it for what was coming next.

"I've missed our little chats," Lillian murmured, spreading crimson jam across a slice of bread with deliberate care. "I really do consider you a friend, Victoria." The lie tasted bitter, even to her own ears. There was no way Lillian genuinely saw her as a friend. Victoria's stomach churned, but she forced a sweet smile onto her lips and nodded.

"Absolutely. We should make time for a proper catch-up soon," Victoria suggested, watching as Lillian's shoulders relaxed slightly. The tension in the kitchen eased as Lillian layered more jam before pressing the second slice of bread on top. With practiced precision, she sliced the sandwich into triangles—Oliver’s favorite shape.

Lillian moved toward the cabinets, searching for chips.

"I think Oliver prefers the ones in the bottom cabinet," Victoria offered casually, stepping around the counter behind Lillian’s back. As Lillian crouched to check, Victoria reached into the top cabinet, her fingers closing around the jar of peanut butter.

"They're not here," Lillian sighed in frustration.

"Oh, maybe they're on the top shelf," Victoria said with a light laugh, unscrewing the peanut butter lid behind her back.

Lillian shut the lower cabinet and stretched upward, rifling through the top shelf while Victoria dipped her finger into the peanut butter. With a quick flick of her wrist, she pried open one of the sandwich triangles and smeared a thin layer of peanut butter over the jam. She repeated the motion with the other half.

The sound of the cabinet door clicking shut made Victoria spin around, exhaling in relief when she saw Lillian’s attention fixed on pouring apple juice into Oliver’s favorite Star Wars cup.

Seizing the moment, Victoria licked the remnants of peanut butter and jam from her fingers, erasing the evidence just as Lillian turned back to the plate. Their eyes met.

"Are we really okay?" Lillian asked, her voice laced with something unreadable.

Victoria’s smile didn’t waver. "Of course."

But beneath the surface, the game had only just begun.

Victoria forced a smile onto her lips.

"Never better," she lied.

Lillian looked relieved and offered her a faint smile as she picked up the plate from the counter.

"I'm glad we talked," Lillian murmured before turning toward the parlor door.

"Me too..." Victoria said, her aura darkening the moment Lillian left the kitchen. She exhaled sharply, relieved she hadn’t been caught. This was the price she had to pay to get Lillian out of the Blackwood estate for good. There was no way her father would let her stay if he suspected for even a second that Lillian posed a threat—especially not after poisoning Oliver.

She quickly screwed the lid back onto the peanut butter jar and was about to step into the parlor to witness her plan unfold when a blood-curdling scream tore through the air.

Her pulse spiked. She rushed into the parlor—only to freeze at the sight before her.

Oliver was on the floor, his face swelling like an overripe tomato, his small hands clawing at his throat as he gasped for air. Victoria had thought she was prepared for this moment, but the last time this had happened, she’d been a child herself—too young to be the one responsible for saving him. She barely remembered the panic, the terror of discovering his allergy.

But this? This was worse than she’d imagined. His wheezing breaths, the way his lips tinged blue—it was horrifying.

"Victoria!" Lillian’s voice was sharp with desperation, and from the way she shouted, it wasn’t the first time she’d called for her. "Do you have an EpiPen?!"

Oliver tried to speak, but each attempt only made his breathing more ragged. Tears streamed down Lillian’s face as she cradled him in her arms, her entire body trembling. She whispered soothing words to him, but the panic in her eyes was unmistakable.

Victoria’s fingers twitched toward the EpiPen hidden in her back pocket—but how could she explain having it on her without revealing her guilt? Her legs turned to lead. She couldn’t move. Couldn’t think.

The parlor door burst open. Sebastian stormed in, followed by one of the maids—Sophia, probably, who must have run for help the moment Oliver collapsed. Her father shoved past her without a glance, yanking open the top drawer of the parlor desk and grabbing the EpiPen stored inside.

In one swift motion, he pressed it against Oliver’s thigh and injected the dose.

Within seconds, Oliver’s breathing steadied.

Victoria’s stomach twisted.

She had almost killed her own brother.

###Chapter 153

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the campus quad. Her fingers tightened around the strap of her backpack, her mind still reeling from the confrontation with Donovan earlier that morning. The memory of his cold, dismissive words sent a sharp pang through her chest.

"You were never enough, Lillian. Evelyn understands me in ways you never could."

She exhaled sharply, shaking her head as if to physically dispel the lingering bitterness.

"Hey, you okay?" Beatrice appeared beside her, concern etched across her features.

Lillian forced a smile. "Yeah, just... thinking."

Beatrice arched a brow. "About him again?"

Lillian didn’t answer, but the way her shoulders tensed was answer enough.

"Ugh, forget Donovan," Beatrice huffed, looping her arm through Lillian’s. "He’s not worth another second of your time. Besides, you have way bigger things to worry about—like Professor Sinclair’s pop quiz today."

Lillian groaned. "Don’t remind me."

As they walked, the chatter of students around them filled the silence. But then, a familiar scent—dark, rich, and undeniably commanding—drifted toward her. Her pulse spiked before she even turned her head.

Sebastian Blackwood stood near the administration building, his broad frame clad in a tailored charcoal suit. His piercing gaze locked onto hers, and for a moment, the world around them faded.

Beatrice nudged her. "Looks like someone’s watching you."

Lillian swallowed hard. "He’s probably just here for a meeting."

But Sebastian didn’t look away. Instead, he took a step forward—then another—until he was standing right in front of her.

"Lillian," he said, his voice low and smooth.

Her name on his lips sent a shiver down her spine. "Sebastian."

A faint smirk tugged at the corner of his mouth. "You’re avoiding me."

She stiffened. "I’ve been busy."

His eyes darkened. "Too busy to answer my calls?"

Beatrice cleared her throat awkwardly. "Uh, I’m just gonna... go." She gave Lillian’s arm a reassuring squeeze before slipping away.

Sebastian didn’t acknowledge her departure. His focus remained entirely on Lillian. "We need to talk."

She crossed her arms. "About what?"

"About us."

Her breath hitched. Us? There was no us. Not really. Not when he was still engaged to Victoria, not when she was still picking up the shattered pieces of her heart.

But before she could respond, a shrill voice cut through the tension.

"Lillian!" Cassandra sauntered toward them, her lips curled in a smirk. "I see you’re still clinging to powerful men to make up for your own inadequacies."

Sebastian’s expression turned glacial. "Watch your tongue."

Cassandra faltered, but only for a second. "Oh, I didn’t realize you were together." She feigned innocence. "My mistake."

Lillian’s nails dug into her palms. She was tired—so tired—of the games, the whispers, the constant reminders of how little she seemed to matter.

Sebastian’s hand brushed against hers, a silent promise of support. But before he could speak, his phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, his jaw tightening.

"I have to take this." His voice was clipped.

Lillian nodded, already stepping back. "Of course."

He hesitated, as if he wanted to say more, but then turned away, answering the call with a sharp, "Blackwood."

Cassandra smirked. "Looks like you’re not as important as you thought."

Lillian met her gaze evenly. "And you’re not as clever as you think you are."

With that, she turned on her heel and walked away, her heart pounding.

But as she rounded the corner, she nearly collided with Oliver, Sebastian’s son. The boy grinned up at her.

"Lillian! Dad said you’re coming to dinner tonight!"

Her stomach dropped. Dinner?

She had no idea what game Sebastian was playing, but one thing was certain—she was about to be pulled right back into his world.

And she wasn’t sure she was ready.

This was the most terrifying moment of my life. When Oliver took a bite of the sandwich and suddenly collapsed, my entire world froze. I had never faced anything like this before. His face turned crimson, swelling grotesquely as he clawed at his throat, gasping for air.

The only thing I knew was that he needed an Epi-Pen—now. But Victoria stood there, paralyzed, not reacting to my frantic pleas. Before I could process what was happening, Sebastian stormed into the room. I hadn’t even noticed the maid until she rushed in behind him, relief flooding me when she immediately retrieved the Epi-Pen from the parlor desk.

As Oliver’s breathing steadied, my body sagged with exhaustion, tears streaming down my face. "Call an ambulance," Sebastian snarled at the maid, who nodded and bolted from the room.

Sebastian pulled Oliver from my lap, cradling him against his chest. Though Oliver was breathing on his own, his face remained alarmingly swollen, his eyes shut tight. I slumped against the couch, willing my racing heart to calm.

"Who gave him peanut butter?" Sebastian’s voice was a dangerous growl, his eyes burning with fury.

I frowned, meeting his glare. Why was he looking at me like I had done something wrong?

"W-what?" My voice came out as a shaky whisper.

"I said, who fed him peanut butter?" His tone was razor-sharp.

I opened my mouth to respond, but Victoria cut in first.

"Lillian made his lunch," she said quickly, pointing at the discarded sandwich on the floor.

Sebastian snatched it up, sniffed it once before his expression darkened. "Didn’t Marcus go over his allergies with you? I thought you had a list." His voice rose with accusation.

"I—" My mind spun. I hadn’t put peanut butter in that sandwich. I knew he was deathly allergic. I would never be so reckless. But how had it gotten there?

"Dad, you have to do something," Victoria cried, tears spilling down her cheeks. "She almost killed him. She shouldn’t be allowed near him—"

My stomach dropped. I stared at her, stunned. Her tears seemed genuine, but there was something calculated beneath them. She was manipulating Sebastian, and I was the one caught in the crossfire.

Why was she turning on me like this? I thought we were okay.

The distant wail of sirens grew louder. Oliver groaned, drawing Sebastian’s attention back to him. He brushed damp strands of hair from Oliver’s forehead, holding him tighter.


"It's going to be alright," Sebastian murmured against Oliver's head, his voice thick with worry. "You'll be fine. I've got you." My chest tightened at his words—he truly believed I had done this on purpose.

I stared at the ruined sandwich on the floor, my mind spinning. Hesitantly, I reached out and picked up a piece of the bread, gasping when I lifted it and saw the smear of pear-infused butter in the center.

How was this even possible?

My gaze snapped up to Victoria, who was glaring down at me, her eyes sharp with accusation. She had been the only other person in the kitchen with me. But would she really poison her own brother? What reason could she possibly have? Oliver was just a child—innocent and undeserving of such cruelty.

"You hurt my family," Victoria hissed, jabbing a finger in my direction. "You can't stay here as Oliver's tutor anymore. Tell her, Father!"

Sebastian remained silent, his attention wholly consumed by Oliver's condition. Undeterred, Victoria turned back to him, her voice trembling with false distress.

"She can't be trusted—especially not with Oliver! Her carelessness nearly killed him! You have to tell her she can't come back to the villa!" Tears streamed down her cheeks, the perfect picture of a distraught sister.

Within minutes, the parlor was swarming with EMTs and Gamma warriors. I stayed frozen on the ground, my limbs locked in shock, while Victoria continued to point fingers at me. Yet no one paid her any attention—Sebastian was too busy coordinating with the pack Gammas and medical team.

"I'll meet you at the hospital," Sebastian finally said as they carried Oliver out. He turned to Victoria, his expression darkening. "Go with your brother."

She bit her lip, wiping at her damp eyes before nodding. As she brushed past him, she paused, looking up with feigned concern.

"She can't be trusted."

Sebastian didn’t respond. He waited until the room had emptied, the wail of sirens fading into the distance. Only Marcus remained at the doorway, arms crossed over his chest, watching the scene unfold with wary eyes.

"Investigate what happened in the kitchen," Sebastian ordered, his voice low and dangerous.

"Um... Alpha..." Marcus hesitated, shifting uncomfortably. "The kitchen surveillance has been down for weeks. You never ordered it repaired."

A deep, guttural growl tore from Sebastian's throat, sending a shiver down my spine.

"Do I have to think of everything for you? It should have been fixed automatically!" His Alpha aura thickened, the air around him crackling with barely restrained fury.

###Chapter 154

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains, rousing Lillian from her restless sleep. She stretched, her muscles aching from the tension that had coiled within her all night. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted up from the kitchen, mingling with the crisp morning air.

Downstairs, Sebastian was already dressed in his usual tailored suit, his sharp features softened slightly by the morning light. Oliver sat at the table, swinging his legs as he munched on toast, his bright eyes darting between his father and Lillian as she descended the stairs.

"Good morning," Lillian murmured, her voice still thick with sleep.

Sebastian glanced up, his gaze lingering on her for a moment longer than necessary. "You look tired," he observed, his tone laced with concern.

She forced a smile. "Just didn’t sleep well."

Oliver piped up, crumbs dotting his lips. "Did you have a nightmare?"

Lillian hesitated. The truth was, she had dreamed of Donovan again—his cold eyes, his cruel words. But she wouldn’t burden the boy with that. "Something like that," she admitted lightly.

Sebastian’s jaw tightened imperceptibly. He set his coffee cup down with deliberate care. "We should talk," he said, his voice low.

Lillian’s pulse quickened. "About what?"

"About what happened yesterday."

Her stomach twisted. Yesterday, she had run into Donovan and Evelyn at the pack’s annual gathering. The encounter had been brief but suffocating, leaving her feeling raw and exposed.

Before she could respond, the front door burst open, and Beatrice stormed in, her cheeks flushed with excitement. "You won’t believe what just happened!" she exclaimed, barely pausing to catch her breath.

Lillian blinked. "What?"

Beatrice grinned. "Isabella just got back from Paris, and she brought us gifts!" She held up a sleek designer bag, her eyes sparkling. "And guess what else? She’s bringing her new boyfriend to dinner tonight!"

Sebastian arched a brow. "Dinner?"

Beatrice nodded eagerly. "Yeah! You’re all invited. It’s going to be amazing."

Lillian exchanged a glance with Sebastian. The last thing she wanted was to sit through an awkward dinner, pretending everything was fine. But Beatrice’s enthusiasm was infectious, and Oliver was already bouncing in his seat.

"Fine," Sebastian relented, though his tone suggested he wasn’t entirely pleased.

Beatrice clapped her hands. "Perfect! Oh, and Lillian—wear something nice. Isabella’s boyfriend is some big-shot fashion photographer."

Lillian groaned inwardly. Just what she needed—another night of forced smiles and polite conversation.

As Beatrice prattled on about the evening’s plans, Lillian’s mind wandered back to Donovan. His smirk, his possessive grip on Evelyn’s waist. The way he had looked at her—like she was nothing.

A hand brushed against hers, startling her. She looked up to find Sebastian watching her, his expression unreadable. "You okay?" he murmured.

She swallowed hard. "Yeah. Just thinking."

His fingers curled around hers, warm and steady. "Don’t let him get to you."

Easier said than done. But for now, she’d focus on getting through the day—one step at a time.

And tonight?

She’d face whatever came next.

"I... I apologize," Marcus said, lowering his gaze. "It was an oversight, and it won't happen again. I'll ensure the issue is resolved by tonight."

"What good does that do now?" Sebastian snarled, turning fully toward him, his crimson eyes burning with barely restrained fury. "My son was poisoned, and we have nothing—no footage, no leads, nothing."

"I’ll investigate thoroughly," Marcus assured him, voice steady. "At least Oliver is alive."

"If I had been a second later—"

"But you weren’t," Marcus cut in firmly. "Focus on the positive."

Sebastian’s back was rigid, his broad shoulders trembling as he exhaled sharply. The air between them crackled with tension.

After a weighted silence, Sebastian finally spoke, his voice dangerously low. "Find. Out. Everything."

"Yes, Alpha," Marcus replied with a stiff nod. His gaze flickered toward me, wary, before he swiftly exited the room, leaving me alone with a seething Sebastian.

I didn’t know what to say. My entire body trembled as I watched him pace like a caged predator, his movements sharp, erratic. He scanned the room, his gaze landing everywhere but on me, and the avoidance twisted my stomach into knots. The composed, controlled man I had begun to know was gone—replaced by a storm of rage that made my skin prickle with unease.

Finally, he stopped. His piercing eyes locked onto mine, and the intensity in them sent a shiver down my spine.

"You were reckless with my son’s life," he hissed through clenched teeth, his glare sharp enough to cut.

"Sebastian—"

"Alpha!" he roared.

I flinched, my breath hitching as I dropped my gaze.

"Alpha," I whispered, my voice barely audible. "I don’t know what happened. I—"

"What happened," he bit out, each word laced with venom, "is that my son was given peanut butter. He had an allergic reaction. I trusted you to protect him, and you failed."

"No, I—"

"Are you telling me you didn’t hand him that sandwich?"

"I’m saying I didn’t know there was peanut butter in it!" My voice cracked as tears spilled down my cheeks.

He scoffed, his lips curling in disgust, and the knot in my stomach tightened painfully.

"It was your responsibility to check everything before letting him eat," he said slowly, as if speaking to someone incapable of basic comprehension.

I opened my mouth, desperate to defend myself, to explain—but he cut me off with a sharp, dismissive wave of his hand.

"Frederick will take you home."

"But—"

"Now."

The finality in his tone left no room for argument. My chest ached as I swallowed my protests, my vision blurring with unshed tears.

I had failed. And now, I was being cast aside.

"I don't want to see you in my estate for the foreseeable future," Sebastian Blackwood said coldly, his voice sharp as a blade.

My chest tightened painfully—he wasn’t just banishing me from his home. He was cutting me out of his life entirely.

"Go," he commanded, his finger pointing toward the door like a judge delivering a sentence. "And stay away from my family."



A soft knock interrupted my thoughts, and I lifted my tear-streaked face to see my mother standing in the doorway. Her lips were pressed into a thin line, and dark circles shadowed her eyes—proof of sleepless nights. I had barely left my room for days, alternating between numbness and uncontrollable sobbing.

She assumed my devastation was because of the move.

But the truth? The last place I wanted to go was the Winslow estate—Donovan’s family home. Yet, with no other options, I had no choice.

Three days.

Three days without a single word from Sebastian.

My mother had already sold our house—to one of Eleanor Winslow’s friends—and we were expected to vacate by sundown. I had spent yesterday packing, and now my room was stripped bare, save for a few scattered clothes and my bed.

"Come downstairs," my mother urged gently. "Let’s have lunch together. One last meal in this house."

I wiped my damp cheeks with the back of my hand. "I’m not hungry."

She sighed and stepped inside, closing the door behind her.

"I know you’re upset about moving," she murmured, sitting beside me. "But this is what’s best for us. Once your father is released and we’re back on our feet, we can leave the Winslow mansion. I just need you to be patient."

As much as I hated this move, it was nothing compared to the agony of Sebastian’s rejection.

I had called the hospital yesterday, desperate to check on Oliver. But the moment I gave my name, the nurse snapped, "You’re not permitted to visit. Do not call again." Then, the line went dead.

Sebastian ignored my calls. Victoria had blocked my number.

I was completely cut off.

Lost.

Hopeless.

"Lillian, sweetheart," my mother coaxed, rubbing my back. "Let’s eat something. Then we can talk about what comes next."

I already knew what came next.

Hell.


###Chapter 155

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the campus quad. Her fingers tightened around the strap of her backpack, the weight of her textbooks grounding her. The morning sun cast long shadows, painting the world in hues of gold and amber.

She spotted Donovan across the courtyard, his arm draped possessively around Evelyn’s waist. A pang of something bitter twisted in her chest, but she forced her gaze away. He’s not worth it, she reminded herself.

"Lillian!" Beatrice’s voice cut through her thoughts. Her best friend jogged toward her, cheeks flushed from the cold. "You won’t believe what just happened."

Lillian arched a brow. "What?"

Beatrice leaned in, lowering her voice conspiratorially. "Cassandra tried to sabotage your research paper again. Professor Sinclair caught her red-handed."

Lillian’s lips curled into a smirk. "Karma’s a bitch."

Beatrice grinned. "Exactly. But that’s not all—Sebastian’s in town."

Lillian’s breath hitched. "What?"

"Yeah, Oliver mentioned it this morning. He’s back from his business trip early." Beatrice wiggled her eyebrows. "Someone’s excited."

Lillian rolled her eyes, but her pulse betrayed her. "Shut up."

The bell rang, signaling the start of classes. As they headed inside, Lillian’s phone buzzed. A message from an unknown number lit up the screen:

"We need to talk. It’s about your mother."

Her blood ran cold.

Sebastian Blackwood stood at the floor-to-ceiling windows of his penthouse, staring down at the city below. The skyline glittered under the midday sun, but his mind was elsewhere.

Theodore Whitmore entered quietly, clearing his throat. "Sir, the meeting with Alpha Harrison has been rescheduled."

Sebastian didn’t turn. "Cancel it."

Theodore hesitated. "But the alliance—"

"I said cancel it." His voice was steel.

Theodore nodded. "Of course. Also, Miss Fontaine called. She’s expecting you at the gala tonight."

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "Tell her I’ll be there."

As Theodore left, Sebastian’s phone vibrated. A photo notification—Oliver, grinning in his school uniform. A rare smile tugged at his lips.

Then another message came through, this one from Marcus Grayson:

"We found her. She’s at the university."

Sebastian’s grip on his phone turned lethal.

Lillian’s combat class was brutal. Professor Montgomery paired her against Odette Marchand, a lithe, vicious opponent who fought like a storm.

Sweat dripped down Lillian’s temple as she dodged another strike. Odette smirked. "Too slow, little wolf."

Lillian bared her teeth. "Try harder."

She feinted left, then swept Odette’s legs out from under her. The girl hit the mat with a grunt, and the class erupted in cheers.

Professor Montgomery clapped. "Excellent technique, Lillian."

As she caught her breath, her phone buzzed again. The same unknown number:

"Midnight. The old chapel. Come alone."

Lillian’s stomach churned.

That evening, Sebastian arrived at the gala in a tailored black suit, drawing every eye in the room. Isabella Fontaine glided toward him, her crimson gown shimmering under the chandeliers.

"Sebastian," she purred, looping her arm through his. "You’re late."

He offered a polite smile. "Business."

Her fingers tightened. "You’re always working."

His gaze flickered over the crowd, searching. Then he saw her—Lillian, standing near the balcony in a simple emerald dress, her presence like a shock of lightning.

Isabella followed his stare and scowled. "What’s she doing here?"

Sebastian didn’t answer. He was already moving.

Lillian turned as he approached, her eyes wide. "Sebastian?"

Before he could speak, the lights flickered. A scream pierced the air.

Then the windows shattered.

"Lillian! We're absolutely thrilled you chose to join us here," Eleanor cooed as she welcomed us at the grand entrance. Arabella stood beside her, arms crossed tightly over her chest, her icy glare piercing through me. I averted my gaze, my stomach twisting into knots. This mansion was the last place I wanted to be, and the less I had to interact with them, the better.

"Like I had any say in the matter," I muttered under my breath before I could stop myself.

My mother, Vivienne, jabbed me sharply in the ribs, shooting me a warning look.

"She’s just teasing, of course," Vivienne said with a laugh so forced it made my skin crawl. She swept forward to embrace Eleanor, pressing a quick kiss to her cheek. "We’re so grateful for your generosity."

"Think nothing of it, darling. That’s what family does," Eleanor replied smoothly, though her eyes darkened as they flicked toward me over Vivienne’s shoulder. "Shall I show you to your quarters?"

"That would be wonderful," Vivienne agreed, glancing at the luggage we’d left by the door.

"Don’t trouble yourself. The staff will handle it," Eleanor assured her, nodding at the butler, who immediately collected Vivienne’s bags.

As Eleanor guided my mother away, she cast a meaningful glance at Arabella.

"Be a dear and show Lillian to her room, won’t you?" Eleanor said, her tone sweet but her gaze sharp.

Arabella’s lips curled into a smirk that sent a chill down my spine.

"With pleasure," she purred, winking at her mother before turning to me, her eyes glinting with malice. "Follow me."

I swallowed hard and grabbed my own bags, trailing behind Arabella through the opulent halls of the Winslow estate. The silence between us was suffocating. When we neared the servants' wing, I wasn’t surprised—I’d expected nothing less.

She shoved open a heavy door, leading me through a dimly lit laundry room reeking of detergent and damp fabric. On the other side, we entered what could barely pass for a living space. The air was thick with mildew, the flickering overhead lights casting eerie shadows. The couch looked salvaged from a landfill, and the kitchen appliances were relics from another era, rusted and barely functional.

Stained rugs and peeling wallpaper completed the dismal picture—a stark contrast to the mansion’s lavish grandeur.

A few maids froze when they spotted Arabella, immediately straightening their postures, their eyes downcast.

Arabella sneered at them as if they were nothing more than dirt beneath her designer heels.

"What do you think you’re doing?" she hissed, her voice venomous. "The foyer is filthy, and you’re lounging around like you own the place? Do I need to remind you of your place again?"

"N-no, Miss Arabella," one maid stammered, trembling. "We were just resting—we’ve been working since last night without—"

"Do I look like I care?" Arabella cut her off, her voice a whip-crack of cruelty. "Get back to work, you worthless rats!"

The maids scurried away, their fear palpable. I gaped at Arabella, disgust twisting in my gut. She was only eighteen, yet she wielded cruelty like a seasoned tyrant. This behavior had to be learned—likely from Eleanor herself.

The urge to snap at her burned in my throat, but I bit my tongue. Starting a fight wouldn’t help—not when my mother’s position here was already precarious.

###Chapter 156

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood's luxurious estate. The sun had barely risen, casting a golden glow over the sprawling gardens below. She tightened the silk robe around her, the fabric whispering against her skin.

Inside, the mansion was already buzzing with activity. The clatter of silverware echoed from the dining room, where Oliver was no doubt piling his plate high with pancakes. The sound of Victoria's laughter drifted down the hallway, mingling with the low murmur of Donovan's voice.

Lillian's fingers curled around the railing. Just weeks ago, she had been a college student struggling to make ends meet. Now, she was the center of a storm she hadn't seen coming—one that involved power, betrayal, and a bond she never asked for.

A soft knock at the door pulled her from her thoughts.

"Lillian?" Beatrice's voice was hesitant. "You okay?"

Lillian turned, forcing a smile. "Yeah. Just needed some air."

Beatrice stepped onto the balcony, her brow furrowed. "You’ve been avoiding everyone since last night."

Lillian exhaled sharply. "It's just... a lot."

The memory of Donovan's cold gaze at dinner still burned. He had barely looked at her, his attention fixed on Evelyn, his new mate. And then there was Sebastian—his presence alone sent her pulse racing, even when he wasn’t in the room.

Beatrice nudged her shoulder. "You know, for someone who’s supposed to be the Lycan Chairman’s fated mate, you’re doing a terrible job at acting happy about it."

Lillian groaned. "It’s not that simple."

"Then explain it to me."

She hesitated. How could she put into words the tangled mess of emotions inside her? The way her wolf stirred whenever Sebastian was near, the way Donovan’s betrayal still ached like an open wound?

Before she could answer, the door swung open again.

Sebastian stood in the doorway, his broad frame filling the space. His dark eyes locked onto hers, unreadable as ever. "We need to talk."

Lillian’s stomach twisted.

Beatrice shot her a knowing look before slipping past Sebastian. "Good luck," she whispered.

The door clicked shut behind her, leaving Lillian alone with the man who had turned her world upside down.

Sebastian crossed the balcony in three strides, stopping just inches from her. His scent—cedar and something distinctly wild—wrapped around her.

"You’ve been avoiding me," he said, his voice low.

Lillian swallowed. "I’ve been busy."

A muscle in his jaw twitched. "Don’t lie to me."

She opened her mouth to protest, but the intensity in his gaze silenced her.

Then, without warning, he reached out, his fingers brushing against her cheek. The contact sent a jolt through her, her wolf surging forward in response.

Lillian’s breath hitched.

Sebastian’s lips curved into a smirk. "See? That’s the problem. You can’t even hide from me."

Her pulse pounded in her ears. "What do you want from me?"

His thumb traced her bottom lip, sending heat spiraling through her. "Everything."

And just like that, the world narrowed to the space between them.

But before she could respond, a sharp knock shattered the moment.

"Sir?" Marcus Grayson’s voice was urgent. "We have a situation."

Sebastian’s expression darkened. He stepped back, his hand falling away. "This isn’t over."

Lillian watched him go, her heart racing.

No, she thought. It was only just beginning.

Without sparing me a single glance, Arabella lifted her chin haughtily and strode toward the staircase. We wound through the dim, twisting hallway until we reached the door at the very end. When she shoved it open, the stench hit me like a physical blow—so putrid I nearly retched. The room was pitch-black until she flicked on the light, revealing a space that made my stomach churn. A suspicious puddle glistened in the center of the floor, and the only furnishings were a narrow cot shoved into the corner, a rickety dresser, and a chipped bedside table.

“This is a dungeon,” I muttered under my breath.

Arabella crossed her arms, smirking. “Actually, it’s one of the better maid’s quarters,” she chirped, her voice dripping with false sweetness. “No need to thank me.”

I barely resisted the urge to roll my eyes. At this point, I’d expected nothing less.

“Oh, and one more thing,” she added, narrowing her eyes like a predator sizing up prey. “You’ll be working to earn your keep. Chores must be completed promptly. The other maids will show you the ropes.”

“You expect me to serve you?” I gaped at her, incredulous. Was this how they planned to treat my mother too?

Arabella’s smirk widened. “You’re living here rent-free as a courtesy to your family. If you want your precious mother to continue enjoying her lavish lifestyle at Winslow Manor, then yes—you’ll scrub floors and polish silver like the rest of the staff.” She tilted her head mockingly. “Consider it the least you can do.”

“What’s that supposed to mean?” I demanded, my pulse spiking.

She scoffed, flipping her hair over her shoulder. “You single-handedly destroyed this family. Donovan was too good for you—I always knew it, and now everyone else sees it too.”

My hands clenched into fists. “He was the one who cheated on me,” I bit out.

Arabella rolled her eyes. “From where I’m standing? He upgraded.” With that, she turned on her heel. “Get comfortable in your new home,” she tossed over her shoulder. “Because starting tomorrow, you belong to the Winslows.”

Sebastian’s POV

“Alpha Blackwood, Oliver is recovering well. He should be cleared to leave tomorrow morning, but I’d like to keep him overnight for one final observation,” Dr. Langford said, flipping through Oliver’s medical charts.

My son had been hospitalized for a week following minor surgery, and though his physical wounds were healing, something was off. He’d been unusually withdrawn since waking up—barely speaking, even to me. Victoria, too, had been conspicuously absent, brushing off my concerns with excuses about wedding preparations.

I made a mental note to confront her later. Something wasn’t right.

“Thank you, Doctor,” I said. Dr. Langford was one of the finest physicians in the country, and I was grateful to have her in my pack. She was also Marcus Grayson’s fated mate, though her frequent travels kept them apart more often than not. When she was here, their sickeningly sweet devotion was almost unbearable to witness.

“Of course,” she replied with a knowing smile.

Returning to Oliver’s room, I found him scrolling listlessly through the tablet I’d brought to entertain him. He glanced up briefly before turning away again. Frustration gnawed at me.

“Alright, that’s it.” I dragged a hand through my hair. “What’s going on with you? Why the silent treatment?”

Oliver’s frown deepened as he met my gaze. “You really don’t know?”

###Chapter 157

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the lavish bedroom as Lillian stirred beneath silk sheets. Her fingers brushed against the empty space beside her—Sebastian had already left for his early meeting. A pang of loneliness tugged at her heart, but she quickly shook it off. Today was important.

Downstairs, the mansion buzzed with activity. Giselle, the head maid, directed staff with quiet efficiency while Lucien, the flirtatious head chef, winked at Lillian as she entered the dining room. "Morning, Luna," he teased, sliding a plate of freshly made croissants toward her. "Special recipe, just for you."

She rolled her eyes but couldn't suppress a smile. "You're incorrigible."

Beatrice burst into the room, her cheeks flushed with excitement. "You won't believe what just happened!" she gasped, clutching her phone. "Isabella's fashion show got featured in Vogue Paris! They called her 'the rising star of the season'!"

Lillian's eyes widened. "That's amazing! We have to celebrate—"

Her phone buzzed sharply, cutting her off. An unknown number flashed on the screen. Her stomach twisted as she read the message: "You don't belong there, little wolf. He'll discard you like the others."

The croissant turned to ash in her mouth.

Beatrice frowned. "Lil? What's wrong?"

"Nothing," Lillian lied, forcing a smile. But her fingers trembled as she deleted the message. Someone was watching her. And they wanted her gone.

Meanwhile, in his office, Sebastian scowled at the financial reports spread across his desk. Marcus, his Beta, cleared his throat. "The Winslows are making moves again. Rumor has it they're trying to sway the council against you."

Sebastian's grip tightened around his pen. "Let them try." His phone vibrated—a notification from the security team. His blood ran cold as he saw the screenshot of the threat sent to Lillian.

"Find out who sent this," he growled, his Lycan aura flaring. "Now."

Marcus nodded sharply and left.

Sebastian stared out the window, his mind racing. Someone was targeting his mate. And if they thought they could intimidate her, they were sorely mistaken.

He would burn the world down before he let anyone hurt her.

Back at the mansion, Lillian paced her room, her thoughts a tangled mess. The message, the Winslows, the whispers at school—it all felt connected. A knock at the door startled her.

"Come in," she called, expecting Beatrice.

But it was Donovan who stepped inside, his expression unreadable. "We need to talk."

Her pulse spiked. "About what?"

His smile was razor-thin. "About the secrets you're keeping from Sebastian."

The air left her lungs.

How much did he know?

And more importantly—what would he do with that knowledge?

The morning sun filtered through the heavy velvet curtains of Sebastian Blackwood's private study, casting golden streaks across the antique mahogany desk where Lillian sat fidgeting. Her fingers traced the intricate carvings on the armrests of the leather chair that smelled faintly of sandalwood and power.

"Relax, little wolf," Sebastian murmured without looking up from the documents he was signing. The way his silver fountain pen glided across the parchment made her stomach flutter. "You're not in trouble."

Lillian swallowed hard. "Then why did you ask me here before breakfast?"

Across the room, Theodore Whitmore discreetly adjusted the thermostat, his movements silent as always. The butler's presence was both comforting and unnerving - a reminder that nothing in this mansion went unnoticed.

Sebastian finally set down his pen, those piercing amber eyes locking onto hers. "We have a situation with Donovan."

The name sent ice through Lillian's veins. She hadn't seen her former fated mate since the disastrous engagement party where he'd publicly rejected her for Evelyn. "What's he done now?"

"Not him." Sebastian's jaw tightened. "His father. Archibald Winslow has filed a formal complaint with the Council about our... arrangement."

Lillian's breath hitched. She knew this day would come - the day their secret relationship would face scrutiny from the Lycan elite. "What does that mean for us?"

Before Sebastian could answer, the study doors burst open. Oliver came barreling in, his school tie already askew at 7:30 AM. "Dad! Victoria won't let me have the last chocolate croissant!"

Sebastian pinched the bridge of his nose. "Oliver, we're in the middle of-"

"Actually," Lillian interrupted, standing abruptly. "I should go check on Beatrice. She was supposed to meet me for breakfast twenty minutes ago." The excuse tumbled out too quickly, but she needed air, needed space to process this new threat to their fragile happiness.

As she hurried toward the door, Sebastian's voice stopped her. "Lillian." That single word held a world of unspoken promises and warnings. "We'll continue this conversation tonight. My room. 9 PM."

The heat in his gaze made her toes curl in her slippers. "Yes, Alpha," she whispered before escaping into the hallway.

Outside, the mansion buzzed with morning activity. Maids carried fresh linens, chefs discussed the day's menu, and through it all, Lillian felt the weight of invisible eyes following her every move. Were they judging her? Pitying her? Waiting for her to fail?

She nearly collided with Marcus Grayson at the grand staircase. The Beta's usual friendly smile was absent today. "Lillian," he nodded curtly. "You should know - the Winslows aren't the only ones asking questions."

Her heart plummeted. "Who else?"

But Marcus just shook his head. "Not here. Meet me at the east garden after lunch." With that, he disappeared down the hall, leaving Lillian with more questions than answers.

As she descended the stairs, her phone buzzed. A text from Beatrice: Emergency! Meet me at the gazebo NOW. Cassandra's spreading rumors again.

Lillian groaned. Just what she needed - more drama before her first class. But as she pushed through the front doors into the crisp morning air, one thought consumed her: How many enemies would she have to face to keep her place at Sebastian's side?

The real battle, it seemed, was just beginning.

"If I knew, I wouldn't be asking," I snapped, frustration lacing my tone.

"Talk to me, Oliver," I said more gently as I stepped closer to his bed. "Why are you upset with me?"

Oliver swallowed hard, and I saw the glimmer of unshed tears in his eyes—my chest tightened painfully. Whatever was bothering him... it was serious.

"What did you say to Lillian that made her not want to see me?" His question caught me off guard.

"What?" I blinked.

"Before I passed out, after the Epi... you were furious. I remember you saying something to her. Then everything went black, and I woke up here. It's been days, Dad, and Lillian hasn’t come once. I didn’t even catch her scent when I woke up—which means she hasn’t been here at all. You must have said something to make her stay away from me."

Even young werewolves had an acute sense of smell, and Oliver had always been particularly sensitive to Lillian’s presence. She’d spent so much time with him that her scent had become familiar, comforting. I wasn’t surprised he noticed her absence—but the depth of his distress? That shook me.

"Oliver, you have to understand—I did this for your own good. Lillian is dangerous—"

"Dangerous?" His voice cracked, eyes widening with disbelief before darkening with anger. A look I’d never seen on him before. "Lillian wouldn’t hurt anyone unless they deserved it, Dad. You know that."

I sighed, sinking onto the edge of his bed.

"Look..." I started, scrambling for the right words to soothe him. "Lillian was the one who gave you that sandwich, Oliver. She was careless, and because of her, I almost lost you. I can’t risk having someone like that near my family."

"So you told her to stay away?" His voice was barely above a whisper, but the accusation in it was sharp. "That’s why she hasn’t come. You scared her off. The only tutor I ever actually liked—"

"I can find you another tutor—"

"There’s no one like her, and you know that!" His shout echoed through the room.

I froze, stunned into silence. Oliver had never raised his voice at me like this. Never defied me so openly. And after what she’d done—how could he still defend her?

"You almost died, Oliver," I bit out, harsher than I intended.

"It wasn’t her fault!"

"She gave you the sandwich—"

"And I put the peanut butter in it!" His scream tore through me.

My breath hitched as I stared at him, utterly stunned.

"What did you just say?" The words barely left my lips after a long, heavy silence.

His voice was quiet, almost hesitant. "I was the one who put peanut butter in it. I did it behind Lillian's back—she didn’t even know. You're blaming the wrong person. It was my fault..."

I couldn’t speak. My mind spun with questions. How? Why? What?

"I don’t understand..." I finally managed to whisper.

He lowered his gaze, guilt weighing on his small shoulders. "I forgot I was allergic. I just... wanted to try it." His voice trembled. "I was careless. But it wasn’t Lillian’s fault. Please, Dad. Don’t punish her because of what I did. I promise I’ll never do it again... just don’t be angry with her."

A sharp exhale escaped me—I hadn’t even realized I’d been holding my breath.

Lillian was innocent?

She hadn’t known about the peanut butter in the sandwich. I should have listened to her from the start.

Before I could respond, a familiar voice cut through my thoughts via mindlink.

"Alpha..." It was Marcus. "We’ve found something new about the peanut butter. The person responsible is already in custody."

My grip tightened.

Who else was involved in this?
###Chapter 158 

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stretched beneath the golden sunlight filtering through the trees. Her wolf stirred restlessly beneath her skin, sensing the tension in the air. Today was the day everything would change.

"Lillian!" Beatrice's voice cut through the forest stillness as she jogged up the path, her chestnut curls bouncing. "You're not seriously considering going through with this, are you?"

Lillian turned, her amber eyes flashing with determination. "I have to, Bea. Donovan's made his choice clear with Evelyn. And Sebastian..." Her voice caught on the Lycan chairman's name. "He deserves better than a broken mate bond."

Beatrice grabbed her wrist, her grip surprisingly strong. "Listen to me. That bastard Donovan doesn't get to dictate your life anymore. And Sebastian Blackwood? He's been waiting for you since the moment you walked into his office."

A twig snapped nearby. Both girls whirled to see Oliver peeking from behind an oak tree, his small face scrunched in concern. "Dad's looking for you," the seven-year-old whispered. "He's got that scary quiet voice."

Lillian's heart clenched. She'd been avoiding Sebastian since the disastrous confrontation with Donovan at the pack borders. The memory of his silver eyes darkening with hurt when she'd pushed him away still haunted her.

The forest suddenly went silent - no birdsong, no rustling leaves. Then came the unmistakable sound of heavy footsteps crushing fallen branches.

Sebastian emerged from the tree line, his broad shoulders blocking the sunlight. His usual impeccable suit was replaced by combat gear, the black fabric stretching across his muscular frame. "Lillian," he said, his deep voice vibrating through her bones. "We need to talk."

Beatrice squeezed her hand before stepping back. "I'll take Oliver for ice cream," she murmured, steering the curious boy away.

Sebastian closed the distance in three strides, his scent of sandalwood and winter enveloping her. "You've been avoiding me for five days," he stated, his jaw tight. "Is this about what happened with Donovan?"

Lillian swallowed hard. "It's about what didn't happen, Sebastian. I'm still tied to him through this stupid mate bond, and you—"

"I don't care about the bond," he growled, cupping her face. His thumb brushed her cheekbone, sending shivers down her spine. "I only care about you. Let me help you break it."

A sudden howl pierced the air, followed by several answering calls. Sebastian's head snapped up, his body tensing. "That's Marcus," he said grimly. "The Darkmoon pack is at our borders."

Lillian's wolf surged forward, her claws extending. "Donovan," she breathed.

Sebastian's phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, his expression turning thunderous. "Victoria's missing." His silver eyes met hers, blazing with barely contained fury. "And your mother just arrived at the Winslow estate."

The ground seemed to shift beneath Lillian's feet. Her mother, Vivienne, at Donovan's family home? While his sister Arabella was supposedly visiting friends overseas? The pieces clicked together with terrifying clarity.

"This isn't a coincidence," Lillian whispered. "They're planning something."

Sebastian's phone buzzed again. This time, when he looked at the message, his face went pale. "The Council just issued a warrant for your arrest," he said hoarsely. "They're claiming you conspired with Alpha Maximilian to kidnap Victoria."

Lillian staggered back. "That's impossible! I haven't even seen Victoria since—"

The distant sound of engines cut her off. Sebastian grabbed her hand. "We need to move. Now." His grip was iron, but his voice softened as he added, "Trust me, little wolf."

As they sprinted toward the pack garages, Lillian realized with startling clarity that she did trust him - completely. Whatever storm was coming, they'd face it together. Even if it meant going to war with the entire Lycan Council.

The morning sun cast golden rays through the sheer curtains of Lillian's bedroom, stirring her awake. She stretched lazily, her muscles still sore from yesterday's intense training session with Professor Montclair. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted up from the kitchen, signaling that Giselle had already begun her morning duties.

Lillian's phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Beatrice lit up the screen: "Meet me at the café in 20. Big news!"

Curious, Lillian dressed quickly, opting for a simple sweater and jeans before heading downstairs. The mansion was unusually quiet, save for the faint clinking of dishes in the dining room. Sebastian must have left early for another meeting with Alpha Maximilian.

The crisp autumn air greeted her as she stepped outside, the fallen leaves crunching beneath her boots. The campus café was bustling as usual, but Beatrice had secured their usual corner table, her expression alight with excitement.

"You look like you're about to burst," Lillian remarked, sliding into the seat opposite her.

Beatrice leaned forward, lowering her voice. "You won't believe what happened last night."

Lillian raised an eyebrow. "Try me."

"Tristan Whitlock—the guy from Darkmoon Pack—asked me out."

Lillian nearly choked on her coffee. "The same Tristan who nearly broke your ribs during combat training?"

Beatrice grinned. "Turns out he was just trying to impress me. He apologized and said he wanted to make it up to me over dinner."

Lillian studied her friend's flushed cheeks. "And you said yes?"

"Obviously." Beatrice twirled a strand of hair around her finger. "But that's not even the craziest part."

Before she could continue, the café door swung open, and Donovan strode in, his arm draped possessively around Evelyn's shoulders. The sight sent a sharp pang through Lillian's chest, though she refused to let it show.

Donovan's gaze locked onto hers, a smirk playing on his lips. "Fancy seeing you here, Lillian."

Evelyn's grip on him tightened, her eyes narrowing. "Don't bother, Donovan. She's not worth your time."

Lillian forced a smile. "Good to see you too, Evelyn. Still clinging to someone else's leftovers, I see."

Evelyn's face darkened, but Donovan merely chuckled. "Still as feisty as ever. Too bad you couldn't keep what was yours."

Beatrice bristled beside her, but Lillian placed a calming hand on her arm. "Let's go. The air suddenly got toxic."

As they stood to leave, Donovan called after her, "Running away again, Lillian? Some things never change."

Lillian paused at the door, turning just enough to meet his gaze. "Neither do second-rate alphas, apparently."

Outside, Beatrice exhaled sharply. "I hate him."

Lillian shrugged, though her fingers curled into fists at her sides. "He's not worth the energy."

Beatrice hesitated before blurting, "That wasn't even the news I wanted to tell you."

Lillian frowned. "What is it?"

"Sebastian is hosting a gala next week. And guess who's invited?"

Lillian's pulse quickened. "Us?"

Beatrice nodded. "Officially, it's for some business alliance, but rumor has it he's planning to announce something... personal."

Lillian's breath caught. "You don't think—"

"I don't know," Beatrice admitted. "But if he's finally making a move, you better be ready."

A slow smile spread across Lillian's face. "Oh, I've been ready."

The wind picked up, scattering leaves across the pavement. Somewhere in the distance, a howl echoed—a reminder that the game was far from over.

And this time, Lillian wasn't playing to lose.

The evening air was thick with tension as Lillian stood in the grand hall of the Blackwood estate. The chandeliers cast a golden glow over the gathered guests, their murmurs a low hum beneath the orchestral music. She adjusted the strap of her emerald-green gown, her fingers trembling slightly.

Sebastian Blackwood, the formidable Lycan chairman, stood at the center of the room, his presence commanding attention. His dark eyes flickered toward her, and for a moment, the world seemed to still. Lillian swallowed hard, her pulse quickening.

"Are you alright?" Beatrice whispered beside her, nudging her elbow.

Lillian forced a smile. "Just nerves."

Beatrice smirked. "You? Nervous? That’s new."

Before Lillian could retort, a sharp laugh cut through the air. Evelyn, Donovan’s new mate, sauntered toward them, her crimson dress clinging to her curves. "Well, well. If it isn’t the little runaway," she purred, her gaze raking over Lillian with disdain.

Lillian’s jaw tightened. "Evelyn. How… unexpected to see you here."

Evelyn’s lips curled. "Oh, darling, I go where Donovan goes. And tonight, he has business with your dear Sebastian."

A chill ran down Lillian’s spine. Business?

Before she could ask, Victoria—Sebastian’s daughter—appeared, her arm linked with Donovan’s. The sight made Lillian’s stomach twist. Victoria’s engagement to Donovan had been a political move, but seeing them together still stung.

"Lillian," Donovan greeted coolly, his eyes unreadable. "You look… well."

She clenched her fists. "Donovan."

Sebastian stepped forward, his voice smooth but edged with warning. "If you’ll excuse us, we have matters to discuss." He gestured toward the private study.

Donovan smirked. "Of course."

As the two men disappeared into the study, Lillian exhaled sharply. Something was off. Donovan wouldn’t show up unannounced unless he had an agenda.

Beatrice squeezed her hand. "You okay?"

Lillian shook her head. "No. And I think we’re about to find out why."

Just then, the doors burst open, and Marcus Grayson, Sebastian’s beta, rushed in, his face grim. "Lillian," he said urgently. "You need to come with me. Now."

Her heart pounded. "What’s wrong?"

Marcus hesitated, then lowered his voice. "It’s Oliver. He’s missing."

Lillian’s blood ran cold. Sebastian’s son.

Without another word, she followed Marcus, her mind racing. One thing was certain—Donovan’s arrival was no coincidence.

And whatever game he was playing, she wouldn’t let him win.

Sebastian's voice was sharp through the mindlink. "What do you mean you found the culprit?" His gaze flickered to Oliver, who sat lost in thought. Had his son lied to him? Oliver had never deceived him before... or had he?

"It was a maid," Marcus responded. "She was caught with the peanut butter in her quarters—the same one who fetched you after Oliver's allergic reaction. She confessed she wanted compensation for helping save him."

"Compensation?" Sebastian's growl reverberated through the link. "I want her exiled from the pack and stripped of her rank immediately."

"Understood, Alpha," Marcus agreed. "Would you like to confront her before her banishment?"

Sebastian considered it briefly before exhaling sharply. "No," he muttered. "Just get rid of her."

"As you command." The connection severed, and Sebastian turned back to Oliver, his eyes narrowed.

"Why did you lie to me?"

Oliver lifted his gaze, lips pressing into a frown. "I didn’t lie..." His voice wavered unconvincingly.

"Yes, you did," Sebastian countered, arms crossing over his chest. "Because it wasn’t you who put the peanut butter in that sandwich—it was a maid."

Oliver’s eyes widened in shock. "What? Why would a maid want to hurt me?"

"That’s not your concern," Sebastian said firmly. "Just know it won’t happen again. She’s being exiled, and every other servant will be investigated."

Oliver fidgeted with his fingers, processing his father’s words.

"You shouldn’t have lied, Oliver," Sebastian murmured, disappointment lacing his tone.

"I’m sorry, Dad..." Oliver’s voice cracked, tears welling in his eyes. "I just couldn’t let Lillian take the blame."

Sebastian fell silent, absorbing his son’s words. "So even if it had truly been Lillian’s mistake, you would’ve covered for her?"

Without hesitation, Oliver nodded. "Yes. She’s family now, right? Family protects each other."

Sebastian’s chest tightened. Oliver was right. Lillian had become family. She was always there, and yet he’d dismissed her without a second thought. He’d accused her blindly, and now regret gnawed at him.

He just hoped it wasn’t too late to make things right.

Meanwhile, neither Sebastian nor Victoria had any inkling of Donovan’s scheming. He’d thought having Lillian under his roof would give him the perfect opportunity to manipulate her, but his family’s constant surveillance made it impossible.

He knew Lillian would never harm Oliver—she adored the boy too much. Whoever had done this was twisted, targeting a seven-year-old. But Donovan had a plan. He bribed a maid, promising her a lifetime of luxury if she took the fall. The moment she saw the money, greed lit up her eyes.

An hour later, she was exiled, and Donovan discreetly transferred the funds into her account. He always kept his word—though he knew she wouldn’t live long enough to enjoy it. The money would return to him soon enough.

Now, he just needed to ensure Lillian got her position back. At least then, he’d have daily access to her—and more chances to lure her to his side.

Lillian’s POV

"You look dead on your feet," Beatrice remarked as she joined me in the student quad. I stared down at my failed exam and sighed. Between the Blackwoods’ demands and my studies, I hadn’t slept in days.

"Is living with the Blackwoods that terrible?"

I shot her a weary look. "Worse than terrible."

"I’m so sorry, Lillian," Beatrice murmured, resting her head on my shoulder. "I’ve been searching for a place for you, but no one has vacancies."

"It’s fine," I said softly. "I appreciate you trying."

"It’s not fair," Beatrice huffed, crossing her arms. "You have a life too—classes, exams. What does your mother think about all this?"

I swallowed hard. If only she knew the truth.


###Chapter 159

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s estate. The sun had barely risen, casting a golden hue over the sprawling gardens below. She tightened the silk robe around her, the fabric whispering against her skin.

Last night’s events replayed in her mind—Donovan’s sudden reappearance, the venom in his words, the way Evelyn had clung to his arm like a trophy. A bitter taste lingered in her mouth. She had thought she was over him, but seeing him again had stirred emotions she’d buried deep.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

“Lillian?” Beatrice’s voice was muffled through the door. “Are you awake?”

Lillian sighed, rubbing her temples. “Come in.”

The door creaked open, and Beatrice slipped inside, her usual bubbly demeanor replaced with concern. “You look like you didn’t sleep at all.”

“I didn’t,” Lillian admitted, sinking into the plush armchair by the window. “Too much on my mind.”

Beatrice perched on the edge of the bed, her fingers twisting the hem of her sweater. “It’s about Donovan, isn’t it?”

Lillian didn’t answer. She didn’t need to.

“You can’t let him get to you,” Beatrice said firmly. “He’s not worth it. Not after everything he put you through.”

“I know.” Lillian’s voice was barely a whisper. “But seeing him with Evelyn—it’s like he’s rubbing it in my face.”

Beatrice’s expression darkened. “That’s exactly what he’s doing. He wants a reaction from you. Don’t give him the satisfaction.”

Lillian exhaled sharply. “Easier said than done.”

A comfortable silence settled between them, broken only by the distant chirping of birds. Then Beatrice grinned, mischief sparkling in her eyes. “You know what you need? A distraction.”

Lillian arched a brow. “What kind of distraction?”

“Sebastian’s hosting a charity gala tonight,” Beatrice said, wiggling her eyebrows. “Black-tie event, high-profile guests, open bar—the works.”

Lillian groaned. “I’m not in the mood for socializing.”

“Exactly why you should go,” Beatrice countered. “Dress up, show Donovan what he’s missing, and remind yourself that you’re the Luna of this pack now. You’re not the same girl he walked away from.”

Lillian hesitated. The idea of facing Donovan again so soon made her stomach churn, but Beatrice had a point. Hiding wouldn’t change anything.

“Fine,” she relented. “But if I end up throwing a drink in his face, I’m blaming you.”

Beatrice laughed, tossing a pillow at her. “Deal.”

As Beatrice left to prepare for the day, Lillian turned back to the window. The sun was higher now, bathing the estate in warm light.

Tonight would be a test—of her strength, her resolve, and her ability to move forward.

And she refused to fail.

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the campus quad, her boots crunching against the gravel path. Her phone buzzed—another message from Donovan. She ignored it, just as she had the last dozen.

Across the courtyard, Cassandra smirked, whispering something to her clique. Lillian clenched her fists but kept walking. She wouldn’t give them the satisfaction of a reaction.

Beatrice caught up to her, breathless. "You won’t believe what I just heard," she said, looping her arm through Lillian’s. "Sebastian’s hosting a gala at Blackwood Manor next week. The entire elite pack is invited."

Lillian’s pulse stuttered. "Why would he do that now?"

Beatrice shrugged. "Rumor has it he’s announcing something big. Maybe about his engagement to Victoria?"

A cold weight settled in Lillian’s stomach. She forced a laugh. "Good for them."

But Beatrice wasn’t fooled. "You still care about him, don’t you?"

Before Lillian could answer, a sleek black car pulled up beside them. The window rolled down, revealing Sebastian’s sharp profile. "Get in," he said, his voice brooking no argument.

Beatrice gaped. Lillian hesitated, but curiosity won out. She slid into the leather seat, the door clicking shut behind her.

Sebastian didn’t look at her. "We need to talk."

The car pulled away, leaving Beatrice standing in stunned silence.

Lillian crossed her arms. "About what? Your upcoming engagement?"

His jaw tightened. "That’s not happening."

"Then what—"

"Someone’s targeting you," he interrupted, finally meeting her gaze. His eyes burned with intensity. "And I won’t let them hurt you again."

Lillian’s breath caught. The air between them crackled with unspoken tension.

Outside, the city blurred past. Whatever Sebastian wasn’t saying, it was big. And this time, she wouldn’t run from it.

I let out a heavy sigh, chewing on the inside of my cheek until I tasted the faint tang of copper.

"She doesn't even realize how bad things are for me," I admitted, my voice barely above a whisper. "When I tried to talk to her about it, she just told me I should be grateful to the Winslow family and stop complaining." Beatrice rolled her eyes so hard I thought they might get stuck.

"Completely delusional," she muttered under her breath.

"Her mate is in prison, Bea. She's allowed to be a little out of touch. I just... I need her to be okay." My throat tightened. "If anything happened to her—if they treated her the way they treat me—"

Tears spilled over before I could stop them. I swiped at them hastily, glancing around to make sure no one saw.

"This isn't fair to you," Beatrice murmured, her voice softening. "Have you eaten? You look like you've dropped ten pounds in a week."

I bit my lip. Truth was, I hadn’t eaten much these past few days. The servants' food was barely edible, and my appetite had vanished under the weight of everything.

"I'm fine," I lied, forcing a weak smile.

My gaze flickered to the clock, and I exhaled sharply.

"I should go," I told her. "I don’t want to be late tonight."

"Make sure you turn in your assignments," she called after me as I headed toward the parking lot.

I waved over my shoulder without looking back. My Uber was already on its way, but I wasn’t expecting to see the sleek black luxury car idling at the curb. My stomach twisted as the window rolled down, revealing Marcus Grayson behind the wheel.

"Marcus?" My brows furrowed. "What are you doing here?"

"I have news for you," he said, his expression unreadable.

I took a step back, crossing my arms. "If Sebastian knew you were here, you’d be in deep trouble."

"He’s the one who sent me," Marcus said, catching me off guard. "He had urgent business at the estate and couldn’t come himself, but—"

"How convenient," I muttered under my breath.

Just then, my Uber pulled up with a quick honk. I motioned for the driver to wait and turned back to Marcus.

"I have to go," I said flatly, spinning on my heel.

I heard his car door slam shut, followed by quick footsteps.

"Lillian, wait. Please, just hear me out," he pleaded.

I had nothing left to say to him—or to anyone tied to Sebastian Blackwood.

Whatever Marcus had to say wouldn’t change a thing.

"I really need to go, Marcus," I said, turning away from him.

"We uncovered the truth. It was one of the maids who poisoned Oliver—not you." My entire body froze just as my fingers brushed the car door handle. I had been so sure it was Victoria, given how suspiciously she’d been acting. Never in a million years would I have guessed it was one of Sebastian’s most trusted staff.

"Are you certain?" I asked, refusing to meet his gaze.

"Yes. She confessed everything. She’s been exiled from the pack and forbidden from joining any other," Marcus explained.

I sucked in a sharp breath, slowly turning to face him.

"That’s practically a death sentence," I murmured, my voice barely above a whisper.

Marcus nodded, running a hand through his tousled hair. "She nearly killed his son. Of course he’s furious. You can’t blame him for being angry—or for worrying about Oliver’s safety."

I sighed. "No, of course not," I said softly. "But he wouldn’t even hear me out. I understand he was upset, but he cast me aside like I meant nothing, Marcus."

"And he regrets that," Marcus insisted. "If you’d just give him a chance—"

"A chance?" I scoffed. "If he wants forgiveness, he can damn well apologize himself." I yanked the car door open but hesitated before sliding inside.

"How is Oliver?"

"He was discharged today," Marcus said. "He’s recovering well... but he misses you."

Tears pricked at my eyes, but I blinked them away before they could fall.

"Thank you for telling me, Marcus. I appreciate the update. But if Alpha Blackwood is truly sorry, he’ll have to say it to my face—not send his Beta to do it for him."

"I understand," Marcus murmured, stepping back.

I didn’t spare him another glance as I climbed into the car and slammed the door shut. The Uber pulled away just as the first tear escaped, tracing a hot path down my cheek.


###Chapter 160

The crisp morning air carried the faint scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s estate. The sun had barely risen, casting a golden hue over the sprawling gardens below. She tightened the silk robe around her, the fabric cool against her skin.

Last night’s events replayed in her mind—Donovan’s sudden reappearance, the venom in his words, the way Evelyn had clung to his arm like a trophy. A bitter taste lingered in Lillian’s mouth. She had thought she was over him, but seeing him again had stirred emotions she’d buried deep.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Lillian?" Beatrice’s voice was muffled through the door. "Are you awake?"

Lillian sighed, rubbing her temples. "Come in."

The door creaked open, revealing Beatrice in her usual oversized sweater and leggings, her dark curls piled messily atop her head. She held two steaming mugs, the rich aroma of coffee filling the room.

"You look like you didn’t sleep at all," Beatrice observed, handing her a mug.

Lillian accepted it gratefully, the warmth seeping into her fingers. "I didn’t."

Beatrice perched on the edge of the bed, studying her. "Donovan?"

Lillian nodded, taking a slow sip. The coffee was strong, just how she liked it. "He showed up at the gala last night. With Evelyn."

Beatrice’s nose wrinkled. "Ugh. That woman is insufferable."

Lillian smirked. "Tell me about it."

Silence settled between them, comfortable yet heavy. Beatrice finally broke it. "Sebastian didn’t seem too happy about it either."

Lillian’s grip on the mug tightened. Sebastian had been… intense. The way his jaw had clenched when Donovan approached, the possessive grip on her waist—it had sent shivers down her spine.

"I don’t know what’s going on with him," Lillian admitted. "One minute he’s distant, the next he’s acting like—"

"Like he owns you?" Beatrice supplied, raising a brow.

Lillian shot her a glare. "I was going to say protective."

Beatrice snorted. "Same difference with that man."

Lillian opened her mouth to argue when another knock sounded—this one sharper, more authoritative.

"Enter," she called.

The door swung open, revealing Sebastian himself, dressed impeccably in a tailored suit, his dark hair slightly tousled as if he’d been running his hands through it. His golden eyes locked onto hers, unreadable.

"Lillian," he said, voice low. "We need to talk."

Beatrice stood, shooting Lillian a knowing look. "I’ll leave you to it."

As the door clicked shut behind her, Lillian squared her shoulders. Whatever this was about, she was ready.

Or so she thought.

Sebastian stepped closer, his presence overwhelming. "Donovan is planning something," he said without preamble. "And I won’t let him hurt you again."

Lillian’s breath hitched. There was something dangerous in his tone, something that made her pulse race.

"What do you mean?" she asked.

Sebastian’s lips curled into a smirk, but there was no humor in it. "Let’s just say… he won’t be a problem for much longer."

The promise in his words sent a thrill down her spine.

And just like that, the game had changed.

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains, painting delicate patterns across the silk sheets. Lillian stretched lazily, her muscles still humming with the remnants of last night’s passion. Beside her, Sebastian lay sprawled, his chiseled torso exposed, the sheets barely covering his hips.

A soft knock at the door interrupted the quiet.

"Alpha Blackwood, your presence is required in the council chamber," Marcus Grayson’s voice filtered through the wood.

Sebastian groaned, rubbing his face. "Tell them I’ll be there in ten."

Lillian propped herself up on one elbow, her dark curls tumbling over her shoulder. "Trouble?"

"Always," he muttered, pressing a quick kiss to her lips before rolling out of bed.

She watched him dress with practiced ease, the muscles in his back flexing as he pulled on his shirt. Even now, after everything, the sight of him still made her pulse quicken.

"You should come with me," he said suddenly, buttoning his cuffs.

Lillian blinked. "To the council meeting?"

Sebastian smirked. "You’re my mate. They need to get used to seeing you there."

Her stomach fluttered. The idea of standing beside him in front of the pack elders was both thrilling and terrifying.

Before she could respond, another knock sounded—this time more urgent.

"Alpha, it’s about the Darkmoon pack," Marcus called.

Sebastian’s expression darkened. "Damn it." He strode to the door, yanking it open. "What now?"

Marcus hesitated, his gaze flicking to Lillian before lowering his voice. "Alpha Maximilian has challenged the treaty. He’s demanding a renegotiation—with conditions."

Lillian sat up straighter, her instincts prickling.

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "Tell them I’m coming."

As Marcus retreated, Sebastian turned back to her. "Get dressed. We’re leaving in five."

Lillian didn’t argue. Something in his tone told her this wasn’t just politics—it was personal.

And when it came to Alpha Maximilian Voss, nothing was ever simple.

The council chamber was already packed when they arrived. Elders murmured in hushed tones, their expressions grim. At the head of the table, Alpha Maximilian lounged with deceptive ease, his icy blue eyes glinting with amusement.

"Ah, Sebastian," he drawled. "So nice of you to finally join us."

Sebastian ignored the jab, taking his seat. Lillian stood beside him, acutely aware of the stares boring into her.

Maximilian’s gaze slid to her, lingering. "And you brought your little mate. How… quaint."

Sebastian’s knuckles whitened on the armrests. "State your business, Voss."

Maximilian smirked. "Very well. I propose a new alliance—one that benefits us both." He leaned forward. "But it comes with a price."

Lillian’s breath hitched. She didn’t like the way he was looking at her.

Sebastian’s voice was dangerously calm. "What price?"

Maximilian’s smile widened. "A challenge. Your best warrior against mine. If I win, I get territory. If you win…" His gaze flicked to Lillian again. "Well, let’s just say I’ll reconsider my stance."

The room erupted in protests.

Lillian’s heart pounded. This wasn’t just about land—it was a power play. And she was the pawn.

Sebastian stood abruptly, his chair scraping back. "You’ll have your challenge. But if your warrior so much as breathes wrong near my mate, I’ll tear your pack apart."

Maximilian merely chuckled. "I’d expect nothing less."

As the meeting dissolved into chaos, Lillian gripped Sebastian’s arm. "What are you thinking?"

His eyes burned with fury. "I’m thinking I should’ve killed him years ago."

And just like that, the fragile peace shattered.

The morning sun cast golden streaks through the towering windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s mansion, illuminating the grand foyer where Lillian stood, her fingers nervously twisting the hem of her sweater. The air was thick with tension, the kind that made her pulse race and her wolf stir restlessly beneath her skin.

Donovan’s sudden reappearance had thrown everything into chaos.

She could still hear his voice, smooth as poisoned honey, whispering promises she no longer wanted to hear. "You’ll always be mine, Lillian. No matter what."

A shiver ran down her spine.

"Lillian?"

Sebastian’s deep voice cut through her spiraling thoughts, grounding her. She turned to find him standing in the doorway of his study, his piercing blue eyes locked onto hers. The intensity of his gaze sent warmth flooding through her, a stark contrast to the cold dread Donovan had left in his wake.

"Come here," he murmured, extending a hand.

She didn’t hesitate.

The moment her fingers touched his, the world seemed to steady. His grip was firm, reassuring—an anchor in the storm.

"We need to talk about Donovan," Sebastian said, his voice low.

Lillian swallowed hard. "I know."

Sebastian led her into the study, where the scent of aged leather and cedar enveloped her. He didn’t release her hand as they settled onto the plush sofa, his thumb tracing slow circles over her knuckles.

"He won’t stop," she admitted, her voice barely above a whisper. "He’s obsessed."

Sebastian’s jaw tightened, a flicker of something dark crossing his features. "He won’t lay a hand on you again. I’ll make sure of it."

The conviction in his voice sent a thrill through her, but beneath it, fear lingered. Donovan wasn’t just any rogue—he was cunning, ruthless, and he had allies.

"What if he—"

Sebastian cut her off with a sharp shake of his head. "No what-ifs. We handle this together."

Lillian exhaled slowly, leaning into his side. For the first time since Donovan had reappeared, she felt a flicker of hope.

Then the door burst open.

Marcus Grayson, Sebastian’s beta, strode in, his expression grim. "Alpha, we have a problem."

Sebastian’s grip on Lillian tightened. "What is it?"

Marcus hesitated, his gaze flicking to Lillian before returning to his Alpha. "Donovan’s been spotted near the eastern border. He’s not alone."

Lillian’s blood ran cold.

Sebastian stood abruptly, his entire demeanor shifting into that of a predator ready to strike. "Gather the warriors. Now."

As Marcus hurried out, Sebastian turned back to Lillian, cupping her face in his hands. "Stay here. Lock the doors. Don’t let anyone in unless it’s me or Marcus."

She nodded, her heart hammering.

Sebastian pressed a fierce kiss to her forehead before striding out, leaving her standing in the middle of the study, the weight of his absence already pressing down on her.

Outside, the wind howled like a warning.

Donovan was coming.

And this time, he wasn’t leaving without a fight.

"Every single maid was thoroughly questioned, sir," one of my gammas reported, standing stiffly before my desk. "None of them had any knowledge about the incident. They were all shocked that she would do such a thing. But none are willing to defend her—they fear exile."

I gave a curt nod, drumming my fingers against the polished wood.

"And the maid responsible—she's gone?"

"Yes, Alpha. As per your orders. We escorted her off pack territory hours ago."

"Good," I said, reclining in my chair. "I've already sent word to the other Alphas, informing them of her crimes. She won’t find refuge in any pack."

"Understood, Alpha," the gamma replied. "Is there anything else you require?"

Before I could respond, the door swung open, and Marcus strode in. He halted mid-step when he noticed the gamma still present.

"That will be all," I dismissed the gamma with a wave. "You're free to go."

The gamma bowed slightly before exiting, casting a wary glance at Marcus as he passed. Marcus shut the door firmly behind him and turned to face me, his expression unreadable.

"Any updates?" he asked.

"Nothing useful," I muttered. "The maids know nothing. And the one who did this is long gone—banned from every pack."

"Perfect," Marcus said, a smirk curling his lips. "She’ll be lucky if she survives the night."

"If we’re fortunate," I agreed darkly. Then, shifting the subject, I asked, "Did you speak with Lillian?"

Marcus stiffened, his smirk vanishing. His gaze dropped to the floor, his fingers flexing at his sides. The unease radiating off him set my instincts on edge.

"Marcus," I said slowly, my voice low and deliberate. "Answer me. Did you speak to her or not?"

He finally lifted his eyes to meet mine, exhaling sharply before nodding.

"Yes. I spoke with her."

A breath I hadn’t realized I was holding escaped me. I leaned back, crossing my arms.

"And? Will she return to the villa? Will she continue tutoring Oliver?"

Marcus hesitated, his jaw tightening.

"I didn’t get the chance to ask. But from the way she sounded... no." His gaze flickered away again.

My blood ran cold before fury ignited in my veins.

"What the hell do you mean, no?" I demanded, my voice dangerously quiet. "Her name has been cleared. Why wouldn’t she come back?"

Marcus swallowed hard, bracing himself before meeting my glare.

"Because she doesn’t trust us anymore, Sebastian. And frankly, I don’t blame her."

Marcus sighed and moved closer to my desk, his expression unreadable.

"Look, she's hurt, and she has every reason to be," Marcus said, his voice low. "She wants you to apologize—face to face. I shouldn’t have been the one to go to her in the first place."

I slumped back in my chair, the weight of his words pressing down on me. He was right. I should never have sent him as my messenger. I was the one who had pushed Lillian out that night—made her feel like an intruder in what should have been her home. I’d invited her in, only to treat her like a threat. I’d ignored her calls, marked her texts as spam, and vanished for days. And then, like a coward, I’d sent Marcus to clean up my mess.

"You're right," I admitted, standing abruptly. "I'll go to her place now and fix this."

Marcus hesitated, his fingers tightening around his phone.

"What aren’t you telling me?" I demanded, irritation flaring.

"She’s not at her house anymore," he said, swiping through his screen before turning it toward me. "I looked into it on my way back. Her mother really did sell the house. It closed last week. They moved out days ago."

"What?!" My voice came out as a growl. So that phone call I’d overheard—it hadn’t been a misunderstanding. Lillian’s mother had actually sold their home, forcing her and her daughter out. Why? Were they in financial trouble? Was this because of me?

###Chapter 161

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood's penthouse suite. Lillian stretched lazily beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming from the intensity of last night. The scent of sandalwood and something distinctly Sebastian clung to her skin, making her heart flutter.

She turned her head, expecting to see him beside her, but the space was empty. Only the indentation on the pillow and the lingering warmth of his body remained.

A note rested on the nightstand.

"Emergency meeting. Don’t leave the suite."

Lillian huffed, tossing the note aside. Typical Sebastian. Always commanding, always in control. She swung her legs over the edge of the bed, her bare feet sinking into the plush carpet. The penthouse was eerily silent, save for the distant hum of the city below.

Her phone buzzed.

Beatrice: Girl, where are you? You missed combat class. Professor Montclair is pissed.

Lillian groaned. Right. She had completely forgotten about that.

Lillian: Got… distracted.

Beatrice: By a certain Lycan chairman? Spill.

Before she could reply, the suite’s door clicked open. Sebastian strode in, his tailored suit immaculate, his expression unreadable. His storm-gray eyes locked onto hers, and for a moment, the air between them crackled.

"You're awake," he said, his voice a low rumble.

Lillian arched a brow. "No thanks to you. You left without a word."

Sebastian’s lips twitched. "I left a note."

"A note isn’t the same as waking me up."

He stepped closer, his presence overwhelming. "You looked too peaceful to disturb."

She scoffed, but her pulse betrayed her, racing beneath her skin. "What was the emergency?"

His expression darkened. "Theodore Whitmore intercepted a message. Donovan is making moves."

Lillian stiffened. Donovan. Her ex-fated mate. The man who had betrayed her, humiliated her, and now seemed hell-bent on destroying whatever fragile happiness she had found.

"What kind of moves?" she asked, her voice steady despite the unease coiling in her stomach.

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "He’s been seen with Alpha Harrison. And Evelyn."

Lillian’s breath hitched. Evelyn—Donovan’s new mate. The woman who had taken her place.

Sebastian’s hand cupped her cheek, his thumb brushing over her skin. "I won’t let him touch you."

The promise in his voice sent a shiver down her spine. But beneath the reassurance, she sensed something else—something dangerous.

Sebastian wasn’t just protecting her.

He was preparing for war.

And Lillian?

She was done running.

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s estate. The sun had barely risen, casting a golden hue over the sprawling gardens below. She tightened the silk robe around her, the fabric whispering against her skin.

Last night’s events replayed in her mind—Donovan’s sudden reappearance, the venom in his words, the way his new mate, Evelyn, had clung to his arm with a smug smile. Lillian’s fingers curled into fists. She had thought she was over him, but the sting of betrayal still lingered like a phantom ache.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, turning to face the door.

The door creaked open, revealing Beatrice, her best friend, balancing a tray of steaming coffee and pastries. "Thought you might need this," Beatrice said with a knowing smile. "You barely touched dinner last night."

Lillian sighed, accepting the cup. The rich aroma of coffee filled her senses, grounding her. "Thanks. I just... didn’t expect to see him again."

Beatrice plopped onto the plush chaise lounge, her expression turning serious. "You know he’s only here to mess with your head, right? Especially now that Sebastian’s taken an interest in you."

Lillian’s cheeks warmed at the mention of Sebastian. The Lycan chairman was an enigma—powerful, commanding, yet surprisingly gentle with her. But Donovan’s presence complicated everything.

Before she could respond, her phone buzzed. A message from Oliver, Sebastian’s seven-year-old son, lit up the screen:

"Lillian, can we train today? Dad says I’m getting better!"

A small smile tugged at her lips. Oliver’s enthusiasm was infectious.

Beatrice peeked over her shoulder. "Aww, the little alpha-in-training misses you."

Lillian chuckled. "I should go. He’s been practicing his shifts."

As she turned to leave, Beatrice grabbed her wrist. "Hey, be careful. Donovan’s not the only one watching you."

Lillian frowned. "What do you mean?"

Beatrice hesitated, then lowered her voice. "Cassandra’s been asking around about you. And Professor Sinclair’s been acting weird since you aced his last exam."

Lillian’s stomach twisted. Cassandra had always been a thorn in her side, but Professor Sinclair? That was new.

"I’ll keep an eye out," she promised, though unease settled in her chest.

Stepping into the hallway, she nearly collided with a broad chest. Strong hands steadied her, and she looked up into Sebastian’s piercing gaze.

"Morning," he murmured, his voice rough with sleep.

Her breath hitched. Even in casual sweatpants and a loose t-shirt, he exuded power. "Morning," she managed.

His thumb brushed her wrist, sending a shiver down her spine. "You okay? You look tense."

She forced a smile. "Just thinking."

Sebastian studied her for a long moment, then nodded. "Oliver’s waiting for you in the courtyard. But after that, we need to talk."

Her pulse spiked. "About what?"

His expression darkened. "Donovan’s not here by coincidence. And I don’t like games."

Before she could ask more, he strode away, leaving her with a whirlwind of questions.

As she headed to the courtyard, Lillian couldn’t shake the feeling that something—or someone—was closing in on her. And this time, she might not be able to outrun it.

A tight knot twisted in my gut as I glared at my Beta. "Then where the hell is she?"

Marcus hesitated only a second before answering. "She's moved into the Winslow estate."

Rage ignited in my veins like wildfire. Over my dead body would I let Lillian stay under that roof—not after the way they'd treated her last time.

"Get Archibald Winslow on the line," I growled through clenched teeth. "I'm inviting myself to dinner."

Marcus smirked. "Yes, Alpha. Any particular reason you’d like me to give him?"

I shot him a sharp look. "I’m a Lycan Chairman. I don’t need a reason."

With a quick nod, he strode off to make the call. Within the hour, an email arrived—an invitation to dine with Archibald Winslow and his family.

As the car rolled up to the grand iron gates of the Winslow manor, Marcus cast me a sideways glance. "You sure you don’t want backup in there? If you lose your temper—"

"I can handle myself," I snapped, cutting him off. "But stay close. Just in case."

"Understood."

The butler swung the door open before I even reached the top step.

"Alpha Sebastian Blackwood," Archibald greeted with an overly bright smile, though his forehead gleamed with sweat. "What an honor to host you. Though I must admit, I’m... curious about the sudden invitation."

I matched his smile with a cold one of my own. "No reason. Just thought if my daughter’s marrying into your family, I should get to know you better. After all, we’re practically family now, aren’t we?"

His throat bobbed. "Of—of course. My apologies. We’re delighted to have you."

A sudden rustle of fabric drew my attention.

"Well, hello, Alpha," Arabella purred, descending the staircase in a gold dress that shimmered under the chandelier. "When I heard you were joining us, I simply had to dress for the occasion. Do you approve?"

I barely spared her a glance. "Hmm."

"Eleanor and Arabella will escort you to the dining hall," Archibald said quickly. "I have a brief matter to attend to, but I’ll join you shortly."

I followed the two women, my steps faltering the moment I spotted the lone figure seated at the table.

She wore a simple evening gown, her dark hair pinned back, revealing those warm, familiar eyes. A faint smile touched her lips as she looked up at me.

"Alpha Sebastian. What a pleasure to see you again," she greeted warmly.

"Madame Dumont," I replied, taking her delicate hand and pressing a chaste kiss to her knuckles. The older woman chuckled at the old-fashioned gesture, but when her gaze flickered to the icy glare Arabella was directing at her, Vivienne’s smile faltered. She withdrew her hand swiftly, as if burned.

"Vivienne, I wasn’t aware you’d be joining us tonight," Eleanor Winslow interjected, her saccharine smile not reaching her cold eyes. "We were expecting a rather special guest."

Vivienne’s cheeks flushed pink as she glanced down at her untouched place setting. The silverware gleamed under the chandelier’s glow, mocking her.

"My apologies," she murmured, fingers twisting the linen napkin in her lap. "No one informed me my presence was... unwelcome. I’ve dined with your family every evening this past week." Her voice was barely above a whisper. "I can leave—"

"You’ll stay." The command left no room for argument. My tone brooked no disobedience, and the table fell silent. Even Arabella’s incessant eyelash fluttering stilled.

Vivienne blinked, startled, as did the others. But no one dared contradict an Alpha’s direct order.

"Of course," she acquiesced, smoothing her skirt as she settled back into her seat.

Eleanor’s lips pursed, but she forced another brittle smile. "It’s no trouble at all," she simpered, gesturing to the empty chair beside Arabella. "Please, Alpha, do sit."

I suppressed a grimace as I took the designated seat—far too close to Arabella for comfort. Her cloying floral perfume made my stomach churn. But Vivienne’s unexpected appearance confirmed one thing: Lillian was here.

And it was only a matter of time before she joined us.

###Chapter 162

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting a golden glow over the room. Lillian stretched beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming with the lingering warmth of Sebastian’s embrace from the night before. She turned her head, expecting to find him beside her, but the space was empty, the sheets cool to the touch.

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, sitting up as the door creaked open.

Giselle, the head maid, stepped inside with a tray of breakfast—fluffy pancakes drizzled with syrup, fresh berries, and a steaming cup of coffee. "Good morning, Miss Lillian. Mr. Blackwood had to leave early for a meeting, but he asked me to ensure you were well taken care of."

Lillian smiled, though a flicker of disappointment tugged at her chest. "Thank you, Giselle."

The maid hesitated, then added, "He also mentioned that you might want to join him later at the packhouse. There’s… something he’d like to discuss with you."

Lillian’s pulse quickened. Discuss what?

Before she could ask, Giselle bowed slightly and excused herself, leaving Lillian alone with her thoughts. She picked at her breakfast, her appetite suddenly diminished.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Beatrice lit up the screen:

"Girl, you alive? You vanished after the party last night. Spill. Now."

Lillian chuckled, typing back. "Alive. Just… busy."

Beatrice’s reply was instant. "Busy with a certain Lycan chairman, I bet. Details. Or I’m showing up at your door."

Lillian rolled her eyes but couldn’t suppress the warmth spreading through her. She was about to reply when another message came through—this time from Donovan.

Her stomach twisted.

"We need to talk. It’s about Evelyn."

Lillian’s fingers froze over the screen. Evelyn—Donovan’s new mate. The one he’d chosen over her.

A sharp knock at the door startled her.

"Miss Lillian?" It was Lucien, the head chef, his voice laced with urgency. "Mr. Blackwood just called. He needs you at the packhouse immediately. There’s been… an incident."

Lillian’s heart dropped. "What kind of incident?"

Lucien’s expression darkened. "It’s about Miss Victoria."

Her blood ran cold.

Without another word, Lillian threw on her clothes and raced out the door. Whatever Sebastian wanted to discuss, it couldn’t be good.

And Donovan’s message?

That could only mean trouble.

Archibald entered the parlor moments later, murmuring something to one of the maids. She nodded briskly and motioned for two others to follow her toward the kitchens.

"My apologies for the wait. Dinner will be served shortly," Archibald announced as he settled into his seat at the head of the grand mahogany table.

I frowned, scanning the assembled guests.

"But not everyone has arrived yet," I pointed out, noting the conspicuous absence despite every chair being occupied.

Archibald's brows knitted together. "Were you expecting another guest, Alpha? My staff wasn't informed—your Beta never mentioned..."

My gaze flicked to Vivienne Dumont, who suddenly found her wineglass fascinating. The way her fingers tightened around the stem told me she knew exactly who I meant. She chewed her lower lip, refusing to meet my eyes.

"Apparently not," I muttered, filing away the mystery for later.

The staff returned in a flurry of movement, balancing silver platters of roasted venison and herb-crusted salmon. Crystal goblets were filled with rich red wine that glimmered like rubies in the candlelight.

"Father, the staff has been working tirelessly all evening," Arabella interjected between delicate bites of her steak. "Perhaps we should give them the rest of the night off?"

Archibald dabbed his mouth with a linen napkin. "And who, pray tell, will handle the cleanup?"

"I'll take care of it," she said with a careless shrug, though her eyes gleamed with calculation. "Consider it my contribution to the evening's festivities."

After a prolonged silence, Archibald gave a curt nod. "Very well. If you insist."

The conversation flowed as smoothly as the wine—talk of territory expansions and upcoming alliance ceremonies. Yet my mind kept drifting to Lillian's absence. Her scent clung to the air, teasingly close yet frustratingly out of reach. Vivienne remained a silent specter at the table, pushing food around her plate while Arabella's pointed toes kept finding their way to my calf beneath the table.

Archibald dominated the discussion, waxing poetic about his pack's prosperity and how destiny had chosen Donovan to lead. "No one deserves this honor more than my son," he declared, raising his glass toward Victoria, who preened under the praise. Eleanor seized the moment to gush about brunch invitations at the exclusive Silver Pines Country Club.

As dessert plates were cleared, Archibald rose with practiced grace.

"Shall we adjourn to the drawing room for port and cigars?"

The party migrated through arched doorways, leaving Arabella alone with the wreckage of our meal. In the opulent parlor, as servants poured steaming espresso and arranged petit fours on gilded trays, my gut twisted with unease. The grandfather clock's pendulum swung like a metronome counting down to some invisible catastrophe.

My wolf stirred restlessly within me, an uneasy energy coursing through my veins. His instincts were sharp, his focus singular—he wanted to return to the kitchen.

I glanced toward the dining hall entrance, my brows knitting together in concern.

"Is everything all right, Alpha?" Eleanor asked, her voice laced with polite curiosity as she took a delicate sip of her coffee.

"Arabella has been gone too long," I pointed out, my tone clipped.

Eleanor waved a dismissive hand. "Oh, I'm sure she's fine. The kitchen staff had quite the mess to clean up after dinner."

Still, unease prickled at the back of my neck. "I'm going to check on her," I declared, pushing back from the table.

Archibald chuckled, shaking his head. "Such a noble Lycan we have here," he teased, though his words carried an edge. Eleanor laughed along, but the sound was strained, forced.

Ignoring them both, I strode toward the dining hall. But just as I reached the door, I froze—Arabella's voice, sharp and venomous, cut through the air like a blade.

"You're nothing but a worthless mutt! Good for nothing except scrubbing floors and serving my family. How does it feel to be nothing?"

My blood ran cold.

###Chapter 163

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the campus quad. Her fingers tightened around the strap of her backpack, her mind still reeling from the confrontation with Donovan the night before. The memory of his cold dismissal burned like ice in her veins.

A familiar voice called out, pulling her from her thoughts. "Lillian! Over here!"

Beatrice waved from beneath the sprawling oak tree, her usual spot between classes. Lillian forced a smile and quickened her pace.

"You look like you haven't slept," Beatrice remarked, eyeing her friend's dark circles.

Lillian sighed, dropping onto the grass beside her. "Because I haven't."

Beatrice frowned. "Still thinking about Donovan?"

Lillian clenched her jaw. "He made his choice. Evelyn can have him."

But the words tasted bitter. No matter how much she tried to convince herself, the bond—once so strong—still ached like an open wound.

Beatrice nudged her shoulder. "Forget him. You deserve better."

Lillian exhaled sharply. "I know. It's just—"

A shadow fell over them.

Sebastian Blackwood stood there, his piercing gaze locked onto Lillian. The Lycan chairman’s presence alone commanded attention, and the students nearby instinctively quieted.

"Miss Whitaker," he said smoothly, "a word?"

Lillian's pulse spiked. What could he possibly want now?

Beatrice shot her a questioning look, but Lillian stood, brushing grass from her jeans. "I’ll catch up with you later."

Sebastian led her away from prying ears, stopping near the edge of the quad. His expression was unreadable.

"I heard about last night," he said finally.

Lillian stiffened. "And?"

His lips curved slightly. "You handled yourself well."

She blinked. That wasn’t what she expected.

Sebastian’s gaze darkened. "But Donovan won’t let this go. He’s already making moves."

A chill ran down her spine. "What do you mean?"

Before he could answer, his phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, his jaw tightening.

"Trouble?" she ventured.

His eyes flicked back to hers. "Pack business. But this conversation isn’t over."

With that, he turned and strode away, leaving Lillian staring after him, her mind racing.

What was Donovan planning?

And why did Sebastian seem so invested in warning her?

The wind picked up, rustling the leaves around her.

Something was coming.

And she wasn’t sure she was ready.

My stomach growled violently, a relentless reminder of my hunger. For days, I had survived on nothing but scraps, my body weakening with each passing hour. When Arabella summoned me to the dining hall, hope flickered in my chest—perhaps tonight, I would finally get a decent meal.

But the sight that greeted me shattered that fragile hope.

The long mahogany table was littered with dirty plates and empty wine glasses, not a single crumb left behind. The rich aroma of roasted meat and herbs still lingered in the air, mocking me.

Arabella smirked, her cold eyes gleaming with satisfaction. "The maids have the night off. Clean this up—alone."

She lounged in a chair, watching like a predator toying with its prey.

Gritting my teeth, I grabbed a silver tray and began stacking the dishes, my hands trembling from exhaustion. Just as I passed her, she stuck out her foot.

I crashed to the floor, the tray slipping from my grasp. Glass shattered, porcelain splintered, and a sharp pain shot through my finger as a shard sliced deep. Blood welled in my palm, crimson against my pale skin.

"Pathetic," Arabella sneered, her voice dripping with venom. "Look at this mess!"

"You tripped me," I whispered, cradling my injured hand.

Her palm struck before I could react. The slap snapped my head to the side, my lip splitting against my teeth. The metallic tang of blood filled my mouth.

Tears burned my eyes, but I refused to let them fall.

"Aww, going to cry now?" Arabella taunted, crossing her arms. "No one’s coming to save you. Not even that worthless mother of yours."

At the mention of my mother, something inside me snapped.

"Don’t you dare speak about her," I hissed, my voice shaking with suppressed rage.

I could break her. Right here, right now. My fingers twitched with the urge to strike back—but I couldn’t. Not without consequences.

Helplessness coiled around me like chains.

Arabella laughed, the sound sharp and cruel. "You’re nothing but a worthless slave. How does it feel to be beneath us?"

Then—

The doors burst open with a deafening crash.

Arabella stumbled back, her smirk vanishing as a towering figure filled the doorway.

"What the hell is going on here?"

Sebastian’s voice was a thunderous growl, vibrating through the room. My breath caught as his golden eyes locked onto me, then flicked to Arabella.

His Lycan aura flared, overpowering even his Alpha presence. The air thickened with his fury.

"A-Alpha!" Arabella stammered, her bravado crumbling. "I was just—"

"She’s bleeding," Sebastian snarled, cutting her off. His gaze dropped to my hand, then back to her. "And you’re mocking her?"

The question wasn’t a question.

It was a promise.

And Arabella knew it.

The shattered glass surrounded Lillian like a cruel halo as she lay on the cold marble floor. Her dress was damp from spilled wine, her hands trembling where they pressed against the shards.

"I... uh..." Arabella stammered, her cheeks flushing crimson. "She tripped! I was just about to help her up!" She reached for Lillian’s arm, but Sebastian’s roar shook the entire manor, the force of it nearly knocking Arabella backward.

"Don’t you dare touch her!"

Even I flinched at the fury in his voice. When Sebastian Blackwood was angry, the air itself seemed to tremble.

Archibald burst into the room, his expression darkening the moment he saw Lillian on the floor. His lips curled, no doubt ready to spit some venomous remark—but Sebastian cut him off.

"Is this how you raise your daughter? To humiliate guests in your own home?"

Archibald paled. "What? No, of course not—"

"Then explain why she thinks this behavior is acceptable!" Sebastian snarled, gesturing to Lillian.

Archibald’s gaze flickered between Lillian and Arabella, who was now cowering in the corner. I wished the floor would swallow me whole.

Then the door swung open again.

Sebastian’s POV

"Arabella?" Eleanor’s voice rang out as she stepped inside.

"Mother!" Arabella wailed, throwing herself into Eleanor’s arms. "Lillian pushed me first! I was only trying to clear the dishes, and she snatched the tray from my hands! She fell—I never meant for her to get hurt!"

Eleanor stroked her daughter’s hair. "Of course you didn’t, darling. Your father will handle this." She turned to Sebastian with a placating smile. "Alpha, surely this is just a misunderstanding."

I looked down at Lillian. Tears shimmered in her eyes, but she refused to meet my gaze. My chest tightened.

She’s lying.

Arabella had them all fooled—but not me.

Through the mindlink, I summoned Marcus. "Get me the security footage. Now."

Then I pushed past the crowd, stopping only when I reached Lillian.

###Chapter 164

Lillian trembled, her gaze fixed on the deep gash across her palm. Without hesitation, I pulled her against me, hating how rigid she became at my touch. Scooping her into my arms, I ignored her sharp inhale as she clutched my shoulder with her uninjured hand, carefully keeping her bleeding one away to avoid staining my clothes.

"Take us to your bathroom," I commanded Archibald.

"Right away, Alpha," he stammered, rushing ahead. I followed without sparing another glance at Vivienne and Arabella. As we moved down the hall, a horrified gasp cut through the air.

"Lillian?!" Vivienne cried. "What happened? Are you hurt?"

"I'm fine, Mom," Lillian murmured weakly. "Just a scratch."

"She’s losing blood," I snapped, not slowing my pace. "I need to stop it before it gets worse."

Archibald led us to a lavish bathroom, but before he could speak, I shut the door in his face.

A heavy silence settled between us. Lillian remained tense, her eyes locked on her wound as I set her on the marble counter. I rummaged beneath the sink and retrieved the first aid kit.

"You don’t have to do this," she whispered.

I glanced up briefly before pulling out antiseptic and bandages. "Would you rather bleed out?"

She shrugged but stayed silent. Taking her hand, I turned on the faucet. The moment my fingers circled her wrist, she stiffened, resisting. My frown deepened.

"Let me help you," I murmured, my skin burning where we touched.

For a heartbeat, she searched my eyes—then exhaled, yielding. I guided her hand under the warm stream, rinsing the wound. She hissed at the sting, muscles locking briefly before relaxing again. My thumb traced slow circles over her pulse, soothing her as I worked.

With each stroke, her breathing steadied, and soon, her gaze kept flickering to me. I pretended not to notice, though the heat of her stare seared my cheek. The corner of my mouth threatened to lift.

"Why are you here?" she finally asked, slicing through the quiet.

I dabbed ointment on her cut, and she winced. "I came for you."

Her breath hitched. "What?"

Pausing, I met her eyes. "I was wrong. About everything. I never should’ve accused you of hurting Oliver. I know you’d never harm him. I should’ve listened instead of throwing you out." My voice roughened. "I’m here to make it right."

She studied me, silent.

Focusing back on her hand, I bandaged it carefully, then linked Marcus to have Elizabeth check it tomorrow. Reluctantly, I let her go.

"Thank you," she said softly. "For this. And for apologizing."

"I should’ve done both sooner," I admitted. "Sending Marcus was cowardly."

A faint smile tugged at her lips, cheeks pinkening. "It was. But you’re here now." Her expression sobered. "Good thing, too. Arabella’s unhinged. Who knows what she’d have done if you hadn’t stepped in."

My jaw clenched at the thought. "She’ll never touch you again."

Lillian frowned. "What do you mean? She lives here. So do I."

Leaning in, I caged her against the counter, our mouths inches apart. Her breath warmed my lips. "Not anymore," I murmured, brushing a featherlight kiss over hers. She sighed, blushing deeper. "From now on, you’re staying with me."


###Chapter 165

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the lavish bedroom, rousing Lillian from her restless sleep. She blinked against the light, her body still aching from the previous night’s confrontation with Donovan. The memory of his betrayal twisted like a knife in her gut, but she refused to let it consume her.

Rolling out of bed, she padded to the window, taking in the sprawling estate below. The Blackwood pack lands were vast, a testament to Sebastian’s power and influence. Yet, despite the luxury surrounding her, Lillian couldn’t shake the unease that clung to her like a second skin.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, turning as the door creaked open.

Beatrice stepped inside, her usual bright smile dimmed by concern. "You look like you barely slept," she observed, crossing the room to squeeze Lillian’s shoulder.

Lillian sighed, rubbing her temples. "Too much on my mind."

"I get it," Beatrice murmured. "But you can’t let Donovan get to you. He’s not worth it."

Lillian nodded, though the words did little to ease the sting. "I know. But seeing him with Evelyn last night—" She cut herself off, shaking her head. "It shouldn’t hurt this much."

Beatrice’s expression softened. "Because you still care. And that’s okay. But don’t forget—you have someone who actually deserves you now."

Lillian’s lips twitched at the mention of Sebastian. The Lycan chairman had been her unexpected rock, his quiet strength a balm to her fractured heart.

"Speaking of," Beatrice continued, mischief lighting her eyes, "Sebastian asked me to tell you he’s waiting downstairs. Something about a surprise."

Lillian arched a brow. "A surprise?"

Beatrice grinned. "You’ll see."

Curiosity piqued, Lillian quickly dressed in a simple yet elegant sundress before heading downstairs. The grand foyer was empty, save for Theodore, who offered her a knowing smile before gesturing toward the gardens.

Stepping outside, Lillian’s breath caught.

The garden had been transformed. Strings of delicate fairy lights crisscrossed overhead, casting a soft glow over the lush greenery. At the center stood Sebastian, his broad frame silhouetted against the morning light.

He turned as she approached, his dark eyes warm. "You’re awake."

Lillian smiled despite herself. "You didn’t have to do all this."

Sebastian closed the distance between them, his fingers brushing hers. "I wanted to." His voice was low, intimate. "After last night, I thought you could use something good."

Her chest tightened. He always knew exactly what she needed.

Before she could respond, Oliver came bounding into the garden, his small face alight with excitement. "Lillian! Dad’s taking us on a trip!"

Lillian blinked, glancing at Sebastian. "A trip?"

Sebastian’s lips curved. "A getaway. Just the three of us. Somewhere quiet, where you can relax."

The offer was unexpected, but the warmth in his gaze made her heart flutter. Maybe this was exactly what she needed—time away from the pack politics, the painful reminders of Donovan.

She squeezed Oliver’s hand, then met Sebastian’s eyes. "I’d love that."

His smile deepened, and for the first time in days, Lillian felt a flicker of hope.

But as they made plans, a shadow moved at the edge of the garden. Evelyn stood there, her expression unreadable before she turned and disappeared into the manor.

Lillian’s stomach knotted.

The past wasn’t done with her yet.

My lips parted to protest—I couldn’t just disappear with him without raising suspicions. But before a single word could escape, a sharp knock echoed against the door. My entire body stiffened, heat flooding my cheeks. Sebastian, however, remained infuriatingly calm. He stepped back, the ghost of a smirk playing on his lips before he winked. The gesture only made my face burn hotter. I wanted to lunge forward, to stop him from opening that door, but it was too late.

With one smooth motion, he pulled it open.

My mother stood frozen on the threshold, her eyes wide as saucers. She stared up at Sebastian, her frame trembling slightly before her gaze darted to me.

"Lillian, sweetheart," she breathed, brushing past him to enter the bathroom. Her hands fluttered over me like nervous birds. "Are you alright? What happened?"

"I'm fine," I rushed out, forcing a smile. "Really. Sebastian took care of it. Good as new." I lifted my hand, and she cradled it gently, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears.

I knew she was aware—of everything. The whispers, the rumors, the danger. But she played her part perfectly, pretending ignorance for my father’s sake. She wanted him free, and she’d endure any lie, any pretense, to make that happen.

Once, I would’ve done the same for Donovan.

"I’m so sorry," she whispered, her voice breaking.

"Mom, it’s nothing," I lied smoothly, squeezing her fingers. "Just an accident."

Sebastian’s expression darkened. He knew the truth—had seen the violence firsthand—and the fury rolling off him was palpable. I gave him the slightest shake of my head as my mother pulled me into a crushing hug. Don’t.

He exhaled sharply, arms folding across his broad chest.

"I have an estate in my territory," Sebastian said abruptly as my mother released me. "Fully staffed. I’m rarely there—only when business calls me to the Northern Border. I want you both to stay there. No conditions."

My breath caught. He wasn’t just offering me an escape—he was offering her one too. My heart swelled, tears pricking at my lashes.

I expected her to leap at the chance. But when silence stretched between us, my stomach twisted. Her face was unreadable, her fingers knotting in the fabric of her skirt.

"Alpha," she said finally, voice steady. "Might I speak with my daughter alone?"

Sebastian’s brows lifted slightly. He met my gaze, a silent question in his eyes, but I was just as lost. After a beat, he nodded.

"Of course," he murmured. "Take your time."

One last lingering look, and then he was gone, the door clicking shut behind him.

I turned to my mother—only to find her staring at me with a sad, knowing smile.

"Mom, what's going on?" I asked, my voice trembling slightly as I searched her face for answers.



"First, I need to ask you something," she began, arching a delicate brow. "Is there something between you and Sebastian Blackwood?"

Heat rushed to my cheeks, and my breath hitched. The question caught me completely off guard.

"No, of course not," I lied, my fingers twisting nervously in my lap. "Why would you think that?"

She shrugged, though her gaze remained sharp. "He seems... unusually attentive toward you. I know you tutor his son, but the way he looks at you—it's more than just professional concern."

"Nothing is happening," I insisted, staring down at my hands to avoid her piercing eyes. "Is that really why you wanted to talk to me?"

"No," she murmured, stepping closer and taking my hands in hers. Her grip was warm but firm. "Lillian... I can't leave here."

My chest tightened. "What? Why not?"

She sighed, her expression heavy with resignation. "Because without the Winslows, we have no one to help us."

My stomach twisted. "What do you mean?"

"They've offered me a position," she explained softly. "I’ll stay in one of their guest rooms, eat with the family, and handle basic household tasks. In return, they’ll give me enough money to pay off your father’s debts."

My lips pressed into a thin line. "They want you to be their maid?"

I had seen how the Winslows treated their staff—cold, dismissive, as if they were invisible. The thought of my mother subjected to that made bile rise in my throat.

"It’s not like that," she said quickly. "They still treat me like an old friend. Like family."

Tears pricked at my eyes. "Mom, please. Sebastian is offering us a way out—"

"Is he?" she interrupted, her voice sharp. "Has he actually offered to pay your father’s debts? Have you even asked him?"

I swallowed hard.

The truth was, I hadn’t.

Sebastian knew I needed money—from all those desperate, foolish attempts to seduce him before I truly knew him—but I had never told him the full extent of my family’s struggles.

And now, faced with my mother’s question, shame burned through me.

Because I didn’t want him to know.

I didn’t want him to see just how broken we really were.

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood's penthouse suite. Below her, the city lights twinkled like scattered diamonds against the velvet night. She tightened the silk robe around her shoulders, the luxurious fabric whispering against her skin.

Inside, Donovan's voice rose in anger. "You can't keep her locked away forever, Blackwood!"

Lillian's fingers curled around the railing. Even after all these months, hearing Donovan's voice sent an involuntary shiver down her spine. The mate bond might have been broken, but some wounds never fully healed.

The sliding glass door opened behind her. "You should come inside," Sebastian murmured, his deep voice laced with concern. "It's getting cold."

She turned to find him silhouetted against the golden light spilling from the suite. Even in casual attire - dark slacks and an untucked white shirt - the Lycan chairman exuded power. His silver eyes glowed faintly in the dim light, a reminder of the predator beneath the polished exterior.

"Are they still arguing?" Lillian asked, nodding toward the living area.

Sebastian's jaw tightened. "Evelyn is demanding we return you to campus immediately."

A bitter laugh escaped Lillian's lips. "Of course she is." Evelyn had been Donovan's new mate for barely three months, yet she acted like she owned him - and by extension, Lillian.

Sebastian stepped closer, his warmth radiating through the chilly night air. "I told them you're staying here until we resolve this situation with Alpha Harrison."

Lillian's pulse quickened at the memory of that awful night at the frat party. Alpha Harrison's leering face, the way his hands had groped at her dress before Sebastian's enforcers intervened...

"Thank you," she whispered. "For everything."

Inside, the argument reached new heights. "This is kidnapping!" Evelyn shrieked.

Lillian squared her shoulders and marched back into the suite. "I'm here of my own free will," she announced, cutting through the tension like a knife.

Donovan's head snapped up. His hazel eyes widened at the sight of her in Sebastian's robe, his nostrils flaring at the mingled scents. A muscle ticked in his jaw. "Lillian..."

"Don't," she warned, holding up a hand. "You lost any right to question my choices when you rejected our bond."

Evelyn sneered. "You're just a pathetic little girl playing house with a Lycan chairman. Do you really think someone like Sebastian Blackwood would settle for a college student?"

Before Lillian could respond, Sebastian was at her side, his arm sliding possessively around her waist. "Careful, Evelyn," he purred, his voice deceptively soft. "You're speaking about my future Luna."

The room went deathly silent. Even Beatrice, who'd been quietly observing from the sofa, dropped her phone with a clatter.

Donovan's face turned ashen. "You're claiming her?"

Sebastian's fingers tightened on Lillian's hip. "I already have."

Lillian's breath caught in her throat. This wasn't part of their arrangement. Sebastian had offered her protection, not... this.

Evelyn let out a shrill laugh. "This is ridiculous! She's not even of age to be a Luna!"

"Enough!" Sebastian's command shook the walls, his alpha power rolling through the room like thunder. "Marcus, escort our guests out."

As Marcus Grayson ushered the sputtering couple toward the elevator, Beatrice rushed to Lillian's side. "Did you know about this?" she hissed.

Lillian could only shake her head, her mind reeling. When the elevator doors closed, Sebastian turned to her, his expression unreadable.

"We need to talk," he said quietly.

Beatrice squeezed Lillian's hand. "I'll be in the guest room if you need me."

As her best friend retreated, Lillian faced Sebastian. "What was that about?"

His silver eyes burned with intensity. "I meant every word, Lillian. I want you as my Luna."

Her heart stuttered. "But... why?"

A slow, predatory smile curved his lips. "Because from the moment I first scented you, I knew you were mine. The only reason I waited this long was to give you time to heal from Donovan's rejection."

Lillian's knees weakened. This couldn't be happening. Not with Sebastian Blackwood, of all people. The most powerful Lycan in the country. A man with a past darker than midnight.

And yet... when he looked at her like that, she could almost believe it was possible.

Almost.

The elevator dinged, interrupting the charged moment. Marcus's voice crackled through the intercom. "Sir, we have a situation. Alpha Harrison is downstairs with his entire pack."

Sebastian's expression hardened. "Lock down the building. No one gets past security."

As he strode toward the door, Lillian caught his arm. "Wait! This is my fight too."

He turned, cupping her face with surprising gentleness. "No, little wolf. This is exactly why I claimed you tonight. So the entire world would know - touch what's mine, and you answer to me."

Before she could respond, he kissed her forehead and was gone, leaving Lillian standing in the middle of the luxurious suite, her entire world turned upside down.

Outside, the distant sound of howls split the night air. The battle for her future had begun.
###Chapter 166 

My mother could read my expression like an open book, and her gaze softened with understanding.

"It wasn't fair of me to ask you to seek Donovan's help, and it wouldn't be fair to ask you to rely on Sebastian's either," she admitted, her voice steady but laced with quiet resolve. "So, I'm doing what I can—trying to fix this without making our family look weak." She exhaled, her fingers tightening around mine. "This is something I have to do. If everything goes according to plan, I should be able to get your father out of prison in a few months, and then... we can finally be a family again."

Tears spilled down my cheeks before I could stop them. I nodded, my throat too tight to speak.

She cupped my face in her warm hands, tilting my chin up until our eyes met.

"But I think you should go to that mansion," she continued, her voice firm despite the tenderness in her touch. "Take Sebastian up on his offer."

I stiffened, my pulse spiking. "What?" I choked out. "I can’t just leave you here alone—"

"I'll be fine, sweetheart," she assured me, brushing a tear from my cheek. "But I know things aren’t safe for you here. That injury of yours wasn’t an accident, and I refuse to let you stay in danger any longer."

I shook my head, my stomach twisting. "No, Mom, it was an accident—"

"You can't lie to me, Lillian," she said gently but firmly, releasing my face. "I want what’s best for my family, and right now, that means you living under the Blackwood pack’s protection. Once your father is free, we’ll rebuild. We’ll start over. But until then..." She swallowed hard. "This is the safest place for you."

I bit my lip, fresh tears blurring my vision.

"I love you," I whispered, my voice raw.

She pulled me into her arms, holding me tight. "I love you so much," she murmured against my hair. "You were the greatest blessing we ever received. I don’t regret adopting you for a single second, and I’m so sorry you’re caught in this mess."

I sniffled, wiping my damp cheeks. "It’s not your fault," I said, because it wasn’t.

It was Donovan’s fault. His and his wretched family’s. And now my mother was paying the price for their cruelty. The worst part? There was nothing I could do to stop it.

After a long moment, my mother opened the bathroom door and stepped into the hallway.

Sebastian was nowhere in sight—thank the Moon Goddess—which meant he hadn’t overheard our conversation. I followed her out, my steps heavy as we made our way toward the parlor. The voices of the Winslow family drifted toward us, each one spinning excuses like a spider weaving its web.

And I? I was just another fly caught in their trap.

I couldn't suppress an exasperated eye roll.

The moment we stepped inside, the lively chatter died down as all eyes locked onto me.

"Oh, Lillian, you're back!" Eleanor rushed toward me, her voice dripping with false concern. "How are you feeling? Your hand—I'm so sorry about what happened."

"It's fine," I muttered, my gaze flickering to Sebastian, whose expression was stormy. At least he saw through her act too. That was a small comfort.

"Why don't you go rest in your room for the evening?" she suggested sweetly.

I glanced at my mother, who gave me a faint, reassuring smile.

Nodding, I murmured, "Okay. Goodnight."

I turned and left the parlor, but the second the door clicked shut behind me, it reopened and closed again. Spinning around, I found Sebastian stalking after me, his dark eyes burning with barely contained fury.

"You're leaving—whether you like it or not. I won't have you staying here another night," he declared, clearly expecting resistance.

But I was done fighting.

"Okay," I said quietly, my voice hollow.

His brows lifted slightly, surprise flickering across his face before his expression softened.

"Alright, then," he murmured. Then, hesitating, he added, "And your mother—"

"She stays." I cut him off. "It's her choice. She doesn’t want to come with me."

His lips pressed into a thin line. "Are you sure?"

"She’s made her decision, Sebastian." My fingers curled slightly around my injured hand. "But promise me one thing—make sure they treat her with respect. Don’t let her end up like this."

A shadow passed over his face. Without hesitation, he nodded. "I’ll make sure of it. No one will touch her."

Relief washed over me. I turned to head toward the servants' quarters, but his hand shot out, gripping my wrist.

"Pack your things. Marcus will come for you tonight. Tell them you're staying with a friend from now on."

His voice was firm, leaving no room for argument.

I swallowed hard and nodded.

This was it—the end of one life, the beginning of another.
###Chapter 167

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, painting the marble floors in warm hues. Lillian stretched lazily in the king-sized bed, her fingers brushing against the cool silk sheets. The scent of sandalwood and bergamot—unmistakably Sebastian’s—lingered in the air, wrapping around her like an invisible embrace.

She sat up, rubbing the sleep from her eyes, when the bedroom door creaked open. Oliver, Sebastian’s seven-year-old son, peeked in with a mischievous grin. "Morning, Lillian! Dad said you’d sleep forever if I didn’t wake you."

Lillian chuckled, ruffling his messy curls. "Did he now? Well, I guess I should thank you for the rescue."

Oliver bounced onto the bed, his tiny frame barely making a dent in the plush mattress. "Are we still going to the amusement park today? You promised!"

Before she could answer, Sebastian appeared in the doorway, leaning against the frame with that infuriatingly perfect smirk of his. His dark hair was slightly tousled, as if he’d just run his fingers through it, and his tailored shirt clung to his broad shoulders. "Only if you eat breakfast first," he said, his deep voice laced with amusement.

Oliver groaned dramatically but scrambled off the bed, darting toward the kitchen.

Sebastian’s gaze lingered on Lillian, the intensity in his golden eyes making her pulse quicken. "Sleep well?"

She arched a brow. "Like a log. Your bed is ridiculously comfortable."

A slow, knowing smile curved his lips. "Good. Because you’ll be spending a lot more time in it."

Heat rushed to her cheeks, but before she could retort, her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Beatrice lit up the screen:

"Emergency brunch. Now. I have gossip you won’t believe."

Lillian sighed. Beatrice’s "emergencies" usually involved scandalous rumors or questionable fashion choices. Still, she couldn’t ignore her best friend.

Sebastian, ever perceptive, tilted his head. "Trouble?"

"Just Beatrice being Beatrice." She swung her legs off the bed, reaching for her robe. "I’ll meet you and Oliver at the amusement park later."

He stepped closer, his fingers brushing her wrist. "Don’t keep us waiting too long."

The contact sent a jolt of electricity through her, and she had to remind herself to breathe. "Wouldn’t dream of it."

As she hurried to get ready, Lillian couldn’t shake the feeling that today was going to be anything but ordinary.

Little did she know, Beatrice’s "gossip" would unravel a secret that threatened to tear her and Sebastian apart.

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood's mountain retreat. Below her, the resort bustled with activity as competitors from various packs prepared for today's challenges. She tightened the belt of her silk robe, watching her breath form little clouds in the cold air.

"Still brooding over yesterday's results?" Beatrice's voice came from behind her, accompanied by the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee.

Lillian accepted the steaming mug with a grateful smile. "Not brooding. Just... reassessing."

Beatrice leaned against the railing, her dark curls bouncing. "You placed third in the obstacle course. That's nothing to scoff at, especially against trained warriors."

Lillian's fingers tightened around the warm ceramic. "I should have done better. Sebastian expects—"

"Sebastian expects you to be human," Beatrice interrupted. "Literally. You're the only non-Lycan competitor here, Lil. Cut yourself some slack."

The sound of approaching footsteps made them both turn. Oliver bounded onto the balcony, his cheeks flushed with excitement. "Lillian! Dad says we're doing the archery competition today! You're gonna shoot arrows!"

Lillian set down her coffee to ruffle the boy's hair. "Am I now? And what makes you so sure?"

"Because I told Dad you're the best!" Oliver declared with childish certainty. "Even better than Uncle Marcus!"

Beatrice snorted. "High praise indeed."

Before Lillian could respond, the balcony doors slid open again, revealing Sebastian in his customary impeccable suit. The morning sunlight caught the silver streaks in his dark hair as he surveyed their little gathering.

"Oliver, stop bothering Lillian. She needs to prepare." His deep voice carried its usual authority, but Lillian had learned to hear the warmth beneath.

Oliver pouted but obeyed, scampering back inside. Beatrice took the hint, winking at Lillian before following the boy.

Sebastian stepped closer, his cologne mingling with the mountain air. "You're nervous."

It wasn't a question. Lillian sighed. "Is it that obvious?"

"Only to me." He reached out, tucking a stray lock of hair behind her ear. "You don't have to compete today if you don't want to."

Lillian shook her head. "I do. I just..." She hesitated, then met his gaze. "What if I embarrass you?"

Sebastian's expression softened in a way few ever witnessed. "Impossible. Your presence here alone has already silenced half the council members who claimed humans couldn't handle our world."

The distant sound of a horn signaled the start of morning preparations. Sebastian checked his watch. "I have to meet with Alpha Voss. But remember—" He caught her hand, pressing a kiss to her knuckles. "Win or lose, you've already proven everything that matters."

As he walked away, Lillian felt the weight on her shoulders lighten. She took a deep breath, squared her shoulders, and headed inside to change. Today wasn't about proving herself to the Lycan world—it was about proving to herself just how far she'd come.

The real competition, she realized as she braided her hair, wasn't against the other warriors. It was against the doubts that still whispered in the back of her mind. And that was one battle she intended to win.

After Lillian retreated to her room, I returned to the parlor where Reginald was deep in conversation with his wife. Their hushed tones and furtive glances betrayed their anxiety—without my financial backing, they would face ruin. The empire they'd built would crumble, forcing them to drain their business profits just to repay my investments.

My gaze flickered to Vivienne, who stood stiffly by the fireplace. The worry in her eyes was unmistakable—she feared for her daughter.

"You should rest," I murmured, offering her a small, reassuring smile. "I need to speak with the Winslows alone."

She hesitated but finally nodded, slipping out of the room with one last uneasy glance at the couple.

The moment the door clicked shut, I turned my full attention to Reginald and Eleanor. My expression darkened.

"Leave us," Reginald ordered his daughter sharply.

Arabella's lips thinned in displeasure. "Can't I stay?" she whined, batting her lashes at me.

"No," he snapped. "This is between us and Alpha Blackwood."

With an exaggerated sigh, she flounced out—but not before throwing me a suggestive wink. I suppressed a shudder, waiting until her footsteps faded before addressing the trembling pair before me.

"What I witnessed tonight was unacceptable," I said coldly, my voice laced with quiet fury. "How can I trust my daughter to marry into a family that treats guests with such disrespect?"

Reginald swallowed hard. "Alpha, I assure you, this was merely a misunderstanding. It won't happen again."

"Are you forgetting," I mused, stepping closer, "that I own the majority stake in your enterprises? One word from me, and you'll be drowning in debt."

I had invested heavily across the Werewolf Kingdom, but only in ventures with promise. The Winslows had been one such investment—until tonight.

Eleanor's hands trembled as she clutched her husband's arm. "We understand, Alpha."

"Good." My voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "If Lillian or Vivienne suffer so much as a scratch under your roof, the consequences will be severe. Am I clear?"

They both bowed their heads, their voices trembling in unison.

"Yes, Alpha Blackwood."

Reginald nudged Eleanor, and she hastily echoed, "Of course, Alpha."

I held their gaze a moment longer, ensuring the warning sank in, before turning on my heel and striding out. The game had changed—and they would learn just how ruthless a Lycan chairman could be.

No harm will come to either of them. You have our word.

Lillian's POV

I spent an hour packing my clothes and personal belongings. Most of my things were still in storage, so I didn’t have much here. But every few minutes, I had to pause, my hands trembling as reality crashed over me.

I couldn’t believe I was about to move into Sebastian Blackwood’s mansion—without my mother.

Leaving her behind felt like tearing my heart in two. The mere thought twisted my stomach into knots.

Sitting on the narrow cot that had been my bed this past week, I inhaled deeply. I wouldn’t miss this place—that much was certain. The maids here had treated me like an outsider, whispering behind my back, their disdain barely concealed.

But none of them had been as cruel as Arabella.

If I fought back, it would only make things worse for my mother. So I bit my tongue, swallowed my pride, and endured.

I resumed packing, ensuring nothing was left behind.

Then—without warning—the door flew open.

Privacy didn’t exist here. Arabella never knocked.

She stormed in, her scowl sharp enough to cut glass. "What the hell do you think you’re doing?" she snapped, her gaze zeroing in on the bag on my bed.

"I’m leaving," I said flatly, refusing to meet her eyes.

"Like hell you are!" She lunged forward, ripping the bag from my hands. I barely had time to react before she hurled it across the room. It slammed against the wall with a heavy thud, spilling my belongings onto the floor.

"You’re not going anywhere," she sneered. "You’re nothing. A worthless orphan. You’ll rot here until you die, you pathetic little bitch."

My temper flared, white-hot.

"I’m staying with a friend," I ground out through clenched teeth. "My mother already gave her blessing."

Arabella’s lips curled into a vicious smirk. "Oh, really? And who would ever want you?"

I refused to let her see how much that stung.

Sebastian’s words echoed in my mind—No harm will come to either of them.

But right now, the only harm I feared was the damage Arabella could do before I walked out that door.
###Chapter 168

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s sprawling estate. The sun had barely risen, casting golden streaks across the sky, but her mind was already racing. Last night’s confrontation with Donovan still burned in her memory—his cold dismissal, Evelyn’s smug smirk, and the way they had flaunted their bond in front of her.

She clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms. How could he?

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. “Lillian?” Beatrice’s voice was gentle but laced with concern. “You’ve been out here for hours. You should eat something.”

Lillian exhaled sharply, forcing her shoulders to relax. “I’m not hungry.”

Beatrice stepped beside her, leaning against the railing. “You can’t let him get to you like this. He’s not worth it.”

“It’s not just him,” Lillian admitted, her voice barely above a whisper. “It’s everything. The way everyone looks at me now—like I’m some pathetic, discarded mate.”

Beatrice frowned. “That’s not true. You’re stronger than this. And you have people who care about you.”

Lillian glanced at her best friend, gratitude flickering in her chest. Beatrice had always been her rock, even when the world seemed determined to break her.

Before she could respond, the sound of footsteps echoed from inside. Sebastian appeared in the doorway, his piercing gaze locking onto Lillian. “We need to talk.”

Her pulse quickened. There was something in his tone—something urgent.

Beatrice squeezed her hand. “I’ll give you two some space.”

Once they were alone, Sebastian crossed his arms. “I just received word from Marcus. Donovan’s pack is making moves against us.”

Lillian’s breath hitched. “What kind of moves?”

“Sabotage. They’ve been targeting our supply routes.” His jaw tightened. “And they’re not being subtle about it.”

A cold realization settled over her. This is because of me.

Sebastian seemed to read her thoughts. “Don’t blame yourself. This was bound to happen sooner or later.”

She shook her head. “No. If I hadn’t—”

“Lillian.” His voice was firm, cutting her off. “We deal with threats head-on. That’s what packs do.”

She swallowed hard, meeting his gaze. “What do we do now?”

A slow, dangerous smile curved his lips. “We fight back.”

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s estate. The sun had barely risen, casting golden streaks across the sprawling gardens below. She tightened the silk robe around her, the fabric whispering against her skin.

Last night had been... unexpected.

Her fingers traced the faint mark on her neck—Sebastian’s claim. The memory of his lips against her skin sent a shiver down her spine. She had fought it, resisted the pull of the mate bond, but in the end, the chemistry between them had been undeniable.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, turning to face the door.

The door creaked open, revealing Beatrice, her best friend, balancing a tray of steaming coffee and pastries. "You look like you didn’t sleep at all," Beatrice teased, setting the tray on the small table by the window.

Lillian scoffed, pouring herself a cup. "That obvious?"

Beatrice smirked, plopping onto the plush chair. "Oh, please. The whole pack heard the commotion last night. Sebastian isn’t exactly subtle."

Heat flooded Lillian’s cheeks. She took a long sip of coffee, avoiding Beatrice’s knowing gaze. "It wasn’t like that."

"Sure, it wasn’t." Beatrice wiggled her eyebrows. "So, what’s the plan now? You’re officially the Luna of the Blackwood Pack. That comes with responsibilities."

Lillian sighed, staring out at the horizon. "I don’t know. Part of me still feels like this is a mistake. I never wanted this life."

Beatrice’s expression softened. "But do you want him?"

The question hung in the air, heavy with implication.

Before Lillian could answer, her phone buzzed. A message from Donovan.

"We need to talk. Alone."

Her stomach twisted. Donovan, her ex-fated mate, had no right to demand anything from her. Not after everything he’d done.

Beatrice peered over her shoulder. "Ugh, ignore him. He lost his chance."

Lillian hesitated, then typed a quick reply. "There’s nothing left to say."

She hit send, but the unease remained. Donovan wasn’t the type to let things go.

A sharp knock at the door startled them both.

"Lillian?" Sebastian’s deep voice resonated through the wood.

Beatrice grinned. "Speak of the devil."

Lillian rolled her eyes but couldn’t suppress the flutter in her chest.

The game had changed.

And she wasn’t sure if she was ready for what came next.

The morning sun cast golden rays through the sheer curtains of Lillian’s bedroom, rousing her from a restless sleep. She blinked against the light, her mind still heavy with the weight of last night’s confrontation. Donovan’s betrayal had left a bitter taste in her mouth, but what stung more was the realization that she had been nothing more than a pawn in his twisted game.

Rolling onto her side, she reached for her phone, only to find a string of missed calls from Beatrice. Her best friend had been blowing up her phone since the news broke—Evelyn, Donovan’s new mate, had made sure the entire campus knew about their engagement.

Lillian groaned, burying her face in her pillow. She didn’t have the energy to deal with the whispers and pitying glances that would inevitably follow her today.

A soft knock at her door interrupted her thoughts.

"Lillian?" Sebastian’s deep voice resonated through the wood. "Are you awake?"

Her heart skipped a beat. The Lycan chairman had been her unexpected sanctuary these past few weeks, offering her a place to stay when her dorm became too suffocating. She hadn’t expected kindness from him, not after everything that had happened between them.

"Come in," she called, sitting up as the door creaked open.

Sebastian stepped inside, his towering frame filling the doorway. His dark eyes flickered with something unreadable as he took in her disheveled state. "You look like you didn’t sleep."

"Gee, thanks," she muttered, running a hand through her tangled hair.

He smirked, leaning against the doorframe. "Oliver’s been asking for you. He wants you to join us for breakfast."

The mention of Sebastian’s son brought a reluctant smile to her lips. Oliver had a way of brightening even her darkest days. "Tell him I’ll be down in a minute."

Sebastian nodded but didn’t move. His gaze lingered on her, intense and searching. "You don’t have to face today alone, you know."

Lillian swallowed hard. She knew what he was implying—the stares, the gossip, the humiliation waiting for her on campus. But she wasn’t about to let Donovan win.

"I’ll be fine," she said, forcing confidence into her voice.

Sebastian’s expression darkened. "If he so much as looks at you the wrong way—"

"Don’t," she interrupted, shaking her head. "I don’t need you fighting my battles for me."

A muscle ticked in his jaw, but he didn’t argue. Instead, he pushed off the doorframe and turned to leave. "Breakfast is in ten. Don’t keep Oliver waiting."

As the door clicked shut behind him, Lillian exhaled sharply. She had no idea what she was walking into today, but one thing was certain—she wasn’t going down without a fight.

Grabbing her phone, she shot Beatrice a quick text: Meet me at the coffee shop before class. We need to talk.

Whatever Donovan had planned, she wouldn’t face it unprepared.

The campus coffee shop buzzed with its usual morning crowd, but the moment Lillian stepped inside, the chatter dimmed. Heads turned, whispers followed. She clenched her fists, forcing herself to keep walking.

Beatrice was already at their usual table, her expression tight with worry. "You okay?" she asked the second Lillian sat down.

"Peachy," Lillian deadpanned, stirring her coffee absently.

Beatrice leaned in, lowering her voice. "Evelyn’s been running her mouth all morning. She’s telling everyone you couldn’t satisfy Donovan, so he had to upgrade."

Lillian’s grip on her spoon tightened. "Of course she is."

"You can’t let her get to you," Beatrice insisted. "She’s just trying to provoke you."

Lillian knew that. But knowing didn’t make the sting any less sharp.

Before she could respond, the bell above the door chimed. A hush fell over the room as Donovan and Evelyn sauntered in, their arms linked. Evelyn’s smirk was downright predatory as her eyes locked onto Lillian.

"Looks like the trash decided to show up," she purred, loud enough for everyone to hear.

Lillian’s blood boiled. She opened her mouth to retort—

But a familiar, commanding voice cut through the tension first.

"Problem here?"

Sebastian stood just inside the doorway, his presence alone enough to silence the room. His gaze swept over Donovan and Evelyn with icy disdain before settling on Lillian.

The air crackled with unspoken tension.

Evelyn paled, her grip on Donovan tightening.

Lillian met Sebastian’s eyes, and for the first time that morning, she felt a flicker of something other than anger—hope.

Maybe she didn’t have to face this alone after all.

A sharp, mocking laugh sliced through the air, silencing me mid-sentence.

"Oh, you mean the woman who just signed a contract to become our live-in maid for the foreseeable future?" Arabella sneered, crossing her arms over her chest with a triumphant smirk. "Now you're nothing more than a maid's daughter—lower than dirt. Soon enough, you'll be sharing a cramped servant's quarters with your precious mother. My mother would never allow filth like her to stay in our pristine guest rooms. She'll be moved in by tomorrow morning at the latest."

My lips pressed into a thin, bloodless line. They had promised her—guest room privileges, still part of the family, just with added chores. Had it all been a lie? Did she even read the contract before signing? My stomach twisted into knots, my hands trembling at my sides. I couldn’t let this happen. These people were vipers, thriving on our suffering.

"I swear, if you lay a single finger on my mother, I'll end you," I snarled, my vision tinged red with fury.

Her hand moved faster than I could blink. The sharp crack of her palm against my cheek echoed through the room, followed by the searing pain. Before I could retaliate, her fingers tangled in my hair, yanking me to the ground. Then came the agonizing pressure—her boot crushing my already injured hand. A scream tore from my throat as I grabbed her ankle and yanked hard, sending her crashing down beside me.

Pain shot through my fractured hand, but I gritted my teeth, channeling every ounce of combat training I had. With a desperate lunge, I flipped her onto her back and pinned her beneath me.

She shrieked like a banshee, her wolf claws unsheathing in a flash. Razor-sharp nails raked across my arms, drawing blood. The metallic scent filled the air as I hissed in pain, trying to pry her off.

Before I could strike back, the door burst open. A horrified gasp cut through the chaos.

"Arabella!" Eleanor shrieked as her daughter bucked beneath me, swiping her claws across my face. Fire erupted along my cheek—wolfbane-laced polish searing into my skin. I recoiled with a choked cry, the poison burning like acid.

"What the hell is going on here?!" Marcus Grayson's voice boomed as Silver Crescent guards surged forward, hauling Arabella off me.

"She attacked my daughter!" Eleanor spat, rushing to Arabella’s side. "She needs to be punished!"

I kept my face hidden, fingers trembling over the bleeding gashes.

"Pack Lillian’s belongings," Marcus ordered a guard, who immediately retrieved my suitcase—now flung across the room. His glare then landed on Reginald, who stood frozen in the doorway, eyes darting between me and his daughter. "Is this how you raised her? You should be ashamed. Alpha Sebastian will hear of this."

"P-please," Reginald stammered. "This is just a misunderstanding—"

"He made it clear before leaving—no harm was to come to Lillian or her mother. You broke that vow," Marcus growled, pointing at my battered form. "Look at what your daughter did!"

"I’ll discipline Arabella myself. She wasn’t present for the discussion. She’ll be punished, but please—"


"Punish the rest of us for her actions?" Reginald's voice trembled as he pleaded, his hands clenched at his sides.

Marcus Grayson, Beta of the Silver Crescent pack, regarded him with icy detachment. After a weighted pause, he finally spoke, his tone sharp as a blade. "Deal with her." His golden eyes narrowed, the unspoken threat hanging thick in the air. "Or we will. And when we do, your position as Delta of the Redmoon pack will be revoked. Your son’s future as Alpha? Gone. Every cent of Silver Crescent’s funding? Withdrawn."

Reginald swallowed hard, his shoulders slumping in defeat. "Y-yes, Beta," he muttered, bowing his head in submission. "I’ll handle it."

Without another word, Marcus turned away, his movements swift and decisive. In one fluid motion, he swept Lillian into his arms, cradling her against his chest as if she weighed nothing. His guards released Arabella without hesitation, falling into step behind him as they strode toward the exit.

Arabella stood frozen, her entire body trembling—not with fear, but with rage. Her fists clenched so tightly her nails bit into her palms. "What the hell is happening?" she shrieked, her voice cracking with fury. "Where are you taking her?!"

"Arabella!" Reginald roared, his voice shaking the very walls of the manor. "Enough!"

"But Father—!" she protested, her face twisted in outrage.

"I said ENOUGH!" His roar was thunderous, the command laced with such authority that even the air seemed to still.

Lillian, barely conscious, didn’t see what happened next. The world blurred at the edges before darkness swallowed her whole.

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, illuminating the scattered papers on his desk. His fingers drummed impatiently against the polished mahogany surface, his mind elsewhere.

Lillian had been avoiding him.

Ever since their last heated argument—one that had left the air between them thick with unresolved tension—she had made herself scarce. No lingering glances, no accidental brushes of their hands, not even the usual banter that had once flowed so effortlessly between them.

A knock at the door pulled him from his thoughts.

"Come in," he called, his voice clipped.

The door swung open, revealing Marcus Grayson, his Beta, looking unusually tense. "Alpha, we have a situation."

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "What now?"

"It’s about Donovan," Marcus said, stepping further into the room. "He’s been spotted near the university again. And this time, he wasn’t alone."

Sebastian’s fingers stilled. "Who was with him?"

Marcus hesitated, then exhaled sharply. "Evelyn."

A muscle in Sebastian’s cheek twitched. Donovan’s new mate. The woman he had chosen over Lillian. The woman who had, in a single night, shattered Lillian’s heart and left her vulnerable to the cruelty of their world.

Sebastian pushed back from his desk, his chair scraping against the hardwood floor. "Where’s Lillian now?"

"At the library, according to Beatrice. She’s been spending most of her time there lately."

Of course she had. The library was her sanctuary, the one place she could lose herself in books and forget, if only for a little while, the pain that had been inflicted upon her.

Sebastian grabbed his coat from the back of his chair. "Tell Theodore to prepare the car. I’m going to the university."

Marcus frowned. "Alpha, with all due respect, is that wise? Donovan’s presence alone is enough to provoke you. If he sees you—"

"I don’t care," Sebastian cut in, his voice low and dangerous. "If he thinks he can waltz back into her life after everything he’s done, he’s sorely mistaken."

Marcus opened his mouth to argue but thought better of it. Instead, he gave a curt nod. "I’ll inform Theodore."

As Marcus left, Sebastian strode to the window, his gaze fixed on the distant silhouette of the university’s clock tower.

Lillian might have been avoiding him, but he wasn’t about to let her face Donovan alone. Not again.

Not ever.

The library was quiet, the only sounds the occasional rustle of pages and the soft hum of whispered conversations. Lillian sat curled in her favorite corner, a thick textbook open in her lap, though her eyes hadn’t moved from the same paragraph in the last ten minutes.

Her mind was elsewhere.

Donovan’s face haunted her—his cold dismissal, the way he had looked at her as if she were nothing. And Evelyn’s smug smile, the triumphant glint in her eyes as she clung to his arm.

A shadow fell over her book.

She looked up, expecting Beatrice or perhaps one of her classmates. Instead, her breath caught in her throat.

Sebastian stood before her, his expression unreadable.

"Lillian," he said, his voice rough. "We need to talk."

Her pulse quickened. "About what?"

His gaze darkened. "About Donovan."

Her stomach twisted. "There’s nothing to talk about."

Sebastian leaned down, bracing one hand on the armrest of her chair, caging her in. "He’s here, Lillian. At the university. With her."

She flinched, her fingers tightening around the edges of her book. "I know."

His eyes flashed. "And you’re just going to sit here?"

"What else am I supposed to do?" she whispered, her voice breaking. "Confront him? Beg him to take me back?"

Sebastian’s jaw clenched. "No. But you’re not going to hide either."

She swallowed hard. "Why do you care?"

For a long moment, he didn’t answer. Then, slowly, he reached out, his fingers brushing against her cheek. "Because I do."

The simple words sent a shiver down her spine.

Before she could respond, the library doors burst open.

Lillian turned, her heart stopping.

Donovan stood in the doorway, Evelyn at his side, his eyes locked on her—and on Sebastian’s hand, still lingering near her face.

A slow, dangerous smile curved Donovan’s lips. "Well, well. Isn’t this interesting?"

Sebastian straightened, his body tensing like a predator ready to strike.

Lillian’s breath hitched.

This wasn’t just a confrontation.

This was war.

"You're a miracle worker," Beta Marcus murmured in awe. His fingers brushed lightly over my skin. "Not even a trace left."

A soft, feminine laugh filled the room. "Don't give me all the credit. Her wolf did most of the healing—she's incredibly strong. I just helped with the surface wounds."

"Alpha Sebastian will be relieved when he sees her," Marcus said, his voice warm with admiration. "How long until she wakes?"

"She was severely exhausted, dehydrated, and slightly malnourished," the woman replied gently. "After what she endured this week, she needs more rest."

A low groan escaped me as my fingers twitched back to life. The voices around me faded momentarily as I struggled to open my eyes. The blinding light of the room forced them shut again. The steady beep of a heart monitor confirmed I was in a hospital bed.

Fragments of memory surfaced—Beta Marcus carrying me out of the Winslow estate, then darkness swallowing me whole. He must have brought me to Silver Crescent Hospital, renowned for its elite physicians.

"Ah, she's stirring," the woman noted, her tone pleased.

"Once again, you've worked wonders," Marcus praised, his voice thick with pride.

She chuckled, and this time, there was an unmistakable intimacy in the sound. My brows furrowed as I shifted slightly, testing my body. No pain. My hand, previously sprained, moved freely.

"Behave, Marcus," she chided playfully.

The sound of a kiss followed, then her breathy laughter. This time, when I opened my eyes, the light didn’t sting as much. I turned my head just enough to see Marcus pressing a kiss to her temple, and she pushed him away with a teasing smirk.

"Not while I'm on duty," she scolded, though her lips curled in amusement.

"But I missed you," he murmured, pulling her closer. "You were gone too long."

"It's my job," she reminded him. "There was an emergency in another pack—I had to go. But I'm back now, and I’m not leaving anytime soon. We’ll have plenty of time to catch up."

He sighed dramatically, wrapping his arms around her waist. "It’s not fair. No one else gets separated from their mate this long."

Mate?!

This woman was Beta Marcus’s mate? I knew he had one, but I’d never given it much thought. I certainly hadn’t expected her to be a doctor at Silver Crescent—let alone one who traveled between packs.


###Chapter 169

"It's been two weeks," she laughed softly.

Neither of them noticed my eyes fluttering open as they slipped into an effortless conversation. While they chatted, I studied her for a long moment. She was striking—her golden-blonde hair pulled into a sleek ponytail, oversized glasses framing intelligent eyes. A crisp white lab coat draped over a soft pink blouse, her posture poised yet relaxed. Tall and slender, though still dwarfed by Marcus, who loomed over her by nearly a foot. The ease between them was palpable, an unspoken familiarity that made my chest tighten unexpectedly.

Seeing Marcus like this—gentle, almost tender—was strange. And undeniably sweet.

He was the first to realize I was awake, his dark eyes widening in surprise.

"Oh—sorry," he murmured, stepping back from the doctor with an apologetic glance. "Didn’t realize you were up. How are you feeling?"

The doctor turned, her cheeks flushing a delicate pink as she straightened her coat. "My apologies," she said smoothly, though her fingers fidgeted with her stethoscope. "Any pain? Can you speak?"

I wet my cracked lips, my throat parched. "I think so," I rasped. "Water…?"

"Of course!" She moved quickly, retrieving a chilled bottle from the mini-fridge. Popping the cap, she tilted it carefully to my lips, letting me take slow, measured sips. The icy relief was instant, soothing the raw ache in my throat. I hadn’t realized how thirsty I was until that moment.

"How long was I out?" I asked, glancing between them.

"Just overnight," Marcus answered. "You slept straight through till mid-morning."

I nodded, taking in the sterile surroundings—the unmistakable scent of antiseptic, the Silver Crescent emblem on the wall. A hospital, then.

"You were severely exhausted," the doctor explained, adjusting her glasses. "And dehydrated. But otherwise, you’re in perfect health. All your injuries have healed."

"And my face?" I lifted a hand, remembering the sting of Arabella’s claws, the poison in her Wolfsbane-laced nails. But my fingertips met only smooth skin.

The doctor smiled. "Good as new. Not even a scar."

###Chapter 170

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the Blackwood estate as Lillian stirred beneath silk sheets. Her body ached pleasantly from last night's passionate encounter with Sebastian. The memory sent heat rushing to her cheeks.

"Morning, little wolf." Sebastian's deep voice rumbled against her ear as his arms tightened around her waist.

Lillian turned to face him, her breath catching at the sight of his tousled dark hair and sleep-heavy eyes. "Someone's awake early," she teased, tracing the hard planes of his chest.

Before Sebastian could respond, frantic knocking shattered the moment. "Alpha! Urgent message from Marcus!" Theodore's voice carried through the heavy oak door.

Sebastian growled low in his throat but disentangled himself from Lillian. "This had better be life or death," he muttered, pulling on a robe.

Lillian watched him stride to the door, admiring the way his muscles moved beneath the thin fabric. The moment the door cracked open, Marcus's panicked voice filled the room.

"Donovan's back. He's at the gates with Evelyn and... he's demanding to see Lillian."

Ice flooded Lillian's veins. She hadn't seen her former mate since the disastrous rejection ceremony. The sheets tangled around her legs as she scrambled upright.

Sebastian's entire body tensed. "How dare he show his face here after what he did?" His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Tell the guards to—"

"No." Lillian stood, wrapping a robe around her trembling frame. "I'll see him. This ends today."

Sebastian's golden eyes burned with protective fury. "Not alone."

Downstairs in the grand foyer, Donovan stood flanked by Evelyn and several unfamiliar warriors. The sight of him—his once-familiar features now twisted with bitterness—made Lillian's stomach churn.

"Lillian." Donovan's voice held none of its former warmth. "You look... different."

Sebastian's hand found the small of Lillian's back, his touch grounding her. "State your business quickly, Donovan. You're not welcome here."

Evelyn sneered, her manicured fingers clutching Donovan's arm possessively. "We came to deliver a message. The Winslow family won't stand for this insult. You stole what belonged to Donovan."

Laughter bubbled up in Lillian's throat, sharp and humorless. "Stole? You mean after he publicly rejected me for you? After you both tried to ruin my life?"

Donovan's jaw tightened. "Things have changed. The alliance between our packs—"

"Is over," Sebastian finished. "Unless you've come to formally apologize to my mate, you can leave."

A tense silence fell. Then Donovan's eyes darkened. "You'll regret this, Lillian. When the war comes—"

"War?" Lillian stepped forward, her wolf rising to the surface. "You don't scare me anymore, Donovan. I'm not the weak girl you rejected. I'm the future Luna of the Blackwood pack."

The declaration hung in the air like a challenge. Evelyn's face twisted with jealousy, but Donovan... Donovan looked at Lillian as if seeing her for the first time.

Before he could respond, Oliver came barreling down the stairs. "Papa! The bad man is here again!" The child positioned himself defiantly in front of Lillian, tiny fists clenched.

Sebastian placed a hand on his son's shoulder. "Go back upstairs with Theodore, Oliver. The adults are talking."

As Oliver reluctantly retreated, Donovan's gaze followed him with unsettling intensity. "Interesting... very interesting." He turned abruptly. "We're done here. But this isn't over, Lillian. Not by a long shot."

As Donovan and his entourage disappeared through the grand doors, Lillian exhaled shakily. Sebastian pulled her close. "You were magnificent," he murmured against her hair.

But Lillian couldn't shake the ominous feeling settling in her bones. Donovan's final words hadn't been an empty threat—they'd been a promise.

And the way he'd looked at Oliver... that had been something far more dangerous than anger.

"She's truly a miracle worker," Marcus said with a proud smile.

I arched a brow at him before shifting my gaze to the doctor.

"I don't believe we've met," I told her, my voice steadier now as I took another long sip of water.

A faint blush tinted her cheeks as she offered a small, warm smile.

"I'm Doctor Amelia Langford. But you can call me Amy, since I know you're close to Marcus and the Alpha."

I shot Marcus a questioning look.

"She knows you're working for Sebastian," he admitted. "And that you're moving into his estate."

"And why does she know that?" I asked, though I already suspected the answer.

"Because Amy is my mate," he explained.

I studied her—she looked young, perhaps late twenties, with intelligent eyes and an air of quiet confidence.

"She's also the best physician in the country," Marcus continued, pride lacing his words. "Head of the medical center and frequently travels for research. She just returned after being away for two weeks."

"I'll be staying for a while," she assured him. "No immediate trips unless there's an emergency, which isn't likely."

I smiled at their easy affection. They were sweet together. Maybe she could be a friend—God knew I needed more of those, especially now that I'd be living in the Silver Crescent pack.

Beatrice was going to lose it when I told her. Not that I planned to hide it—she was my best friend, and she deserved to know what was happening in my life. Besides, keeping my living arrangement with Sebastian Blackwood a secret was impossible. She’d find out eventually, and I’d rather she heard it from me.

"You're free to leave whenever you're ready," Amy said kindly. "Marcus will take you to your new home."

My new home.

The thought sent an odd flutter through my chest. I nodded and glanced at Marcus.

"Your belongings have already been moved, including what was in storage," he explained.

My surprise must have been obvious because he chuckled.

"Alpha Sebastian is thorough," he said. "Shall we go?"

"Alright," I agreed.

After a few more minutes of hydrating and Amy removing the IV and heart monitor, I was ready. They insisted on wheeling me out in a chair, though I could walk just fine. My legs felt slightly unsteady, but I knew the weakness would pass soon.

As I settled into the back seat of the car, Amy leaned in before Marcus shut the door.

"I hope we can meet again soon, Lillian. It was lovely getting to know you."

I smiled. "You too."

She closed the door, then pressed a quick kiss to Marcus’s lips. After their murmured goodbyes, he slid into the driver’s seat, and we pulled away from the hospital.

Sebastian’s POV

"She's on her way to the estate now," Marcus mindlinked me as I sat in my office.

I glanced at the clock—just past noon.

"I'll be there shortly," I replied, severing the connection.

I tried to finish my paperwork quickly, but a new email notification chimed. Opening it, I frowned at the sender’s name.

Damien Laurent.

A renowned film director. We’d been in talks for months about shooting a movie in my territory. The contract had been signed weeks ago, but I hadn’t heard from him since.

Until now.

Alpha Blackwood,

Apologies for the short notice, but one of our lead actresses has an urgent conflict and can no longer commit to the original schedule. To accommodate her, we’ve moved filming up—we’ll arrive next week. If you have any concerns, don’t hesitate to reply. Otherwise, we look forward to meeting you soon.

Best,
Damien Laurent
I exhaled sharply.

Next week.

Perfect timing—just as Lillian was settling in.

This was going to be interesting.

###Chapter 171

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains, stirring Lillian from her restless sleep. She blinked against the light, her mind still foggy from the previous night's events. The scent of fresh linen and something distinctly Sebastian lingered in the air, grounding her in reality.

She sat up abruptly, heart pounding.

Where was she?

The room was unfamiliar—luxurious, with dark mahogany furniture and plush velvet drapes. A soft knock at the door startled her.

"Lillian?" A deep, velvety voice called from the other side. Sebastian.

She swallowed hard, fingers tightening around the sheets. "Come in."

The door opened, revealing the imposing figure of the Lycan chairman. His storm-gray eyes flickered with something unreadable as he stepped inside, carrying a tray of breakfast—steaming coffee, fresh fruit, and buttery croissants.

"You should eat," he said, setting the tray on the bedside table. His voice was calm, but tension coiled beneath the surface.

Lillian hesitated. "What happened last night?"

Sebastian exhaled sharply, running a hand through his tousled dark hair. "You don’t remember?"

Fragments flashed in her mind—music, laughter, Donovan’s sneering face, then darkness. She shook her head. "Not much."

His jaw tightened. "You were drugged."

Her breath hitched. "What?"

"At the party. Someone slipped something into your drink." His voice turned dangerously low. "If I hadn’t found you when I did—"

Lillian’s stomach twisted. She remembered now—the dizzying sensation, the way the room had spun, the hands grabbing her—

Sebastian’s fingers brushed against hers, startling her from the memory. "You’re safe now," he murmured.

She looked up, meeting his gaze. There was something raw in his expression, something that made her pulse stutter.

Before she could respond, another knock sounded—this time, sharper.

"Sebastian," Marcus’s voice came through the door. "We have a problem."

Sebastian’s expression darkened. He stood, straightening his suit jacket. "Stay here," he ordered, though his tone softened. "I’ll be back soon."

As the door clicked shut behind him, Lillian exhaled shakily.

Safe.

But for how long?

And who had tried to hurt her?

She reached for the coffee, her fingers trembling.

The game had just gotten more dangerous.

The moment we pulled up to the estate, my breath caught in my throat. The mansion was breathtaking—almost as grand as Sebastian Blackwood’s villa. As the car rolled toward the sweeping staircase leading to the entrance, I had to remind myself to close my mouth.

"This place is fully staffed," Marcus Grayson explained, glancing at me through the rearview mirror. "No butler, but you won’t need one. Sebastian assigned Frederick Hastings here as well, so he’ll be your personal driver whenever you need him. He has his own quarters with the staff, so he’s available around the clock. And of course, I’ll be in and out, as will Sebastian."

I nodded, though my mind was spinning. The sheer scale of it all was overwhelming.

"There are four maids here," Marcus continued, "one head maid, a head chef, and two kitchen assistants. Each maid has a specific role—one for laundry, one for cleaning, one for serving, and the head maid oversees everything. Don’t hesitate to ask her for anything. All your belongings have already been moved into your room, including your phone."

Relief washed over me. I hadn’t realized how much I’d missed my phone until now. I’d left it behind at the Winslow estate, and I’d been dreading the thought of replacing it.

"The maids spent all morning organizing your room and unpacking your things, so you should find everything easily. They even set up your schoolwork on the desk," Marcus added, surprising me further.

"That’s incredibly thoughtful," I murmured, twisting my fingers together. "Thank you for all of this."

Marcus smirked. "Don’t thank me. Sebastian arranged everything. He wanted to make this transition as smooth as possible. I think he feels guilty about the whole Oliver situation. He knows it wasn’t your fault, and the person responsible has already been dealt with."

I nodded. Sebastian had already assured me of that, but hearing it again eased something inside me.

"Will I still be able to see Oliver?" I asked hesitantly.

"Of course," Marcus chuckled. "You’re not getting out of tutoring that easily."

"So… I still have the job?" I asked, barely daring to hope. Sebastian had implied as much, but I hadn’t been sure.

Marcus’s grin widened. "Yes. Oliver refuses to have anyone else. You know he was willing to take the blame just to get you back?"

I blinked. "Wait—what?"

"Before I uncovered the truth, Oliver told Sebastian that he was the one who put peanut butter in his sandwich. Claimed he forgot he was allergic," Marcus said with a laugh.

My jaw dropped. "He lied for me?"

"That kid adores you," Marcus said as he turned off the engine. "It would crush him if you weren’t his tutor anymore."

I nodded, biting my lower lip to suppress the grin threatening to spread across my face. The thought that Oliver would go to such lengths for me sent warmth flooding through my chest. Of course, I would never allow him to shoulder the blame alone. If I had discovered that he’d taken the fall to secure my job, I would’ve marched straight to Sebastian and confessed everything—Oliver had nothing to do with it. But relief settled in my bones, knowing it hadn’t come to that.

"Come on," Marcus said as he stepped out of the car.

I followed closely behind him, my eyes widening as we entered the grand mansion. The interior was just as breathtaking as the exterior—gleaming marble floors, intricate rustic woodwork, and towering ceilings that made me feel small. The design echoed Sebastian’s villa, a clear testament to his refined taste.

But what struck me most was the scent. The entire place carried Sebastian’s signature aroma—rich, commanding, and undeniably alpha. Even amidst the mingling smells of staff, polished wood, and something delicious wafting from the kitchen, his presence was overwhelming. My wolf sighed in contentment, soothed by the familiarity.

A woman approached us immediately, her warm brown eyes crinkling with kindness. She stood about my height, her short, curly chestnut hair pulled back with a simple bandana. Unlike the stiffly uniformed staff at the Winslow estate, she wore a relaxed T-shirt and well-worn jeans, giving off an effortlessly welcoming vibe.

"Hello," she greeted, her voice as sweet as honey.

"Lillian, this is Giselle," Marcus introduced with a nod. "Giselle, this is Lillian. If you need anything during your stay, she’s the one to ask."

I offered a small smile. "It’s lovely to meet you."

"Likewise," she replied, her gaze warm. "I hope everything meets your expectations. If you're hungry, just say the word—I’ll have the kitchen whip up whatever you’d like. Send me a list of your favorite dishes, and I’ll make sure we’re fully stocked."

Her hospitality was genuine, not the stiff formality I’d grown used to. A flicker of ease settled in my chest. Maybe this place wouldn’t feel so foreign after all.

###Chapter 172

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, painting the polished marble floors in warm hues. Lillian stretched lazily in the oversized bed, the silk sheets cool against her bare skin. The scent of freshly brewed coffee and something sweet—perhaps croissants—wafted from the kitchen, making her stomach growl.

She had barely opened her eyes when the door creaked open, revealing Oliver’s mischievous grin. "Morning, sleepyhead!" he chirped, bouncing onto the bed with all the energy of a seven-year-old who had clearly consumed too much sugar already.

Lillian groaned, pulling the covers over her head. "Oliver, it’s too early for this."

"Nope! Dad says breakfast is ready, and if you don’t come now, Lucien will eat all the chocolate croissants."

That got her moving.

Downstairs, the dining room was already bustling. Sebastian sat at the head of the table, impeccably dressed in a tailored suit, scrolling through something on his tablet. His sharp gaze flicked up as she entered, and the corner of his mouth lifted in that infuriatingly knowing smirk.

"Finally decided to join us?" he drawled.

Lillian rolled her eyes, sliding into the seat beside him. "Blame your son. He’s the one who kept me up half the night with his ‘secret mission’ to steal cookies from the kitchen."

Oliver gasped dramatically. "You promised you wouldn’t tell!"

Sebastian arched a brow. "Is that so?"

Before Oliver could protest further, Giselle swept in with a tray of steaming pastries, her expression stern but amused. "If I find crumbs in the pantry again, someone’s going on dish duty for a week."

Lillian bit into a croissant, savoring the buttery flakiness, when her phone buzzed. A message from Beatrice lit up the screen:

"Emergency. Meet me at the café in 20. Donovan’s back in town."

Her stomach twisted. Donovan. Just the name sent a chill down her spine. She hadn’t seen him since he’d publicly rejected her at the mating ceremony, choosing Evelyn instead.

Sebastian’s fingers brushed hers as he casually plucked the phone from her grip. His eyes scanned the message, and his jaw tightened. "You’re not going alone."

Lillian snatched her phone back. "I don’t need a babysitter."

The air between them crackled with tension. Oliver, sensing the shift, wisely stuffed another croissant into his mouth and slid out of his chair, muttering something about "adult drama."

Sebastian leaned in, his voice low and dangerous. "Donovan isn’t just your ex, Lillian. He’s a threat. And if he’s back, it’s not for a friendly visit."

She met his gaze, defiance burning in her chest. "Then it’s a good thing I’m not the same weak girl he left behind."

Without waiting for a response, she pushed back from the table and headed for the door. But Sebastian’s next words stopped her cold:

"Fine. But if you’re not back by noon, I’m coming after you—and I won’t be polite about it."

Lillian didn’t look back as she strode out, but she couldn’t suppress the shiver that raced down her spine.

Because she knew he meant every word.

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s sprawling estate. The sun had barely risen, casting golden streaks across the sky, but she couldn’t sleep—not after last night.

Her fingers tightened around the railing as she replayed the confrontation with Donovan in her mind. His betrayal still stung like a fresh wound, but what hurt more was the smug smirk Evelyn had worn when she’d clung to his arm.

A rustle of fabric made her turn. Sebastian stood in the doorway, his broad frame silhouetted against the dim light of the bedroom. His silver eyes gleamed with concern. "You’ve been out here for hours," he murmured, stepping closer.

Lillian exhaled sharply. "I needed to think."

Sebastian’s hand settled on her shoulder, warm and grounding. "Don’t let them get to you."

She scoffed. "Easy for you to say. You’re not the one who was publicly humiliated."

His grip tightened slightly. "No, but I am the one who watched you walk away from him with your head held high. That takes strength, Lillian."

She wanted to believe him, but doubt gnawed at her. "What if I’m not strong enough?"

Sebastian turned her to face him, his expression fierce. "You are. And you don’t have to face this alone."

A flicker of warmth spread through her chest, but before she could respond, the shrill ring of her phone shattered the moment. Beatrice’s name flashed on the screen.

Lillian answered, and Beatrice’s frantic voice spilled out. "Lil, you need to get to campus now. Cassandra just posted a video of you and Donovan arguing—it’s everywhere!"

Her blood ran cold. "What?"

Sebastian’s jaw clenched as he caught the gist of the conversation. "We’ll handle this."

But Lillian was already pulling away, her mind racing. If Cassandra had twisted the footage, she wouldn’t just be dealing with heartbreak—she’d be fighting for her reputation.

And this time, she refused to lose.

A soft smile curved my lips.

"How thoughtful of you," I murmured to her. "But I'm quite alright for the moment. Perhaps another time?" She gave a graceful nod.

"Certainly," Giselle replied with that melodic voice of hers, fingers smoothing her pristine apron.

Marcus turned to face me fully.

"I must take my leave now, but Alpha Sebastian will arrive shortly," he assured me, his deep voice carrying that familiar note of authority. "Giselle will show you to your chambers and help you settle in." I dipped my head in acknowledgment.

"My thanks, Marcus," I said sincerely.

With a final courteous bow, the Beta exited the grand estate. I turned to find Giselle watching me with that perpetually pleasant expression, her hands clasped neatly before her.

"It's refreshing to have someone new to attend to," she confessed warmly. "Alpha Sebastian visits occasionally, but the house often feels... hollow after a while. One grows weary of polishing silver that no one uses."

"I can imagine," I chuckled, glancing around the opulent foyer. "I'm happy to be here."

"Shall we?" She gestured toward the sweeping staircase.

As we ascended, Giselle painted a vivid picture of the mansion's amenities with her words - a two-story library with rolling ladders, rose gardens that bloomed year-round, an infinity pool that seemed to spill into the horizon, and of course, the private hot springs. Each bedroom, she explained, was a self-contained sanctuary with its own lavish bathroom. The thought of having personal space again sent a thrill through me.

The second-floor corridor stretched before us, illuminated by crystal chandeliers that cast dancing prisms across the walls. When we reached my designated room, Giselle entered first—

And my breath caught.

The chamber was easily triple the size of my childhood bedroom. But what truly stunned me was seeing all my belongings already arranged with meticulous care—my favorite lilac duvet perfectly draped across the four-poster bed, framed photographs and academic trophies displayed on mahogany shelves, even my well-worn novels lining the built-in bookcases. Just as promised, my school materials and backpack waited on the antique writing desk positioned before floor-to-ceiling windows that offered a breathtaking panorama of pack territory.

Opposite this, a curved bay window seat overlooked the manicured gardens, beyond which I could just make out the glimmering pool and steaming hot springs.

My cosmetics and hair tools were neatly organized on a gilded vanity. Peeking into the adjoining bathroom revealed all my toiletries precisely arranged around a sunken marble tub and separate rainfall shower.

"The walk-in closet contains your entire wardrobe," Giselle informed me as I emerged. She'd opened the cedar-paneled doors to reveal rows of my familiar clothing—alongside several elegant pieces I'd never seen before.

"These aren't mine," I observed, fingering a silk blouse with French seams.

She nodded and bit her lower lip, hesitating before speaking. "Some of the clothes you brought looked... intentionally ruined," she confessed, her voice barely above a whisper.

I exhaled sharply, resisting the urge to roll my eyes. Arabella. It had to be her. I wasn’t sure when she’d snuck into my room to destroy my things, but it must have been recently—I hadn’t noticed anything amiss before.

"So, I took the liberty of buying you a few new outfits," Giselle continued, peeking up at me through her lashes. "I couldn’t find exact replacements, so I improvised. I hope that’s alright."

"You didn’t have to do that," I said, shaking my head. "I would’ve managed. I could’ve replaced them myself."

She shrugged lightly, a small smile playing on her lips. "Sebastian insisted. It was his money, so don’t worry about it."

I suppressed another sigh.

I wasn’t sure if that made it better or worse, but I didn’t want to seem ungrateful. So, I simply nodded and murmured, "Thank you."

"I hope everything meets your expectations," she said, glancing around the room as we stepped out of the walk-in closet.

"It’s perfect, Giselle. Really."

Her expression brightened, clearly pleased with my approval.

"If you need anything at all, don’t hesitate to reach out. You can call or text—I already added my number to your contacts," she said, gesturing toward my phone charging on the nightstand. Relief washed over me at the sight of it, and I offered her a grateful smile.

"Unfortunately, we can’t mindlink since you’re not officially part of the pack yet. So, this will have to do for now."

A deep voice cut through the air from the doorway, freezing me in place.

"We could change that." Sebastian leaned against the frame, his gaze intense. "If you pledged yourself to me, that is."
###Chapter 173

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s mansion. The golden hues of twilight painted the sky, casting long shadows across the sprawling estate. She exhaled slowly, her breath forming a faint mist in the cool evening.

Inside, the grand hall buzzed with activity. The pack was preparing for the upcoming alliance meeting with Alpha Maximilian Voss, a rival Lycan chairman whose intentions remained shrouded in mystery. Lillian could hear the low murmurs of warriors discussing strategy, the clinking of silverware as the staff set the banquet table, and the occasional laughter of Oliver, Sebastian’s seven-year-old son, as he darted between the adults.

A familiar presence approached from behind. She didn’t need to turn to know it was Sebastian—his scent, a mix of cedar and something uniquely his, wrapped around her like a comforting embrace.

“You’re thinking too hard,” he murmured, his deep voice laced with amusement.

Lillian smirked. “Someone has to, since you’re too busy being charming.”

Sebastian chuckled, leaning against the railing beside her. His piercing silver eyes gleamed under the fading sunlight. “Charm is a necessary skill when dealing with wolves like Voss. But don’t worry, I’ve got everything under control.”

She arched a brow. “Do you? Because last I checked, he’s the one who sent an assassin after you last month.”

Sebastian’s expression darkened. “And he failed. Miserably.”

Lillian sighed, rubbing her temple. “I just don’t trust him. There’s something off about this sudden alliance proposal.”

Before Sebastian could respond, the doors to the balcony swung open, and Beatrice rushed out, her cheeks flushed. “Lillian! You have to see this.”

Lillian frowned. “What’s wrong?”

Beatrice grabbed her wrist, dragging her inside. “Victoria just arrived—with Donovan.”

Lillian’s stomach twisted. Donovan, her ex-fated mate, had been engaged to Victoria, Sebastian’s daughter, before everything fell apart. His sudden appearance was anything but coincidental.

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. “Why wasn’t I informed?”

Beatrice bit her lip. “They just showed up at the gates. No warning.”

Lillian exchanged a glance with Sebastian. Whatever game Donovan was playing, it was about to begin.

And she had a feeling it wouldn’t end well.

Sebastian leaned against the doorframe with that infuriating smirk of his, and I rolled my eyes at his teasing. There was no way in hell I would ever switch packs—not that easily, at least. Even though Donovan was about to become the Alpha of the Redmoon Pack, it was still my home. My family was there. My friends. My entire life.

Sebastian knew this, of course. The amusement dancing in his eyes told me he was just messing with me, barely holding back laughter at my indignant expression.

"Alpha, it's good to see you," Giselle said, dipping her head respectfully. "I was just helping Lillian settle in before attending to my other duties. Did you need anything while I'm here?"

"No, I'm fine. Thank you, Giselle," he replied, his tone polite.

I exhaled in quiet relief. Unlike the Winslows, who treated their staff like disposable pawns, Sebastian spoke to his people with respect. My chest tightened at the thought of my mother still trapped in that gilded cage. But Marcus had assured me—no harm would come to her. If the Winslows broke their word, Sebastian would make sure they regretted it. I had to hold onto that.

Giselle excused herself, leaving us alone. The moment the door clicked shut behind her, the air between us shifted. Sebastian stepped further into the room, his presence filling the space effortlessly.

"Is everything to your liking?" he asked, scanning the room.

"Yes, it's perfect," I admitted, running my fingers over the familiar books on the shelf. "I can't believe you managed to get all my things."

He shrugged, as if it were nothing. "Wasn't hard. I just wanted you to feel at home."

My cheeks warmed, and I knew I was blushing furiously. "Thank you," I murmured. "For everything."

His gaze lingered on me, assessing. "I’m glad you’re recovering well. Dr. Langford truly is the best."

Embarrassment prickled at the memory of him seeing me so vulnerable. "She was kind. Marcus is lucky to have her as a mate."

Sebastian nodded in agreement. "By the way, you’re expected back on duty Monday evening after classes. You’ll be tutoring Oliver at the villa. Frederick will be staying here with you in the meantime."

"Marcus already told me," I said.

A beat of silence stretched between us. The unspoken tension was thick enough to choke on. We needed to talk—about us, about where we stood now. Things had been so good before everything spiraled, and now? I wasn’t sure what we were anymore.

I kept my eyes fixed on the floor, but I could feel Sebastian studying me, his expression unreadable.

I bit my lower lip, my gaze lifting to meet his. Sebastian's dark, intense eyes roamed over my face before trailing slowly down my body, leaving a trail of fire in their wake.

"We should talk about us..." I finally managed to say, my voice barely above a whisper. "I know things got complicated after the Oliver situation, but—"

Before I could finish, Sebastian closed the distance between us in one swift motion, his lips crashing against mine. The kiss was desperate, hungry—nothing like the controlled, composed man I knew him to be. Electricity sparked through me, every nerve ending alight as his mouth moved against mine. My arms wound around his neck instinctively, pulling him closer as he lifted me effortlessly off the ground. My legs wrapped around his waist as he carried me toward the bed, his tongue tracing my bottom lip in a silent demand.

I parted for him without hesitation, a soft moan escaping me as his tongue delved into my mouth, tasting, claiming. Heat pooled low in my stomach, my fingers tangling in his hair as I arched against him. I needed more—needed to feel his skin against mine, needed to rid us of the barriers between us.

Sebastian didn’t keep me waiting. The moment my back hit the mattress, he pulled away just long enough to yank his shirt over his head, tossing it aside. My breath hitched as my hands roamed over the sculpted planes of his chest, my fingertips tracing the hard ridges of his abs. How was it possible for someone to be this perfect? And yet here he was, letting me touch him, letting me have him.

I wasted no time in shedding my own shirt, and Sebastian made quick work of my bra, his dark gaze burning as he took in the sight of my bare skin. The moment his mouth closed over my nipple, teasing and sucking, a sharp gasp tore from my lips. Pleasure shot through me, my back arching off the bed as his hands worked to undo my pants, leaving me in nothing but my panties—already damp with desire.

I could feel the evidence of my need, the ache between my thighs growing unbearable. Every touch, every kiss, only stoked the fire higher. I had missed this—missed him. The past few weeks had been agony, and now that he was here, I wasn’t letting go.

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the marble floors of Sebastian Blackwood's penthouse as Lillian stirred awake. Her limbs tangled with Sebastian's beneath the silk sheets, his muscular arm draped possessively over her waist. The scent of bergamot and cedarwood clung to his skin, making her wolf purr contentedly.

"Morning, little wolf," Sebastian murmured against her hair, his voice rough with sleep.

Lillian turned to face him, tracing the scar above his eyebrow. "You're up early for someone who kept me awake half the night."

A wicked grin curved his lips. "You weren't complaining then."

Before she could retort, the door burst open. Oliver stood there, his pajamas rumpled, clutching a tablet. "Dad! The board meeting starts in twenty minutes!"

Sebastian groaned, rolling onto his back. "Cancel it."

"But Alpha Harrison is—"

"Cancel. It." Sebastian's voice dropped to that dangerous tone that made even seasoned warriors flinch.

Oliver's eyes darted to Lillian, silently pleading for help. She sighed, sitting up and letting the sheet pool around her waist. "Sebastian, you can't keep postponing meetings because of me."

He caught her wrist, pressing a kiss to her pulse point. "Watch me."

The tablet pinged with an incoming message. Oliver's face paled. "It's from Victoria. She's at the airport with Donovan."

Sebastian was out of bed in an instant, his entire demeanor shifting. "What the hell is my daughter doing with that bastard?"

Lillian scrambled after him, grabbing his robe. "Maybe it's not what you think."

He whirled on her, eyes flashing gold. "You're defending him now?"

"Of course not!" She shoved the robe at him. "But you won't know anything until you talk to her calmly."

Marcus Grayson appeared in the doorway, already dressed in his usual tailored suit. "Alpha, the car's ready. Theodore has eyes on them at Terminal 3."

Sebastian stalked toward the walk-in closet, barking orders. "Tell Julian to intercept but don't engage. I want to know every word exchanged."

Lillian exchanged a worried glance with Oliver. The boy chewed his lip. "Do you think Aunt Victoria is running away again?"

She smoothed his hair. "Let's not jump to conclusions."

When Sebastian emerged minutes later in a charcoal suit that made him look every inch the ruthless Lycan chairman, Lillian blocked his path. "I'm coming with you."

His jaw clenched. "Not this time."

"Either I come with you," she said, lifting her chin, "or I'll follow in my own car. Your choice."

The tension between them crackled until Sebastian exhaled sharply. "Fine. But you stay in the car until I say otherwise."

As they sped toward the airport, Lillian's phone buzzed. A text from Beatrice: Donovan was seen buying two tickets to Paris last night. Evelyn wasn't with him.

Her stomach dropped. This wasn't just a casual meeting—Donovan was trying to leave the country with Sebastian's daughter.

The car screeched to a halt outside Departures. Through the tinted windows, Lillian spotted Victoria arguing with Donovan near the check-in counters. Julian Mercer and three other gammas formed a loose perimeter around them.

Sebastian was out of the car before it fully stopped. Lillian followed, ignoring his earlier order. The moment Donovan saw them, his face twisted into a sneer.

"Well, well," he drawled, pulling Victoria closer. "The happy couple arrives."

Victoria struggled against his grip. "Dad, it's not what it—"

"Let her go," Sebastian growled, his canines elongating. The air thickened with the weight of his alpha aura, making nearby humans stumble away instinctively.

Donovan's eyes flicked to Lillian, a cruel smile playing on his lips. "Missing me already, sweetheart?"

Before she could respond, Sebastian lunged.

###Chapter 174
The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stretched beneath the golden rays filtering through the trees. Her wolf stirred restlessly, still unsettled from last night’s confrontation with Donovan. She exhaled sharply, shaking off the lingering tension.

Sebastian had left before dawn—something about urgent pack business—but not before leaving a note on her nightstand in his precise, elegant script: "Training at noon. Don’t be late."

As if she’d dare.

Beatrice barged into her room without knocking, her arms laden with shopping bags. "You won’t believe what I found at that new boutique near campus!" she announced, dumping the contents onto Lillian’s bed. Silk scarves, delicate jewelry, and a particularly daring crimson dress spilled out.

Lillian raised a brow. "Planning to seduce someone?"

Beatrice smirked. "Maybe. But this—" She held up the dress, "—is for you. Sebastian’s hosting that gala next week, remember? You can’t show up in your usual combat gear."

Lillian groaned. Formal events were torture. "I’d rather fight Blanca again."

"Too bad." Beatrice tossed the dress at her. "Try it on. If it doesn’t fit, Amélie said she can alter it."

Grumbling, Lillian slipped into the dress. The fabric clung to her curves, the deep V-neckline accentuating her collarbones. Beatrice wolf-whistled.

"Sebastian’s going to lose his mind."

Lillian rolled her eyes but couldn’t suppress the warmth creeping up her neck.

A knock interrupted them. Theodore stood at the door, his expression grave. "Miss Lillian, Alpha Sebastian requests your presence in his study. Immediately."

Her stomach dropped. That tone never meant good news.

Sebastian’s study smelled of leather and aged whiskey. He stood by the window, his broad shoulders tense. Without turning, he said, "Donovan’s filed a formal challenge."

Lillian froze. "What?"

"He’s invoking the Ancient Rite." Sebastian finally faced her, his golden eyes blazing. "A duel for mating rights. Three days from now."

The room spun. Ancient Rites were brutal, no-holds-barred fights—often to the death.

"He can’t do that," she whispered.

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "He just did."

Outside, thunder rumbled. The first drops of rain hit the window like a warning.

Sebastian's lips trailed down my body, igniting a trail of fire that left goosebumps in its wake. I squirmed beneath him, anticipation coiling tight in my stomach. His fingers hooked into the waistband of my panties, sliding them down my legs before I kicked them aside, leaving me completely bare before him. Yet, embarrassment was the furthest thing from my mind—I was too lost in the haze of desire to care.

His mouth found the sensitive skin of my inner thighs, inhaling deeply as if memorizing my scent. The heat of his breath against my damp flesh made me shiver. His eyes had darkened to near-black, the wolf within him barely restrained. A low growl rumbled in his chest before he buried his face between my legs, devouring me with a hunger that bordered on primal.

The sensation was overwhelming. My fingers twisted into the sheets as I arched off the bed, his name spilling from my lips in a desperate moan. I didn’t care if the maids heard—let them know exactly who owned me.

The pressure built rapidly, coiling tighter until I shattered with a cry, my body trembling beneath his relentless attention. He lapped at me greedily, drawing out every last wave of pleasure before finally lifting his head.

Then his lips crashed back onto mine, letting me taste myself on his tongue. The possessive act sent another jolt of arousal through me. My hands roamed down his chest, pushing lightly until he obeyed my silent command, rolling onto his back. I straddled his hips, my breath hitching as I took in the sight of him—his dark eyes burning with need, his body taut with restraint.

I helped him shove his pants and boxers down, freeing his erection. Even now, the sheer size of him made my pulse race. My only experience had been with Donovan, and even then, we’d never gone this far. But Sebastian… he was something else entirely. If I hadn’t already taken him inside me before, I wouldn’t have believed it possible.

His hands gripped my hips as I rocked against him, his gaze locked onto mine. A smirk curled my lips before I leaned down, capturing his mouth in a searing kiss. I nipped at his bottom lip, drawing a growl from him before he retaliated, teeth grazing my own in a way that made me laugh breathlessly.

Then, without warning, he lifted me slightly, positioning me right over his length before slamming me down in one smooth thrust. The sudden fullness stole my breath, shock melting into pure, unadulterated pleasure. It was as if something inside me had clicked into place—like I was finally whole again. The last time I’d felt this complete was the first time we’d been together, but somehow, this was even more intense.

We stayed like that for a moment, connected, unmoving, just breathing each other in. Our heartbeats synced, our chests rising and falling in unison. Then I began to move, rolling my hips in slow, deliberate circles before picking up speed.

His grip tightened, fingers digging into my skin as his breathing grew ragged. "Lillian," he rasped, my name rough on his tongue. Hearing it like that—knowing I had this power over him—sent a thrill through me. My hands skimmed up my body, cupping my breasts, watching as his pupils dilated further.

I tangled my fingers in my hair, tossing my head back with another moan as he hit that perfect spot inside me, sending sparks shooting through my veins.

Then I felt him—harder, thicker, his cock twitching within me. He was close, but he was holding back, waiting for me. My entire body tensed as pleasure coiled tighter, my climax hovering just out of reach—until his thumb brushed over my clit, sending me hurtling over the edge.

I cried out his name as I came, my walls clenching around him, dragging him with me. His release followed instantly, filling me until I felt the evidence of it dripping down my thighs.

We collapsed together, breathless, still tangled in each other’s arms.

I collapsed onto Sebastian, our bodies still intimately connected. His strong arms encircled me, shifting us effortlessly until we lay tangled together on our sides, his length still buried deep inside me. Our legs intertwined, sealing the heat between us.

Time blurred—minutes or hours, I couldn’t tell. Exhaustion crept over me like a warm tide, my limbs heavy with satisfaction. His breathing steadied against my neck, slow and deep, matching the rhythm of my own. He was just as spent as I was.

At some point, sleep claimed me. The world faded into darkness, but not before one last thought flickered through my mind, curling my lips into a drowsy smile.

I could get used to this.

###Chapter 175

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, illuminating the spacious bedroom where Lillian lay tangled in silk sheets. The scent of sandalwood and musk still lingered in the air, a reminder of the night before—one that had left her body humming with satisfaction.

She stretched lazily, her muscles pleasantly sore, when the door creaked open.

"Morning, sunshine," Sebastian murmured, his deep voice laced with amusement as he leaned against the doorframe, a steaming cup of coffee in hand. His dark hair was slightly tousled, and the sight of him in nothing but low-slung sweatpants made her pulse skip.

Lillian sat up, clutching the sheet to her chest. "You’re up early."

"Couldn’t sleep," he admitted, crossing the room to hand her the coffee. His fingers brushed against hers, sending a jolt of electricity through her. "Thought you might need this."

She took a sip, the rich bitterness waking her senses. "Thanks."

Sebastian’s gaze darkened as it trailed over her bare shoulders. "We have a meeting in an hour."

Lillian groaned. "Do we have to?"

His lips curved into a smirk. "Unfortunately, yes. The board won’t wait."

She sighed dramatically, but before she could protest further, his phone buzzed. Sebastian frowned as he glanced at the screen.

"Problem?" she asked.

"Donovan," he muttered, his jaw tightening. "He’s demanding another meeting."

Lillian’s stomach twisted. Ever since her ex-fated mate had resurfaced, chaos had followed. "What does he want now?"

Sebastian’s expression turned icy. "To negotiate. Again."

She scoffed. "After everything he’s done?"

"He’s persistent, I’ll give him that." Sebastian pocketed his phone. "But I won’t let him near you."

Lillian reached for his hand, squeezing it. "I can handle him."

Sebastian’s grip tightened. "I know you can. But you shouldn’t have to."

A knock at the door interrupted them. "Sir?" Marcus Grayson’s voice filtered through. "The car’s ready."

Sebastian exhaled sharply. "We’ll deal with Donovan later. For now, let’s focus on the board."

Lillian nodded, but unease settled in her chest. Something told her Donovan’s sudden reappearance wasn’t a coincidence.

And she wasn’t sure she was ready for what came next.

The evening air was thick with the scent of roasted herbs and spices as we gathered in the grand dining hall. Earlier, I had informed the kitchen staff—along with Giselle—that on days when Sebastian wasn’t present, I preferred to eat in the kitchen. They had all nodded in understanding, their warm smiles putting me at ease. The food, as always, was exquisite, but my attention kept drifting to Sebastian, who was meticulously cutting into his steak. When he sensed my gaze, his dark eyes flicked up to meet mine.

"I need to talk to you about something," I said abruptly, setting my fork down.

His brow arched slightly, the ghost of a smirk playing at the corner of his lips. "Go on," he replied, his voice smooth but laced with amusement.

I took a deep breath. "I need my best friend." The words tumbled out before I could stop them. "I hate lying to her about everything that's happening in my life. She’s going to notice I’m not at the Winslow manor anymore, and I want to tell her the truth. About... well, this." I gestured vaguely between us, then to the sprawling mansion around us.

Sebastian studied me in silence, his expression unreadable. My stomach twisted into knots as his gaze lingered on my face, searching for something. Finally, he set his fork down. The indifference in his eyes made my pulse quicken. What if he refused? Would I have to keep lying to Beatrice?

Just as my thoughts spiraled, he cleared his throat, snapping me back to reality.

"Is this the girl who works at the Carter resort?" he asked.

I blinked, surprised he remembered her. A flicker of something sharp—jealousy?—pricked at my chest, but I swallowed it down and nodded.

"Yes. Beatrice. We’ve known each other since we were kids. I tell her everything, and she does the same. She’s my best friend."

The silence stretched between us, thick and heavy. I shifted in my seat, suddenly hyper-aware of every passing second. Then, after what felt like an eternity, he gave a single nod.

"Okay."

I stared at him, my brows lifting. "Okay?" I repeated, needing more than his clipped response.

He hummed, picking up his fork again as if the conversation was already over.

"I can tell her?" I pressed, frustration creeping into my voice.

Sebastian glanced at me, that infuriating smirk tugging at his lips again. He was enjoying this—watching me squirm, dangling answers just out of reach.

The realization made my cheeks burn.

He’s toying with me.

And, annoyingly, I couldn’t deny the thrill that shot through me at the thought.

"Yes." My heart raced with exhilaration. The first thing I planned to do in the morning was call Beatrice—we needed to have a proper lunch together. I nearly leaped across the table to kiss Sebastian right then, but just as I leaned in, one of the kitchen staff entered, clearing away the remnants of our meal.

I had hoped Sebastian would stay the night, but duty called him back to his villa. Not that I could blame him—his children were waiting. Still, that didn’t stop him from leaving me breathless one last time before he departed.

Exhaustion claimed me before he even left, so I never got to say goodbye. When I woke the next morning, an odd emptiness settled in my chest. His side of the bed was cold, the sheets untouched. A sigh escaped me as I dragged myself up, watching the sunrise paint the Silver Crescent territory in hues of gold and pink. A faint smile curved my lips despite the loneliness.

The ensuite bathroom beckoned, and I indulged in the massive whirlpool tub—pure luxury. The steaming water worked its magic, melting away every tension until my limbs felt like liquid. By the time I stepped out, my mind was blissfully quiet, my body weightless. I had never known such relaxation.

Padding into the kitchen, I was surprised to find breakfast already prepared.

"Good morning, madam," the head chef greeted with a courteous nod. "Your meal is ready."

"Please, call me Lillian," I insisted.

"Then you may call me Lucien," he replied smoothly.

Lucien looked to be in his late thirties, with sharp features and an easy charm. The female staff certainly noticed—their cheeks flushed whenever he spoke to them. I wondered if they were new; their reactions seemed too fresh, too unguarded.

"It's a pleasure to meet you properly, Lucien," I said, reaching for a fork from the silverware tray.

The morning held promise. And for the first time in a long while, so did I.
###Chapter 176

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse suite. Lillian stretched lazily beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming from the intensity of last night’s full moon run with her mate.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, sitting up as the door creaked open.

Giselle, the head maid, entered with a silver tray bearing a steaming cup of coffee and a plate of freshly baked croissants. "Good morning, Miss Lillian. Mr. Blackwood asked me to inform you that he’s in a meeting but will join you for breakfast shortly."

Lillian smiled, wrapping her fingers around the warm cup. "Thank you, Giselle."

The maid hesitated before adding, "Also, Miss Evelyn called earlier. She insisted on speaking with you."

Lillian’s grip tightened around the cup. Evelyn—Donovan’s new mate—had been relentless in her attempts to provoke her.

"Ignore her," Lillian said coolly. "If she calls again, tell her I’m unavailable."

Giselle nodded and quietly exited the room.

Lillian exhaled sharply, her mind racing. The upcoming Alpha Summit loomed over her like a storm cloud. Rival packs would be present, including Alpha Maximilian Voss, who had made no secret of his disdain for Sebastian.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Beatrice:

"You’ll never guess who just checked into the Grand Lycan Hotel."

Lillian’s pulse quickened. "Who?"

"Celeste Devereaux."

Lillian nearly dropped her phone. The famous actress-model was rumored to have once been involved with Sebastian. And now she was here, just days before the summit.

The bedroom door swung open, and Sebastian strode in, his tailored suit accentuating his powerful frame. His dark eyes locked onto hers, immediately sensing her tension.

"What’s wrong?" he asked, his voice low.

Lillian swallowed. "Celeste is in town."

A flicker of surprise crossed his face before his expression hardened. "She’s irrelevant."

But Lillian wasn’t convinced. Because if there was one thing she knew about Sebastian’s past, it was that nothing—and no one—was ever truly irrelevant.

And as the clock ticked toward the summit, she couldn’t shake the feeling that Celeste’s arrival was no coincidence.

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, painting the room in warm hues. Lillian stretched beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming from the intensity of last night’s mating bond. Beside her, Sebastian slept soundly, his sculpted chest rising and falling in a steady rhythm.

She traced the scars along his torso—each one a testament to battles fought, a history she was only beginning to unravel. A soft sigh escaped her lips. This man…

Her thoughts were interrupted by the sudden vibration of her phone. Beatrice’s name flashed on the screen, followed by a string of frantic texts:

"Lil, you won’t believe what just happened. Evelyn showed up at the café looking like she’d been crying. She said Donovan’s been acting weird—like, really weird. And get this—he’s been meeting with Alpha Harrison in secret."

Lillian’s blood ran cold. Alpha Harrison? The same Alpha who had tried to take advantage of her when she was drunk?

She shot out of bed, her bare feet hitting the plush carpet. Sebastian stirred, his deep voice laced with sleep. "What’s wrong?"

"Donovan’s up to something," she said, pulling on a robe. "And if he’s working with Harrison, it can’t be good."

Sebastian was instantly alert, his golden eyes sharpening. "We’ll handle it."

The campus coffee shop was unusually quiet when Lillian arrived. Gabrielle, the barista, gave her a knowing look as she slid a steaming latte across the counter. "Beatrice is in the back. She looks… stressed."

Lillian found her best friend hunched over a table, her usually vibrant curls dull under the dim lighting. "Okay, spill," Lillian demanded, dropping into the seat opposite her.

Beatrice exhaled shakily. "Evelyn came to me because she’s scared. Donovan’s been disappearing at odd hours, and when she confronted him, he snapped. Like, full-on fangs-out, eyes-glowing snapped."

Lillian’s grip tightened around her cup. "And Harrison?"

"He’s been seen with Donovan twice this week. And not just casual meetings—they were arguing."

A shadow fell over their table. Oliver, Sebastian’s seven-year-old son, stood there clutching a sketchbook, his wide eyes filled with worry. "Aunt Lillian… I heard Daddy talking to Uncle Marcus. They said something about a trap."

Lillian’s heart skipped a beat.

Sebastian’s voice crackled through her phone seconds later. "Lillian, get to the pack house. Now."

The Blackwood Pack House was in chaos when she arrived. Warriors moved with urgency, their expressions grim. Marcus Grayson, Sebastian’s Beta, met her at the door. "We just intercepted a message. Donovan and Harrison are planning to ambush Sebastian tonight—during the full moon run."

Lillian’s wolf bristled beneath her skin. "Where’s Sebastian?"

"Gone to meet with Alpha Voss. He doesn’t know yet."

Her stomach twisted. A setup.

Marcus’s phone buzzed. His face paled as he read the message. "It’s worse than we thought. They’ve got Victoria."

Lillian’s breath caught. Sebastian’s daughter.

The front door burst open. Sebastian strode in, his aura radiating fury. "We move now."

Lillian didn’t hesitate. She met his gaze, her voice steady. "I’m coming with you."

Sebastian’s jaw clenched, but he nodded. "Then we end this tonight."

The forest was eerily silent as they stalked through the trees, the full moon casting long shadows. Lillian’s senses were on high alert, every rustle of leaves setting her nerves on edge.

Then she smelled it—blood.

A figure stumbled into the clearing. Evelyn, her dress torn, her face streaked with tears. "Lillian—run!"

Donovan emerged from the darkness, his eyes glowing with malice. "Too late."

Behind him, Alpha Harrison stepped forward, a cruel smirk twisting his lips. "Welcome to the end, little mate."

Sebastian growled, his canines elongating. "You’ll regret this."

Harrison laughed. "Oh, we’re just getting started."

A chorus of snarls erupted from the trees as Harrison’s warriors closed in.

Lillian bared her fangs.

Game on.

I took a bite of the fluffy scrambled eggs and couldn't suppress a delighted hum. The rich, buttery flavor melted on my tongue.

"This is incredible," I told Lucien, savoring another forkful.

He smirked, leaning against the counter with effortless charm. "Scrambled eggs aren’t exactly rocket science, sweetheart. Though I’d appreciate it if you finally sent Giselle that list of your favorite dishes. Or just hand it to me—I’d love to know what to whip up for you next time."

I shrugged, swirling my fork in the golden eggs. "Honestly, I’ll eat anything. You could serve me cardboard, and I’d probably still thank you."

Lucien chuckled, shaking his head. "That’s not the point. I want to make things you love."

"Everything is my favorite when it’s made by you," I teased, grinning when he rolled his eyes.

"So, do you live here too?" I asked between bites.

"Yep," he confirmed, crossing his arms. "24/7. Which means if you ever get a midnight craving..." He trailed off with a playful wink, and I laughed, knowing full well he was joking. The entire mansion was probably aware of my relationship with Sebastian by now—it wasn’t exactly subtle.

"But seriously," he added, tone softening, "if you ever need something, day or night, just call for me."

"I’ll remember that," I promised, taking another bite.

"All the staff live in the quarters on the main floor," he explained, pouring himself a cup of coffee.

I hesitated before asking, "And… they’re nice?" The thought of them living in anything resembling the cramped, dismal servants' quarters at the Winslow estate made my stomach churn.

Lucien’s expression softened. "Better than my old apartment, that’s for sure. Spacious rooms, private bathrooms, killer views. Plus, I get paid well to do what I love." He took a sip of coffee before adding, "From what I’ve heard, our rooms aren’t too different from the ones upstairs—just smaller."

Relief washed over me. "And Sebastian treats you well?" I asked, biting my lip.

Lucien studied me for a moment, eyebrows lifting slightly before he shrugged. "When he’s here, yeah. He’s not around much, though. But cooking for his charity events keeps me busy. Now, though?" He grinned. "I’ve got you to spoil. So, seriously—send me that list."

I laughed. "Fine, fine. I’ll send it."

We fell into easy conversation as I finished my meal, and from just this brief exchange, I could already tell—

The way Lucien flirted with everyone—from the kitchen staff to Giselle—was undeniably charming. But it was harmless, the kind that made him perfect friend material.

After breakfast, I insisted on helping with the dishes, but Giselle wouldn’t hear of it.

"The Alpha would have my head if he found out I let you clean," she said firmly, shooing me away from the sink.

I sighed but eventually gave in.

Later that morning, once the hour was decent enough, I called Beatrice and told her we needed to talk. We agreed to meet at our favorite café near campus. The moment she spotted me, her face lit up, and she pulled me into a tight hug.

"Feels like I haven’t seen you in forever," she murmured as she stepped back.

"It’s only been a few days," I laughed.

"Days too long," she countered, pouting. "You’ve been so busy, I couldn’t even get through to your phone."

She wasn’t entirely wrong. The room I’d been staying in didn’t have a charger, so my phone had died days ago. It only came back to life when I arrived at the mansion, and I was grateful Marcus had the foresight to charge it for me.

"Sorry I didn’t call," I said, biting my lip. "There’s a reason for that."

"You look better," she noted, studying me with a soft smile.

I nodded. "I feel better, Bea."

We ordered our drinks—her usual double espresso, my caramel latte—and settled into a cozy corner booth.

"So," she said, stirring her coffee, "what’s going on with you?"

I hesitated, then exhaled. "Okay… don’t freak out."

Her brows shot up. "Now I am freaking out."

I took a deep breath. This was like tearing off a bandage—quick and painful.

"I moved in with Sebastian Blackwood."

###Chapter 177


The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s estate. The golden hues of twilight painted the sky, casting long shadows across the sprawling gardens below. She exhaled slowly, her breath forming a faint mist in the cool evening.

Inside, the mansion buzzed with activity. Preparations for the upcoming gala were in full swing—maids flitted about, adjusting table settings, while Lucien Dubois, the head chef, barked orders in the kitchen. The event was crucial, not just for Sebastian’s political standing among the Lycan elite, but for Lillian as well.

She tightened her grip on the railing, her knuckles whitening. The weight of her new role as Sebastian’s chosen mate pressed heavily on her shoulders. It wasn’t just about surviving the scrutiny of the pack anymore—it was about proving she belonged.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

“Lillian?” Beatrice’s voice drifted through the half-open door. “You’ve been out here for ages. Are you alright?”

Lillian forced a smile. “Just needed some air.”

Beatrice stepped onto the balcony, her arms crossed against the chill. “You’re nervous about tonight, aren’t you?”

“Wouldn’t you be?” Lillian countered. “Half the Lycan council will be there, watching my every move.”

Beatrice smirked. “And the other half will be too busy ogling Sebastian to care.”

Lillian rolled her eyes, but the tension in her chest eased slightly. Beatrice always knew how to lighten the mood.

“Besides,” Beatrice continued, nudging her shoulder, “you’ve faced worse. Remember Alpha Harrison?”

A shudder ran down Lillian’s spine at the memory. The drunken alpha had cornered her at a pack gathering months ago, his intentions anything but honorable. She’d handled it—barely—but the incident had left scars.

“This is different,” Lillian murmured. “Tonight isn’t about fighting. It’s about diplomacy. And I’m not exactly the queen of small talk.”

Beatrice snorted. “Please. You charmed Donovan once, didn’t you?”

Lillian’s smile faltered. Donovan—her ex-fated mate, the man who’d betrayed her for Evelyn. The wound was still fresh, a dull ache she couldn’t quite shake.

“That was before I knew better,” she said quietly.

Beatrice’s expression softened. “Hey. Look at me.” She waited until Lillian met her gaze. “You’re stronger now. And Sebastian wouldn’t have chosen you if he didn’t believe in you.”

Lillian swallowed hard. Beatrice was right. She had survived Donovan’s betrayal, Alpha Harrison’s advances, and even Cassandra’s relentless bullying at school. A gala was nothing compared to that.

“Fine,” she conceded, squaring her shoulders. “But if anyone spills wine on my dress, I reserve the right to shift and bite them.”

Beatrice grinned. “That’s the spirit.”

As they turned to head back inside, a familiar scent caught Lillian’s attention—something earthy and warm, like cedar and smoke. Sebastian.

He stood in the doorway, his broad frame filling the space effortlessly. His dark eyes flickered with amusement. “Biting guests isn’t part of the evening’s agenda, little wolf.”

Lillian’s cheeks warmed. “You heard that?”

“Every word.” He stepped closer, his presence enveloping her like a shield. “Though I’d pay to see you take down Alpha Voss if he gets too handsy.”

Beatrice coughed pointedly. “I’ll just… go check on Oliver.” She slipped past Sebastian with a wink.

Alone on the balcony, Sebastian reached out, tucking a loose strand of hair behind Lillian’s ear. His touch sent a jolt of electricity through her.

“You’ll be magnificent tonight,” he murmured.

Lillian’s pulse quickened. “What if I embarrass you?”

Sebastian’s lips curved into a slow, predatory smile. “Impossible.” He leaned in, his breath warm against her ear. “But if you’re that worried, I can always distract everyone with a scandal of my own.”

Before she could ask what he meant, he captured her lips in a searing kiss. The world narrowed to the heat of his mouth, the possessive grip of his hands on her waist.

When he finally pulled away, Lillian was breathless.

“Now,” Sebastian said, his voice rough with promise, “let’s go show them why you’re mine.”

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood's penthouse, painting the marble floors in warm hues. Lillian stretched lazily beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming from the previous night's passion. The scent of Sebastian—spiced cedar and something uniquely alpha—lingered on her skin, making her heart flutter.

She turned her head, expecting to find him beside her, but the bed was empty. A note rested on his pillow in elegant script:

"Emergency meeting. Don't leave the penthouse—Derek is stationed outside. I'll be back soon."

Lillian sighed, running her fingers through her tousled hair. The possessive command should have irritated her, but instead, warmth spread through her chest. He was protecting her, even when he wasn't here.

Her phone buzzed—a message from Beatrice.

"Girl, you alive? Or did the Lycan King finally wear you out?"

Lillian snorted, typing back. "Very funny. He’s gone for now. What’s up?"

"You need to see this."

A link followed. Lillian clicked it, and her stomach dropped.

BREAKING: Alpha Harrison Accuses Blackwood of Mate Theft—Demands Justice

The article detailed Alpha Harrison's public declaration that Sebastian had "stolen" Lillian from him, despite their broken bond. Worse, he was rallying support from other packs, framing it as an act of Lycan aggression against werewolves.

Lillian's fingers trembled. This wasn’t just about her anymore—it was a political storm, one that could ignite a war.

The penthouse door opened, and Sebastian strode in, his expression dark. "You saw."

She nodded. "What are we going to do?"

He crossed the room in three strides, cupping her face. "We fight." His thumb brushed her cheek. "But first, we make sure they know exactly who you belong to."

A shiver ran down her spine.

Because when Sebastian Blackwood made a claim, the world listened.

If Beatrice had been holding her coffee cup when I blurted out the news, she definitely would have dropped it. Her jaw practically hit the floor as she gaped at me, her eyes wide with shock. I hated keeping this part of my life from her for so long, but now I was ready to confess everything. I just prayed she wouldn’t be furious with me for hiding it.

"I’m sorry, I don’t think I heard you right," she said, narrowing her eyes at me.

"What?" I swallowed hard, taking a sip of my own coffee before setting the cup down.

"No, you heard me correctly," I admitted, avoiding her stunned gaze. "I moved in with Alpha Sebastian Blackwood."

"How…? What…?" She stammered, struggling to form a coherent question. I couldn’t blame her—this was the last thing she’d expected.

"Okay, before I explain, promise you won’t be mad at me for keeping this secret."

She studied me warily for a moment before leaning back in her seat and crossing her arms.

"Have you been seeing him?"

I flinched at her sharp tone. She was already upset, and her question caught me off guard.

"It’s… more complicated than that," I admitted.

"Complicated how, Lillian?" she pressed, her patience wearing thin.

I took a deep breath, steeling myself.

"I’ve been working at his estate for months now," I confessed.

Her brows shot up. "Excuse me, what?"

"That kid I’ve been tutoring… he’s Sebastian’s son," I said quickly. "I’ve been teaching his boy."

She blinked, then shook her head in disbelief.

"Alpha Blackwood doesn’t have a son," she countered. "He has a daughter—which, of course, you already know."

"He does have a son," I insisted. "He’s just kept out of the public eye. Oliver attends a private school, and I think only the pack knows he exists. It’s been a well-guarded secret."

"Why would he hide his own son?" Beatrice frowned, her lips pursed.

"He’s only seven," I said with a shrug. "Maybe Sebastian just doesn’t want Oliver getting tangled up in pack politics."

"Oliver?" Beatrice's eyes widened slightly as she processed the information.

"His son," I clarified, swirling my latte absentmindedly.

She nodded thoughtfully before taking a slow sip of her iced coffee, the condensation dripping onto the table between us. The café was nearly empty, the quiet hum of the espresso machine the only background noise.

"And you've been tutoring him?" she asked after a deliberate pause, her fingers tapping rhythmically against her cup.

I nodded.

"Yes," I admitted, tracing the rim of my mug with my fingertip.

"And that's how you got so close to Sebastian?" Her voice dropped an octave, laced with curiosity.

Another nod. My teeth caught my lower lip as I debated how much to reveal.

"Then... things just... evolved," I murmured, feeling the heat creep up my neck.

Beatrice's brows shot up. She leaned forward, elbows propped on the table, eyes sharp with intrigue.

"Evolved how?" she pressed, her voice barely above a whisper.

I exhaled, the words sticking in my throat. "We sort of... you know..."

The flush on my face must have been answer enough because she gasped dramatically, nearly knocking over her drink.

"Oh my gods!" she squealed, slapping a hand over her mouth. A barista glanced our way, and I shot Beatrice a warning look. She lowered her voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Are you two together now?"

I shook my head—then shrugged.

"It's... casual," I confessed. "Technically, he suggested it. His mother kept throwing potential mates at him, and he needed a way out. And I—" I hesitated, "—needed Donovan to back off. He doesn’t know about Sebastian and me, but he suspects something. And Sebastian... well, he makes sure Donovan keeps his distance. So, win-win."

Beatrice’s jaw dropped. "Holy hell," she breathed, eyes sparkling. "So... is it good?"

I blinked. "Is what good?"

She rolled her eyes, taking another sip. "Don’t play dumb, Lillian. The sex. Is it good?"

My face burned. I ducked my head, staring hard at my half-finished drink.

"...Incredible," I muttered.

Beatrice shrieked—again—earning another disapproving glance from the barista. I groaned, burying my face in my hands.

"Beatrice, I swear, if you tell anyone—"

She held up her hands in surrender, grinning like she'd just uncovered the juiciest secret of the century.
For a fleeting moment, Lillian's expression twisted with unmistakable offense. Her amber eyes flashed with wounded pride, lips parting slightly as if to retort before she caught herself. The air between them crackled with tension, thick enough to slice with a claw.

Sebastian's words had struck deeper than intended. She could feel her wolf bristling beneath her skin, the primal urge to either fight or flee surging through her veins. Her fingers curled into fists at her sides, nails biting into her palms as she struggled to maintain composure.

The grand hall of Blackwood Manor seemed to shrink around them, the opulent chandeliers casting harsh shadows that mirrored the sudden chill in their exchange. Even the usual hum of pack activity in the distance faded into white noise.

"You misunderstand me," Sebastian began, his deep voice laced with a rare hint of contrition, but Lillian was already stepping back, her shoulders squaring defensively. The scent of crushed lavender—her telltale sign of distress—wafted between them.

"Don't," she interrupted, voice barely above a whisper yet razor-sharp. The single syllable hung in the air, charged with unspoken hurt. Behind her, Beatrice hovered near the arched doorway, clutching a stack of books to her chest like a shield, her wide eyes darting between them.

A muscle ticked in Sebastian's jaw as he watched Lillian retreat, the space between them growing colder with each step. The realization that he'd crossed an invisible line settled heavily in his chest. But before he could speak again, the shrill ring of his phone shattered the moment—Victoria's name flashing on the screen like a neon warning.

And just like that, the fragile thread of their confrontation snapped. Lillian turned on her heel, her dark hair whipping like a curtain between them as she strode toward the garden doors. The last thing Sebastian saw was the defiant set of her spine before she vanished into the twilight, leaving only the faintest trace of bergamot and unresolved tension in her wake.

Beatrice's hesitant voice broke the silence. "She'll come around," she offered, though her grip on the books tightened. "Eventually."

Sebastian exhaled through his nose, thumb hovering over Victoria's call. The weight of the unspoken lingered, heavier than any Lycan decree. Eventually, he thought grimly, might be too late.

###Chapter 178

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s mansion. The golden hues of twilight painted the sky, casting long shadows across the sprawling estate. She exhaled slowly, her breath forming a faint mist in the cool evening.

Inside, the murmur of voices drifted from the grand hall. The annual Lycan Summit was in full swing, and tensions simmered beneath the polished veneer of diplomacy. Lillian’s fingers tightened around the railing. She could feel Donovan’s presence even before she heard his voice.

"Running away already?" His tone was laced with mock amusement.

Lillian didn’t turn. "Just needed some air."

Donovan moved closer, his cologne—something expensive and woodsy—filling the space between them. "You always did prefer solitude."

She finally faced him, her gaze steady. "And you always preferred an audience."

A smirk tugged at his lips. "Still sharp as ever."

Before she could retort, the balcony doors slid open, and Evelyn stepped out, her arm slipping possessively through Donovan’s. "There you are," she purred, her eyes flicking to Lillian with barely concealed disdain. "The Alpha of the Silvermoon Pack was asking for you."

Donovan’s expression shifted, the playful glint in his eyes hardening. "Duty calls."

As they disappeared back inside, Lillian’s wolf stirred restlessly. She had almost forgotten how suffocating pack politics could be.

A familiar voice broke through her thoughts. "You look like you could use a drink."

Beatrice appeared beside her, holding out a glass of champagne. Lillian accepted it with a grateful smile. "Thanks."

Beatrice leaned against the railing, her gaze following Donovan and Evelyn’s retreating figures. "He’s still insufferable, isn’t he?"

Lillian took a sip, the bubbles tickling her throat. "Some things never change."

A comfortable silence settled between them before Beatrice nudged her shoulder. "Come on. Sebastian’s about to make his speech. You don’t want to miss it."

Lillian hesitated, her eyes drifting back to the horizon. Something in the air felt charged, like the calm before a storm.

Beatrice noticed her hesitation. "What’s wrong?"

Lillian shook her head. "Nothing. Just a feeling."

But as they re-entered the hall, the weight of unseen eyes followed her. Someone was watching. And they weren’t friendly.

"I would never betray your trust, Lillian," Beatrice assured me, her voice steady and sincere. "You know you can count on me." Her words eased the tension in my shoulders, and I sank deeper into the plush café chair. It felt liberating to finally voice everything that had been weighing on my heart. Having Beatrice by my side, someone I could confide in without hesitation, was a comfort I hadn’t realized I needed so badly.

"So, you’re living with him now?" she asked, wiggling her eyebrows suggestively.

I sighed, swirling my coffee absently. "Apparently, Sebastian has another estate within his territory. He insisted I move in immediately."

Beatrice didn’t even blink. "Of course he does. He’s Sebastian Blackwood—wealth practically drips from his fingertips. That mansion probably isn’t even his only spare."

I nodded, then hesitated before continuing. "He went to the Winslow estate for dinner, trying to establish some kind of rapport with them. But when he saw how they treated me—like some kind of servant—he lost it. Next thing I knew, he was ordering me to relocate to his home."

Beatrice’s eyes widened, her lips parting as if she were about to let out an excited squeal, but she caught herself just in time, clearing her throat instead. I went on, explaining how I had wanted my mother to come with me, but she had stubbornly refused, insisting she needed to stay. Beatrice listened intently, sipping her latte as I unraveled the tangled threads of my life.

"So, he doesn’t know about the financial mess?" she finally asked.

I shook my head, then paused, reconsidering. "He knows I need money. He’s not stupid—he’s probably guessed my family isn’t doing well. But he doesn’t know the extent of it. He has no idea my father is in prison."

Beatrice frowned. "Lillian, the Blackwood Corporation funds half the businesses in the Lycan territories. Why not just tell him? He could fix this with a snap of his fingers."

I exhaled sharply, running a hand through my hair. "My father is too proud. Years ago, he presented a business proposal to Alpha Sebastian, and it was rejected. After that, he refused to seek help from the Lycans again. He wanted to prove he could succeed on his own." My voice dropped to a murmur. "Instead, he turned to loan sharks. Borrowed more than the business was worth. And when the interest piled up… well, you know how that ended."

Beatrice leaned forward. "But Sebastian could help. If you just asked—"

"I can’t," I cut in, biting my lip hard. "I’m embarrassed, okay? I don’t want him looking down on my family. And I doubt he even remembers rejecting my father’s proposal. If I bring it up now, he’ll ask questions—why wasn’t this business Lycan-funded? What went wrong? I don’t have answers that won’t make my father look reckless."

Beatrice sighed, shaking her head with a small, knowing smile. "You’re just like him, you know that? Too proud for your own good."

I didn’t argue. Because she was right.

I nodded in agreement because she was absolutely right, and deep down, I knew it.

"I can't wait to see this mansion. You will invite me over sometime, right?" Beatrice asked, her brows lifting playfully.

"Of course," I promised, grinning. "Now that you know everything, you can drop by whenever you want." She clapped her hands together, her excitement practically vibrating through the air.

"Okay, but wait—there's more exciting news," she said, leaning in conspiratorially. "Did Sebastian tell you about what's happening next week?" My frown deepened before I shook my head. I hadn’t spoken to him much these past few days, so I was completely out of the loop.

"What’s going on?" I asked, curiosity prickling at my skin.

"He signed a contract with a film crew," she whispered, eyes gleaming. "They’re shooting an entire movie right here in his pack!"

Working at the most luxurious resort in werewolf territory, it didn’t surprise me that Beatrice had insider information. The elite loved to gossip, and she always had her ear to the ground.

"That’s actually incredible," I murmured, already imagining the possibilities. What kind of story would they film here?

But Beatrice wasn’t done. "Oh, that’s not even the best part," she said, voice dropping to a hushed whisper. "The lead actress is Celeste Devereaux, Lillian!"

My jaw nearly hit the floor.

"What?" I choked out, my pulse skyrocketing. The queen of Hollywood—here?

She nodded wildly. "Yes!" she squealed. "She’s arriving next week!"

Next. Week.

Celeste Devereaux—the most stunning, sought-after actress and supermodel—was coming here? To Sebastian’s pack?!
 ✨
###Chapter 179

The morning sun cast golden rays through the sheer curtains of Lillian's bedroom, stirring her awake. She stretched languidly, her muscles still sore from yesterday’s intense combat training. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted up from the kitchen, making her stomach growl.

Downstairs, Donovan was already seated at the dining table, his expression unreadable as he sipped his espresso. Evelyn sat beside him, her fingers entwined with his possessively. The sight made Lillian’s chest tighten, but she forced a polite smile.

"Good morning," she murmured, sliding into her seat.

"Sleep well?" Donovan asked, his tone indifferent.

"Like a log," she lied, reaching for the toast.

Beatrice burst into the room then, her cheeks flushed with excitement. "You won’t believe what just happened!" she exclaimed, waving her phone. "Sebastian Blackwood just announced a charity gala—and guess who’s invited?"

Lillian’s fork stilled mid-air. "Us?"

"Not just us—the entire campus!" Beatrice squealed. "It’s happening this weekend at the Blackwood Estate!"

Donovan’s grip on his cup tightened. "Interesting timing," he muttered.

Lillian ignored him, her mind racing. A gala meant formal wear, socializing, and—most importantly—Sebastian. She hadn’t seen him since their last heated argument, and the thought of facing him again sent a thrill down her spine.

Evelyn smirked. "I suppose you’ll need a dress. Too bad you can’t afford anything decent."

Before Lillian could retort, Beatrice linked arms with her. "We’re going shopping. Now."

As they left, Donovan’s voice followed them, laced with warning. "Don’t embarrass yourself, Lillian."

Outside, Beatrice huffed. "Ignore him. We’re getting you something stunning."

Lillian exhaled shakily. The gala was her chance—to prove herself, to confront Sebastian, and maybe, just maybe, to reclaim what was once hers.

But fate had other plans.

Because as they turned the corner, a sleek black car pulled up beside them. The window rolled down, revealing Sebastian’s piercing gaze.

"Need a ride?" he asked, his voice dripping with quiet intensity.

And just like that, the game changed.

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, illuminating the spacious living area where Lillian sat curled up on the plush sofa. A steaming cup of coffee rested on the table in front of her, untouched. Her fingers absently traced the rim of the mug as her mind wandered back to last night’s confrontation with Donovan.

She had expected anger, betrayal—anything but the cold indifference he had shown. It stung more than she cared to admit.

The sound of footsteps pulled her from her thoughts. Sebastian strode into the room, his dark hair slightly tousled, as if he had just run his fingers through it in frustration. His sharp blue eyes locked onto hers, and for a moment, the air between them crackled with unspoken tension.

"Did you sleep at all?" he asked, his voice low and rough.

Lillian shook her head. "Not really."

Sebastian exhaled sharply, his jaw tightening. "Donovan’s a fool."

She let out a humorless laugh. "Yeah, well, he made his choice."

Silence stretched between them, heavy with the weight of everything left unsaid. Then, Sebastian moved closer, his presence commanding yet oddly comforting. "You deserve better than him."

Lillian looked up, meeting his gaze. "And what if I don’t know what ‘better’ looks like anymore?"

A slow, dangerous smirk curled his lips. "Then maybe it’s time you found out."

Before she could respond, the shrill ring of her phone shattered the moment. Beatrice’s name flashed across the screen.

Lillian hesitated, then answered. "Bea?"

"Lil, you need to get to campus now," Beatrice’s voice was urgent, breathless. "Cassandra just posted something online—something bad."

A cold dread settled in Lillian’s stomach. "What did she do?"

Beatrice’s next words sent a chill down her spine.

"She leaked the photos."

Lillian’s blood ran cold.

Sebastian’s expression darkened as he caught the shift in her demeanor. "What happened?"

She swallowed hard, her fingers tightening around the phone. "We have a problem."

And just like that, the fragile peace of the morning shattered.

Victoria was in the kitchen grabbing a quick snack when she heard muffled laughter drifting from the parlor. Her brows furrowed as she set down her glass and moved toward the sound. The villa had been unusually quiet for the past week—mostly because Oliver had been recovering in the hospital. Even after his return, the atmosphere remained subdued. She and Donovan had been spending more time here because of it.

When she reached the parlor door, a familiar voice sent ice flooding through her veins.

No…

It couldn’t be.

She shoved the door open, and her entire body locked up at the sight before her. Lillian sat on the couch, Oliver beside her, their heads bent over a textbook. Whatever they were discussing had Oliver dissolving into a fit of giggles. Sebastian lounged in a nearby armchair, watching them with an amused grin. The sight twisted Victoria’s stomach into knots.

No one had noticed her yet.

Lillian wasn’t supposed to be here. She had made sure of it. She had pinned Oliver’s allergic reaction on her—how could her father be so reckless as to let her keep her job? She thought she’d finally rid herself of Lillian, yet here she was, looking more confident than ever. Victoria’s fists clenched at her sides, her nails biting into her palms as she glared at the scene.

Then Lillian’s gaze lifted, sensing the weight of Victoria’s stare. Her smile faltered, replaced by wary concern. "Oh… hey, Victoria," she said carefully, studying the fury etched across Victoria’s face.

The shift in tone caught Sebastian’s attention. He turned, his own expression darkening as he took in his daughter’s rigid posture.

"Victoria," he greeted, voice edged with caution. "Everything alright?"

"Daddy," she ground out through clenched teeth. "Can we talk? Now."

Without waiting for a response, she spun on her heel and stalked into the hallway. Sebastian sighed but followed, shutting the parlor door behind him. He crossed his arms, watching as Victoria paced like a caged animal, her breaths sharp and uneven.

After a long silence, he finally spoke. "What’s this about?"

Victoria whirled on him. "How could you let that monster back into our home after what she did?!"

"Victoria—"

"She nearly killed Oliver! Does that mean nothing to you?" she snapped, cutting him off before he could defend himself.

"Victoria, listen—"

"No, you listen!" she hissed, stepping closer. "She was careless with Oliver’s life, and it landed him in the hospital. She cannot be trusted!"

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "You don’t have all the facts."

"I have enough," she spat. "Or are you choosing her over your own family now?"

His eyes flashed dangerously. "Careful, Victoria."

She scoffed, turning away before he could see the tremor in her hands.

This wasn’t over.

Not by a long shot.

Victoria's voice trembled with fury as she glared at her father. "She can't be trusted! I never want to see her here again!" Her hands clenched into fists at her sides, her nails digging into her palms.

Sebastian exhaled deeply, running a hand through his dark hair as he studied his daughter. The tension in the room was thick enough to cut with a knife. "I know you're upset, but just hear me out," he said, his voice steady despite the storm brewing in Victoria's eyes.

She finally lifted her gaze to meet his, and Sebastian caught the glimmer of unshed tears. There was something deeper here—something she wasn’t saying. But he knew better than to push. Victoria had always been stubborn; she had to come to him on her own terms.

"How could you let her back in, Dad?" she demanded, crossing her arms tightly over her chest.

"Lillian didn’t do anything wrong," Sebastian stated firmly, his piercing gaze never leaving hers.

Victoria’s breath hitched. She took a step back, her face draining of color. The reaction was so sudden, so visceral, that Sebastian frowned. But he dismissed the thought just as quickly.

"W-what do you mean?" she stammered, her voice barely above a whisper.

"I mean exactly that," he repeated. "One of the maids confessed. She wanted compensation for helping save his life. I banished her from the pack and turned her into a rogue."

Victoria’s lips parted in shock. "A... a maid confessed?" Her voice was small, disbelieving.

Her mind raced. How? She knew for a fact that the maid had nothing to do with it. She had been the one to slip the peanut butter into the sandwich. The kitchen camera had been conveniently broken—there was no evidence. So why would a maid take the blame?

A sharp pang of jealousy twisted in her gut. Was the maid protecting Lillian? Was Lillian that much better than her? Or worse—had Lillian somehow manipulated the maid into taking the fall so she could slink back into Donovan’s life?

The thought made her blood boil.


###Chapter 180

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the university quad. Her combat boots crunched against the gravel path, the sound echoing in the quiet morning. She adjusted the strap of her backpack, her fingers brushing against the hidden dagger she always carried now - a gift from Sebastian after the last attack.

Across the courtyard, Cassandra's laughter rang out like shattered glass. The blonde was surrounded by her usual entourage, all casting venomous glances in Lillian's direction. But today, something was different. Cassandra clutched a glossy magazine, her manicured finger stabbing at a photo spread.

Lillian's breath caught when she recognized the image - Sebastian at some high-society gala, his arm draped around the waist of Celeste Devereaux. The actress's crimson lips were curved in a triumphant smile that made Lillian's stomach twist.

"Looks like your sugar daddy found a new toy," Cassandra called, her voice dripping with false sympathy. The magazine fluttered to the ground at Lillian's feet, the pages splayed open to reveal more intimate-looking shots.

Beatrice appeared at her side like a silent shadow. "Don't," she murmured, placing a restraining hand on Lillian's arm. "That's exactly what she wants."

But the damage was done. The whispers followed Lillian all the way to her first class, where Professor Sinclair's knowing smirk suggested he'd already seen the photos. She barely registered the lecture, her mind replaying Sebastian's promise just last night: "No more secrets between us."

The vibration of her phone startled her. A text from an unknown number showed a blurry photo of Sebastian entering a hotel room, the time stamp from two hours ago - when he'd claimed to be in a board meeting. Beneath it, a single line: "He's lying to you again."

Lillian's fingers trembled as she typed out a reply to Sebastian: "We need to talk." The three dots appeared, then disappeared. No response came.

By afternoon, the campus buzzed with fresh gossip. Someone had leaked security footage of Lillian's drunken night with Alpha Harrison last semester - edited to look far more compromising than it had been. The video played on loop in the student union, drawing gasps and lewd comments.

Oliver's small hand slipped into hers unexpectedly. "Dad's not answering his phone either," the boy whispered, his wide eyes too knowing for a seven-year-old. "But Uncle Theodore says not to worry."

The pieces clicked together with terrifying clarity. This wasn't just petty bullying - it was coordinated. Someone was systematically destroying her reputation and relationship. And judging by the new text now lighting up her screen - a photo of Evelyn and Donovan cozy in a café - they weren't done yet.

The message read: "Meet me alone at the old boathouse at sunset if you want the truth. Tell no one."

Lillian stared at the words, her wolf stirring uneasily. This reeked of a trap. But if there was even a chance to uncover who was behind this...

She hit reply: "I'll be there."

The sun dipped below the horizon as Lillian approached the dilapidated boathouse, her hand resting on the dagger's hilt. The door creaked open before she could knock. In the shadows, a familiar silhouette waited.

"Hello, Lillian," said the voice she least expected. "Did you really think he'd choose you forever?"

The door slammed shut behind her with finality.

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains, painting delicate patterns across the silk sheets. Lillian stirred, her body still humming from the intensity of last night. Beside her, Sebastian Blackwood lay in peaceful slumber, his sculpted features softened by sleep.

She traced the curve of his jaw with her fingertips, marveling at how fate had woven their paths together. Once, she had been just a college student, tangled in the mess of a broken mate bond with Donovan. Now, she was the chosen Luna of the most powerful Lycan pack in the country.

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," she murmured, pulling the sheets higher.

The door creaked open, revealing Giselle Beaumont, the head maid. "Good morning, Luna. Breakfast is ready whenever you and Alpha Blackwood wish to dine."

Lillian smiled. "Thank you, Giselle. We’ll be down shortly."

As the maid retreated, Sebastian’s deep voice rumbled beside her. "Morning, love." His arm snaked around her waist, pulling her closer.

She turned to face him, her heart fluttering at the warmth in his gaze. "Good morning."

His lips brushed against hers in a slow, possessive kiss that left her breathless. When he pulled away, his eyes darkened with something primal. "Last night was…"

"Perfect," she finished for him, cheeks heating.

A smirk tugged at his lips. "I was going to say inadequate."

She gasped, swatting his chest. "Sebastian!"

He chuckled, the sound rich and intoxicating. "Relax, darling. I’m teasing." His expression sobered. "But we do need to talk about Donovan."

The mention of her ex-fated mate sent a chill down her spine. "What about him?"

Sebastian sat up, the sheets pooling around his waist. "He’s been spotted near the pack borders. With Evelyn."

Lillian stiffened. "What does he want?"

"That’s what we need to find out." His jaw tightened. "I won’t let him near you again."

She reached for his hand, intertwining their fingers. "I’m not afraid of him."

Sebastian’s grip tightened. "You should be."

Before she could respond, another knock sounded—this time, more urgent.

Marcus Grayson’s voice carried through the door. "Alpha, we have a situation."

Sebastian sighed, pressing a kiss to her forehead before rising. "Duty calls."

As he dressed swiftly, Lillian watched, her mind racing. Donovan’s sudden reappearance couldn’t be a coincidence. And if he was with Evelyn…

She swallowed hard.

Whatever game he was playing, she wouldn’t let him win. Not this time.

Rage simmered beneath Victoria's skin, but she clenched her fists, forcing herself to remain composed in front of her father.

"So, Lillian did nothing wrong. Therefore, she stays. I appreciate your concern, and I'm glad you care for your brother, but leave Lillian alone, understood?" Sebastian's voice was firm, his brows lifting in quiet warning.

Heat flooded her cheeks, but she nodded. "Understood," she murmured. "I'm sorry." A small, forgiving smile curved Sebastian's lips before he pulled her into a tight embrace. She exhaled, returning the hug briefly before he released her.

"Are you seeing Donovan tonight?" She nodded, biting her lower lip. The thought of Donovan discovering Lillian was back made her stomach twist. He had been entirely devoted to her this past week—lavishing her with attention, his gaze never straying. But now that Lillian had returned, she feared he would slip back into his old habits, trailing after her like some lovesick fool.

"Yes," she said. "I might stay over at his place." Sebastian gave a slow nod.

"Be careful," he cautioned. Then, as an afterthought, he added, "Oh, and the film crew arrives tomorrow. They'll be staying at the villa, so I expect you to be on your best behavior."

At that, Victoria perked up instantly—she had nearly forgotten about the movie being filmed in their territory.

"Celeste Devereaux will be here, right?" she asked, barely containing her excitement. The famous actress and model had been her idol for years, and the anticipation had been gnawing at her ever since the project was announced.

Sebastian nodded.

"Yes," he confirmed. "Try not to scare her off."

Victoria smirked. "No promises."

Her father shook his head, amusement flickering in his eyes before he turned and strode back toward the parlor. Victoria watched him go, then crept forward, cracking the door open just enough to peer inside.

Her gaze immediately landed on Lillian, who brightened the moment Sebastian re-entered the room. Even her father wore a faint smile as he spoke to her, murmuring something Victoria couldn't quite catch—but whatever it was, it made both Lillian and Oliver laugh.

They looked like a perfect little family.

The sight made her blood boil.

She hated how effortlessly they fit together, how comfortable and happy they seemed. It was painfully obvious that Lillian had feelings for her father—and worse, that he returned them.

As Victoria continued to watch their interactions, a plan began to form in her mind.

Celeste Devereaux would be arriving soon.

And Victoria intended to use that to her advantage.

A wicked smile curled Victoria's lips as she shut the Parlor door behind her.


Lillian's POV

The last time I'd tried seducing Sebastian Blackwood in his office, it had been a disaster. He'd rejected me outright, sending me away with a stern reminder that I deserved better. The humiliation had burned, and I'd sworn never to put myself in that position again.

But things were different now.

We'd slept together. I was living in his mansion. The tension between us had shifted into something hotter, something unpredictable.

And tonight, Celeste Devereaux—gorgeous, famous, and dangerously alluring—was visiting the pack.

I needed to remind Sebastian exactly who could satisfy him.

I slipped into a scandalous red lace set, the fabric sheer enough to tease but not reveal. A sleek trench coat covered me, though the way it clung left little to the imagination. My makeup was smoky, my hair cascading in loose waves. I looked good—no, I looked irresistible.

Standing outside Blackwood Enterprises, my pulse raced like a trapped bird.

Deep breath, Lillian.

I pushed through the glass doors.

The same frosty receptionist from last time sat behind the desk. The moment she spotted me, her lips curled in disdain.

"You again?" she sneered, crossing her arms.

"I'm here to see Alpha Blackwood," I said, keeping my voice steady despite the nerves clawing at me.

Her laugh was sharp. "Not happening."

I blinked. "Is he in a meeting?"

"No. He just doesn’t want you here." She leaned back, smirking. "His exact words? 'Do not let Lillian Montague step foot in this office.' Any other questions?"

###Chapter 181

The crisp morning air carried the faint scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s sprawling estate. The sun had barely risen, casting a golden hue over the dense forest surrounding the property. She tightened the silk robe around her, her fingers brushing against the delicate fabric.

Inside, the mansion buzzed with quiet activity. The clinking of silverware echoed from the dining room, where Oliver, Sebastian’s seven-year-old son, was already seated, his small hands gripping a fork with determination.

“Good morning, Lillian,” Oliver chirped, his bright eyes lighting up at the sight of her.

She smiled, ruffling his hair. “Morning, sweetheart. Did you sleep well?”

Before he could answer, the deep timbre of Sebastian’s voice cut through the air. “He was up half the night reading under the covers again.”

Lillian turned to see Sebastian leaning against the doorway, his broad frame filling the space effortlessly. His dark hair was slightly tousled, as if he’d just run his fingers through it, and his piercing gaze held a warmth that made her pulse quicken.

“I was not,” Oliver protested, though the guilty flush on his cheeks betrayed him.

Sebastian arched a brow. “Then why did I find three books hidden under your pillow?”

Oliver huffed, crossing his arms. “Maybe they were already there.”

Lillian stifled a laugh, shaking her head. “You’re as stubborn as your father.”

Sebastian’s lips quirked into a smirk. “And you encourage him.”

The playful banter was interrupted by the arrival of Marcus Grayson, Sebastian’s beta, who cleared his throat. “Alpha, the council has requested an emergency meeting.”

Sebastian’s expression darkened. “What now?”

“It’s about Alpha Harrison,” Marcus said, his tone grave. “He’s been spotted near our borders again.”

Lillian’s stomach twisted. The memory of that night—Harrison’s predatory gaze, the way he’d cornered her when she was vulnerable—flashed in her mind.

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. “I’ll handle it.” He turned to Lillian, his voice softening. “Stay close to the house today.”

She nodded, though unease settled in her chest.

As Sebastian strode out, Oliver tugged at her sleeve. “Lillian, will you help me with my homework later?”

She forced a smile. “Of course.”

But her thoughts were elsewhere.

Because if Harrison was bold enough to return, it meant one thing—he wasn’t done with her yet.

And this time, she wouldn’t be caught off guard.

"He specifically said he doesn't want Lillian Dumont to return to his office. Any further questions?"

The receptionist's voice dripped with condescension, her perfectly manicured fingers tapping impatiently on the desk.

A cold shiver ran down my spine. My breath hitched as I stared at her, stunned. Had Sebastian really given such an order? The thought alone made my chest tighten painfully. I took an involuntary step back, my confidence crumbling under her smug gaze.

"You can't be that surprised," she drawled, rolling her icy blue eyes. "Last time you were here, security had to escort you out. Did you really think he'd welcome you back?"

My teeth sank into my lower lip. Logically, I understood her words, but my mind refused to accept them. This had been my last desperate attempt to fix things, and now—

A sharp inhale. No point staying.

I turned to leave, humiliation burning my cheeks, when a familiar voice froze me mid-step.

"Lillian?"

Of course. Just when I thought this couldn’t get worse.

Slowly, I turned to face him, forcing a strained smile. "Hello, Alpha. I was just leaving—apparently, I'm not welcome here."

Sebastian’s expression darkened. "Who told you that?"

My gaze flicked to the receptionist, whose face had gone beet red.

"Y-you did, Alpha," she stammered, shrinking under his glare. "You said if she ever came back, I was to turn her away."

His jaw clenched. "That was before." His voice was dangerously low. "And unless you want to be unemployed, you’ll remember that I tore that note off your desk yesterday."

Her eyes darted to her notepad—empty.

"Next time you don’t check with me first," he growled, "you’re fired."

She trembled, barely managing a weak "Y-yes, Alpha" before dropping her gaze to the desk.

Without another word, Sebastian grabbed my wrist and pulled me toward the elevator. Silence stretched between us, thick and suffocating, all the way to his office.

The elevator ride to his office floor was silent, the tension between us thick enough to cut with a knife. Only when we rounded the corner and reached his desk did he finally turn to face me, leaning back against the polished mahogany surface. His piercing gaze locked onto mine, a smirk tugging at the corner of his lips.

"To what do I owe this unexpected visit?" Sebastian asked, his voice laced with amusement.

My cheeks flamed under his scrutiny, and for a fleeting second, I questioned my impulsive decision. But now that we were alone, my nerves weren’t from uncertainty—they were from anticipation.

"I... uh..." I stammered, shifting my weight from one foot to the other.

His brows arched as his eyes swept over me, lingering on the familiar trench coat draped over my shoulders. Recognition flickered in his gaze, and his smirk widened into a full, lopsided grin. "Well, well," he drawled, amusement dancing in his voice. "Is this a sequel I wasn’t aware of?"

Heat rushed to my face again, but his teasing tone steadied me. Things were different now. I wasn’t the same hesitant girl who had bargained with him before. I had already shared his bed, lived under his roof—there was no room for hesitation this time.

Without a word, I undid the belt of the trench coat, letting it slip open to reveal the delicate lace beneath. His breath hitched, his eyes darkening as they roamed over me. I shrugged the coat off completely, letting it pool at my feet before taking a deliberate step back, giving him an unobstructed view.

"I just wanted to drop by," I purred, tilting my head slightly.

His jaw tightened, his voice dropping to a low, rough timbre. "I can see that."

The way he looked at me sent a thrill down my spine. Emboldened, I arched a brow. "Do you like what you see?"

His gaze snapped back to mine, intensity burning in his eyes. "More than words can say," he admitted, his voice strained.

The air between us crackled with unspoken desire, and I knew—this time, I wasn’t leaving without exactly what I wanted.

The afternoon sun cast long shadows across Blackwood Estate as Lillian paced nervously in the garden. Her fingers twisted the hem of her blouse, the fabric stretching taut between her restless fingers.

"Miss Lillian?" A deep voice startled her. She turned to find Sebastian Blackwood standing at the arched garden entrance, his broad shoulders blocking the sunlight. "You seem troubled."

Lillian swallowed hard. "I was just thinking about... everything." Her gaze dropped to the rose bushes between them. "Donovan's sudden reappearance. Evelyn's threats. And now Victoria's engagement party..."

Sebastian stepped closer, the scent of sandalwood and power enveloping her. "None of that matters now." His fingers brushed against hers, sending electric currents up her arm. "You're under my protection."

"But your pack—"

"Will accept my choice." His voice held that unshakable alpha certainty that always made her knees weak. "Unless you've changed your mind about us?"

Lillian's breath hitched. The memory of their last kiss burned through her hesitation. "Never."

A satisfied growl rumbled in Sebastian's chest just as Oliver came barreling around the hedge. "Dad! Aunt Penelope says the cake's—" The boy skidded to a stop, eyes darting between them. "Are you two doing the mushy stuff again?"

Sebastian's lips twitched. "Go tell your aunt we'll be right in."

As Oliver scampered off, Lillian bit her lip. "We should—"

"Not yet." Sebastian caught her wrist, pulling her behind a towering hydrangea bush. His mouth crashed down on hers with possessive intensity, stealing her breath and thoughts alike. When they broke apart, both were panting. "That's what you do to me, little wolf," he murmured against her lips.

Footsteps crunched on gravel nearby. "Mr. Blackwood?" Theodore's polite cough came from the other side of the bushes. "The Darkmoon Pack delegation has arrived early."

Sebastian's grip tightened momentarily before releasing her. "Duty calls." His thumb brushed her swollen bottom lip. "We'll continue this tonight."

Lillian's pulse hammered as she watched him stride away, every inch the powerful Lycan chairman. She pressed cool fingers to her flushed cheeks. How had her life become this complicated fairytale?

Beatrice found her moments later, eyebrows raised. "You look thoroughly kissed. Do I need to have the 'birds and bees' talk with our resident alpha?"

"Shut up," Lillian groaned, but couldn't suppress her smile.

Inside the grand ballroom, crystal chandeliers glittered above the gathering elite. Lillian spotted Victoria immediately—the alpha's daughter stood regally beside Donovan, her smile not quite reaching her eyes.

Then the doors swung open again.

Gasps rippled through the crowd as Alpha Maximilian Voss entered with his entourage. The rival Lycan chairman's gaze locked onto Sebastian with predatory intensity.

"Blackwood," he purred. "How... domestic you've become." His cold eyes slid to Lillian. "And this must be the little werewolf causing all the drama."

Sebastian moved instantly, placing himself between them. "Careful, Voss."

The tension crackled like live wire. Lillian's claws pricked at her fingertips. Something told her this gala just became a battlefield.

And she was right in the crosshairs.

###Chapter 182

The morning sun filtered through the heavy drapes of Lillian's bedroom, casting golden streaks across the silk sheets. She stirred awake, her werewolf senses immediately alerting her to Sebastian's absence from their bed. The lingering scent of his cologne told her he hadn't been gone long.

Downstairs, the mansion buzzed with unusual activity. Lillian pulled on her robe and followed the sounds to the grand foyer where Sebastian stood in deep conversation with Marcus Grayson, his beta. Both men turned as her bare feet padded across the marble floor.

"Good morning, darling," Sebastian murmured, pressing a kiss to her temple. The gesture was tender, but Lillian didn't miss the tension in his jaw.

"What's happening?" she asked, fingers tightening around her robe's belt.

Marcus exchanged a glance with Sebastian before answering. "We've received word from the Darkmoon pack. Alpha Maximilian is making his move earlier than expected."

Lillian's breath hitched. The annual Lycan Council gathering was still weeks away, but apparently their rival had other plans. She turned to Sebastian. "What does this mean for us?"

Before he could answer, little Oliver came barreling down the staircase, his pajama shirt half-buttoned. "Daddy! Victoria says there's going to be a war!"

Sebastian scooped up his son with one arm while keeping his other hand firmly on Lillian's waist. "No war, champ. Just some grown-up politics we need to handle."

But Lillian saw the truth in Sebastian's stormy gray eyes. The carefully maintained peace between packs was unraveling, and Alpha Maximilian's sudden aggression could spark the very conflict they'd all been trying to avoid.

Theodore Whitmore appeared in the doorway, his usually impeccable suit slightly rumpled from what must have been a rushed arrival. "Sir, the helicopter is ready. We need to leave within the hour if we're to meet with the other Alphas before sunset."

Lillian's heart pounded. She'd known this day would come eventually, but the reality of Sebastian leaving for potentially dangerous negotiations made her wolf whimper.

Sebastian turned to her, his expression softening. "I need you to stay here with Oliver and Victoria. Marcus will remain as well to ensure your safety."

She wanted to argue, to demand she accompany him, but the pleading look in Oliver's eyes kept her silent. Instead, she straightened her shoulders. "How long will you be gone?"

"A few days at most." He brushed his lips against hers. "Promise me you'll stay out of trouble."

Lillian forced a smile. "When have I ever caused trouble?"

Sebastian's chuckle was dark with promise. "I'll hold you to that, little wolf."

As she watched him stride toward the waiting vehicles, Lillian couldn't shake the feeling that their lives were about to change forever. Somewhere in the distance, thunder rumbled despite the clear morning sky—an ominous warning of the storm to come.

A sly smirk curled my lips as I closed the distance between us, my bare feet silent against the polished hardwood floor. "Then perhaps we should make the most of this moment?" I murmured, my voice dripping with playful suggestion.

My arms wound around his neck, pulling our bodies flush together. The hard press of his arousal against my thigh sent a thrill through me—I loved the power I held over him, the way his control unraveled at my touch. His response was immediate, his strong arms banding around my waist, crushing me against him as his mouth claimed mine.

The kiss started slow, almost teasing, but quickly turned molten as his tongue swept past my lips. A breathy moan escaped me as I drowned in his scent, in the taste of him. His hands were everywhere, scattering papers and pens from his desk with one rough sweep, clearing space for me without breaking our kiss. The mess could wait. Right now, there was only this hunger between us.

He lifted me effortlessly, settling me onto the desk, and I hooked my legs around his hips, keeping him close. His lips trailed fire down my throat, nipping at the sensitive skin before moving lower. My bra loosened, then fell away, discarded without a second thought. I laughed softly as he sucked my bottom lip between his teeth, leaving it swollen and tingling.

His mouth moved lower, tracing the curve of my shoulder before finding my breasts. I gasped as his teeth grazed a nipple, the sharp pleasure-pain making me arch into him. His hands kneaded my flesh, possessive and demanding, leaving faint marks in their wake. My fingers tangled in his hair as he worked me toward the edge, my breath coming in ragged pants.

"Sebastian," I moaned, grateful the office was empty, that no one could hear us.

His fingers hooked into the lace of my panties, and I lifted my hips, letting him strip them away. The dark hunger in his gaze sent a shiver through me. A low growl rumbled in his chest before he dropped to his knees, his mouth finding the slick heat between my thighs.

I cried out as his tongue flicked over my clit, my back bowing off the desk. Pleasure coiled tight in my belly, spiraling higher until I shattered around him, his name a broken whisper on my lips. He didn’t stop until I was trembling, until every last drop of pleasure had been wrung from me.

Then his mouth was on mine again, tasting of me, of us. I yanked his shirt over his head, tossing it aside before running my hands over the sculpted planes of his chest. He was perfection—every hard line, every scar, every breath he took for me. I needed him inside me, needed to feel him like I needed air.

As if sensing my thoughts, he unfastened his pants, and I helped push them down, along with his boxers, freeing his thick length. My fingers wrapped around him, stroking slowly, drawing a ragged groan from his lips. His forehead pressed to mine, his breath hot against my skin as he fought for control.

Just as he moved to claim me, his phone rang.

A frustrated growl tore from his throat.

Part of me—the selfish, desperate part—wanted him to ignore it. But the rational part knew better. He was a man with responsibilities, and I’d already stolen him away from his work.

With a sigh, I released him. He kissed me once more, deep and lingering, before pulling away to grab his phone.

"Yes?" His voice was rough, strained.

A pause. Then—

"She's here now?" Another beat of silence. His fingers raked through his hair. "Fine. I'll be there."

He hung up, his expression torn between irritation and reluctant duty.

I bit my lip, watching him. Duty always won.

And just like that, the moment was over.



###Chapter 183

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood's penthouse. Lillian stirred beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming from the intensity of the previous night. The scent of sandalwood and musk clung to her skin—Sebastian’s scent.

She turned her head, expecting to find him beside her, but the bed was empty. Only the faint indent on the pillow and the lingering warmth of his body remained.

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," Lillian called, pulling the sheets higher.

The door creaked open, revealing Giselle Beaumont, the head maid, carrying a silver tray. "Good morning, Miss Lillian. Mr. Blackwood left early for a meeting but instructed me to bring you breakfast."

Lillian sat up, her dark curls tumbling over her shoulders. "Thank you, Giselle."

The maid set the tray on the bedside table—freshly squeezed orange juice, a croissant still warm from the oven, and a single red rose in a slender vase.

"Did he say when he'd be back?" Lillian asked, trying to sound casual.

Giselle smiled knowingly. "He didn’t specify, but he mentioned he’d see you at the gala tonight."

Lillian’s pulse quickened. The annual Blackwood Charity Gala—the event where the elite of the Lycan world gathered. And she was expected to attend as Sebastian’s date.

Just then, her phone buzzed. A message from Beatrice:

"You’re still alive? I was starting to think Sebastian Blackwood had eaten you."

Lillian rolled her eyes and typed back:

"Very funny. I’ll call you later."

She took a sip of the orange juice, the tangy sweetness bursting on her tongue. Her mind wandered back to last night—Sebastian’s hands on her waist, his lips tracing the curve of her neck, the way he had whispered her name like a prayer.

A shiver ran down her spine.

But then reality crashed in.

Tonight, she would be standing beside him in front of the entire Lycan elite. Including Donovan.

And Evelyn.

Her stomach twisted.

Would they be there? Would they try to humiliate her again?

Lillian clenched her fists. No. She wouldn’t let them. Not this time.

She reached for the rose, its petals velvety against her fingertips.

Tonight, she wouldn’t be the timid werewolf girl they’d mocked.

Tonight, she would be Sebastian Blackwood’s equal.

And she would make sure everyone remembered it.

Celeste Devereaux definitely had something.

Watching Lillian get dressed after our interrupted moment was torture. My fingers itched to finish what we'd started, but duty called. There would be time for that later—once my workday ended and I had her back in my arms. For now, business demanded my attention.

The film crew had arrived early, settling into the villa before I could greet them.

"I'm sorry," I murmured, wrapping my arms around Lillian's waist as she adjusted her blouse. She turned in my hold, those warm eyes softening as she rose onto her toes to press a kiss to my lips.

"It's fine," she whispered, her fingers brushing over my chest. "I know you have responsibilities. I'll see you tonight."

I kissed her again, deeper this time, savoring the taste of her before forcing myself to pull away. After dropping her off at the mansion, I headed straight for the villa.

A sleek limo and several luxury cars were parked outside. Marcus stood by the entrance, nodding as I approached.

"They're inside," he said. "Already settled in their rooms."

I strode through the doors, the hum of conversation guiding me toward the parlor.

"—such a fan! I have your posters everywhere! You're, like, my ultimate idol!" Victoria's voice carried down the hall, brimming with excitement.

I suppressed a groan. Of course she'd latch onto Celeste the second she arrived. If I didn't intervene, the actress might reconsider filming here entirely.

Pushing open the parlor doors, I paused.

Security—both mine and unfamiliar faces—stood along the walls. On the plush couches sat a group of stunning women and sharply dressed men. Nearby, an older man—Damien Laurent, the director—spoke in low tones with one of my officers.

But my focus zeroed in on Victoria, who was practically vibrating as she gushed at the petite, dark-haired woman seated across from her.

Celeste Devereaux.

Even in casual wear, she exuded effortless elegance. But the tightness in her smile was unmistakable—she was searching for an escape.

"Victoria," I said, crossing my arms. "Give her some space."

My daughter whirled, hands flying to her hips. "Dad!"

Celeste's gaze flicked to me, relief flashing in her eyes.

Perfect. Time to save my guest—and my film deal—before Victoria scared her off for good.

"I'm merely introducing myself," she whispered, her voice barely audible. "There will be plenty of time for conversation later. For now, let her settle in without being ambushed by an overzealous admirer."

Victoria's lips parted in shock at my words, but she didn’t argue. Instead, she offered a stiff nod and quickly excused herself, practically fleeing the room. I knew I had embarrassed her, but at this moment, I couldn’t bring myself to care.

Celeste rose from her seat, her outfit leaving little to the imagination. The delicate lace of her jumpsuit clung to her like a second skin, revealing every curve of her model-perfect figure.

"Thank you for that," she murmured as she approached me, a slow, knowing smile curving her lips. "I'm Celeste Devereaux." She extended her hand, and I took it in a brief, polite shake.

"Yes, I'm aware," I replied coolly.

A faint blush tinted her cheeks, and she let out a breathy laugh. "It's an absolute pleasure to meet you, Alpha..." Her voice dipped into a purr, heavy with unspoken suggestion.

I withdrew my hand and turned toward Damien Laurent.

"Mr. Laurent, I presume?" I offered my hand again, this time to him.

He clasped it without hesitation—his grip firm, confident. A man who knew his own worth. I could respect that.

"Please, call me Damien, Alpha," he said smoothly. "It's an honor to meet you, and we deeply appreciate your hospitality in allowing us to film here. Your territory is breathtaking—perfect for our production."

I inclined my head.

"Of course," I replied. "The homes you selected for filming have been vacated and prepared. The businesses you requested have also been temporarily closed and are at your disposal."

Gratitude flickered in his eyes, and he nodded eagerly.

Naturally, those who agreed to vacate their homes or shutter their shops had been generously compensated. I made sure they wouldn’t suffer for this arrangement—their livelihoods were secure for the duration of the shoot.
###Chapter 184

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood's sprawling estate. Below, the pack grounds buzzed with activity—warriors training, maids bustling about their duties, and children laughing as they darted between the trees. It was a stark contrast to the chaos that had consumed her life just months ago.

Her fingers tightened around the railing as she recalled Donovan's betrayal. The memory of his sneering face as he paraded Evelyn around campus still burned like acid in her veins. But now, she was no longer the naive girl who had believed in fated mates. She was stronger.

A deep voice broke through her thoughts. "You're brooding again."

Lillian turned to find Sebastian leaning against the doorway, his piercing silver eyes studying her. The Lycan chairman was dressed casually in a black turtleneck that accentuated his broad shoulders, his dark hair slightly tousled from the morning breeze.

"I'm not brooding," she countered, lifting her chin. "I'm strategizing."

Sebastian smirked, stepping closer. "About?"

"About how to make Donovan regret ever crossing me."

His expression darkened at the mention of Donovan. "He already does," he murmured, his voice laced with a growl. "But if you want to ensure he never forgets, I have a proposition for you."

Lillian arched a brow. "I'm listening."

Sebastian closed the distance between them, his presence overwhelming. "The annual Lycan Summit is next week. Every influential pack leader will be there—including Donovan."

Her pulse quickened. "And?"

"And," he continued, his gaze never leaving hers, "I want you by my side. Not as my guest, but as my equal. Let them see the woman who commands respect, not the girl they once underestimated."

Lillian's lips curved into a slow, dangerous smile. "Oh, I'll do more than that. I'll make sure Donovan chokes on his regret."

Sebastian chuckled, the sound rich and warm. "That's what I like to hear."

As he turned to leave, Lillian caught his wrist. "Why are you doing this for me?"

He paused, his expression unreadable for a moment before he answered, "Because you're worth it."

The words settled over her like a promise—one she intended to keep him to.

"We truly appreciate this, Alpha," Damien Laurent said thoughtfully.

I gave a firm nod.

"How about I take you and your team out for a tour of the pack today?" I suggested. "Unless you're eager to start work immediately—then I'll leave you to it."

Damien exchanged glances with his crew, who nodded eagerly. "We weren't planning to begin until tomorrow, so a tour would be perfect," he replied. "Honestly, we could all use a break. The last few days have been nonstop... an evening out sounds ideal."

"Good. Then let's get moving," I said, gesturing for them to follow.

The rest of the evening was spent exploring the pack grounds, showcasing everything we had to offer. My packmates were thrilled to meet the film crew, especially Celeste Devereaux—she was, after all, the most famous among them.

Celeste handled the attention with practiced grace, posing for photos and signing autographs without complaint. She soaked up the admiration like sunlight, which didn’t surprise me in the slightest.

Later, I took them to dinner in the city. Celeste made sure to sit beside me, chattering nonstop. I wasn’t oblivious—I knew exactly what she was doing. The way she kept fluttering her lashes, the lingering glances—it was all too obvious. But the truth was, I had zero interest. My focus was solely on the film project. Celeste was just another woman throwing herself at me, and frankly, it was tiresome.

My wolf bristled at her proximity, making it easier to maintain distance. Yet she was relentless. By the time the evening ended, exhaustion weighed on me. All I wanted was to return to my mansion and see Lillian—to pick up where we'd left off in my office earlier.

I told Victoria I had urgent business up north tonight and instructed her to stay home with Oliver. She agreed without question, though I could see the curiosity in her eyes.

After dropping the crew off at the villa, I bid them goodnight, promising to see them in the morning. As I left, I could feel Celeste’s gaze burning into me until I was completely out of sight.

This was going to be a long few weeks.

Third Person POV

"I know that look," Colette Morel said, crossing her arms as she watched Sebastian Blackwood’s car disappear down the street.

Celeste stood frozen in the doorway, her pulse racing. In all her years as an actress and model, she had never encountered a man as striking as Sebastian Blackwood. She’d heard the rumors, of course—but nothing could have prepared her for the reality.

Her fingers tightened around the doorframe. This wasn’t just attraction.

It was obsession.

Celeste leaned against the balcony railing, her gaze lingering on the imposing figure of Sebastian Blackwood across the courtyard. The golden afternoon light caught the sharp angles of his jaw, making him look every bit the untouchable Lycan Alpha he was.

"You've got it bad for the Alpha," Colette teased, nudging her shoulder playfully.

Out of everyone on set, Celeste had grown closest to Colette. In an industry built on façades, their friendship was as real as it could get—though even that had its limits.

Celeste exhaled dramatically, pressing a hand to her chest. "How could I not? Look at him. That man is a walking fantasy."

Colette rolled her eyes. "A man like that doesn’t stay single for long. There’s always a reason."

"I heard his fated mate passed away years ago," Celeste murmured, lowering her voice. "Left him with their daughter. The girl’s a bit... much, but for Sebastian Blackwood? I’d endure a hurricane."

Colette crossed her arms. "We’re here to work, Celeste. Not to hunt for men. Damien poured everything into this film—it has to go smoothly." As Damien’s sister, she took his ambitions seriously.

Celeste smirked, tossing her hair over one shoulder. "Oh, it will go smoothly. But why can’t I multitask?"

"Multitask?" Colette arched a brow.

"Exactly." Celeste’s grin turned wicked. "Why can’t I nail my performance and nail Sebastian Blackwood?" She leaned in, eyes gleaming with determination. "Now that I’ve set my sights on him, I’m not backing down. I want him, Colette. And what I want, I get."

With that, she sauntered back inside, leaving Colette shaking her head in exasperation before following.

Neither noticed Victoria lurking in the shadows of the terrace, her lips curling into a satisfied smile.

Operation: Separate Lillian from Her Father was officially underway.

And it was going to be far easier than she’d anticipated.

###Chapter 185

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s mansion. The moon hung low in the sky, casting silver light over the sprawling estate. She exhaled slowly, her breath forming a small cloud in the cool night.

Inside, the grand hall buzzed with activity. The annual Lycan Council gathering was in full swing, and though Lillian had grown accustomed to these events, tonight felt different. Her fingers tightened around the railing as she caught sight of Donovan across the room, his arm draped possessively around Evelyn’s waist. The sight still stung, even after all this time.

A warm presence settled beside her. "You shouldn’t let him get to you," Beatrice murmured, handing her a glass of sparkling cider.

Lillian forced a smile. "I’m not. It’s just… hard to forget, you know?"

Beatrice squeezed her shoulder. "You have Sebastian now. And he’s ten times the man Donovan ever was."

Before Lillian could respond, the sound of raised voices cut through the hum of conversation. She turned to see Oliver, Sebastian’s seven-year-old son, standing defiantly in front of Alpha Harrison, his small fists clenched.

"You can’t talk to my dad like that!" Oliver snapped, his voice trembling with childish fury.

Alpha Harrison smirked, clearly amused. "And who’s going to stop me? You?"

Sebastian appeared instantly, his towering frame radiating quiet authority. "That’s enough," he said, his voice low but commanding. The room fell silent.

Lillian’s heart pounded as she watched the exchange. She knew Sebastian could handle himself, but the tension in the air was palpable.

Then, from the corner of her eye, she noticed Victoria—Sebastian’s daughter—whispering urgently to Theodore Whitmore, the family butler. Whatever she said made Theodore’s expression darken.

Something was wrong.

Lillian excused herself from Beatrice and moved closer, catching fragments of their conversation.

"—found the documents in his study," Victoria hissed. "He’s planning something."

Theodore nodded grimly. "We need to warn your father."

Before Lillian could intervene, a sharp gasp echoed through the hall. Heads turned as Evelyn stumbled forward, clutching her stomach. Her face twisted in pain.

Donovan’s eyes widened in alarm. "Evelyn? What’s wrong?"

Evelyn collapsed to her knees, her breath coming in ragged gasps. "I—I don’t know—"

The crowd erupted into chaos.

Lillian’s instincts kicked in. She rushed forward, but Sebastian was already there, barking orders to Marcus Grayson, his beta. "Get Dr. Langford. Now."

As the guests scrambled to make way, Lillian caught a glimpse of Donovan’s face—his expression wasn’t just concern. It was fear.

And in that moment, she knew.

This wasn’t an accident.

Someone had poisoned Evelyn.

And the real question was—who stood to gain from it?

The answer sent a chill down her spine.

Because if Evelyn died… Donovan would be free to reclaim his fated mate.

Her.

The first rays of dawn filtered through the curtains, casting a golden glow over the room. For the first time since I arrived at the Blackwood estate, Sebastian had actually stayed the night with me. Usually, after our passionate encounters, he would slip away once I drifted off to sleep. But this morning, I woke to find him still here—shirtless, his sculpted torso on full display, though he had at least pulled his pants back on.

My breath hitched at the sight of him. It wasn’t displeasure that curled in my chest, but a quiet, fluttering confusion. Tentatively, I traced my fingers down the hard planes of his back, savoring the warmth that radiated from his skin. The urge to curl back into his arms was overwhelming, but I knew better. With the film crew shooting in his territory, his schedule would be packed.

He stirred, his lashes fluttering before his piercing gaze met mine. My pulse stuttered, half-expecting him to bolt from the bed like a man caught in a compromising situation. Maybe he hadn’t meant to fall asleep here. Maybe he’d regret it.

But then—his lips curved into that slow, devastating smile, and my heart hammered wildly against my ribs.

"Good morning," he murmured, rolling onto his back and stretching, his abs flexing in a way that made my mouth go dry. I swallowed hard.

"Morning," I managed, voice slightly breathless. "I didn’t expect you to still be here."

He raked a hand through his tousled dark hair, looking unfairly good for someone who had just woken up. "I was exhausted," he admitted, voice rough with sleep. "Yesterday was... a lot."

"Did you meet Celeste?" I asked before I could stop myself, worrying my lower lip between my teeth. I hated the way my stomach twisted at the thought of him spending the day with a world-famous supermodel, but I had no right to voice that insecurity. So I kept my gaze fixed on my hands, fingers twisting in the sheets.

"Yeah," he said, his tone unreadable. "She’s... interesting. I have to oversee filming again today."

I nodded, forcing a neutral expression. "I’ll be tutoring Oliver later. If you wanted to meet up..." The words tumbled out before I could stop them, my cheeks burning.

Sebastian turned to face me fully, his eyes darkening with something that made my breath catch. "I’ll keep that in mind," he replied, voice low and velvety. "But today’s going to be hectic. I might not have time."

I nodded again, already expecting as much.

With effortless grace, he slid out of bed and scooped his discarded pants from the floor. "I’m going to shower," he announced, already striding toward the bathroom.

I watched him disappear behind the door, only then realizing I’d been holding my breath. The sound of running water filled the room, and I quickly scrambled out of bed, throwing on the first clothes I could find before heading downstairs.

The kitchen was already bustling when I arrived. Giselle stood at the center, deep in conversation with a couple of kitchen staff, their voices hushed. The moment they noticed me, the chatter stopped.

"Good morning, Miss Lillian," Giselle greeted with a polite smile. "Hungry? Lucien is about to start breakfast."

I opened my mouth to respond when—

###Chapter 186
The morning sunlight streamed through the grand windows of the Blackwood mansion, casting a golden glow over the marble floors. I stretched slightly, my stomach growling in protest.

"I'm absolutely famished," I confessed, rubbing my temples. "Could he possibly make more? Sebastian is here too."

Giselle arched a perfectly shaped brow, and I could practically see the questions swirling behind her sharp gaze. But she merely pressed her lips together and nodded. "Of course," she replied smoothly, her tone as polished as the silverware she arranged on the counter.

Not a moment later, Lucien strode into the kitchen, arms laden with fresh ingredients. The moment his dark eyes landed on me, his lips curved into that infamous, heart-stopping smirk.

"Do you have a preference for waffles, darling?" he asked, setting everything down with effortless grace.

I couldn't help but smile. "I adore waffles."

"Perfect," he purred, already reaching for the mixing bowl. "Waffles for the stunning Lillian, coming right up."

Heat rushed to my cheeks at the compliment, but Lucien, ever the charmer, didn’t stop there. He caught the lingering gazes of the kitchen staff—all of whom were practically swooning—and threw them a playful wink. One of the younger maids clutched her chest dramatically, as if she might faint on the spot.

I rolled my eyes but couldn’t suppress the laugh bubbling up in my throat.

The moon hung low over Blackwood Manor as Lillian paced her bedroom, the silk nightgown whispering against her skin. Outside, the first snow of winter dusted the grounds like powdered sugar. She paused by the window, watching her breath fog the glass.

A knock startled her. "Come in," she called, smoothing her hair.

The door creaked open to reveal Sebastian Blackwood, his broad shoulders nearly filling the frame. Moonlight caught the silver streaks in his dark hair as he stepped inside. "Couldn't sleep?" His deep voice resonated through the room.

Lillian shook her head. "Too much on my mind." She gestured to the stack of textbooks on her desk. "Finals are next week."

Sebastian moved closer, the scent of pine and leather wrapping around her. "You'll do fine." His thumb brushed her cheek. "But that's not what's really bothering you, is it?"

She hesitated, then sighed. "Donovan texted me today."

Sebastian's jaw tightened. "What did he want?"

"To meet. Says it's urgent." Lillian twisted the edge of her nightgown. "He claims Evelyn left him."

A low growl rumbled in Sebastian's chest. "Don't go. It's a trap."

"I know but..." Lillian bit her lip. "What if he's telling the truth? What if he needs help?"

Sebastian cupped her face, forcing her to meet his piercing gaze. "After everything he's done? The lies? The betrayal?" His voice dropped to a whisper. "You're too kind for your own good, little wolf."

Downstairs, a door slammed. They both tensed.

"Oliver's home from his sleepover," Sebastian murmured, glancing at the clock. "Two hours past curfew."

Lillian smiled despite herself. "Your son takes after you."

"Stubborn as a mule, you mean." Sebastian sighed. "I should go deal with this."

As he turned to leave, Lillian caught his hand. "Wait. About Donovan... I won't go alone. But I need to know the truth."

Sebastian studied her for a long moment before nodding. "Marcus will go with you. And you'll check in every hour." His grip tightened. "Promise me."

"I promise." She rose on tiptoe to brush her lips against his. "Thank you."

As Sebastian left to discipline his wayward son, Lillian returned to the window. Snowflakes swirled in the lamplight, beautiful yet fleeting. Like trust, she thought. Once broken, could it ever truly be mended?

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. Another message from Donovan: "Tomorrow. Noon. The old boathouse. Please."

Lillian's fingers hovered over the screen. This could be a mistake. But some questions demanded answers. With a deep breath, she typed a single word: "Okay."

Outside, the wind howled through the trees, carrying whispers of danger on the winter air.

Giselle rolled her eyes dramatically.

"Don't you ladies have anything better to do?" she snapped, crossing her arms tightly over her chest and leveling a glare at the giggling maids.

Lucien smirked, unfazed.

"Now, Giselle, no need to be jealous," he teased, nudging her shoulder playfully. "You know you're still my favorite."

"I'm not jealous," she growled, spinning to face him, her cheeks already heating. "But flirting on the job is unprofessional."

"That's not what you were saying the other night," Lucien murmured in a low, suggestive whisper—just loud enough for the rest of us to catch.

My eyes widened as Giselle’s face flushed from pink to deep crimson. Had they…? My curiosity spiked. There was definitely something going on between them, and I was suddenly far too invested in figuring it out.

"We weren’t working," she hissed through clenched teeth. "I need to run to the store. I’ll be back." With that, she spun on her heel and practically fled the kitchen, looking mortified.

I turned to Lucien, who was chuckling and shaking his head.

"She gets embarrassed so easily," he mused, still amused. "I don’t get it. It was just sex. Not a big deal."

I crossed my arms, watching as he moved gracefully around the kitchen, his hands deftly handling the ingredients.

"Maybe to you it wasn’t a big deal," I pointed out. "But did you ever consider it might mean something to her?"

He paused, glancing over his shoulder at me.

"Not my fault she changed her mind," he said with a shrug. "We agreed—no strings. Just scratching an itch. Nothing more."

"Is that the kind of guy you are?" I arched a brow. "The type who treats intimacy like it’s meaningless?"

He quirked an eyebrow in return, then braced his hands on the counter, leaning in so close that if he moved another inch, his lips would brush mine.

"Want to find out?" His voice dropped to a sultry murmur.

Just as I started to pull back, the kitchen door slammed shut, making Lucien instinctively straighten up.

"Lucien, I didn’t hire you to flirt. I hired you to cook," Sebastian’s deep voice cut through the room like a blade, sending an involuntary shiver down my spine.

Amusement still danced in Lucien’s eyes, but he wisely didn’t argue. "Yes, Alpha," he replied smoothly, turning back to the stove.

I stifled a laugh as Lucien quickly resumed cooking, and Sebastian took the seat beside me.

"He’s harmless," I murmured under my breath.

Sebastian rolled his eyes.

"He’s a man with one thing on his mind. Be careful around him," he muttered back.

I raised an eyebrow.

"Do you only have one thing on your mind too?" I challenged.

His gaze locked onto mine, and the intensity in his eyes made my smile falter. I couldn’t read his expression, and the uncertainty twisted my stomach into knots. He studied me for a long moment before speaking.

"What exactly do you think this is?" he asked abruptly.

"Excuse me?" I blinked.

He gestured between us. "This. What do you think we’re doing?"

My cheeks burned at the question, and I had to look away, focusing on the counter instead. He kept his voice low enough that the others in the kitchen either didn’t hear or pretended not to.

After a beat of silence, I answered, "We’re just having fun. Right? Helping each other out. Scratching an itch."

He nodded slowly, thoughtfully.

"Right," he said finally. "Guess that answers your question."

###Chapter 187

The evening air was thick with tension as Lillian stood at the edge of the forest, her fingers trembling around the crumpled letter in her hand. The scent of pine and damp earth filled her lungs, but all she could focus on were the words scrawled in Donovan’s messy handwriting.

Meet me at midnight. We need to talk.

Her heart pounded against her ribs. After everything—the betrayal, the humiliation, the way he had discarded her for Evelyn—why now? Why here?

A twig snapped behind her, and Lillian whirled around, her golden eyes flashing in the moonlight.

Sebastian Blackwood stepped out of the shadows, his broad shoulders tense, his silver gaze locked onto hers. "You shouldn’t be out here alone," he murmured, his voice low and rough.

Lillian swallowed hard. "I can take care of myself."

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "Not when Donovan’s involved."

She flinched at the name. "What do you know?"

Instead of answering, Sebastian closed the distance between them, his fingers brushing against the letter in her hand. "He’s playing games, Lillian. And you’re walking right into his trap."

Her breath hitched. "Then what do you suggest I do?"

Sebastian’s grip tightened around her wrist, his touch searing. "You let me handle it."

A gust of wind rustled the leaves overhead, carrying with it the faintest whisper of Donovan’s scent. Lillian’s pulse spiked.

He was close.

Too close.

And as Sebastian’s grip turned possessive, his lips brushing against her ear, she realized—

This wasn’t just about Donovan anymore.

This was war.
I bit the inside of my cheek before nodding reluctantly. Well, that answered my question—this was nothing more than sex. Sebastian had made that abundantly clear. Deep down, I already knew, but hearing it confirmed still twisted something sharp in my chest. A foolish part of me had hoped, against all logic, that maybe he felt something more. But no. I was just deluding myself.

"There you go, Beautiful," Lucien murmured, snapping me out of my thoughts as he slid a plate of food toward me.

"Coffee," Sebastian demanded, his jaw tight.

Lucien nodded, placing a plate in front of him before turning to fetch the coffee. Sebastian’s gaze tracked his every move, the tension in the room thickening inexplicably. It was bizarre—Sebastian had no right to act this way.

When Lucien returned with two steaming mugs, filling them to the brim, Sebastian dismissed him with a curt wave. To his credit, Lucien didn’t argue. We ate in silence, and when we finished, the kitchen staff cleared the dishes.

"I'll take you to school," Sebastian announced, grabbing his coat from the hook.

"Frederick can drive me," I countered.

"Just come," he muttered, seizing my wrist and pulling me toward the door.

"Careful, Alpha Blackwood," I teased, unable to resist. "People might start thinking you actually like me if you keep acting so possessive." He didn’t respond, just shook his head in exasperation. I smirked as I slid into the car.

The drive was mostly quiet, save for a few brief exchanges. He mentioned Frederick would pick me up later and bring me back to the villa.

Now that Beatrice knew almost everything, I finally had someone to confide in. Before class, I spilled my confusion—how Sebastian swung between icy detachment one moment and possessive intensity the next. One minute, he acted like our arrangement meant nothing; the next, he was glaring daggers at any man who so much as glanced my way.

"I can't believe you're actually sleeping with him," Beatrice laughed, shaking her head. "Maybe he's just as confused as you are."

I mulled that over for the rest of the day before deciding to let it go—for now.

True to his word, Frederick arrived to take me back to the villa. What I wasn’t expecting was Victoria blocking my path to the parlor, arms crossed, her expression smug.

"You can't go in there today," she announced. "My father is busy with the film crew."

"Oh, I didn’t realize they were using the parlor," I said, checking the time. "Is Oliver somewhere else?"

"Maybe in his room?" she mused, then pushed the door open just enough for me to see inside.

My stomach dropped.

Sebastian sat on the couch, and beside him—close, too close—was Celeste Devereaux. She was even more stunning in person than in magazines, her fingers curled around his arm as she laughed at something someone said.

The sight of them together sent a sharp, acidic rush through my veins.

"Don’t they make a perfect couple?" Victoria purred.
###Chapter 188

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s sprawling estate. The golden hues of twilight painted the sky, casting long shadows across the manicured gardens below. She exhaled slowly, her breath forming a faint mist in the cool evening.

Inside, the grand hall buzzed with activity. The annual Lycan Council gathering was in full swing, and the elite of their kind mingled beneath crystal chandeliers. Lillian could hear the clink of fine china and the murmur of hushed conversations.

She turned at the sound of approaching footsteps. Donovan stood in the doorway, his dark eyes unreadable. The moonlight caught the sharp angles of his face, making him look almost ethereal.

"You shouldn’t be out here alone," he said, his voice low.

Lillian arched a brow. "And why is that?"

Donovan stepped closer, his presence overwhelming. "Because I don’t trust myself around you."

Her pulse quickened, but she refused to let him see it. "That sounds like a you problem."

A smirk tugged at his lips. "Always so defiant."

Before she could retort, the doors behind them burst open. Evelyn stormed out, her face flushed with anger. "There you are!" she snapped at Donovan. "You’ve been ignoring me all night!"

Lillian suppressed a sigh. Drama follows him like a shadow.

Donovan barely spared Evelyn a glance. "We’ll talk later."

Evelyn’s eyes flicked to Lillian, narrowing. "Of course. She’s more important."

Lillian held up her hands. "I was just leaving."

She brushed past Donovan, but his fingers wrapped around her wrist, stopping her. "Don’t go."

The intensity in his voice sent a shiver down her spine.

Evelyn scoffed. "Pathetic."

Lillian yanked her arm free. "I’m not part of this." She strode back inside, her heart pounding.

Beatrice intercepted her near the refreshments. "What was that about?"

Lillian grabbed a glass of champagne and downed it. "Nothing worth discussing."

Beatrice smirked. "Uh-huh. You’re a terrible liar."

Before Lillian could respond, Sebastian appeared beside them, his towering frame commanding attention. His gaze locked onto hers. "We need to talk."

Beatrice nudged her. "Go on. I’ll cover for you."

Lillian followed Sebastian to his private study. The moment the door closed, he turned to her. "Donovan’s been making moves against the council."

She frowned. "What kind of moves?"

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "The kind that could start a war."

A chill settled over her. "What do you need me to do?"

His eyes darkened. "Stay close to him. Find out his plans."

Lillian swallowed hard. This just got complicated.

Outside, thunder rumbled in the distance.

A storm was coming.
Victoria knew exactly what she was doing. The look on Lillian's face was precisely the reaction she had hoped for. She wanted Lillian to see Celeste with her father and realize that Celeste was the superior match. Lillian didn’t stand a chance against Celeste—everyone knew it. Including Celeste herself.

Just that morning, they had an entire conversation about it.

Victoria intercepted Celeste before she joined the others for their morning meeting. Celeste frowned when she spotted Victoria, their last encounter having left a sour taste. In fact, Victoria had embarrassed herself trying to impress the actress. But now, Victoria had leverage—something she intended to use to her advantage.

"I'm late for the meeting," Celeste said, holding up a hand to stop whatever Victoria was about to say. "Can this wait?" She was accustomed to fans bombarding her, and in her eyes, Victoria was no different.

"I think you’ll want to hear this now," Victoria countered, crossing her arms.

Celeste stilled, studying the girl. Something in Victoria’s tone piqued her interest. She arched a brow. "Alright, you have my attention," she conceded, though she added pointedly, "For now."

A slow smirk curled Victoria’s lips as she leaned against the wall, her gaze fixed on the stunning actress. Celeste would make the perfect stepmother—not only was she age-appropriate and breathtakingly beautiful, but most importantly, she wasn’t Lillian. And that was all Victoria cared about.

In her mind, Lillian was only using Sebastian to get closer to Donovan. Victoria wanted her as far away from their lives as possible. If that meant setting her father up with another woman, then so be it.

"I overheard you talking about my father last night," Victoria continued smoothly. "I know you’re interested in him."

Celeste’s eyes narrowed. "And why is that any of your business?"

"Well," Victoria murmured, tilting her head, "if things work out between you two, you’d be my stepmother. So, who my father dates is very much my business."

Celeste had to admit she had a point—though she hadn’t thought that far ahead. She was merely testing the waters with Sebastian, seeing if there was potential. Becoming a stepmother wasn’t part of her immediate plans. But she supposed it was the price she might have to pay.

"I’m assuming you have a problem with me pursuing your father?" Celeste asked, watching her carefully.

"Not at all," Victoria surprised her by answering without hesitation. "Don’t get me wrong—it’d be a little strange calling you ‘stepmom’—but my father’s happiness is all that matters to me. If you make him happy, then I’m happy. Oliver and I have wanted him to remarry for a while now."

"Oliver?"

"My brother," Victoria clarified. Of course, she knew Oliver wasn’t her real brother, but he might as well have been. For a moment, she’d forgotten not everyone knew about him.

Even as the film crew bustled around them, Victoria’s plan was already in motion.
###Chapter 189

The film crew had taken over the Blackwood estate, though Oliver mostly kept to himself in his wing of the mansion. Between location scouting and equipment setups, the bustling production team barely noticed whether the boy was present or not.

"I had no idea Sebastian had another child," Celeste murmured, her perfectly manicured fingers tightening around her champagne flute. The revelation displeased her, though not enough to deter her ambitions. With a dismissive toss of her auburn hair, she narrowed her kohl-rimmed eyes at Victoria. "Why are you telling me this? If you don't care that I'm pursuing your father, why bother with this little chat?"

"Because you needed warning," Victoria countered, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. She glanced toward the grand staircase before continuing. "I have strong reasons to believe Father is already involved with someone. Or at the very least, thoroughly captivated by her."

Celeste's porcelain complexion flushed crimson. "What makes you say that?" she demanded through clenched teeth.

"The way they look at each other," Victoria explained, absently twisting the emerald ring on her finger - her mother's heirloom. "All those whispered conversations, the secretive glances. He's been absent most evenings when she's not here, yet miraculously available whenever she visits." A bitter laugh escaped her. "He thinks he's being subtle, but I notice everything."

The actress's grip threatened to shatter the crystal glass. "And who is this woman?"

"Lillian," Victoria spat the name like spoiled milk. "Oliver's tutor."

A pang of guilt twisted Victoria's stomach. This petty, vindictive version of herself felt foreign - a far cry from the poised young woman Sebastian had raised. But Lillian's betrayal cut deep. How dare she play the devoted friend while secretly entangled with Donovan? The deception justified this retaliation, Victoria told herself. Some wounds demanded repayment in kind.
The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains, painting delicate patterns on the silk sheets. Lillian stirred, her body aching from the previous night’s events. The scent of cedar and musk still clung to her skin—Sebastian’s scent.

She sat up abruptly, her heart hammering. The bed beside her was empty, but the indentation on the pillow told her he had been there.

What happened last night?

Fragments of memories flashed through her mind—the gala, the champagne, the way Sebastian’s fingers had traced the curve of her waist before leading her upstairs. Heat rushed to her cheeks.

The door creaked open, and she instinctively pulled the sheets higher.

Sebastian stood in the doorway, dressed in a tailored black suit, his silver eyes glinting with amusement. "Morning, little wolf."

Lillian swallowed. "Did we—?"

His lips curved into a smirk. "Would you like a detailed recount?"

She threw a pillow at him.

Sebastian caught it effortlessly, chuckling as he strode toward her. "Relax. Nothing happened." He leaned down, his breath warm against her ear. "Though I won’t lie—I was tempted."

Lillian’s pulse spiked.

Before she could respond, his phone buzzed. His expression darkened as he read the message.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Trouble." He pocketed the phone. "Victoria’s engagement party is tonight. And Donovan just RSVP’d."

Lillian’s stomach twisted. "He wouldn’t dare show up."

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "Oh, he will. And he’s bringing Evelyn."

A knock interrupted them. Beatrice poked her head in, her eyes widening at the sight of Lillian in Sebastian’s bed. "Uh… am I interrupting something?"

Lillian groaned. "It’s not what it looks like."

Beatrice smirked. "Sure, it isn’t." She tossed a garment bag onto the bed. "You’re gonna need this. The whole pack’s talking."

Sebastian’s gaze turned predatory. "Let them talk."

Lillian exhaled sharply. Tonight wasn’t just about facing Donovan—it was about proving she wasn’t the weak, discarded mate he thought she was.

And Sebastian? He’d make sure the entire Lycan world knew exactly whose side he was on.

If Lillian wanted to play games, then Victoria could play them ten times better.

"And what does this Lillian have that I don't?" Celeste asked, her voice laced with irritation. She had noticed that Sebastian barely spared her a second glance, brushing off her subtle advances. Now she understood why—it was because of her, Lillian.

"Nothing," Victoria murmured, feigning innocence. "Lillian is my age... far too young for him. My father deserves a real woman. Besides, you're far more beautiful."

Celeste smirked at that. Perfect. That meant she still had a fighting chance. She wasn’t about to let some naive college girl steal Sebastian’s heart.

"Celeste, we’re waiting for you!" Damien called from the parlor.

"I should go," Celeste told Victoria, smoothing her dress. "But thank you for the information. I’ll make sure your father chooses the right woman."

Victoria smiled sweetly, her plan already in motion. "That’s all I ask," she said, her tone dripping with false sincerity. "I’ll do my part—maybe even convince Lillian to step aside."

Celeste nodded, reassessing the girl before her. She had pegged Victoria as nothing more than a spoiled princess, but now she saw the cunning beneath the surface. If things worked out between her and Sebastian, being a stepmother to this girl might not be so bad.

With a quick goodbye, Celeste retreated to the parlor, pleased to find Sebastian already seated. She seized the opportunity, sliding into the chair beside him, her movements deliberate.

Meanwhile, Victoria lingered outside the parlor door, knowing Lillian would arrive soon. Sebastian had asked her to inform Lillian that their tutoring session had been relocated due to an impromptu meeting. He was too busy to text her himself.

Victoria had agreed—but she had no intention of delivering the message. She wanted Lillian to walk in and see Celeste cozying up to Sebastian. She wanted her to witness just how perfect they looked together.

The moment Lillian stepped into the hallway, Victoria knew her plan had worked. The color drained from Lillian’s face as her gaze locked onto Sebastian and Celeste, their heads bent close in conversation.

Good.

Now Lillian would believe Sebastian was moving on—with someone far more suited to him. It wouldn’t be long before she gave up entirely.

Victoria didn’t want to hurt her father, but Celeste could mend whatever damage Lillian left behind. Besides, Sebastian was the strongest man she knew. A fleeting romance wouldn’t break him.

Lillian was nothing more than a passing distraction.

"I overheard Celeste talking last night," Victoria said casually, watching as Lillian stood frozen in the doorway. "She’s very interested in my father. Honestly, I’m already picturing her as my stepmother."

Lillian’s breath hitched. "I... see."

The devastation in her voice gave Victoria pause. She had assumed Lillian was only using Sebastian to get closer to Donovan—that her feelings weren’t genuine. But the raw emotion flickering across Lillian’s face suggested otherwise.

For a fleeting second, doubt crept in.

Then Victoria shook it off.

No. This was for the best.

It was all an act. Every smile, every glance, every carefully placed word—Lillian had been performing since the moment they met. She was a master of deception, after all. There was no way she was genuinely hurt by seeing Sebastian with another woman. No, her frustration stemmed from the crumbling of her carefully laid plans to get close to Donovan. Now, she’d have to start over, and this time, without Victoria’s father as leverage.

But Victoria was determined to expose her. She wouldn’t let Lillian win.

"I'm sorry..." Lillian murmured, stepping back from the parlor entrance. Her voice was soft, fragile. "I don’t think I’m feeling well. Could you apologize to Oliver for me? Tell him we’ll reschedule our session for tomorrow."

Victoria feigned concern, tilting her head slightly. "Of course," she said, her tone dripping with false sweetness. "Are you alright? You look... pale."

Lillian nodded mechanically, her gaze flickering toward the parlor door before meeting Victoria’s eyes. And then—Victoria saw it. The glimmer of unshed tears, the slight tremble of Lillian’s lower lip. She was trying to hide it, but the pain was unmistakable.

That didn’t make sense.

Lillian didn’t want Sebastian. She wanted Donovan. So why did she look like her heart had just been torn in two?

"Yes," Lillian whispered, turning her face away. "It was... good to see you, Victoria."

Without another word, she walked away, leaving Victoria standing there, utterly bewildered.

###Chapter 190

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, painting the marble floors in warm hues. Lillian stretched beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming from the intensity of last night’s mating bond. Beside her, Sebastian slept soundly, his sculpted chest rising and falling in a steady rhythm.

She traced the faint scars along his collarbone—remnants of battles fought long before she had entered his life. A small smile tugged at her lips. This man, this powerful Lycan chairman, was hers.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. Beatrice’s name flashed across the screen.

Beatrice: Girl, where are you? You were supposed to meet me for coffee an hour ago!

Lillian winced. She had completely forgotten.

Lillian: Sorry! Overslept. Meet you at The Velvet Bean in 30?

She slipped out of bed, careful not to wake Sebastian. The penthouse was eerily quiet, save for the distant hum of the city below. As she padded toward the walk-in closet, her bare feet sank into the plush carpet.

The closet was a masterpiece—rows of designer dresses, tailored suits, and shelves of Italian leather shoes. Lillian reached for a simple emerald-green wrap dress, one that hugged her curves without being too flashy.

A deep voice rumbled behind her. “Going somewhere?”

She turned to find Sebastian leaning against the doorframe, arms crossed, his dark eyes glinting with amusement.

“Coffee with Beatrice,” she said, fastening the dress behind her neck. “I promised her ages ago.”

He stepped closer, his fingers brushing the exposed skin of her back. “You could stay.”

The heat in his voice sent a shiver down her spine.

Lillian laughed, swatting his hand away. “If I stay, we both know coffee won’t be the only thing I’m late for.”

Sebastian smirked but let her go. “Fine. But I’m picking you up afterward. We have that meeting with Alpha Maximilian at three.”

Her stomach twisted. The rivalry between Sebastian and Maximilian Voss was legendary—two Lycan alphas vying for dominance in the business world. And now, she was caught in the middle.

“Do I have to go?” she groaned.

Sebastian’s expression hardened. “He’s been sniffing around our territory. I want him to see exactly who holds my loyalty.”

Lillian sighed. “Fine. But if he tries to pull any shady business tactics—”

“Then we remind him why the Blackwood name is feared,” Sebastian finished, his voice edged with steel.

She kissed him quickly before grabbing her purse. “Try not to burn down the city before I get back.”

His low chuckle followed her out the door.

The Velvet Bean was packed, the scent of roasted coffee beans and cinnamon thick in the air. Beatrice waved from a corner booth, her auburn curls bouncing as she gestured dramatically.

“Finally!” she huffed as Lillian slid into the seat opposite her. “I was starting to think Sebastian had you locked in a dungeon.”

Lillian rolled her eyes. “Please. If anything, I’m the one who keeps him distracted.”

Beatrice waggled her eyebrows. “Oh, I bet you do.”

A server appeared, setting down two caramel macchiatos. Lillian took a sip, savoring the sweetness.

“So,” Beatrice leaned in, lowering her voice. “Any updates on the Evelyn situation?”

Lillian’s grip tightened around her cup. Evelyn—Donovan’s new mate—had been making subtle jabs at her in public, trying to provoke a reaction.

“She’s harmless,” Lillian said, though the lie tasted bitter. “Just desperate for attention.”

Beatrice snorted. “Right. And I’m the Queen of England.”

Before Lillian could respond, the café door swung open. A familiar, unwelcome figure strode in—Evelyn herself, flanked by two smug-looking she-wolves from her pack.

Their eyes locked.

Evelyn’s lips curled into a smirk.

Perfect.

Lillian exhaled slowly. “Looks like coffee just got more interesting.”

The faintest trace of Lillian's scent teased my senses moments ago. I hadn't had the chance to speak with her all day—pack business had kept me swamped. I'd instructed Victoria to message her about rescheduling the tutoring session, then canceled it entirely when the film crew demanded the space for their meeting. They needed to inspect the training grounds for their production.

I assumed Frederick would have taken her straight home after classes, so catching her scent here surprised me. I nearly excused myself to check, but Damien wouldn’t stop talking, his words a relentless drone in my ear. Worse, Celeste clung to my arm like ivy, her fingers possessive. Every time I tried to subtly shake her off, she only tightened her grip. My wolf bristled at her touch, a low growl vibrating in my skull the entire time she sat beside me.

I had to suppress him before he did something reckless.

The moment the agonizing meeting ended—hours later—I was the first out of my seat. My fingers brushed against my phone, ready to call Lillian, when Damien's voice cut through the hallway.

"Alpha Sebastian," he called, halting me mid-step.

I exhaled sharply, schooling my expression before turning. "Yes?"

His smile was too bright. "I was thinking—why not take Celeste to dinner tonight? She could use a break from the crew. Some fresh air, good food..."

I arched a brow. "And why would I do that?"

Damien’s expression softened. "She’s not eating. Losing weight. You know how models are—obsessed with perfection. But I worry. If she were my sister, Colette, I’d want someone to step in." He hesitated. "She admires you. Maybe you could... encourage her."

My jaw tightened. As Lycan Chairman, I couldn’t exactly refuse a plea like that.

"Fine," I muttered. "One dinner."

Damien beamed.

"Perfect," Sebastian murmured, rubbing his palms together with satisfaction. "I'll inform her immediately. My gratitude, Alpha." He gave a respectful bow before turning on his heel to deliver the news to Celeste in the parlor.

Sighing, I checked the time—it seemed my plans to visit the estate tonight were ruined.

I snatched my phone and pulled up Lillian's contact. My thumb hovered over the call button before pressing it. The phone rang once, twice, then silence. No answer.

Frowning, I ended the call before it could redirect to voicemail. A text would have to do.

Me: Hey, sorry, something came up. Can’t make it tonight. I’ll stop by tomorrow instead. Hope you’re doing okay.

I reread the message, lips pressed thin. It wasn’t ideal, but it would have to suffice. I hit send and waited.

Minutes passed.

Finally, a single emoji appeared—a thumbs-up.

My brows knit together.

Was she upset?

"Oh, hey Dad," Victoria called as she descended the staircase, her voice light. "Everything alright?"

"Yeah," I muttered, still staring at my screen. Shaking off the thought of Lillian being angry, I glanced up at my daughter. "Did you see Lillian earlier?"

Victoria hesitated, her teeth catching her lower lip. "Yeah, she was here," she admitted softly. "But she wasn’t feeling well, so she left."

My frown deepened. She had been fine this morning. What could have happened so suddenly?

"I thought I told you to let her know tutoring was canceled?" I reminded her, my tone sharper than intended.

Victoria’s eyes flickered away. "I—I forgot."

A beat of silence stretched between us.

Something wasn’t adding up.

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the Blackwood estate as Lillian stirred awake. Her limbs tangled with Sebastian's beneath the silk sheets, his possessive arm still draped over her waist even in sleep. The scent of bergamot and cedar clung to his skin, a comforting reminder of their passionate night.

A sharp knock shattered the peaceful moment.

"Alpha Blackwood?" Marcus Grayson's urgent voice carried through the mahogany door. "We have a situation at the eastern border."

Sebastian's eyes snapped open, instantly alert. "Report."

"Intruders from the Voss pack. They've crossed the boundary line near the old mill."

Lillian felt Sebastian's muscles tense beneath her fingertips. The Voss pack had been testing their borders for weeks, but this was the first outright violation since their mating ceremony.

"Sound the alert. I want all gammas mobilized in five minutes." Sebastian rolled from bed with predatory grace, already reaching for his combat gear.

Lillian scrambled up, her bare feet hitting the cold marble floor. "I'm coming with you."

Sebastian paused mid-motion, his silver eyes flashing dangerously. "Absolutely not."

"That's my pack too now," she countered, yanking open the wardrobe. Her fingers closed around the leather armor Sebastian had commissioned for her last month. "I won't sit here like some helpless—"

A pained cry from downstairs cut her off. Oliver's voice.

They moved as one, bursting into the hallway to find seven-year-old Oliver clutching his arm, tears streaming down his face. Victoria knelt beside him, her usually perfect blonde hair in disarray.

"He fell from the balcony," Victoria gasped, her hands fluttering uselessly over Oliver's twisted limb. "I told him not to climb but he never listens—"

Sebastian scooped up his son with surprising gentleness. "Marcus, take Lillian to the safe room. Victoria, fetch Dr. Langford."

Lillian opened her mouth to protest when the ground trembled beneath them. Distant explosions echoed from the east.

The attack had begun.

###Chapter 191 

"Oh, sorry, Dad. I thought you said that session was only moved," Victoria murmured, her fingers nervously twisting the hem of her sweater. "I told her the session had been rescheduled. But when she arrived, she said she wasn’t feeling well and left. That’s all I know..."

A cold knot formed in my stomach, but Victoria had no reason to lie to me. I forced a nod. "Alright," I said quietly. "Thanks. I’m having dinner with Celeste tonight, so I won’t be back until later."

"Of course, Dad," Victoria replied, her eyes brightening with mischief. "Have fun!"

I brushed past her and headed upstairs to change. Within the hour, we were ready to leave. Celeste had transformed into a vision in a deep crimson dress that clung to her slender frame, accentuating every curve. The deliberate display irritated me more than I cared to admit.

Before leaving, I shot Lillian another text, telling her I hoped she felt better and to call if she needed anything. I wouldn’t mind dropping by with medicine or food—but the message remained unanswered, tightening the unease in my chest.

I shouldn’t be this concerned about her. It wasn’t like me. Yet, even as I sat across from Celeste in the dimly lit restaurant, Lillian’s absence gnawed at me.

"Alpha Sebastian, you seem distracted," Celeste remarked, swirling her wineglass with elegant fingers. She took a slow sip, her gaze sharp. "Everything alright?"

"Just a lot on my mind," I muttered, mirroring her gesture. "Work has been overwhelming lately."

"I completely understand," she purred, fluttering her lashes. "I’ve been swamped too. But it’s lovely to escape for a while, isn’t it? Thank you for bringing me here. This place is exquisite—just what I needed. And I’m sure you needed the break too, being such a busy Lycan."

I nodded absently.

"It’s good to step away from work for once," I lied.

In reality, this dinner felt like another obligation—one far more tedious than my usual duties. But voicing that would only complicate things, so I kept the truth to myself. She seemed satisfied, relaxing into her seat with a pleased smile.

"I’m so glad you feel that way," she murmured, reaching across the table to brush her fingers over my wrist. "Because I was hoping we could spend more time together."

I withdrew my hand subtly and leaned back, taking another sip of wine.

"Free time is rare for me," I said flatly. "I can’t promise anything."

"I’m busy too," she admitted, undeterred. "But I’d make time for you. Tonight has been wonderful, and I think you’ve enjoyed yourself as well. We could have a little fun, get to know each other better. Two overworked souls finding solace in each other’s company."

Before I could respond, the waiter arrived with our meals. The conversation died there, replaced by the clink of silverware against porcelain. I prayed she’d let it go—but as we exited the restaurant, she seized my hand, her grip firm.

"I don’t want the night to end," she whispered, pressing closer until her body brushed against mine. "How about a walk under the stars? It’s been ages since I’ve been on a proper date, and—"

I stepped back, forcing her to release me.

"This wasn’t a date, Celeste," I said, sharper than intended. "I’m sorry if you misunderstood, but—"

"Of course not," she cut in smoothly, though her smile faltered. "But I’d hoped it might become one. I’m not blind, Sebastian. I knew this wasn’t a date when we started, but there’s clearly something between us."

"At best, this was a casual outing," I said, my frown deepening.

She opened her mouth to argue—but a sudden flash of light silenced her. We turned to find two photographers aiming their lenses at us.

"Celeste Devereaux! Are you and Alpha Blackwood dating?"
"Celeste, who designed that stunning dress?"
"Is this a romantic relationship, or just friendship?"

Celeste froze, as did I. I expected her to shut it down, to reiterate what we’d just discussed—so when she suddenly wrapped her arms around my neck, I barely had time to react.

She flashed the cameras a dazzling smile, winked—and then kissed me.

###Chapter 192

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine and dew as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s sprawling estate. The sun had barely risen, casting a golden hue over the dense forest that bordered the property. She tightened the silk robe around her, the fabric whispering against her skin as she inhaled deeply.

Last night’s confrontation with Donovan still weighed heavily on her mind. His betrayal had been sharp, but the way Sebastian had stepped in—his dominance, his unyielding protection—had left her pulse racing in a way she hadn’t expected.

A soft knock at the door pulled her from her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, turning just as the door creaked open.

It was Evelyn, Donovan’s new mate, her expression unreadable as she lingered in the doorway. "We need to talk," she said, her voice steady but laced with something Lillian couldn’t quite place.

Lillian arched a brow. "About?"

Evelyn stepped inside, closing the door behind her. "Donovan isn’t who you think he is."

A bitter laugh escaped Lillian’s lips. "Oh, I think I know exactly who he is now."

Evelyn shook her head, her fingers twisting the hem of her sweater. "No. There’s more. He’s been working with Alpha Harrison—plotting against Sebastian."

Lillian’s breath hitched. "What?"

Evelyn’s gaze flickered to the window, as if ensuring they weren’t overheard. "He’s been feeding them information. About you. About Sebastian’s pack. Everything."

The revelation struck like a physical blow. Lillian’s fingers curled into fists, her nails biting into her palms. "Why are you telling me this?"

Evelyn hesitated, then exhaled sharply. "Because I’m done being his pawn. And if you’re smart, you’ll warn Sebastian before it’s too late."

Before Lillian could respond, Evelyn turned and slipped out the door, leaving her standing there, heart pounding.

She needed to find Sebastian. Now.

Downstairs, the mansion was already alive with activity. Servants moved with quiet efficiency, and the scent of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the rich aroma of breakfast. Lillian barely registered any of it as she strode through the halls, her mind racing.

She found Sebastian in his study, his broad shoulders tense as he reviewed documents spread across his desk. The moment she entered, his head snapped up, his dark eyes locking onto hers with an intensity that sent a shiver down her spine.

"Lillian," he said, his voice low. "What’s wrong?"

She didn’t waste time. "Donovan’s working with Alpha Harrison. He’s been leaking information about your pack."

Sebastian’s expression darkened. "How do you know this?"

"Evelyn just told me."

A muscle in his jaw twitched. "And you trust her?"

Lillian hesitated. "I don’t know. But we can’t ignore it."

Sebastian pushed away from his desk, his movements deliberate as he rounded it to stand before her. "No, we can’t." His hand lifted, fingers brushing her cheek in a gesture so tender it made her breath catch. "Thank you for telling me."

The warmth of his touch lingered even as he pulled away, his demeanor shifting into that of the ruthless Lycan chairman she knew him to be. "Marcus," he called, his voice sharp.

The door opened almost instantly, and Marcus Grayson stepped inside, his posture rigid. "Sir?"

Sebastian’s gaze never left Lillian’s. "We have a problem."

And just like that, the game had changed.

###Chapter 193

"Yes," I rasped, my voice barely above a whisper.

"Good luck, and remember—take a deep breath. Don’t jump to conclusions. Let him explain first before you react. Update me on everything tomorrow."

"I will," I promised before ending the call.

I set my phone on the nightstand, plugged it in, and turned to face him. Sebastian still stood in the doorway, his dark eyes narrowed as he studied me.

"Victoria said you weren’t feeling well," he murmured. "You were fine this morning."

I nodded, swiping at my cheeks again, praying he wouldn’t notice the tear stains or the redness in my eyes. I hated how vulnerable I became around him, but I couldn’t help it.

"Yeah, just a little off," I lied. "Probably something I ate."

"Was it Lucien’s cooking?" His jaw tightened. "I’ll fire him—"

"No!" I cut in quickly. "Don’t. It wasn’t him. It was something from school, that’s all."

He looked almost disappointed. I knew he’d been itching to get rid of Lucien—the chef had always rubbed him the wrong way—but I wouldn’t let him. Lucien was one of the few people here who made me feel less alone. Between him and Giselle, this place had started to feel like home.

At least, it had—until I saw that photo of Sebastian and Celeste.

The nausea twisted in my gut again, and I dropped my gaze to my lap, willing the tears back.

"How was your date?" The bitterness in my tone was impossible to mask.

"It wasn’t a date," he said sharply. "Just dinner. Damien thought it would be good for me to take her out, and—" He paused, frowning. "Wait. I didn’t mention it in my texts. How did you know?"

My cheeks burned. I had nothing to be ashamed of—I hadn’t asked Victoria to send me that photo. But she had, captioned: Father’s first real date in years! Don’t they look perfect together?

My stomach had lurched the second I saw it. Celeste, draped in a shimmering red gown, pressed against Sebastian in his tailored suit. He was dressed more casually now, and I couldn’t stop wondering—had she helped him out of that jacket?

"Victoria sent a picture," I admitted. "She wanted me to see how lovely you two looked."

His eyes darkened with fury, and I shivered under the intensity of his glare.

"I’ll be having a word with her about that," he muttered. "But it wasn’t a date."

I nodded, wanting to believe him.

He stepped closer to the bed.

"Still feeling sick?"

I nodded again—because I was sick, just not from food.

"I’ll make you tea." Before I could protest, he was gone.

I sighed, leaning back against the pillows, frustration and hurt tangling inside me.

When Sebastian returned, he handed me a steaming mug—prepared exactly how I liked it. The fact that he remembered something so small surprised me. I murmured my thanks and sipped in silence while he watched me.

We didn’t speak for the rest of the night. I didn’t expect him to stay, but he did.

He slept beside me like it was the most natural thing in the world.

When I woke the next morning, the bed was empty—but the sound of running water from the bathroom told me he was still here. He hadn’t left.

A flicker of hope sparked in my chest. He’d come straight back after his not-a-date and stayed the night, thinking I was ill. He’d made me tea, tended to me—and hadn’t tried anything. Maybe he did care.

Then I saw my phone. Beatrice had called—and texted.

Frowning, I opened the message. My heart plummeted.

Beatrice: Whatever you do, DON’T check the internet today! Please!!

Dread coiled in my stomach. I had to know.

I pulled up the news.

The headline hit me like a punch to the gut.

CELESTE DEVEREAUX SPOTTED WITH NEW BOYFRIEND, SEBASTIAN BLACKWOOD!

Tears welled before I could stop them. I clicked the link—and there it was.

Sebastian and Celeste.

Kissing.

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains of Lillian’s bedroom, stirring her awake. She stretched lazily, her muscles still sore from yesterday’s training session with Professor Montclair. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted up from the kitchen, signaling that Giselle, the head maid, was already at work.

Lillian’s phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Beatrice lit up the screen: "Meet me at the café in an hour. Big news!"

Curious, Lillian dressed quickly, opting for a simple sundress and sandals. As she descended the grand staircase of Sebastian Blackwood’s mansion, she nearly collided with Oliver, his seven-year-old son, who was racing down the hall with a toy sword.

"Watch where you’re going, Lillian!" Oliver giggled, dodging past her.

She chuckled, shaking her head. "You’re going to give your father a heart attack one of these days."

In the dining room, Sebastian sat at the head of the table, engrossed in a stack of documents. His sharp blue eyes flicked up as she entered. "Morning," he murmured, his deep voice sending a shiver down her spine.

"Morning," she replied, pouring herself a cup of coffee. "Beatrice wants to meet. Says she has news."

Sebastian arched a brow. "Hopefully nothing involving another reckless scheme."

Lillian smirked. "With Beatrice, it’s always a gamble."

The campus café was bustling when Lillian arrived. Beatrice waved her over from a corner table, her face alight with excitement. Gabrielle, the barista, slid a caramel latte toward Lillian with a knowing smile.

"You’re never going to believe this," Beatrice whispered, leaning in. "I overheard Cassandra talking to Professor Sinclair. They’re planning something—something big."

Lillian’s grip tightened around her cup. "What kind of something?"

Beatrice’s eyes gleamed. "Something involving Donovan and Evelyn. They’re trying to sabotage your position in the pack."

A cold knot formed in Lillian’s stomach. She had hoped Donovan would move on after their broken bond, but it seemed he was still determined to make her life difficult.

Before she could respond, her phone buzzed again. A message from Marcus Grayson, Sebastian’s beta: "Emergency meeting at the pack house. Now."

Lillian exhaled sharply. "Duty calls."

Beatrice squeezed her hand. "Be careful."

The pack house was tense when Lillian arrived. Sebastian stood at the head of the room, his expression unreadable. Marcus and Julian Mercer, the head gamma, flanked him, their postures rigid.

"We have a problem," Sebastian announced. "Alpha Maximilian Voss has challenged our territory rights. He’s gathering allies."

Murmurs broke out among the pack members. Lillian’s pulse quickened. A territorial dispute could mean war.

Sebastian’s gaze locked onto hers. "Lillian, I need you to stay close. Things are about to get dangerous."

She nodded, her mind racing. Between Donovan’s scheming and now this, the stakes had never been higher.

As the meeting adjourned, Sebastian pulled her aside. His voice was low, urgent. "Trust no one outside this pack. Understood?"

Lillian swallowed hard. "Understood."

But as she walked away, one thought consumed her: What if the enemy is already among us?

I recoiled from her instantly, wiping my mouth with the back of my hand, disgust curling in my gut. What the hell just happened?

Celeste’s face flushed crimson at my blatant rejection. My gaze snapped to the paparazzi lingering nearby, their cameras still poised. The moment my eyes locked onto them, they flinched, sensing the storm brewing beneath my skin.

"Leave," I snarled, my voice laced with the growl of my wolf, "before I tear your throats out."

The threat wasn’t empty. My vision sharpened, the gold of my wolf bleeding into my irises. The photographers trembled, muttering hasty apologies before scattering like roaches.

But the fury didn’t leave me. My muscles were locked tight, my jaw clenched so hard it ached. I mindlinked Marcus. Pick us up. Now.

All I wanted was to dump Celeste at the villa and get back to Lillian. I needed to see her, to make sure she was okay.

A tentative touch brushed my back. I stiffened, my wolf snarling violently in my mind. I barely restrained him before he lashed out.

"Don’t. Touch. Me." I jerked away, my voice a blade of ice.

"Sebastian—"

"It’s Alpha," I snapped, turning on her with a glare that could melt steel. "You crossed a line tonight, Celeste. That was unacceptable."

Her lips parted, feigning innocence. "I—I’m sorry. I just needed to shut them up. They wouldn’t stop until we gave them something."

"I shut them down just fine without lying." My voice was a low, dangerous rumble.

She laughed, a bitter, mocking sound. "You think that’s the end of it? They’re not done with us yet."

"We are done." The car pulled up, Marcus behind the wheel. "Get in. And if you breathe a word of this to anyone—"

Celeste smiled, slow and knowing. "Oh, I won’t have to. By tomorrow, everyone will be talking about it."

I ignored her cryptic remark, sliding into the front seat while she took the back. The farther she was from me, the better. My thoughts were consumed by one thing: Lillian.

Lillian’s POV

"Maybe it doesn’t mean anything," Beatrice said over the phone.

I curled tighter into myself, my pillow damp with tears. Why was I reacting like this? I didn’t even know the full story.

But the image burned behind my eyelids—Sebastian and Celeste, lips locked, the cameras flashing.

I wasn’t his mate. I had no claim over him.

So why did it feel like my heart had been ripped out?

Lucien had flirted with me before, and I hadn’t spiraled like this.

But Sebastian... he was different.

And that terrified me.

Then why does it feel like my soul has been shredded into pieces? Why is my wolf howling in agony, as if mourning a profound loss? These emotions are overwhelming, and I don’t know how to make sense of them.

"I don’t know," I whispered hoarsely. "I’m exhausted, and seeing them together earlier… it tore me apart, Beatrice."

"Why would Victoria show you that?" Beatrice snapped, her voice laced with bitterness. "She knew you had feelings for him, didn’t she?"

"I’m not sure if she knew for certain… but I thought she at least suspected," I admitted softly. Fresh tears welled up, but I forced them back, swallowing the lump in my throat. "She’s been acting so distant lately. Something’s off, and I don’t think she wants to be friends anymore."

"Good," Beatrice said firmly. "You shouldn’t stay friends with the woman who stole your ex’s affection anyway."

"She didn’t know she was the other woman. I can’t blame her for what Donovan did. We were both deceived. The only difference is, I know I was betrayed—Victoria doesn’t. I pity her… I want to keep our friendship, but she’s been avoiding me, acting like a stranger."

"Don’t waste your energy on her. If Sebastian truly cares about you, he won’t entertain this girl. Trust me," she reassured gently.

"That’s the problem, Beatrice," I murmured, my voice barely audible. "I don’t know if he does care, or if this is just… physical." Silence stretched between us for a long moment.

"Maybe you should talk to him?" she suggested carefully. "You’re drowning in confusion, and living under his roof won’t help if you don’t get answers."

I opened my mouth to respond, but the bedroom door creaked open. Sebastian stood in the doorway, his broad frame silhouetted against the dim hallway light. My pulse skyrocketed. It was late, and I hadn’t expected him tonight. Mortification burned through me—he was seeing me like this, my face swollen from crying, my eyes red and raw. I turned away hastily, swiping at my cheeks before he could notice.

"Beatrice, I’ll call you tomorrow," I whispered urgently.

"Did he just walk in?" she asked, curiosity lacing her tone. She knew me too well.

###Chapter 194

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the campus grounds, her boots crunching against the gravel path. The morning sun cast golden streaks through the trees, illuminating the bustling quad where students hurried to their classes.

She adjusted the strap of her backpack, her thoughts still tangled from last night’s encounter with Donovan. His cold dismissal had stung more than she cared to admit, but she refused to let it drag her down. Not today.

"Lillian!" Beatrice’s voice cut through the chatter, and Lillian turned to see her best friend jogging toward her, her dark curls bouncing with each step.

"You look like you’ve been wrestling with a ghost," Beatrice teased, falling into step beside her.

Lillian rolled her eyes. "More like wrestling with my own stupidity."

Beatrice arched a brow. "Donovan again?"

Lillian exhaled sharply. "He was at the bar last night. With Evelyn."

Beatrice winced. "Ouch."

"Yeah." Lillian clenched her fists, then forced herself to relax. "But I’m done letting him dictate my mood. I have bigger things to worry about."

Like the upcoming combat trials. Professor Montclair had announced a surprise evaluation, and Lillian wasn’t about to let her personal drama ruin her chances.

As they rounded the corner toward the lecture hall, a familiar figure leaned against the brick wall, his arms crossed. Sebastian Blackwood.

Lillian’s pulse spiked.

He pushed off the wall, his dark eyes locking onto hers. "We need to talk."

Beatrice shot Lillian a knowing smirk before nudging her forward. "Good luck with that."

Lillian swallowed hard as Sebastian closed the distance between them. His presence was overwhelming—tall, commanding, with an aura that made the air around him hum with tension.

"What is it?" she asked, keeping her voice steady.

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "You’ve been avoiding me."

She had. After their last heated argument, she’d thrown herself into training, desperate for distance.

"I’ve been busy," she deflected.

His gaze bore into hers, unrelenting. "Busy or not, we have unfinished business."

Lillian’s breath hitched. "What kind of business?"

A slow, dangerous smile curved his lips. "The kind that starts with you admitting you’re mine."

Her heart hammered. This wasn’t just about rivalry or pack politics anymore. This was something deeper, something primal.

And she wasn’t sure she was ready to face it.

But Sebastian wasn’t giving her a choice.

He stepped closer, his voice dropping to a growl. "Run all you want, Lillian. But I always catch what’s mine."

The challenge in his eyes sent a shiver down her spine.

Game on.

In the span of a single heartbeat, my world shattered. Sebastian Blackwood had lied to me. He had taken Celeste Devereaux out on a date—kissed her—and the proof was splashed across the latest gossip column. The realization burned through me, leaving me feeling like the biggest fool alive.

Hadn’t Donovan taught me anything? Trust was a luxury I couldn’t afford. Everyone betrayed me eventually. Even Ellian, my supposed fated mate, had turned his back on me. And now Sebastian? The shower shut off, and I bolted upright, scrambling for my jeans and a T-shirt. I needed to get out before he emerged from the bathroom. If I had to face him now, I’d explode.

My wolf howled in despair, her fury matching mine. What was wrong with me? Why did I keep falling for the same traps? Just as my fingers brushed the doorknob, the bathroom door swung open.

Sebastian stepped out, a towel slung low around his hips. Water glistened on his sculpted chest, trailing down in rivulets that disappeared beneath the fabric. My traitorous gaze lingered, my pulse stuttering. Even now, he had this effect on me.

His lips curved in amusement as he caught me staring. My cheeks flamed—not from embarrassment, but from sheer, unbridled rage. I turned to leave, but his voice stopped me cold.

"Going somewhere?" He glanced at the clock. "You don’t have classes for hours. I thought we could—" His words died when he saw the storm in my eyes.

"So that’s why you stayed last night?" I hissed. "Didn’t get enough with Celeste? Needed to check me off your list too?"

His expression darkened. "What the hell are you talking about?"

"Don’t play dumb!" I snapped, my voice trembling. "I saw the photos, Sebastian. You took her out. You kissed her. And then you came here and lied to my face!"

A low growl rumbled in his chest as he closed the distance between us. "Watch your tone," he warned, his voice lethally soft. "Remember who you’re speaking to."

I let out a bitter laugh. "Oh, I know exactly who you are. A liar. Just like the rest of them."

His eyes flashed gold, his wolf surging forward. "Explain this tantrum. Now."

"Still pretending?" I yanked out my phone and shoved the headline in his face.

His breath hitched as he took in the damning photo. For once, the great Sebastian Blackwood was speechless.

"Going to tell me it wasn’t a date?" I spat.

I turned to leave, but his hand clamped around my wrist, stopping me dead. It wasn’t painful—just firm. But it was enough to trigger my fight instinct. I whirled and slapped him hard across the face.

The crack echoed in the room. His head barely moved, but my palm stung like hell. Still, the satisfaction was worth it.

"You’re acting like a child," he gritted out. "Calm down before you go anywhere."

"Embarrassing you, Alpha?" I mocked, dipping into a sarcastic bow. "My apologies." I yanked my arm free. "Don’t touch me."

He grabbed me again, slamming me against the wall. His wolf surged, his control fraying. For a second, I thought he’d tear into me. But then he buried his face in the curve of my neck, inhaling deeply. A shuddering breath escaped him, and against my will, my body relaxed.

His nearness sent a traitorous heat through me, my wolf responding despite my fury. The anger flickered, threatening to dissolve under his touch.

Damn him. Damn both of us.

###Chapter 195

The morning sun filtered through the heavy velvet curtains of the Blackwood estate, casting golden streaks across Lillian's face as she stirred awake. Her body ached from yesterday's intense training session with Marcus, but the warmth of Sebastian's arm draped protectively over her waist made the discomfort fade into the background.

"Morning, sweetheart," Sebastian murmured, his deep voice still rough with sleep. His fingers traced lazy circles on her bare shoulder, sending pleasant shivers down her spine.

Lillian turned in his embrace, meeting those piercing amber eyes that never failed to make her heart race. "You're awake early," she observed, noticing the alertness in his gaze despite the early hour.

Sebastian's lips curved into that devastating smirk she adored. "Couldn't sleep. Too busy thinking about how you nearly took down Marcus yesterday." His thumb brushed against her lower lip. "My fierce little wolf."

A knock at the door interrupted their moment. "Alpha Blackwood?" Theodore's crisp voice came through the wood. "Your nine o'clock meeting has been moved up. Alpha Voss arrived earlier than expected."

Sebastian's entire demeanor shifted instantly, the warmth in his eyes hardening into cold calculation. "Tell him I'll be down in fifteen minutes."

As Theodore's footsteps retreated, Lillian sat up, the sheets pooling around her waist. "Maximilian Voss? Here?" Her fingers tightened involuntarily on the bedding. The rival Lycan chairman's sudden appearance couldn't mean anything good.

Sebastian was already moving with that predatory grace of his, pulling on his tailored dress shirt with quick, efficient movements. "Stay here," he instructed, buttoning his cuffs. "I'll handle this."

But Lillian was already out of bed, reaching for her robe. "Like hell I will." She met his surprised look with a stubborn tilt of her chin. "If this involves pack business, it involves me too. I'm your mate, remember?"

For a moment, Sebastian looked like he might argue. Then that proud, approving gleam entered his eyes that always made Lillian's stomach flutter. "Five minutes," he conceded. "And wear the black dress from Genevieve's collection. We need to make an impression."

Downstairs in the grand study, the air was thick with tension. Maximilian Voss stood by the fireplace, his imposing frame clad in an impeccably cut navy suit that did nothing to soften his dangerous aura. His beta, Benedict Grayson, stood at attention behind him like a shadow.

"Sebastian," Maximilian greeted with false warmth, his sharp gaze immediately flicking to Lillian as she entered. "And this must be the famous Lillian. My daughter Arabella has told me so much about you."

Lillian forced a polite smile, her fingers tightening slightly around Sebastian's arm. "All good things, I hope."

Maximilian's chuckle held an edge. "Oh, quite. She was particularly impressed by your... unique fighting style during the last inter-pack competition."

Before the conversation could continue, the door burst open and Oliver came running in, his small face alight with excitement. "Papa! I finished my—" He skidded to a halt upon seeing the visitors, his eyes going wide.

Sebastian's expression softened imperceptibly as he placed a hand on his son's shoulder. "Oliver, this is Alpha Voss. Say hello properly."

Oliver straightened immediately, his little shoulders squaring in perfect imitation of his father's posture. "Good morning, Alpha Voss," he said with surprising composure for a seven-year-old.

Maximilian studied the boy with an unreadable expression. "Your heir shows remarkable poise, Sebastian. He'll make a fine alpha one day."

The compliment sounded genuine, but Lillian didn't miss the calculating gleam in the older alpha's eyes as he looked between Oliver and herself. She instinctively stepped closer to the boy, her protective instincts flaring.

Sebastian smoothly redirected the conversation. "You didn't come all this way to discuss my son's manners, Maximilian. What do you want?"

The pleasant mask slipped, revealing the ruthless predator beneath. "The northern territories," Maximilian said bluntly. "I'm here to make you an offer you'd be foolish to refuse."

Lillian felt the shift in Sebastian's energy before she saw it—the subtle tension coiling through his muscles, the way his fingers flexed slightly at his sides. This was no social call. This was a challenge.

And as Maximilian's gaze locked onto hers with unsettling intensity, Lillian realized with sudden clarity—she wasn't just a bystander in this game of power. She'd become a key player.

And the real game was only just beginning.

"Don't push me, Lillian," Sebastian murmured against my skin, his lips tracing a slow, deliberate path along the nape of my neck, his tongue flicking out to taste me. A shudder ran through me as he pinned me between his hard body and the wall, his dominance undeniable. "I'm not in the mood for games."

I didn’t know what to say—words failed me. But my body? It had a will of its own. Without thinking, I hooked one leg around his waist, grinding against him shamelessly, like a she-wolf in heat. The moment I felt him harden beneath me, a thrill shot through my veins, spurring me to move faster, to see just how far I could push him.

A low, possessive growl rumbled from his chest before his mouth crashed down on mine, kissing me as if he’d been starved for the taste of me. And gods, I hadn’t realized how much I needed this—needed him—until that moment. Clothes were torn away in desperate haste, fabric pooling at our feet until nothing separated us.

Naked and trembling beneath him, I surrendered completely, my earlier anger forgotten in the haze of desire. My heart pounded wildly, each beat echoing the frantic rhythm of his thrusts as he lifted me effortlessly, my legs locking around his waist. The moment he filled me, a breathless moan tore from my lips, his name spilling from me like a prayer.

He nipped at my bottom lip, his thrusts deep and relentless, his mouth trailing down my throat in a series of teasing bites—just hard enough to send shivers through me but not enough to leave a mark.

Then he carried me to the bed, his hands and mouth claiming every inch of me, leaving no part untouched. I arched beneath him, fingers tangled in his dark hair as he drove me higher, pleasure building until rational thought was obliterated. Whatever argument we’d had earlier? Gone. All that existed was this—the heat, the hunger, the raw need between us.

Some might call me reckless. But in this moment, I didn’t care.

When he finally pushed me over the edge, my scream of his name was met with a feral growl—his control slipping, his wolf surging forward. His canines elongated, and my breath caught at the sight. Instinctively, my own wolf stirred, a primal urge to bare my neck to him rising within me. But I held her back, confused by the intensity of the reaction.

Sebastian barely restrained himself, his wolf receding with a frustrated snarl as he reached his own climax. The sound was almost pained, as if the beast inside him fought against submission.

Afterward, we lay there, chests heaving, the air thick with unspoken tension. He pulled away abruptly, putting distance between us as if burned. Neither of us spoke. Neither of us dared to look at the other.

"I should go," he muttered, already rising from the bed. "I have business to attend to. But I’ll see you at the villa later."

I nodded numbly, watching as he dressed with swift, almost agitated movements. He barely glanced at me before leaving, the door clicking shut behind him with finality.

Alone, my mind raced.

Had he almost marked me?

At school, I confided in Beatrice, who rolled her eyes and called me an idiot for letting lust override my anger. But she was relieved it hadn’t ruined my day. Truthfully, I hadn’t given Celeste or that kiss a second thought since this morning.

No—my thoughts were consumed by one thing:

Sebastian Blackwood, and how close he’d come to losing control.


The thought sent shivers down my spine, though I couldn't comprehend why. My wolf's reaction to Sebastian's primal instincts both confused and electrified me. Shaking my head, I pushed the unsettling thoughts aside. Right now, I needed to focus on my tutoring session with Oliver and act as if nothing unusual had occurred.

Arriving at Blackwood Manor that evening, I was startled by the unexpected commotion. A film crew had taken over the estate, their equipment and chatter filling the grand halls. Apparently, they were shooting scenes at Sebastian's residence, though the library remained undisturbed for our lessons.

After helping Oliver complete his assignments, we ventured outside for our usual sparring session. The training grounds, however, had been transformed into a movie set. My breath caught when I spotted Sebastian deep in conversation with Celeste Devereaux. The famous actress had her manicured hands all over him - smoothing his collar, adjusting his tie - while he stood motionless, permitting her intimate touches.

A savage growl erupted from my throat before I could stop it. Heat flooded my veins as my vision tinted red. The possessive fury shocked me with its intensity. Oliver's wide-eyed stare brought me back to reality, but the fire in my chest refused to die down. What was happening to me? And why did the sight of Celeste touching Sebastian make me want to rip her perfect face off?
###Chapter 196

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, illuminating the sleek marble floors. Lillian stretched beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming from the intensity of last night’s full moon. Beside her, Sebastian slept soundly, his muscular arm draped possessively over her waist.

She carefully slipped out of bed, not wanting to wake him. The events of the previous night replayed in her mind—the way he had claimed her beneath the silver glow of the moon, the raw power in his touch, the whispered promises that still sent shivers down her spine.

Padding barefoot to the ensuite bathroom, Lillian caught her reflection in the mirror. The mark on her neck—Sebastian’s claiming bite—stood out starkly against her skin. A thrill shot through her. She was his now, irrevocably.

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

“Miss Lillian?” Sophia’s voice floated through. “Breakfast is ready whenever you are.”

“Thank you, Sophia. I’ll be down shortly.”

She dressed quickly in a simple sundress, her movements light. The penthouse was quiet, save for the distant clinking of silverware from the dining room. When she entered, Oliver was already seated, swinging his legs as he munched on a stack of pancakes.

“Morning, Lillian!” he chirped, syrup smeared on his cheek.

She laughed, ruffling his hair. “Morning, trouble. Where’s your dad?”

“Still sleeping,” Oliver said, rolling his eyes. “He’s so lazy.”

Sebastian’s deep voice cut in from behind her. “I heard that.”

Lillian turned, her breath hitching as he strode into the room, dressed in a tailored suit that hugged his broad shoulders. His golden eyes locked onto hers, darkening with unspoken desire.

“Good morning,” he murmured, brushing a kiss against her temple.

Oliver groaned. “Ugh, gross.”

Sebastian smirked, taking his seat at the head of the table. “You’ll understand when you’re older.”

Theo, their head gamma, entered then, his expression serious. “Alpha, we have a situation.”

Sebastian’s playful demeanor vanished. “What is it?”

“Alpha Maximilian Voss has arrived at the border. He’s demanding an audience.”

Lillian’s stomach twisted. Maximilian was Sebastian’s biggest rival—a ruthless Lycan chairman who had made no secret of his disdain for their alliance.

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. “Tell him I’ll meet him in the conference room.”

Theo nodded and left.

Lillian reached for Sebastian’s hand. “What does he want?”

Sebastian’s grip was firm. “Nothing good.”

Oliver, sensing the tension, frowned. “Is everything okay?”

Sebastian forced a smile. “Of course. Eat your breakfast.”

But Lillian knew better.

Something was coming.

And it wasn’t going to be pretty.

I didn’t realize what I was doing until every pair of eyes in the room locked onto me. My wolf was seething, her fury boiling over at the sight of Celeste draped all over Sebastian. I could barely restrain her. She wanted to tear into flesh, and for the first time, I wasn’t sure I could hold her back completely. She had never reacted like this before, and I had to admit—it terrified me.

Then Oliver’s small hand curled around my wrist, and that was the only thing that grounded me. Even my wolf knew better than to lose control in front of a child. I sucked in a sharp breath, exhaling shakily. My gaze flicked to Sebastian’s, and the displeasure in his eyes was unmistakable. He murmured something to Celeste, who immediately stepped back, tucking her hands at her sides. Her eyes never left mine, sharp and assessing. She didn’t look happy either. The others? They were watching with barely concealed amusement, clearly entertained by the drama.

Before I could process anything, Sebastian was beside me, his grip iron-tight around my wrist as he dragged me toward the villa. I nearly tripped over my own feet, his anger radiating off him in suffocating waves. It made my pulse spike. I had never felt this kind of fury from him before—and knowing it was directed at me made it ten times worse.

When we were far enough from prying eyes, he finally released me, spinning to face me. His expression was stormy, jaw clenched.

"Is this arrangement too much for you?" His question hit me like a physical blow.

"W-what?" My voice wavered.

"Is this going to be a problem? Other women being near me?" His tone was icy. "Because if it is, we end this now. You can stay in the mansion, but we go back to being nothing more than employer and employee."

"I don’t know what happened," I blurted. "My wolf—she lost control for a second. But she’s fine now."

He studied me, silent for a long moment. Then, coldly: "You made a scene out there. You knew they were filming today. Didn’t Victoria inform you?"

Frowning, I pulled out my phone. No messages. Victoria had been distant lately, but would she really sabotage me like this? I bit my lip, hesitating.

"I must have missed it," I muttered, unwilling to throw her under the bus. The last thing I needed was to cause tension between Sebastian and his daughter.

He exhaled sharply. "I have damage control to do. If you’re going to act like a child, then leave. Take your tutoring sessions somewhere else."

His words stung, sharp as a slap. I stood frozen, watching him stride away, my chest tight.

A moment later, Oliver appeared at my side, his small face creased with concern. "Are you okay, Lillian?"

I swallowed hard, forcing a smile. "Yeah. Just… a bad moment."

But inside, my wolf was still restless, and I had no idea what that meant—or what it would cost me.

I didn't want Donovan to sense my unease, so I plastered on a smile and gave a quick nod.

"Sounds good," I replied. "How about we hit the villa's gym for some training today?" I suggested, forcing lightness into my tone.

He agreed, and we made our way to the back of the estate, stepping into the sleek, well-equipped gym. The next hour was spent pushing our limits—weights clanging, sweat dripping, breaths ragged. By the time we finished, exhaustion clung to us both, muscles trembling from exertion.

As I was leaving, my gaze caught Victoria emerging from the kitchen. She froze mid-step when she spotted me, her expression hardening instantly. The disapproval in her eyes was unmistakable.

"Why didn't you mention they were filming at the training grounds today?" I demanded, crossing my arms over my chest.

Her lips curled into a dismissive smirk. "Must've slipped my mind," she said with a careless shrug before turning toward the staircase.

My patience snapped. "Is there something going on between us, Victoria?" I called out, halting her retreat.

She paused, then turned back with an exaggerated tilt of her head. "Why would you think that?" Her voice dripped with false innocence, but the venom beneath was impossible to miss.

The realization hit me like a blow—she had been avoiding me. Worse, she was angry. But why? My pulse quickened, frustration heating my cheeks.

"What did I do to make you resent me?" I pressed, stepping closer. "I thought we were friends, but you're acting like anything but."

For a heartbeat, silence stretched between us. Then she let out a sharp, bitter laugh, spinning to face me fully. Her glare was glacial, sending an involuntary shiver down my spine.

"You want to know what's wrong?" she hissed, eyes flashing with something dangerous. "Let's start with the fact that you—"

###Chapter 197

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s estate. The sun had barely risen, casting a golden glow over the sprawling gardens below. She wrapped her arms around herself, the thin silk of her robe doing little to ward off the chill.

Last night’s confrontation with Donovan still weighed heavily on her mind. His betrayal had cut deeper than she cared to admit, but what stung more was the smug satisfaction in Evelyn’s eyes when she had clung to his arm.

A soft knock at the door pulled her from her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, turning just as Beatrice pushed the door open, balancing a tray of steaming coffee and pastries.

"You’re up early," Beatrice remarked, setting the tray on the small table near the balcony. "Couldn’t sleep?"

Lillian sighed, running a hand through her tousled hair. "Too much on my mind."

Beatrice poured her a cup of coffee, the rich aroma filling the space between them. "Donovan isn’t worth losing sleep over, you know."

"I know," Lillian murmured, taking the cup. "But it’s not just him. It’s everything—this whole mess with the pack, Sebastian’s responsibilities, Oliver’s safety…"

Beatrice gave her a knowing look. "You care about them."

Lillian hesitated before nodding. "More than I should."

A comfortable silence settled between them, broken only by the distant chirping of birds. Then, Beatrice’s phone buzzed. She glanced at the screen, her expression darkening.

"What is it?" Lillian asked.

Beatrice hesitated before answering. "It’s from Victoria. She’s demanding a meeting with Sebastian today."

Lillian’s grip tightened around her cup. "About what?"

Beatrice met her gaze. "She claims she has proof that you’re manipulating Sebastian for your own gain."

Lillian scoffed. "That’s ridiculous."

"Is it?" Beatrice arched a brow. "You’ve been spending a lot of time with him. People are talking."

Lillian set her cup down with a sharp clink. "Let them talk. I’m not doing anything wrong."

Beatrice sighed. "I believe you, but Victoria won’t stop until she gets what she wants. And right now, she wants you out of the picture."

Lillian’s jaw clenched. "Then let her try."

The determination in her voice surprised even herself. She had spent too long running, too long letting others dictate her life. If Victoria wanted a fight, she would give her one.

Beatrice smirked. "That’s the spirit. Just be careful—she plays dirty."

Lillian nodded, her mind already racing with possibilities. She wouldn’t back down. Not this time.

As the first rays of sunlight fully illuminated the estate, she felt a renewed sense of purpose. Whatever Victoria had planned, she would face it head-on.

And she wouldn’t be alone.

Sebastian’s deep voice echoed from the doorway. "Good. You’re both awake."

Lillian turned to see him leaning against the frame, his piercing gaze locked onto hers. "We have a problem."

She straightened. "Victoria."

His lips curled into a dangerous smile. "Exactly. And we’re going to handle it—together."

The challenge in his tone sent a thrill down her spine.

Game on.

"You dare speak of friendship?" Victoria snarled, closing the distance between us with predatory grace. Her voice dripped with venom. "You were the one who betrayed me from the start. You lied to my face, and now you have the audacity to act offended because I finally see through you? Pathetic. My father deserves better than to be manipulated by someone like you!"

A chill slithered down my spine.

"What are you talking about?" I forced the words out, though my throat tightened with guilt. "I never lied to you—"

Even as I said it, the weight of my deception pressed down on me. But there was no way Victoria could know the truth about Donovan and me... right? The wild fury burning in her eyes told me otherwise.

"You've been lying since the moment we met!" she hissed, her voice trembling with barely contained rage. "You swore nothing was happening between you and Donovan, but you deceived me, Lillian! You never told me you were his fated mate!"

My breath caught.

How did she find out? Panic clawed at my chest, leaving me speechless.

"Nothing to say now, is there?" she mocked, shaking her head, her expression twisting between disgust and pity. "Have you been sleeping with him this whole time? Is that why you kept quiet? Am I the fool here? Are you and Donovan still—"

"No!" I cut her off sharply. "Donovan and I are over."

"Don’t insult my intelligence," she spat, tears glistening in her eyes. "You don’t just walk away from a fated mate. It’s impossible. Either you did something unforgivable to drive him away, or you’re still tangled up in this sick game—using me to get close to my father. I don’t know what your endgame is, but it won’t work!"

"I’m not playing you, Victoria," I insisted, my own frustration rising. "I’m not the one you should be afraid of!"

"I can’t believe a single word out of your mouth!" she snapped, stepping so close I could feel the heat of her anger. "You’re a liar. I thought you were my friend, but that was just another lie. You were never my friend. You were scheming against my fiancé from the beginning. You wanted him for yourself!"

"Donovan isn’t the man you think he is," I pleaded, desperate to make her see the truth. "He’s the one you should be angry with—"

Tears streaked down her cheeks.

"No, you’re the mastermind here," she whispered, her voice breaking. "Donovan would never betray me like this."

Was she serious?

"Victoria—"

"Shut up!" she roared.

Before I could react, her fingers tangled in my hair, yanking me down with brutal force. The world tilted as I crashed to the ground, pain exploding through my skull.

And then—darkness.

I didn’t want to hurt her, even though I knew I could end this fight in seconds. My only goal was to protect myself, so I relied on my defensive instincts to dodge her wild swings.

The scene in the villa foyer was pure chaos—two girls shrieking, tangled in a pathetic mess on the marble floor. I couldn’t even imagine how ridiculous we must have looked.

Then, before I even saw him, I felt him.

Sebastian’s presence crashed over us like a tidal wave, his Alpha aura so potent it stole the breath from my lungs. Victoria barely flinched—probably because they shared the same bloodline, muting the full force of his dominance.

But for me?

It was agony.

A scream tore from my throat as my skull threatened to split open. The pressure forced me onto my knees, my nose dripping blood onto the pristine tiles.

"Victoria," Sebastian growled, his wolf simmering just beneath his skin. "Explain. Now."

"She betrayed me!" Victoria sobbed, her voice trembling. "She’s been with Donovan this whole time—she’s his fated mate!"

The crushing weight of Sebastian’s power lifted, and I gasped, finally able to breathe again. I didn’t dare move. My face was a wreck—blood smeared, tears I hadn’t even realized I’d shed streaking my cheeks.

"What did you just say?" Sebastian’s voice dropped dangerously low.

Victoria wiped her eyes, her voice thick with venom.

"I said she’s been sleeping with my fiancé!"

At that exact moment, the front door clicked shut.

All three of us turned.

And there he stood—wide-eyed, frozen in the doorway.

Donovan.

###Chapter 198

The morning sun filtered through the heavy drapes of Lillian's bedroom, casting golden streaks across the silk sheets. She stirred awake, her werewolf senses immediately alerting her to Sebastian's absence from their bed. The lingering scent of his cologne told her he hadn't been gone long.

Downstairs, the Blackwood mansion buzzed with unusual activity. Lillian could hear Beatrice's excited chatter mingling with Oliver's laughter as she descended the grand staircase. The marble floors felt cool beneath her bare feet as she followed the sounds to the dining room.

"Good morning, sleepyhead," Beatrice teased, her auburn curls bouncing as she poured herself another cup of coffee. "We were just discussing the pack meeting tonight."

Oliver looked up from his pancakes, syrup dripping from his chin. "Papa said it's gonna be super important!"

Lillian ruffled his hair affectionately before accepting the coffee Victoria handed her. The younger woman's engagement ring caught the light as she moved, a constant reminder of the complicated web of relationships in their pack.

"Where's Sebastian?" Lillian asked, trying to sound casual.

"Already in his study with Marcus," Victoria replied, her tone carefully neutral. "They've been there since dawn."

The unease in Lillian's stomach had nothing to do with hunger. Something was brewing, and she could feel it in her bones. The last time Sebastian had been this preoccupied was when Donovan had made his move against them.

As if summoned by her thoughts, Theodore entered with a silver tray bearing a sealed envelope. "For you, Miss Lillian. Delivered by special courier."

The heavy parchment felt ominous between her fingers. Breaking the wax seal—a crest she didn't recognize—she unfolded the letter. The words made her blood run cold:

"The past never stays buried. Expect me at midnight."

No signature. No explanation. But Lillian didn't need one. The handwriting was unmistakable—Donovan's precise, angular script that hadn't changed since their university days.

Beatrice, ever observant, was at her side in an instant. "What is it? You've gone pale as a ghost."

Lillian forced a smile for Oliver's sake. "Nothing important. Just some pack business." She folded the letter carefully, but not before Beatrice caught a glimpse of the contents.

Their eyes met in silent understanding. The calm before the storm had just ended.

Victoria hadn’t intended to reveal that secret—not like this, and certainly not with Donovan standing right there. She had planned to meet him later, hoping to surprise him at the villa. But fate had other plans. Now, mortification burned through her as she locked eyes with Donovan, who looked as stunned as a deer in headlights.

His eyes were wide, his lips parted slightly, as if he couldn’t process what had just happened. He never expected Victoria to know about him and Lillian. Even though nothing was happening between them now, she was never supposed to find out they had once been fated mates.

Had Lillian told her? How else could she have known?

“I didn’t mean to cause a scene,” Victoria said, standing abruptly and wiping at her damp cheeks. “But Lillian lied from the beginning. She swore nothing was between her and Donovan, but it was all a lie.”

Sebastian’s gaze snapped to Lillian’s, his eyes darkening with fury. The tension in the room thickened, suffocating. Victoria wasn’t sure what angered him more—that Lillian had betrayed her trust, or that she had once been involved with Donovan. Maybe now her father would finally see Lillian for who she truly was and leave her behind.

Celeste was the better choice, anyway.

“Victoria, baby…” Donovan finally spoke, breaking the heavy silence as he stepped closer, deliberately moving around Lillian without so much as a glance in her direction. The small act made Victoria’s chest tighten. He looked devastated, his expression raw with fear and regret, and it tugged at her heart despite everything.

“I would never hurt you,” he said, voice rough. “I just didn’t want to worry you. Lillian and I… we were mates, but it’s over. There’s nothing left between us. You have to believe me.”

Victoria swallowed hard, her lower lip trembling. She didn’t know what to believe anymore. The betrayal cut deep, leaving her adrift in a sea of doubt.

“I don’t know what to trust,” she whispered, staring down at her hands.

“I know,” Donovan murmured, reaching for her cautiously, as if she might bolt. “And I’m so sorry. This is my fault. But I love you, Victoria. I would never intentionally hurt you. Please… believe me.”

Another tear slipped free, tracing a path down her cheek.

Sebastian cleared his throat, his gaze still locked on Lillian, who remained frozen on the floor, visibly shaken by his Alpha power. “Perhaps you two should discuss this privately.”

Victoria nodded numbly and took Donovan’s outstretched hand.

“Okay,” she whispered.

She didn’t spare Lillian another glance as she let Donovan lead her upstairs, away from the wreckage of the truth.
###Chapter 199

The door clicked shut behind them, sealing them in tense silence. Donovan exhaled sharply, but Victoria felt no relief. She crossed her arms protectively over her chest, her piercing glare burning into him from across the room.

"How could you lie to me, Donovan?" Her voice trembled with barely restrained fury after a weighted pause.

He turned to face her, remorse darkening his expression. "I shouldn't have," he admitted, his voice rough with regret. "I'm so sorry. Please, forgive me..."

"Forgive you?" Victoria let out a bitter laugh, swiping at the traitorous tears on her cheeks. "Just like that? After everything?" Her breath hitched. "Tell me the truth—are you still sleeping with her?"

"No," Donovan answered instantly, but the firmness of his reply did little to soothe the ache in her chest.

Her nails dug into her palms. "Do you want to?"

This time, hesitation flickered across his face—just a fraction of a second, but it was enough to fracture what remained of her trust.

His jaw tightened. "It's... complicated." He raked a hand through his hair. "My wolf still craves her because she's our fated mate. Until we complete our bond and I mark you, that pull won't vanish completely." His gaze locked onto hers, desperate. "But I swear, Victoria, I would never act on it. You're the one I choose. The one I love. Lillian and I... that's over."

Her throat burned. "Why?"

"Because she betrayed me." The words tore from him like a confession. "She slept with someone else. And now—" His voice turned venomous. "She's been manipulating your father this whole time just to get to me. She admitted it."

Victoria recoiled as if struck. The revelation hung between them, sharp as shattered glass.

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains of Lillian's bedroom, casting golden patterns across the silk sheets. She stretched languidly, her werewolf senses immediately picking up the faint scent of bergamot and sandalwood that always lingered in Sebastian Blackwood's wing of the mansion.

Downstairs, the mansion buzzed with unusual activity. Lillian could hear the clinking of fine china as the staff prepared for the day's important meeting. Giselle Beaumont, the head maid, directed a team of servants with quiet efficiency while Lucien Dubois, the flirtatious head chef, argued passionately about the lunch menu.

"Miss Lillian!" Beatrice Whitaker's voice carried up the grand staircase as she bounded into view, her cheeks flushed with excitement. "You won't believe what's happening today!"

Lillian arched an eyebrow as she descended the stairs, her bare feet silent on the marble steps. "Should I be worried about that gleam in your eye, Bea?"

Beatrice grabbed her arm, practically vibrating with energy. "Alpha Maximilian Voss is arriving within the hour! The entire Darkmoon delegation is coming to finalize the territorial agreements."

A cold shiver ran down Lillian's spine. The last encounter with Alpha Voss had ended with broken furniture and bruised egos. She could still remember the way his golden eyes had assessed her like a piece of meat at their last meeting.

As if summoned by her thoughts, Sebastian appeared in the foyer, his imposing frame dressed in a tailored navy suit that accentuated his broad shoulders. Oliver clung to his hand, the seven-year-old looking unusually serious in his miniature version of his father's outfit.

"Lillian," Sebastian's deep voice resonated through the hall, "I need you at my side for this negotiation. Voss respects strength, and your presence will... unsettle him."

The unspoken meaning hung between them - her rejection of Donovan and subsequent bonding with the Lycan chairman had become legendary among the packs. What better demonstration of power than his former fated mate standing proudly beside his greatest rival?

Victoria chose that moment to make her entrance, her designer heels clicking sharply against the floor. "Father, must we really entertain these barbarians?" Her nose wrinkled in distaste. "Last time they were here, that brute Tristan Whitlock nearly broke Julian's nose."

Sebastian's jaw tightened. "Diplomacy requires patience, Victoria. And Julian should have known better than to challenge a Darkmoon warrior to an arm-wrestling match after three whiskeys."

Theodore Whitmore appeared with perfect timing, bearing a silver tray with steaming coffee. "The helicopters have been spotted approaching, sir. They'll land in twenty minutes."

Lillian accepted the offered coffee, her mind racing. She'd need to change into something more formal - perhaps that emerald green dress Genevieve Laurent had designed specifically for pack negotiations. The color brought out her eyes while the strategic slit allowed for quick movement if violence erupted.

As she turned to head upstairs, Sebastian caught her wrist. His touch sent electric currents through her skin. "Whatever happens today," he murmured for her ears alone, "remember you're mine. Let Voss see that truth in your eyes."

Outside, the distant thrum of helicopter blades grew louder. The game was about to begin.

Victoria gaped at him; she had suspected as much, but hearing Donovan confirm it aloud was utterly staggering.

"What?" she breathed, her voice barely above a whisper. "She's using my father to get to you?"

"Obviously," he replied with an exasperated eye roll. "Why else would she cling to him like this? It's honestly pathetic. She's been throwing herself at every man in sight since she started working here, and I keep telling her I'm not interested. She's not the sweet, innocent girl you thought she was, Victoria. You should watch your back around her."

Deep down, Victoria already knew this, but hearing it from Donovan made it all the more real. Fury surged through her veins, and her dislike for Lillian intensified. Now, even her poor Donovan had fallen victim to her schemes.

Seizing the moment, Donovan closed the distance between them, wrapping his arms around her in a tight embrace. His wolf bristled at the contact, but he needed to comfort her—his plans depended on it.

"I love you," he murmured, pressing a kiss to the top of her head. "I hate that you got hurt. But I swear, I’m not keeping anything else from you."

Victoria nodded against his chest, exhaling slowly. The conversation had lifted a weight off her shoulders. Now, she knew exactly who her allies were—and Lillian was not one of them.

Lillian's POV

Sebastian pressed a warm cloth to my nose, carefully wiping away the dried blood. Silence stretched between us since Victoria and Donovan had disappeared upstairs. I had hoped she would send him away for good, but the moment she took his hand, I knew she was going to forgive him.

What surprised me more was that Sebastian was allowing it. He knew exactly what kind of snake Donovan was. Yet, he was still letting his daughter marry him.

"Were you the one who told her?" Sebastian asked abruptly, breaking the quiet.

I blinked up at him, startled by the question.

"No," I said firmly. "I would never do that. I wouldn’t want to hurt her like that."

"Then how did she find out?" His tone was sharp, accusatory.

I frowned. "I don’t know. It wasn’t me."

He studied me for a long moment before nodding and returning his attention to cleaning my face.

"You shouldn’t have fought with her."

My eyes narrowed in disbelief.

"She threw the first punch," I reminded him. "I barely fought back. You know I could have—"

"You should have walked away before it got to that point."

His words struck me like a physical blow, leaving me speechless. The silence between us stretched, thick and suffocating. When he finally finished wiping the blood from my face, he leaned back, his piercing gaze studying me with an intensity that made my skin prickle.

"Until filming wraps, you should stay at the Blackwood estate," Sebastian declared, his voice firm. "I'll send Oliver to keep you company."

My brows lifted in surprise. "You're not worried he'll find out I'm living here?"

A slow shake of his head.

"Oliver's only been there a handful of times himself," Sebastian admitted. "If he asks, we'll say you needed a place to stay, and I offered the estate. Nothing more to it."

I bit my lip, the sting of his dismissal sharper than I expected. Still, I nodded.

"Right," I murmured, forcing the word past the lump in my throat.

His next words were softer, but no less final. "And it's best if you keep your distance from Victoria. At least until tensions ease."

He didn’t need to tell me twice—Victoria had made her feelings painfully clear. Losing a friend hurt, but clinging to my ex’s fiancée was a recipe for disaster. I nodded again, hating how my cheeks burned under his scrutiny.

"You should go," he said abruptly, rising to his feet. "I won’t be back tonight, but I’ll try to stop by tomorrow."

"It’s fine," I whispered, wrapping my arms around myself. "I understand."

He didn’t respond, but I could feel the weight of his stare.

Swallowing hard, I dared to glance up through my lashes. "C-can you tell Victoria I’m sorry?"

His jaw tensed, a muscle feathering before he gave a stiff nod.

"Sure."

I offered a weak smile before turning away, unable to bear looking at him a second longer. The moment I stepped out, the dam inside me threatened to break. But I held it together—just long enough to disappear down the hall before the first tear fell.

###Chapter 200

The moon hung low in the velvet sky, casting silver streaks across the forest floor as Lillian sprinted through the trees, her breath ragged. Every muscle in her body burned, but she couldn’t stop—not when Donovan’s enraged snarls echoed behind her, growing closer with each passing second.

He wasn’t supposed to find out.

Her heart hammered against her ribs as she skidded around a thick oak, her bare feet kicking up damp leaves. The scent of pine and earth filled her lungs, but beneath it, the metallic tang of blood lingered—her own. A shallow gash on her arm throbbed, a stark reminder of Donovan’s fury when he’d discovered her secret.

Sebastian.

The name sent a shiver down her spine. She had known the risks when she accepted the Lycan chairman as her true mate, but she hadn’t anticipated Donovan’s reaction. His betrayal still stung, raw and fresh, like an open wound.

A branch snapped behind her.

Lillian whirled around just as Donovan lunged from the shadows, his amber eyes blazing with unchecked rage. She barely dodged in time, his claws grazing her shoulder as she stumbled back.

"You think you can run from me?" he growled, his voice laced with venom. "After everything we had?"

"We had nothing," Lillian shot back, her voice trembling but defiant. "You chose Evelyn. You left me."

His lip curled. "And yet here you are, throwing yourself at Sebastian Blackwood like some desperate—"

A deep, guttural snarl cut through the night, silencing him mid-sentence.

Both of them froze.

From the darkness, a massive black wolf emerged, its golden eyes locked onto Donovan with lethal intent. The air thickened with dominance, suffocating in its intensity.

Sebastian.

Lillian’s breath hitched as he stepped forward, his fur bristling, every muscle coiled for attack.

Donovan took an involuntary step back, his bravado faltering. "This isn’t over," he spat, though the tremor in his voice betrayed his fear.

Sebastian didn’t give him a chance to retreat. With a single, fluid motion, he lunged.

Lillian barely had time to blink before Donovan was pinned beneath Sebastian’s massive frame, his claws digging into his throat. A whimper escaped Donovan’s lips—a sound she had never heard from him before.

"Sebastian, wait!" she cried, rushing forward.

The Lycan’s head snapped toward her, his gaze softening just slightly. But the warning in his eyes was clear: He deserves this.

Lillian swallowed hard. "Not like this."

For a heartbeat, the forest fell silent. Then, with a reluctant growl, Sebastian released Donovan, shoving him away with enough force to send him sprawling into the dirt.

"Run," Sebastian commanded, his voice a deadly whisper. "And if I ever catch you near her again, I won’t stop."

Donovan scrambled to his feet, his face twisted in humiliation and fury. But he didn’t argue. With one last glare at Lillian, he turned and vanished into the trees.

The moment he was gone, Sebastian shifted back, his human form materializing in a swirl of shadows. His dark hair was tousled, his chest rising and falling with barely restrained anger.

Lillian didn’t hesitate. She threw herself into his arms, burying her face against his chest. His warmth enveloped her, steady and sure, chasing away the lingering fear.

"You shouldn’t have come after me alone," he murmured, his fingers tangling in her hair.

She pulled back just enough to meet his gaze. "I had to."

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "He could have killed you."

"But he didn’t." She pressed her palm against his cheek. "Because of you."

For a long moment, he simply stared at her, his expression unreadable. Then, with a sigh, he pulled her close again, his lips brushing the top of her head.

"Let’s go home," he said softly.

Lillian nodded, her heart finally settling.

But as they turned to leave, a distant howl pierced the night—one that didn’t belong to either of their packs.

Sebastian stiffened.

Lillian’s pulse spiked. "What was that?"

His grip on her tightened.

"Trouble."
"Donovan is such an ass," Beatrice huffed as we strolled toward the student lounge. It had been a day since my confrontation with Victoria, and I'd just finished recounting the whole ordeal to Beatrice. She was fuming on my behalf, while I just felt bruised and bewildered. Sebastian hadn’t reached out since last night, and evening was creeping in.

Well, that wasn’t entirely true. He had texted—but only to say Oliver wasn’t feeling well and that he wouldn’t be coming to tutoring today. He’d also made sure to add that he wouldn’t be stopping by tonight. Not that I expected him to.

"Yeah, well, Victoria’s head over heels for him. I’m guessing she took him back," I muttered, shaking my head. "Whatever. Not my circus, not my wolves."

"But doesn’t it still sting?" Beatrice frowned, nudging me. "I mean… he’s your fated mate."

I bit my lower lip, shaking my head again.

"That’s not the part that hurts the most," I admitted quietly. "My wolf and I are used to Donovan’s games. It’s nothing new. And honestly? It hurts less every time. I don’t love him anymore—fated or not."

Beatrice nodded thoughtfully before suddenly brightening.

"Okay, enough about idiot men," she declared, spinning to face me as we reached the lounge doors. Her eyes sparkled with mischief. "Guess what? There’s a frat party tonight!"

"A frat party?" I arched a brow. "Seriously, Bea?"

She grinned, swinging the door open and dragging me inside, her arm looping through mine.

"Everyone’s going. I’ve got the night off from work, and we deserve to let loose. Come on, Lillian—just one night of fun to forget about Donovan and Sebastian?"

I sighed. Parties weren’t my scene—especially frat parties. I’d rather spend the evening in the combat center, working off my frustration with a few rounds of sparring.

"Pleeease?" Beatrice pouted, squeezing my arm. "When was the last time we actually did something fun? You need this."

She wasn’t wrong. Maybe a distraction would help.

"Fine," I relented. "But if it’s lame, we’re leaving."

Beatrice squealed, throwing her arms around me.

"Yes! Meet me here at eight. And wear something hot," she ordered, pointing a stern finger at me.

I rolled my eyes but couldn’t help laughing.

"Whatever you say, Bea."

"Yes, ma'am," I replied with a playful salute, unable to suppress my smirk.

We spent the afternoon studying for our upcoming exams, though most of our time was filled with laughter and idle chatter. Later, Frederick arrived to pick me up and take me home.

The rest of my evening was dedicated to getting ready for a party I had zero interest in attending. But when I finally stood before the mirror, taking in my reflection, a slow, satisfied grin spread across my face.

Third Person POV

Beatrice had nothing suitable to wear to her first frat party. She wanted something bold, something that would turn heads—but most of her wardrobe was tailored for work, elegant and refined. She didn’t own anything remotely provocative, and that was exactly the look she was going for tonight.

For a fleeting moment, she considered texting Lillian to ask if she wanted to go shopping together, but she quickly dismissed the idea. Lillian was already struggling with whether she even wanted to attend, and Beatrice knew she needed space to make her decision in peace.

So instead, Beatrice grabbed her keys and drove into the city, determined to find something unforgettable. She still had a few hours before the party—plenty of time to transform herself into the kind of woman who would leave an impression.

"Welcome back, Beatrice," a familiar voice greeted as she stepped into her favorite boutique.

"Hey, Amélie," Beatrice replied, already scanning the racks. "I need something hot. I’m going to a frat party tonight."

Amélie, the boutique clerk, wrinkled her nose in distaste. "Ugh, those are the worst. I don’t miss those days at all."

A few years older, Amélie had recently graduated and was training to become the store’s manager. She had never been much of a party girl, though she had endured her fair share of frat parties during her college years.

"Well, this is my first one, and I want to make sure it’s memorable," Beatrice said with a shrug.

Amélie nodded in understanding. "Fair enough. Just make it quick—I’m closing early tonight."

Beatrice frowned. "Why? It’s not a holiday, is it?"

Amélie’s lips curled into a delighted smile. "No, but I have a date tonight, and I can’t wait. I still can’t believe he actually asked me out. He’s from the Silver Crescent pack—we met at a bar a few nights ago. He’s taking me dancing and then to dinner."

Beatrice arched a brow, intrigued. "Sounds like someone’s got a good night ahead of them."

Amélie laughed, her eyes sparkling. "Oh, you have no idea."

With that, Beatrice turned back to the racks, her mind already racing with possibilities. Tonight, she wasn’t just going to a party—she was making an entrance.
###Chapter 201

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains of Lillian's bedroom, stirring her awake. She stretched lazily, her muscles still sore from yesterday’s training session with Professor Montclair. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted up from the kitchen, signaling that Sebastian was already awake.

Downstairs, she found him at the dining table, reading through a stack of documents while Oliver chattered excitedly about his upcoming school project. The domestic scene warmed her heart, but the moment was interrupted when Donovan’s name flashed across Sebastian’s phone screen.

Lillian’s stomach twisted. Why was he calling now?

Sebastian’s jaw tightened as he answered, his voice clipped. "Donovan."

The conversation was brief, but the tension in the room thickened. When Sebastian hung up, his expression was unreadable.

"What did he want?" Lillian asked, forcing her voice to remain steady.

Sebastian exhaled sharply. "He’s demanding a meeting. Claims he has information about Victoria’s engagement."

Lillian’s fingers curled into fists. Victoria, Sebastian’s daughter, was still engaged to Donovan—a fact that gnawed at her every day. "And you believe him?"

Sebastian’s eyes darkened. "No. But I won’t ignore a potential threat."

Beatrice burst into the room then, her cheeks flushed from running. "Lillian! You won’t believe what I just heard—Cassandra’s been spreading rumors about you again!"

Lillian groaned. Great. Just what I needed.

Sebastian stood, his presence commanding. "We’ll deal with Donovan first. Then Cassandra."

As they prepared to leave, Oliver tugged at Lillian’s sleeve. "Will you be back for dinner?"

She ruffled his hair, forcing a smile. "Of course, sweetheart."

But as they stepped outside, Lillian couldn’t shake the feeling that this meeting would change everything.

And not for the better.

"Oh, he sounds absolutely divine," Beatrice giggled, her eyes sparkling with amusement.

Amélie nodded enthusiastically.

 "He's picking me up here... and honestly, he's so breathtakingly handsome I might just faint," Amélie admitted with a playful sigh. "Plus, he's a bit older—definitely in his early thirties. Total silver fox vibes."

"I guess we're both in for exciting nights," Beatrice laughed, her fingers trailing over the racks of new arrivals.

She browsed through the boutique’s latest collection, admiring a few adorable pieces, but nothing quite captured the bold statement she wanted to make. Sensing her hesitation, Amélie stepped in with a knowing grin. She sifted through the racks before pulling out the most stunning—and scandalously short—dress Beatrice had ever seen.

When Amélie held it up, Beatrice gasped.

"Oh, sweet heavens!" Beatrice exclaimed, snatching the dress with wide eyes. "This is perfect. I have to try it on." Amélie smirked, clearly pleased with her find.

"I’ll even give you the friends-and-family discount," Amélie added as Beatrice practically sprinted into the dressing room.

Inside, Beatrice ran her hands over the delicate fabric, admiring how the dress clung to her curves. It was daring—short enough to leave little to the imagination—and that was exactly the effect she wanted.

She fluffed her shoulder-length blonde waves, letting the soft curls frame her delicate features. Beatrice knew she was beautiful, but standing next to Lillian always made her feel like she paled in comparison. Lillian’s effortless grace and striking beauty were unmatched, and while Beatrice adored her best friend, a tiny, secret part of her envied it.

With a sigh, she twirled in front of the mirror, watching the way the dress accentuated her cleavage and showcased her long, toned legs. It was perfect. She was definitely buying it.

Just as her fingers curled around the dressing room door handle, she froze.

A scent—rich, intoxicating—flooded her senses. Warm milk chocolate, with just a hint of cool mint. It was like her favorite dessert had been transformed into the most irresistible fragrance. Her stomach fluttered, and suddenly, her wolf was wide awake, thrumming with excitement beneath her skin.

She needed to find the source.

Beatrice rushed out of the dressing room, her nose lifting slightly as she followed the scent like a beacon. She could hear Amélie’s laughter near the front counter, so she headed that way—partly to show off the dress, but mostly to ask if Amélie had any idea where that divine smell was coming from.

But the moment she turned the corner, she stopped dead in her tracks.

A man stood at the counter—tall, broad-shouldered, with an aura of effortless confidence. He was, without question, the most gorgeous man she had ever laid eyes on. Her mouth went dry just looking at him.

Beatrice had never been one to believe in love at first sight.

But then he turned.

His warm, deep brown eyes locked onto hers, and in that instant, she knew—she was ruined.

For a heartbeat, she was too stunned to think.

Then her wolf surged forward, pressing a single, undeniable truth into her mind.

"Mate."

The man's gaze locked onto her with such intensity that it stole her breath away. His eyes, dark and unreadable at first, slowly traveled down her body, lingering on the curve of her neck before dipping lower—too low. Heat rushed to Beatrice's cheeks as she realized exactly where his attention had settled. His wolf was close to the surface; she could see it in the way his pupils dilated, the way his jaw clenched as if fighting for control.

When his eyes finally met hers again, the raw hunger in them sent a shiver down her spine.

"Oh, mon Dieu!" Amélie gasped, suddenly appearing beside Beatrice with an excited squeal. "You look absolutely stunning! This dress was made for you—just wait until everyone sees you at the party tonight!" She twirled Beatrice around, completely oblivious to the low, warning growl rumbling from the man behind the counter.

Beatrice barely heard Amélie’s words. Her focus was entirely on him—the way his fingers flexed against the counter, the way his nostrils flared as if scenting her.

"You have to take this dress," Amélie insisted, adjusting the neckline with a playful grin. "And don’t even worry about paying for it right now. Consider it my gift to you."

Beatrice blinked, finally tearing her gaze away from the man. "Wait—you're leaving now?"

Amélie nodded, stepping back toward the counter with a bright smile. "Oui! My date just arrived." She looped her arm through the man’s, leaning into him with a familiarity that made Beatrice’s stomach drop.

Her mate was Amélie’s date?!

The realization hit her like a physical blow.

###Chapter 202

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains, stirring Lillian from her restless sleep. She blinked against the light, her body still heavy with exhaustion from the previous night’s turmoil. The scent of Donovan still lingered in her mind, a bitter reminder of the past she couldn’t escape.

Rolling onto her side, she caught sight of Sebastian’s sleeping form beside her. His dark lashes fanned over his sharp cheekbones, his breathing slow and steady. The sight of him brought a flicker of warmth to her chest, a stark contrast to the cold dread that had settled in her stomach.

She slipped out of bed as quietly as possible, not wanting to wake him. The wooden floor was cool beneath her bare feet as she padded to the window, pushing the curtains aside to gaze at the sprawling estate below. The gardens were already alive with activity—maids tending to the flowers, guards patrolling the perimeter.

A soft knock at the door made her turn.

"Come in," she whispered.

The door creaked open, and Beatrice peeked inside, her dark curls bouncing as she stepped in. "You’re awake," she said, relief coloring her voice. "I was worried."

Lillian managed a small smile. "Couldn’t sleep much."

Beatrice crossed the room, her eyes flickering to Sebastian before lowering her voice. "Donovan was here last night."

Lillian stiffened. "I know."

"He didn’t… do anything, did he?"

Lillian shook her head. "No. But he made it clear he’s not giving up."

Beatrice’s lips pressed into a thin line. "That bastard."

A rustling sound came from the bed, and both girls turned to see Sebastian stirring. His golden eyes flickered open, immediately locking onto Lillian.

"Morning," he murmured, his voice rough with sleep.

Lillian’s pulse quickened. "Morning."

Sebastian sat up, the sheets pooling around his waist, revealing the hard lines of his torso. His gaze shifted to Beatrice. "Something wrong?"

Beatrice hesitated before sighing. "Donovan was here last night."

Sebastian’s expression darkened instantly. "Where is he now?"

"Gone," Lillian said quickly. "But he’ll be back."

Sebastian’s jaw clenched. "Not if I have anything to say about it."

Lillian bit her lip. She knew Sebastian’s protective instincts were flaring, but she also knew Donovan wouldn’t be deterred so easily.

Beatrice cleared her throat. "I’ll leave you two to talk." She gave Lillian a meaningful look before slipping out of the room.

The moment the door clicked shut, Sebastian was on his feet, crossing the distance between them in two strides. His hands cupped her face, his thumbs brushing lightly over her cheeks.

"You okay?" he asked softly.

Lillian exhaled shakily. "I will be."

Sebastian studied her for a long moment before nodding. "Good. Because I’m not letting him near you again."

Lillian wanted to believe him. But deep down, she knew Donovan wasn’t the kind of man who took no for an answer.

And that thought terrified her.

This had to be the worst idea I'd ever agreed to. My stomach twisted with unease as the car pulled up to the campus. But I'd promised Beatrice I'd come to this party, and I wasn't about to back out now.

"Thanks for the ride, Frederick," I said as we neared the school.

He smirked, glancing at me through the rearview mirror. "Just doing my job. No need for thanks."

I shrugged. "Still."

His grin widened. "If you need an early escape, just call. I won't judge. These frat parties? Not exactly my idea of fun either."

I nodded, grateful for the lifeline. As he parked, I gave him one last wave before stepping out and heading toward the student lounge where I was supposed to meet Beatrice. We'd planned to walk in together.

But she wasn't there.

I perched on the steps, uncaring if my dress got dirty, and waited. And waited. After what felt like an eternity, I checked my phone—8:55 PM. We were supposed to meet at 8. Had she gone without me?

Just as I stood to leave, I heard my name.

"Lillian!"

I turned to see Beatrice rushing toward me, her dark curls bouncing with each step. She looked stunning in a sleek black dress that hugged every curve, the neckline daringly low. My simple outfit paled in comparison. Beatrice had always been effortlessly gorgeous, and a small, petty part of me envied that.

But as she got closer, I noticed her red-rimmed eyes.

"Are you okay?" I asked when she reached me.

She forced a smile, but it didn’t reach her eyes. "Yeah, just lost track of time. Had to hunt down this dress."

I looped my arm through hers. "No worries. Let’s just get this over with."

She laughed, the sound brittle. "That’s the spirit."

We made our way to the frat house, the bass from the music already vibrating through the ground. The place was packed—people spilled out onto the lawn, drinks in hand, laughter too loud. The warm night air did nothing to ease the headache already forming behind my temples.

We squeezed through the crowd, Beatrice clinging to my arm as she greeted guys she knew. Their eyes raked over her, lingering in ways that made my skin crawl. I tightened my grip on her. I didn’t trust any of them.

"Let’s grab a drink!" she announced.

I wrinkled my nose. "Beer? Really?"

She rolled her eyes. "It’s a frat party, Lillian. They don’t exactly stock champagne."

With a sigh, I followed her to the kitchen, where coolers overflowed with cheap beer. She handed me a can, cracking hers open with a sharp hiss.

"To our first—and hopefully last—frat party!" she cheered, clinking her can against mine.

I took a reluctant sip, barely suppressing a gag. Disgusting. But maybe if I drank enough, I’d forget the taste.

The living room was worse—music blaring, bodies pressed too close. Girls swayed against frat guys, their movements sloppy with alcohol. Beatrice tugged me into the chaos, her laughter too bright, too forced.

Something was wrong. And I wasn’t leaving until I found out what.

###Chapter 203

The morning sun filtered through the heavy drapes of Lillian's bedroom, casting golden streaks across the rumpled sheets. She stretched languidly, her muscles protesting slightly from yesterday's intense training session with Professor Montclair. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted upstairs, undoubtedly Lucien's doing - the flirtatious head chef always made sure breakfast was perfect.

Downstairs, the mansion buzzed with unusual activity. Giselle, the head maid, directed staff with quiet efficiency while Sebastian Blackwood's deep voice rumbled through the grand foyer. Lillian paused at the top of the marble staircase, watching as the Lycan chairman issued orders to Marcus Grayson, his beta. Even in casual attire, Sebastian commanded attention, his broad shoulders tense with some unspoken urgency.

"Ah, Miss Lillian," Theodore Whitmore greeted as she descended, his butler's uniform impeccably pressed. "You're just in time. Mr. Blackwood was about to send for you."

Sebastian turned at the sound of her name, his stormy eyes softening momentarily. "We have a situation," he said without preamble. "Isabella Fontaine's fashion show has been moved up, and we need to leave for Paris within the hour."

Lillian's breath caught. Paris? With Sebastian? Her pulse quickened at the thought, though she schooled her features into calm indifference. "I wasn't aware we had plans to travel."

A ghost of a smile played on Sebastian's lips. "Neither was I, until Donovan decided to make his move. He's taking Evelyn to the same event."

The mention of her ex-fated mate sent a familiar pang through Lillian's chest, though it was duller now, tempered by time and Sebastian's persistent presence in her life. Beatrice would call this a classic case of running into your ex while looking fabulous - if only the stakes weren't so high.

Upstairs, Sophia Delacroix was already packing Lillian's bags with military precision. "The black Valentino, the red Gucci, and that stunning emerald green dress Madame Genevieve designed specifically for you," the maid murmured, folding garments with care. "Mr. Blackwood insisted you have options."

Lillian's fingers traced the delicate embroidery on the green gown, remembering how Sebastian's eyes had darkened when she'd tried it on during the fitting. That had been before the incident with Cassandra at school, before Oliver's suspension, before everything became so complicated.

A knock at the door revealed Victoria, Sebastian's daughter, looking uncharacteristically hesitant. "Father asked me to give you this," she said, holding out a velvet box. Inside nestled a pair of emerald earrings that perfectly matched the gown. "He said... they reminded him of your eyes."

Lillian's throat tightened. This was dangerous territory. Gifts from a Lycan chairman to a werewolf college student weren't just inappropriate - they were practically a declaration. Yet when she met Victoria's gaze, she saw no malice, only quiet resignation. The engagement to Donovan had been broken months ago, but the wounds clearly still festered.

The private jet waited on the tarmac, its sleek lines gleaming in the morning light. Julian Mercer, Sebastian's head gamma, conducted a final security check while Oliver bounced excitedly near the stairs. "Aunt Lillian! We're going to see the Eiffel Tower!" the boy exclaimed, his earlier troubles forgotten in the thrill of adventure.

Sebastian placed a steadying hand on his son's shoulder. "Business first, then sightseeing," he reminded gently, though his eyes never left Lillian's face. "Assuming we can avoid any... complications."

The unspoken threat hung between them - Donovan wouldn't make this easy. Neither would Evelyn, nor Cassandra, who Lillian suspected had somehow engineered this entire scenario. But as she boarded the plane, taking the seat beside Sebastian, Lillian realized with startling clarity that she wasn't afraid.

Let them come. She was done running.

The sight was so ridiculous that Beatrice and I burst into laughter, immediately mimicking their ridiculous dance moves. There was something liberating about letting go with my best friend, especially when she could match my level of absurdity without hesitation.

We sipped our beers, and with each gulp, the bitter taste grew more tolerable—maybe this wouldn’t be so unbearable after all. Beatrice finished hers first and grabbed another, already swaying slightly. She had always been a lightweight, and the flush on her cheeks told me she was already tipsy. One beer down, and she was giggling uncontrollably. I could only imagine the chaos a second one would bring.

"Beer pong tournament—back patio, now!" one of the frat boys shouted, sparking cheers as the crowd surged toward the yard. Beatrice latched onto my arm, dragging me along with her. We squeezed into the circle around the table just as a broad-shouldered guy called for a partner. To my shock, Beatrice shot her hand up.

"Beatrice, you’ve never played this before," I reminded her, but she just tossed her hair and grinned.

"So what?" she said, her voice light with drunken amusement. "First time for everything!" She bounded over to the guy, slapping his palm in a high-five. His eyes raked over her, lingering a second too long—clearly, he liked what he saw. He gestured for her to go first.

She missed the cup entirely on her first try, sending the ball bouncing off the table. The crowd erupted in laughter, Beatrice included. The opposing team scored effortlessly, forcing her to down her drink. To my astonishment, she chugged the entire cup without flinching.

The game continued, and Beatrice lost spectacularly—only landing a couple of shots while her partner carried most of the weight. Not that he minded. He was too busy enjoying the way she bounced around, her laughter infectious, her movements carefree.

By the end, Beatrice was a mess. Slurred words, wobbly legs—I knew I’d be the one hauling her out of here. I wasn’t sober either, two beers deep, but compared to her, I was practically functional. She could barely walk straight, her sentences dissolving into giggles.

Her partner slid a hand to the small of her back, murmuring something in her ear. My stomach twisted. I grabbed her wrist and yanked her toward me.

"Hey!" he protested.

"Back off," I snapped, steering her away.

Beatrice mumbled something incoherent as I dragged her through the crowd. "Relax, it’s just a party!" the guy called after us. I flipped him off without looking back, earning a chorus of laughter from the onlookers.

Inside, the house was quieter—most of the party had migrated outside for round two of beer pong. I guided Beatrice to a couch, where she collapsed against me, her head lolling onto my shoulder.

"What’s wrong with me?" she mumbled, her lips pursed in a drunken pout.

I chuckled. "Nothing. You’re just wasted."

She exhaled shakily, and then I felt it—warm dampness seeping through my sleeve. I looked down.

"Beatrice… are you crying?" My stomach dropped. She wasn’t the type to cry easily. Something was wrong.

"I hate myself," she whispered, her voice raw.

My chest tightened. "What’s going on? Talk to me."

"He didn’t want me," she murmured, her words thick with alcohol and heartbreak.

"Who? That frat guy? Trust me, he definitely wanted you—"

"No, not him." She lifted her head, her eyes glassy. "That guy at the boutique. He walked away with her… even after seeing me. I don’t even know his name."

Her voice cracked, and I pulled her closer, my heart aching for her.

This wasn’t just about tonight.

This ran deeper.
###Chapter 204

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian hurried through the bustling campus. Her heart pounded with anticipation—today was the day she would finally confront Donovan about his betrayal. The memory of finding him with Evelyn still burned in her mind, a wound that refused to heal.

She spotted him near the fountain, his golden hair catching the sunlight. Beside him, Evelyn giggled, her fingers brushing his arm possessively. Lillian clenched her fists, her wolf stirring beneath her skin.

"You look like you're about to shift right here," Beatrice murmured, appearing at her side. Her best friend’s dark eyes were filled with concern.

"I might," Lillian admitted through gritted teeth. "I need answers."

Beatrice sighed. "Just don’t do anything reckless. Remember, Sebastian’s waiting for you at the pack house."

The mention of Sebastian Blackwood, the powerful Lycan chairman who had become her unexpected ally—and perhaps something more—sent a shiver down her spine. But right now, Donovan was her priority.

She strode forward, her boots crunching on the gravel. Donovan turned, his smug expression faltering when he saw her. "Lillian," he said, forcing a smile. "What a surprise."

"Cut the act," she snapped. "We need to talk. Alone."

Evelyn scoffed. "Whatever you have to say, you can say it in front of me."

Lillian’s eyes flashed. "Fine. Why did you lie to me, Donovan? You swore I was your fated mate, and yet here you are, with her."

Donovan’s jaw tightened. "Things change, Lillian. The Moon Goddess doesn’t always get it right."

The words struck like a physical blow. Before she could respond, a deep voice cut through the tension.

"Interesting theory."

Sebastian stepped into view, his towering frame commanding attention. His piercing gaze locked onto Donovan. "But I’ve found the Goddess is rarely wrong. Perhaps the problem isn’t her—it’s you."

Donovan paled. "This doesn’t concern you, Blackwood."

Sebastian smirked. "Everything concerning Lillian concerns me."

Lillian’s breath hitched at the possessiveness in his tone. Evelyn’s eyes darted between them, realization dawning. "Oh, this is rich," she sneered. "You’ve moved on to the Lycan chairman? How predictable."

Sebastian’s expression darkened. "Careful, little wolf. You’re speaking to your future Alpha Female."

Silence fell. Lillian’s pulse roared in her ears. Had he just—?

Donovan’s face twisted in fury. "You can’t be serious."

Sebastian ignored him, turning to Lillian. "We have matters to discuss. Unless you’d rather stay here?"

She didn’t hesitate. "Let’s go."

As they walked away, Beatrice’s delighted whisper followed them. "Oh, this is going to be good."

Behind them, Donovan’s enraged shout echoed across the quad. But Lillian didn’t look back.

Not this time.

"Who are you talking about?" I asked, my voice laced with confusion. At first, I thought Beatrice was just rambling in her drunken haze, but when I met her gaze, her eyes were startlingly clear—intense, even. "Bea?" I pressed, my pulse quickening.

"I met my mate..." she slurred, her words barely coherent before she suddenly bent over and vomited all over my favorite boots.

I let out a sharp groan, jumping back instinctively. That was not what I expected her to say—but my shock was quickly overshadowed by the revolting mess now covering my shoes and the frat house floor. Questions would have to wait. Right now, I needed to get her cleaned up before she embarrassed herself further.

Gripping her shoulders, I hauled her upright just as she gagged again. "Oh no, not again—" I muttered, steering her toward the bathroom while she wobbled like a newborn fawn. Tears streamed down her flushed cheeks, and she hiccuped pitifully between dry heaves. I dodged another wave of vomit, my stomach churning in sympathy.

Then, out of nowhere, strong arms wrapped around Beatrice’s waist, lifting her effortlessly. I blinked up at a tall, broad-shouldered frat boy who had appeared beside me like some kind of drunken guardian angel.

"Saw you struggling," he said with an easy grin. "Let me help you get her to the bathroom."

Relief flooded me. "Thank you," I breathed, nodding gratefully.

True to his word, he carried her the rest of the way, setting her down gently outside the bathroom before stepping back to give us privacy. Inside, I helped Beatrice rinse her mouth and splash water on her face until she finally stopped retching. Once she was slumped against the wall, breathing heavily, I pulled out my phone and dialed Frederick.

"Fred, I need a ride. Beatrice is… not okay," I said, wincing as she groaned dramatically.

"I’ll be there ASAP," he promised, though the frustration in his voice was clear. "Traffic’s a nightmare for some reason."

Sighing, I stepped out of the bathroom to find the frat boy still waiting.

"Thanks again," I said, offering a tired smile.

He shrugged, his dimples deepening. "No problem. I’ve been watching you all night, actually. You’re stunning."

Heat rushed to my cheeks at the unexpected compliment. "That’s sweet of you," I said carefully, "but just so you know, I’m not really—"

"Relax," he cut in, holding up his hands in surrender. "Just stating facts. I’m not like the other guys here."

I arched a brow. "You’re in a frat."

He chuckled. "Yeah, but I’m different."

I couldn’t help but laugh. "Sure you are," I teased. Then, realization struck. "Wait… I’ve seen you around campus. You’re Thierry, right?"

His grin widened. "Should I be flattered you remember my name?"

"Not really," I admitted with a smirk. "You sit two rows behind me in Defense Tactics."

"Oh! That's why you looked familiar," he chuckled, his eyes lighting up with recognition. "You're Lillian Dumont." I gave a small nod, tucking a loose strand of hair behind my ear.

"The one and only," I quipped, flashing him a playful smirk.

His grin widened. "You're really good at defense," he admitted, tilting his head slightly.

"You should see me in combat," I countered, crossing my arms. "Becoming a gamma is my goal." 

"Well, you'll be a damn impressive gamma, no doubt," he said, nudging my shoulder lightly. "Didn't expect to see you at a frat party, though."

I shrugged, leaning back against the wall. "Beatrice wanted to come, so I agreed to tag along," I confessed. "She's my best friend."

"Ah, got it," he mused, nodding thoughtfully. "Well, I'm glad I got to meet you properly."

I smiled faintly. The attention was nice—especially after last night—though I wasn’t exactly swooning over this guy. Still, it was a pleasant distraction.

"Can I get you something to drink?" He gestured toward the kitchen.

"I think I've had enough," I admitted, shaking my head.

"How about water, then?" He raised an eyebrow, waiting.

I considered it for a moment. He seemed harmless enough. "Sure," I relented. "Water sounds good."

His grin returned. "Perfect."

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the cobblestone path leading to the Blackwood estate. Her heart pounded with a mix of anticipation and unease. She hadn’t seen Donovan in weeks—not since he’d publicly rejected her as his fated mate in favor of Evelyn.

Beatrice, ever the supportive best friend, had insisted on accompanying her. "You’re not facing him alone," she’d said firmly, looping her arm through Lillian’s. "Not after what he did."

Sebastian Blackwood, the formidable Lycan chairman, stood near the grand oak doors, his piercing gaze locked onto Lillian the moment she entered the courtyard. His presence was magnetic, commanding the attention of everyone around him. Oliver, his seven-year-old son, peeked out from behind him, his curious eyes darting between Lillian and Beatrice.

"Lillian," Sebastian greeted, his voice deep and smooth. "I wasn’t expecting you today."

She swallowed hard, forcing herself to meet his eyes. "I need to speak with Donovan."

A flicker of something unreadable passed over Sebastian’s features before he nodded. "He’s inside with Evelyn."

The mention of Donovan’s new mate sent a sharp pang through Lillian’s chest, but she refused to let it show. Squaring her shoulders, she strode past Sebastian, Beatrice close behind.

The grand hall was bathed in golden light, the chandeliers casting intricate shadows across the marble floors. Donovan stood near the fireplace, his arm draped possessively around Evelyn’s waist. The sight made Lillian’s stomach twist.

"Lillian?" Donovan’s voice was laced with surprise—and something else. Guilt?

She didn’t give him time to react further. "We need to talk. Alone."

Evelyn’s grip on Donovan tightened. "Whatever you have to say, you can say it in front of me."

Lillian’s jaw clenched. "This doesn’t concern you."

Donovan hesitated, then sighed. "Evelyn, give us a minute."

With a huff, Evelyn stalked off, shooting Lillian a venomous glare.

Once they were alone, Lillian didn’t waste time. "You lied to me."

Donovan’s expression darkened. "What are you talking about?"

"The rejection," she said, her voice steady despite the storm of emotions inside her. "You never told me the real reason you chose Evelyn."

His silence was answer enough.

Lillian took a step closer, her eyes burning with unshed tears. "Tell me the truth, Donovan. Or I swear, I’ll find out myself."

The tension between them crackled like static in the air.

And then—

A loud crash echoed from the hallway, followed by raised voices.

Sebastian’s deep growl cut through the noise. "What the hell is going on here?"

Lillian turned just in time to see Victoria, Donovan’s fiancée, storm into the room, her face flushed with fury.

"You!" she snarled, pointing at Lillian. "You’re the reason everything’s falling apart!"

Before Lillian could react, Victoria lunged—

And the world exploded into chaos.
###Chapter 205

My eyebrows shot up when Thierry returned with a red solo cup of water. I had expected a proper water bottle, but he didn’t seem the least bit bothered as he handed it to me with a lazy smirk. I peered into the cup—clear liquid, no suspicious scent. Relieved, I offered him a small, grateful smile.

"Thanks," I murmured, bringing the cup to my lips. The taste was... odd. I wrinkled my nose, staring at the water before glancing back at him.

"It’s unfiltered," he explained with a shrug. "Ran out of the good stuff. Hope you don’t mind."

I nodded, though the metallic tang lingered on my tongue. Still, it was better than the beer I’d been nursing earlier. As I took another sip, I caught him watching me with an intensity that made my pulse skip.

"So," he drawled, leaning against the wall beside me. "You single?"

The question caught me off guard, though I kept my expression neutral. Not exactly the smoothest pickup line, considering we were loitering outside the bathroom while Beatrice emptied her stomach inside.

"Not really looking," I replied, though the words felt sticky in my mouth. Was I seeing Sebastian? Technically, yes. But right now, with the way things stood between us, it didn’t feel like much of anything.

Thierry chuckled. "Yeah, I get that. Been a while for me too. Frat house full of girls throwing themselves at me, but none of them..." His gaze flicked over me. "None of them were you."

I rolled my eyes, taking another sip. "Smooth. Dangerous."

"Dangerous how?" He stepped closer, his voice dropping.

"Because I bet you get whatever you want with that mouth of yours," I shot back, but my own words sounded distant, sluggish. My cheeks burned, and my grip on the cup loosened slightly. Was the hallway spinning, or was it just me?

"Maybe I do," he murmured, closing the distance between us. "Problem with that?"

I shook my head—bad idea. The motion sent the room tilting violently. My knees buckled, and I barely caught myself against the wall. "Whoa," I muttered, laughing weakly. "Okay, what the hell? Is it just me, or is it suddenly boiling in here?"

Sweat prickled at my temples, my breath coming too fast. Thierry frowned, plucking the empty cup from my limp fingers and tossing it aside. "Drink more next time," he said, but his voice sounded like it was underwater.

I tried to speak, but my tongue felt thick, useless. My limbs were leaden, my wolf writhing beneath my skin in distress. Heat—wrong, unnatural heat—flooded my veins, but I couldn’t move, couldn’t think.

Thierry’s arms slid around me, holding me upright as my vision blurred. "Let’s get you somewhere comfortable," he murmured against my ear, lips brushing my neck.

I wanted to protest, to shove him away, but my body wasn’t mine anymore. The last thing I registered was the ground disappearing beneath me as he lifted me effortlessly, cradling me against his chest.

And then—nothing.
###Chapter 206

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, illuminating the lavish space with warmth. Lillian stretched beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming from the intensity of last night’s mating bond.

She turned her head, expecting to see Sebastian beside her, but the bed was empty. A faint trace of his sandalwood scent lingered on the pillow, sending a shiver down her spine.

Where is he?

Before she could dwell on it, the bedroom door creaked open, and Oliver’s small face peeked in. His silver-blue eyes—so much like his father’s—sparkled with mischief.

"Morning, Lillian!" he chirped, bouncing onto the bed. "Dad said you need breakfast. He made pancakes!"

Lillian chuckled, ruffling his dark curls. "Did he now?"

Oliver nodded eagerly. "With chocolate chips! But he burned the first batch."

She laughed, imagining the usually composed Lycan chairman fumbling in the kitchen.

As she got dressed, her phone buzzed—a message from Beatrice.

Beatrice: Girl, you better not be skipping class again. Professor Sinclair is on a warpath.

Lillian groaned. Between pack politics and her newly solidified bond with Sebastian, her academic life had taken a backseat.

Downstairs, the penthouse smelled of coffee and slightly charred pancakes. Sebastian stood by the stove, his broad shoulders tensed in concentration as he flipped another pancake. The sight was so domestic, so unlike the ruthless Lycan chairman, that her heart swelled.

He turned, his gaze darkening as it swept over her. "Sleep well?"

She smirked. "Not nearly enough."

A growl rumbled in his chest, but Oliver’s giggle interrupted them. "Dad, it’s smoking again!"

Sebastian cursed under his breath, rescuing the pancake just before it blackened.

Lillian bit back a laugh. "Maybe I should take over."

He shot her a look. "I can handle it."

She arched a brow. "Clearly."

Before he could retort, the doorbell rang.

Sebastian’s expression shifted instantly—guarded, calculating. He wiped his hands on a towel and strode to the door.

Lillian’s pulse spiked when she heard the voice on the other side.

"Good morning, Alpha Blackwood."

Victoria.

Sebastian’s daughter stood in the doorway, her posture rigid, her gaze flickering past him to land on Lillian. The air thickened with unspoken tension.

Oliver, oblivious, waved. "Hi, Vicky! Want pancakes?"

Victoria’s lips twitched, but her eyes remained cold. "No, thank you." She focused on Sebastian. "We need to talk. Alone."

Lillian’s stomach dropped.

Sebastian exhaled sharply. "Not now, Victoria."

Her jaw tightened. "It’s about Donovan."

The name sent a chill through the room.

Lillian’s fingers curled into fists. What now?

Sebastian’s voice turned icy. "Later."

Victoria’s eyes flashed with defiance. "He’s back in the city."

Silence.

Then—

A crash from the kitchen. Oliver had dropped his plate, syrup splattering across the marble floor.

Sebastian didn’t move, his gaze locked on Victoria. "Where?"

She hesitated, then whispered, "The Winslow estate."

Lillian’s blood ran cold.

Donovan was here.

And he wasn’t alone.

Something was off... and my instincts told me it had everything to do with Thierry.

Sebastian’s POV

After Oliver fell asleep, I made my way to the estate to see Lillian. The way we left things last night didn’t sit right with me—there was a gnawing guilt twisting in my chest. I knew I’d hurt her, and I needed to make her understand my side of things.

But when I arrived, Lillian wasn’t there.

"Where is she?" I demanded, staring at Giselle, who stood before me.

"She went to a party at her university," Giselle answered with a careless shrug. "Some frat thing, I think."

A deep growl rumbled in my throat. A frat party? Alone? Did she have any idea how reckless that was? Worse yet, Frederick was here, waiting for her call to pick her up.

"You should’ve stayed with her," I bit out.

"Apologies, Alpha," Frederick murmured, lowering his head. "She insisted I leave for now."

Before I could reprimand him further, his phone rang. He glanced at the screen, his brow furrowing as he answered.

"Hello?"

A pause. His expression darkened as he listened, nodding sharply even though the caller couldn’t see him.

"Yeah, I’ll be there as fast as I can."

He hung up and turned to me.

"Who was it?" I snapped.

"Lillian," he said, instantly seizing my full attention. "Apparently, Beatrice is wasted, and they both need a ride. I’ll drop Beatrice off first, then bring Lillian straight here."

He moved to leave, but I followed.

"I’m coming with you."

Frederick gave a curt nod, and we headed for the car.

Traffic was a nightmare. We inched forward at a crawl, the flashing lights of ambulances and police cars speeding past us signaling an accident ahead. Not surprising, given we were in the heart of the city.

Frederick pulled out his phone to text Lillian about the delay. A thumbs-up emoji came through in response.

But as minutes dragged on, an uneasy feeling settled in my gut. Something wasn’t right.

We were just around the corner from the university, yet—

The streets were a nightmare—cars bumper to bumper, horns blaring, the entire city at a standstill.

"Is there any way around this?" I demanded, craning my neck to see past the sea of vehicles.

"Afraid not," Frederick muttered, gripping the wheel. "Humans and their traffic."

A low growl rumbled in my chest. "I don’t have time for this. That party—I need to get there now."

Without another word, I threw open the car door and stepped out onto the pavement.

"Alpha Sebastian!" Frederick called after me, but I was already moving, weaving through the gridlock with inhuman speed. I didn’t shift—not with so many humans around—but even in this form, I was faster than any mortal or wolf.

It didn’t take long to reach the campus. The moment my boots hit the pavement, Lillian’s scent hit me like a punch to the gut. I let my wolf surge forward just enough to sharpen my senses, tracking her through the chaos.

The frat house was exactly what I expected—loud, obnoxious, packed with drunken students. Most were too far gone to notice me, but if they had been sober, they would’ve recognized me instantly. Sebastian Blackwood. A Lycan. My presence alone should’ve sent them scrambling.

I shoved through the front doors, ignoring the stumbling bodies in my way. My wolf led me down a dimly lit hallway, Lillian’s scent growing stronger with every step. My stomach twisted.

Then I heard it—muffled voices.

Hers.

And his.

Ice flooded my veins.

I turned the corner—and froze.

There he was. Some frat boy, Kyle, lifting Lillian into his arms like she was some prize. She was limp, her head lolling, eyes barely open. Drugged. Drugged.

And he had his lips against her neck, whispering something filthy.

That was it.

The world went red.

A snarl ripped from my throat—the kind that shook the walls.

###Chapter 207

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains of Lillian's bedroom, casting golden patterns across the rumpled sheets. She stretched languidly, her werewolf senses immediately picking up the faint scent of bergamot and sandalwood lingering in the air - Sebastian's signature cologne.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. "Miss Lillian? Breakfast is ready," Sophia's gentle voice called through the door.

"I'll be right down," Lillian replied, throwing off the covers. As her feet touched the plush carpet, memories of last night's confrontation with Donovan flooded back. The way his new mate Evelyn had clung to his arm, the venom in his eyes when he'd seen her with Sebastian - it all replayed in her mind like a broken record.

Downstairs, the dining room was unusually quiet. Only Oliver sat at the massive oak table, kicking his legs as he nibbled on toast. "Where's your father?" Lillian asked, taking the seat beside him.

Oliver shrugged. "Emergency pack meeting. Something about Alpha Harrison causing trouble again." He leaned closer, his whisper conspiratorial. "But Daddy said you're not to worry. Marcus is handling it."

Lillian's fingers tightened around her coffee cup. That name alone sent shivers down her spine. The memory of Alpha Harrison's drunken advances at the last pack gathering still made her skin crawl.

Theodore entered with a silver tray. "Your omelet, Miss Lillian. Chef Lucien prepared it specially - truffle and goat cheese, your favorite."

"Thank you," she murmured, though her appetite had vanished. The clock on the wall ticked ominously. In exactly three hours, she'd be facing Donovan and Evelyn again at the university's midterm presentations.

Her phone buzzed with a text from Beatrice: Don't freak out, but guess who's spreading rumors about you and Sebastian all over campus? Cassandra strikes again.

Lillian groaned. Just what she needed - more drama before her big presentation. She typed back: Meet me at the library in an hour. We need damage control.

As she gathered her books, Oliver tugged at her sleeve. "Will you pick me up from school today? Daddy might be busy."

The hopeful look in his eyes melted her heart. "Of course, sweetheart." She kissed his forehead, inhaling his childish scent of crayons and apple juice.

The drive to campus was tense. Every red light felt like the universe conspiring against her. When she finally parked, she spotted Nathaniel Whitlock leaning against his motorcycle, clearly waiting for her.

"Lillian," he called, pushing off his bike. "We need to talk about what happened at the-"

"Not now, Nathaniel," she cut him off, striding past. The last thing she needed was another confrontation, especially with someone who'd made his crush on her painfully obvious.

The library's heavy doors swung shut behind her with a definitive thud. Beatrice was already at their usual table, surrounded by open books and two steaming cups of coffee. "You look like hell," she observed bluntly.

"Feel like it too," Lillian admitted, collapsing into the chair. "What's Cassandra saying now?"

Beatrice slid a printed campus gossip blog across the table. The headline screamed: Scholarship Student Sleeping Her Way to the Top - Lillian's Secret Affair with Lycan Chairman Exposed.

Lillian's blood ran cold. Below the headline was a blurred photo of her and Sebastian leaving a restaurant last week. "This is ridiculous! We were discussing Oliver's school project!"

"I know," Beatrice soothed. "But the damage is done. Half the campus believes it, including Professor Sinclair." She hesitated. "And Donovan's been telling everyone you're a gold-digger."

The words hit like a physical blow. Lillian's vision swam as the library walls seemed to close in around her. She'd known Donovan was bitter, but this? This was downright cruel.

A new text notification popped up - Sebastian this time: Heard about the rumors. Don't engage. We'll handle this together after your presentation. Focus on your work.

Easier said than done, Lillian thought bitterly as the clock ticked closer to presentation time. The walk to the lecture hall felt like marching to her execution. Students whispered behind their hands as she passed. Some smirked; others looked at her with outright pity.

Then she saw them - Donovan and Evelyn, standing right outside the lecture hall doors. Evelyn's arm was possessively looped through Donovan's, her designer dress probably costing more than Lillian's entire wardrobe.

"Ready to embarrass yourself, scholarship girl?" Evelyn sneered as Lillian approached. "Or are you hoping your special friend will bail you out again?"

Donovan's smirk made her stomach churn. "Maybe she'll cry to get sympathy points. Worked on Blackwood, apparently."

Lillian's hands shook, but she lifted her chin. "Unlike some people, I actually earned my place here." She brushed past them, ignoring Evelyn's indignant gasp.

Inside, Professor Sinclair was already setting up the projector. He gave Lillian a disapproving once-over. "Miss Lillian, I hope you're prepared. This presentation counts for forty percent of your grade."

She swallowed hard. "I am, Professor."

As she took her seat in the front row, her phone buzzed once more. An unknown number this time: Watch your back, little wolf. The game's just getting started.

The lights dimmed for the first presentation. Lillian's pulse pounded in her ears. Whoever was behind these threats - Donovan, Cassandra, maybe even Alpha Harrison - they weren't going to stop until they destroyed her.

But she refused to go down without a fight.

The moment my growl echoed through the dimly lit hallway, the man clutching Lillian froze. His grip loosened as he turned, his face paling when he recognized who stood before him.

"Let. Her. Go." My voice was a lethal whisper, laced with the promise of violence.

Trembling, he lowered Lillian to the ground. Her head lolled to the side, her body limp, barely able to stay upright. My nostrils flared—this wasn’t just alcohol. The scent was wrong.

She’d been drugged.

The second his hands left her, I struck. My fist connected with his face with a sickening crunch. He hit the floor, blood gushing from his shattered nose.

The bathroom door creaked open, and Beatrice stumbled out, her movements sluggish. She froze, her glassy eyes widening when she took in the scene—the unconscious man, Lillian’s limp form, and me, standing over them both.

"A-Alpha Blackwood?" Her voice slurred, her pupils blown wide from intoxication. Then her gaze landed on Lillian, and she gasped. "Lillian?!" She dropped to her knees beside her friend, shaking her weakly. "Wake up! What did he do to you?!" Tears spilled down her cheeks.

I turned back to the man writhing on the floor and let my wolf surge forward, just enough for him to feel the raw, predatory energy rolling off me.

"If I ever catch you near her again," I snarled, "you won’t live to regret it."

He whimpered, clutching his broken nose, his entire body shaking. But I had no more time for him. Lillian was burning up in my arms, her breath shallow, her skin feverish. Whatever he’d given her was forcing her into heat.

A deep, warning growl rumbled from my chest, sending the lingering onlookers scrambling back. Even Beatrice flinched, her drunken haze doing little to dull her instinctive fear.

"Follow me," I ordered.

She knew better than to argue. Nodding quickly, she scrambled to her feet and trailed behind me as I carried Lillian through the now-silent house and out into the cool night air.

Frederick was already waiting by the car. The moment he saw us, he rushed to open the back door.

"Is she alright?" he asked, his voice tight with concern.

"Take Beatrice home first," I commanded. "Then bring Lillian back to the estate."

"Yes, Alpha." He helped Beatrice into the car while I carefully secured Lillian in the backseat, buckling her in before stepping back.

The night was far from over.

The seatbelt clicked into place as I slid in beside Lillian, unwilling to let her out of my sight for even a second. The air inside the car was thick with tension, her scent intoxicating, making it hard to focus on anything but her.

The drive felt endless. Traffic crawled at a snail's pace, and after dropping Beatrice off, every minute stretched into an eternity. Lillian’s breathing grew ragged beside me, her body radiating heat as she pressed closer. She buried her face in the crook of my neck, inhaling deeply, her warm breath sending shivers down my spine.

I tightened my arms around her, trying to steady her, but it only seemed to make her burn hotter. Her fingers traced slow, teasing paths up my chest, her touch igniting fire beneath my skin.

"Sebastian..." Her voice was a breathless whisper, rough with need. It was the first time she'd spoken since I'd taken her from the party. Her lips, swollen and parted, glistened in the dim light, begging to be claimed. The sight alone was enough to unravel my self-control.

But I couldn’t—wouldn’t—take advantage of her like this. Not when she wasn’t in her right mind.

Yet, when her lips brushed against my jaw, featherlight and desperate, my resolve wavered. She trailed kisses along my cheek, her breath hitching as she neared my mouth.

I couldn’t resist.

Just one taste.

The moment our lips met, I let my tongue slip past hers, savoring the sweetness of her. A soft, needy moan escaped her as I deepened the kiss, pulling her closer. She responded instantly, pressing her body flush against mine, her fingers tangling in my hair.

Her touch was electric, every movement sending waves of desire crashing through me.

But I forced myself to pull back, gripping the seat to steady my racing heart.

"Lillian," I murmured, my voice rough. "We can't—not like this."

She whimpered, her eyes glazed with need. "Please... help me."

The plea nearly shattered me.

But I wouldn’t cross that line.

Not yet.

Not until she was fully herself again.

The car rolled to a stop outside the mansion, and I exhaled sharply, gathering my frayed control.

This wasn’t over.

But for now, I had to be strong.

For her.

###Chapter 208

The morning sun filtered through the heavy velvet curtains of Lillian's bedroom, casting golden streaks across the rumpled sheets. She groaned, rolling onto her back as the events of last night came rushing back with painful clarity.

Her phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand. Beatrice's name flashed across the screen with a string of increasingly frantic messages:

"Lil, where are you?"
"Sebastian's looking for you!"
"You missed the pack meeting!"

Lillian's stomach twisted. She'd completely forgotten about the mandatory gathering. Throwing off the covers, she winced as her bare feet hit the cold marble floor. The penthouse suite Sebastian had booked for their stay at the resort felt suddenly oppressive.

A sharp knock at the door startled her. "Miss Whitaker? It's Marcus. You're needed downstairs immediately."

Lillian scrambled for her robe, fingers trembling as she tied the silk belt. "Just—just give me five minutes!"

She caught her reflection in the floor-length mirror and gasped. The delicate lace nightgown—a gift from Sebastian—was torn at the shoulder, revealing angry red marks along her collarbone. Memories of the dark forest, of rough hands and cruel laughter, sent bile rising in her throat.

The knock came again, more insistent this time. "We really must go. There's been... an incident."

When Lillian emerged, Marcus's usually composed face was tight with tension. His golden eyes flickered to her bruised neck before he quickly looked away. "The Chairman is waiting."

The elevator ride down to the conference level was excruciating. Lillian could feel Marcus's disapproval radiating off him in waves. When the doors slid open, the cacophony of raised voices hit her like a physical blow.

Sebastian stood at the center of the storm, his imposing frame radiating barely contained fury. Across from him, Alpha Maximilian Voss smirked, one arm draped possessively around a smug-looking Arabella Voss.

"—completely unacceptable behavior from your mate," Maximilian was saying, his voice dripping with false concern. "Attacking my daughter during the full moon? There will be consequences."

Sebastian's growl reverberated through the room. "Your daughter provoked her. The security footage proves it."

Lillian's breath caught. She remembered flashes—Arabella's taunting smile, the way she'd whispered about Oliver's accident, the sudden rush of red-hot rage—but the rest was a blur.

Then Sebastian turned, and his gaze locked onto hers. The raw emotion in his storm-gray eyes stole the air from her lungs. Not anger. Fear.

Marcus nudged her forward. The crowd parted like the Red Sea as she approached, whispers following in her wake.

Sebastian reached for her, then seemed to think better of it. "Are you hurt?" The question was barely audible, meant only for her.

Before she could answer, Arabella let out a dramatic gasp. "Look at her neck! Those are clearly mating marks!" She turned accusing eyes to Sebastian. "You claimed her during the challenge? That's against every tournament rule!"

The room erupted. Lillian's hand flew to her bruised skin as realization dawned. Those weren't just injuries from the fight—someone had tried to claim her last night. And it hadn't been Sebastian.

The world tilted dangerously. The last thing she saw before darkness swallowed her vision was Sebastian's face twisting in horror as he caught her collapsing form.

My arms encircled Lillian’s waist, lifting her effortlessly onto my lap as she let out a breathy, desperate moan. Her hips rolled against mine, seeking friction, seeking release. Every fiber of my being screamed to give in, but I knew better. If we crossed this line now, we’d both regret it. She wasn’t in her right mind—drugged, vulnerable. I couldn’t take advantage of her, no matter how much my wolf howled for me to claim her.

"Lillian..." My voice was rough, strained, as I brushed my lips against hers. She whimpered, her fingers tangling in my hair, trying to pull me closer. But I held her back, keeping just enough distance between us. "We can’t do this."

Her eyes fluttered open, pupils blown wide with need, her gaze hazy and unfocused. She wasn’t herself—that much was painfully obvious.

"But I need you," she rasped, her voice thick with desperation. "Please, Sebastian..."

My name on her lips sent a jolt of heat straight through me, but I clenched my jaw. "No. You’re not in control right now. You were drugged."

"It hurts," she whined, arching against me, her body trembling.

I exhaled sharply, torn between restraint and the overwhelming urge to give her what she wanted. Reluctantly, I adjusted her on my lap, keeping her close but not letting her move against me. My fingers traced slow, soothing circles along her spine, and she shuddered, a soft sigh escaping her lips.

Then her mouth found the sensitive skin of my neck, her teeth grazing, her tongue flicking out in a teasing caress. My eyes slammed shut as pleasure licked through me, her scent—sweet, intoxicating—wrapping around me like a vice.

"Lillian, stop," I growled, though my voice lacked conviction. "Not like this. Not here."

"But I want this," she murmured against my throat, her breath hot.

"You don’t know what you want right now," I insisted, even as my own resolve wavered.

Before I could argue further, the car rolled to a stop outside the mansion. Relief flooded me. I didn’t wait for Frederick to open the door—I shoved it open myself and scooped Lillian into my arms. She clung to me, her breathing ragged, her body burning against mine.

The halls were mercifully empty as I carried her upstairs, her whimpers muffled against my shoulder. The moment we reached the bedroom, I laid her on the bed and took a deliberate step back, putting space between us.

But Lillian had other plans.

Her fingers worked frantically at the buttons of her dress, peeling the fabric away until it pooled at her feet. Then her bra followed, leaving her in nothing but soaked panties that did nothing to hide her arousal. My mouth went dry. My wolf snarled, demanding I take what was being offered so freely.

Her breasts were flushed, her nipples hard and begging for attention. She cupped them in her hands, arching with a soft moan as her eyes locked onto mine—pleading, desperate.

Every instinct in me roared to give in.

But I wouldn’t.

Not like this.

Not when she wouldn’t even remember it tomorrow.


"This can't happen," I murmured, my voice barely above a whisper, rough with restraint.

"But I need you..." Lillian breathed, sliding off the bed with deliberate slowness. Her hips swayed with each step as she closed the distance between us, her gaze locked onto mine with an intensity that made my pulse spike. "I need you to touch me."

Before I could protest further, she was already there—her arms winding around my neck, her body pressing flush against mine. The heat of her skin burned through the thin fabric of my shirt, and when her lips met mine in a soft, pleading kiss, my control shattered.

I tried to pull back, tried to remind myself why this was wrong, but the moment her fingers tangled in my hair, all reason fled. "Please..." she whispered against my mouth, her breath warm and sweet. "Touch me..."

A low growl rumbled in my chest as I gave in, my hands sliding down her waist, pulling her closer. I told myself this was just to help her, just to ease whatever torment had driven her to this moment—but that was a lie.

The truth was, I wanted this.

Lillian had clawed her way into my life, into my thoughts, until she was all I could think about. And now, with her body pressed against mine, her lips desperate and seeking, I knew I couldn't resist her.

Because I needed her just as much as she needed me.

###Chapter 209

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s estate. The sun had barely risen, casting a golden hue over the sprawling gardens below. She tightened the silk robe around her, the fabric whispering against her skin.

Last night’s confrontation with Donovan still burned in her mind. His betrayal had been sharp, but the way Sebastian had shielded her—his presence steady and unyielding—had left her pulse racing in an entirely different way.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, turning to see Beatrice pushing open the door, her arms laden with a tray of steaming coffee and pastries.

"Morning, sunshine," Beatrice chirped, setting the tray on the small wrought-iron table. "You look like you didn’t sleep much."

Lillian sighed, sinking into one of the chairs. "Couldn’t. Too much on my mind."

Beatrice poured her a cup of coffee, the rich aroma filling the space between them. "Donovan?"

"Among other things." Lillian wrapped her hands around the warm mug, letting the heat seep into her fingers. "Sebastian… he’s different. I don’t know how to explain it."

Beatrice smirked. "Oh, I think you do. You just don’t want to admit it."

Before Lillian could retort, the door swung open again, and Oliver bounded in, his dark curls tousled from sleep. "Lillian! Dad says we’re going riding today. You’re coming, right?"

She couldn’t help but smile at his enthusiasm. "Of course. Wouldn’t miss it."

Oliver grinned before darting out as quickly as he’d arrived. Beatrice raised an eyebrow. "Looks like someone’s already got the Blackwood seal of approval."

Lillian rolled her eyes, but her cheeks warmed.

Downstairs, Sebastian waited by the grand staircase, his broad frame clad in a fitted riding jacket. His gaze flicked to her the moment she descended, something unreadable flashing in his dark eyes.

"Ready?" he asked, his voice low.

She nodded, ignoring the way her heart stuttered.

As they stepped outside, the stables came into view, the horses already saddled. But before they could mount, Marcus Grayson approached, his expression grim.

"Alpha," he said, inclining his head. "We have a problem."

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "What is it?"

Marcus hesitated, glancing at Lillian. "It’s about Evelyn. She’s been spotted near the border."

Lillian’s breath caught. Donovan’s new mate—here?

Sebastian’s eyes darkened. "Prepare the guards. We’re not taking any chances."

As Marcus hurried off, Sebastian turned to Lillian, his voice firm. "Stay close to me."

The command sent a shiver down her spine.

Because for the first time, she realized—she wanted to.

I drew Lillian's nipple into my mouth, rolling it between my teeth until it peaked even harder. A breathy moan escaped her lips as I lavished attention on her breasts, her scent growing headier with every passing second—thick with desire, intoxicating. My body pressed against hers, the friction of our clothed forms only heightening the tension. I hadn't bothered undressing; this wasn’t about me.

This was about her.

Whatever poison they’d slipped into her drink was potent, her heat spiraling out of control. If I hadn’t arrived when I did—if some other man had taken advantage—

A snarl rumbled in my chest at the thought. The image of Lillian writhing beneath someone else, begging for relief the way she was now, sent my wolf surging forward. I clenched my fists, forcing the beast back under control.

Her needy whimper snapped me back to the present.

Beneath me, Lillian arched, her body slick with sweat, her breaths coming in shallow gasps. I traced my fingers down her torso, claiming her lips in a searing kiss, sucking and biting until they were swollen. When she tried to deepen it, I pulled back just enough to tease, smirking at her frustrated whine.

I wouldn’t make her wait long.

My mouth trailed down her throat, lingering over her pulse before I sucked hard at the sensitive spot beneath her ear. She shuddered, fingers tangling in my hair, tugging as I licked a path down her collarbone, back to her breasts. I took my time there, savoring the way she arched into my touch, her breath hitching with every flick of my tongue.

Then lower.

Her panties were soaked through, clinging to her skin. The sight alone had my cock straining against my slacks, desperate to be buried inside her. But I forced myself to focus—she came first.

I kissed the inside of her thighs, inhaling her scent, before hooking my fingers into the lace and dragging them down her legs. The moment they were gone, I spread her wide, drinking in the sight of her—pink, glistening, perfect.

A low growl escaped me as I pressed a kiss to her inner thigh, lapping up the evidence of her need before finally—finally—brushing my lips over her clit.

She jerked, a broken moan spilling from her lips.

I smirked.

When I pulled back slightly, she rocked her hips, wordlessly begging for more. I didn’t need to be told twice.

I sealed my mouth over her, sucking her clit between my lips, teasing it with my teeth until she gasped, her thighs trembling. My tongue flattened against her, tasting every inch, alternating between slow, deliberate licks and sharp nips that had her writhing.

Her pleasure was a symphony—every whimper, every shudder, every desperate roll of her hips music to my ears.

And I wasn’t done yet.

My fingers delved deeper, exploring her with practiced precision as she writhed beneath me. The slick heat of her arousal coated my skin, her breathy moans filling the air between us.

"More... please," she gasped, her hips rolling desperately against my mouth. I smirked against her, savoring the way her body trembled under my touch. Withdrawing slightly, I added another finger, stretching her further, working her with slow, deliberate strokes before quickening my pace.

Her back arched off the bed as I curled my fingers just right, hitting that sweet spot that made her cry out. "Sebastian—!" Her voice broke on my name, nails clawing at the sheets.

I could feel her tightening around me, her thighs shaking as pleasure coiled tighter and tighter inside her. The scent of her arousal was intoxicating, sweet and heady, driving me wild. My own need throbbed painfully, but I refused to rush this.

Instead, I pressed deeper, my tongue swirling around her clit as my fingers worked her mercilessly. She was so close—her breath hitched, her body tensed—and then she shattered with a sharp cry, her release flooding over my fingers.

I didn’t let up, drawing out every last wave of her pleasure until she was limp and gasping beneath me. Only then did I pull back, licking my lips as I admired the wrecked, beautiful sight of her.

But this was far from over.

I wanted her again. And this time, I wouldn’t stop until she was screaming my name in ways she never thought possible.
###Chapter 210

The night air was thick with tension as Lillian stood frozen in the dimly lit hallway of the Blackwood estate. Her heart hammered against her ribs, each beat echoing like a drum in her ears. She had overheard something she wasn’t supposed to—something that could change everything.

Sebastian’s deep voice had been laced with urgency when he spoke to Donovan earlier. "If she finds out, we lose everything."

Finds out what? Lillian’s mind raced. She had come to the study to return a book she borrowed from Sebastian, but now, she wished she had stayed in her room.

A floorboard creaked beneath her foot, and she sucked in a sharp breath. No, no, no—

The door to the study swung open, revealing Donovan’s cold, calculating gaze. His lips curled into a smirk that sent a shiver down her spine. "Well, well. Eavesdropping, little wolf?"

Lillian straightened, forcing her voice steady. "I was just passing by."

Donovan stepped closer, his presence suffocating. "Funny. Because I could’ve sworn I heard footsteps stopping right outside the door."

Before she could respond, Sebastian appeared behind Donovan, his expression unreadable. His golden eyes locked onto hers, and for a moment, she thought she saw a flicker of something—regret? Warning?

"Lillian," he said, his voice smooth but edged with something darker. "We need to talk."

Her stomach twisted. Whatever secret they were keeping, she was now tangled in it. And from the way Donovan was grinning, she knew—this wasn’t going to end well.

Behind her, the hallway stretched endlessly, but there was no escape. Not from this.

Not from them.

The thought should have terrified me, but I was too consumed by this raw, primal need.

"Just like that..." Lillian begged, her voice trembling. "Don't stop."

As if I ever would.

I nipped gently at her clit, and that was all it took—her body arched off the bed, her breath hitching as pleasure ripped through her. She shattered beneath me, trembling violently as her climax tore through her. I didn’t let up, teasing her through the aftershocks until she was nothing but a boneless, breathless mess beneath me. Only then did I finally pull away, pressing one last kiss to her swollen flesh before trailing my lips up her body, tasting every inch of her until I reached her mouth again.

I kissed her softly, but she was already lost to sleep—her lips parted, her breathing steady, her cheeks still flushed from pleasure. The drugs had pulled her under, leaving her looking almost angelic in her exhaustion. Beautiful.

The sight made my chest tighten for a fraction of a second before I forced myself to move. My cock was painfully hard, straining against my pants, demanding relief. If I didn’t take care of it now, I’d be suffering all night.

With one last lingering glance at Lillian, I pressed a kiss to her cheek and slipped into the bathroom.

The shower hissed to life, steam curling in the air as I faced the mirror. My reflection stared back at me—flushed, sweating, my pupils blown wide with need.

What the hell was wrong with me?

This wasn’t like me. I didn’t lose control. I didn’t get this reckless, this desperate.

I shoved the thought aside and stripped, stepping under the scalding spray. Leaning against the tiles, I wrapped a hand around my aching length, hissing at the contact. It was so hard it hurt, throbbing with every beat of my pulse.

Closing my eyes, I pictured Lillian—her lips, swollen from my kisses, parting as she sank to her knees. I imagined the heat of her mouth, the way her tongue would flick against the head of my cock before taking me deeper. The way she’d gag when I pushed past her limits, her throat fluttering around me as she struggled to take every inch.

My grip tightened, strokes turning rough and fast as I lost myself in the fantasy.

I’d fist my hand in her hair, holding her still as I fucked her mouth, forcing her to look up at me. I wanted to see those pretty doe eyes watering, tears streaking her cheeks as drool spilled down her chin. I wanted her throat raw by the time I was done, so she’d feel me for hours after—every breath, every swallow, a reminder of what I’d taken from her.

My hips jerked, my cock swelling as my release built. I braced a hand against the wall, panting, lost in the image of her swallowing every drop, licking her lips clean before I dragged her up and pinned her against the shower wall.

I’d bury myself inside her, so deep she’d scream my name until her voice broke.

The thought alone was enough to push me over the edge.

With a groan, I came hard, my release spilling over my fingers as my body shuddered with the force of it.

And even then, all I could think about was her.

The mere memory of her was enough to unravel me completely.

Just the thought of Lillian sent me spiraling, my control shattering as I came hard against the shower tiles, wishing with every fiber of my being that it was her lips wrapped around me instead.

A rough groan tore from my throat as I watched the evidence of my weakness swirl down the drain. I braced my hands against the wall, letting the scalding water wash over me as I struggled to steady my breathing.

When I finally turned off the shower, I wrapped a towel around my hips and faced the fogged-up mirror. The man staring back at me was a stranger—someone consumed by a hunger I couldn’t shake.

I was addicted.

And I wasn’t sure I wanted to quit.

But one thing was certain—I needed to get the hell out of this penthouse before I did something reckless.

Because if I stayed?

I’d end up at her doorstep before dawn.

###Chapter 211

The night air was thick with tension as Lillian stood frozen in the dimly lit hallway of Sebastian Blackwood’s mansion. Her heart hammered against her ribs, each beat echoing the dread pooling in her stomach. The letter clutched in her trembling fingers felt like a ticking time bomb—its contents threatening to shatter the fragile peace she had fought so hard to maintain.

"Meet me at midnight. The truth about Donovan and Evelyn isn’t what you think."

The words, scrawled in an unfamiliar hand, had been slipped under her door moments ago. Lillian had debated ignoring it, but curiosity—or perhaps desperation—had won out. Now, as she crept toward the designated meeting spot, every shadow seemed to twist into something sinister.

A floorboard creaked beneath her foot, and she flinched.

"Relax, little wolf. It’s just me."

The voice, smooth as velvet, sent a shiver down her spine. Lillian spun around to find Marcus Grayson leaning against the wall, his piercing amber eyes gleaming in the low light.

"You?" she whispered, her grip tightening on the letter. "You’re the one who sent this?"

Marcus pushed off the wall, his towering frame closing the distance between them. "I figured you deserved to know the truth before it’s too late."

Lillian swallowed hard. "What truth?"

A smirk tugged at his lips, but there was no warmth in it. "That Evelyn isn’t just Donovan’s new mate. She’s working with Alpha Harrison to undermine Sebastian’s pack from within."

The revelation hit her like a physical blow. Lillian staggered back, her mind racing. Evelyn had always been too sweet, too accommodating—had it all been an act?

"Why are you telling me this?" she demanded, her voice barely above a whisper.

Marcus’s expression darkened. "Because if Sebastian falls, we all fall. And whether you like it or not, you’re the key to stopping it."

Before she could respond, the sound of approaching footsteps sent them both into silence. Marcus pressed a finger to his lips and melted into the shadows, leaving Lillian alone with the weight of his words—and the chilling realization that the game had just gotten far more dangerous.

Donovan had grown more cautious around Victoria ever since he nearly lost her—twice. With Lillian back in the mansion tutoring Oliver, he made sure to keep a close watch on her. Though he still intended to make her his mistress despite his engagement to Victoria, he had to tread carefully now. One wrong move, and Victoria would catch on. So, he observed from a distance, maintaining just enough space to avoid suspicion.

Yet, Victoria had been acting… off. Jumpy. As if she expected someone to leap out from the shadows at any moment. She avoided Oliver more than usual, and Lillian? She treated her like a disease. Donovan understood the latter—ever since Victoria discovered Lillian was his true fated mate, she’d been wary. He’d spun a convincing lie, of course. Claimed Lillian was still obsessed with him, only tutoring Oliver to get close. A complete fabrication, but necessary. If Victoria learned the truth? She’d leave without hesitation.

Since the revelation, Victoria had refused to touch him. Not intimately, at least. They hadn’t slept together—he’d insisted on waiting until marriage—but they’d shared plenty of heated kisses before. Now? Nothing. A full week had passed since she found out, and she recoiled at even the slightest brush of his fingers. He knew she was still furious about the deception, no matter how much he blamed Lillian.

The mansion had been chaotic lately, swarming with a film crew shooting some movie. Victoria hovered around, trying to win Celeste’s favor, and Donovan played the doting fiancé, supporting her every move. He wasn’t entirely sure why she was so determined to set her father up with Celeste. Sure, the actress was stunning, and having her as a stepmother would be… interesting. But Victoria’s fixation bordered on obsession.

Donovan had also noticed Sebastian’s absence. The Lycan chairman rarely appeared at the mansion anymore. Was it because Celeste was constantly draped over him?

"Where’s your father been?" Donovan asked over dinner. He’d taken Victoria out, hoping to reassure her of his devotion—even if it was all an act.

She glanced up, lips pursed in a frown. "What do you mean?"

"He hasn’t been around much. Only when the film crew needs him." Donovan leaned forward. "Any idea where he’s been?"

She shrugged. "Probably his office. He is the Lycan chairman. Busy man."

Donovan nodded—but he’d already checked. Earlier that evening, he’d gone to Sebastian’s office, hoping to discuss Redmoon Pack affairs. His secretary claimed he hadn’t been in for days due to the film shoot.

So if Sebastian wasn’t at his office… and he wasn’t at the mansion…

Where the hell was he?

"Are you absolutely certain there's nowhere else he might have gone?" Donovan inquired, his piercing gaze studying Victoria intently.

She hesitated for a brief moment before realization flickered across her features.

"Oh, he mentioned having business up north," she replied with a casual shrug. "We own another estate there—rarely used, but Father stays there occasionally when work takes him that way."

Donovan gave a thoughtful nod, already filing the information away. Perhaps I should pay that place a visit, he mused. The idea of dropping by unannounced was reckless—Sebastian Blackwood wasn’t the kind of man who appreciated uninvited guests—but curiosity gnawed at him. What kind of business would pull the Lycan chairman away so abruptly? And more importantly, was there a way Donovan could insert himself into the situation? After all, ingratiating himself with Sebastian remained his ultimate goal.

After their meal, Donovan escorted Victoria home, pausing at her doorstep. "I’ll see you tomorrow," he murmured, brushing a loose strand of hair behind her ear.

She offered a small, distracted smile. "Thank you for dinner," she said softly, though her voice carried an undercurrent of something heavier.

Donovan didn’t miss the shadow of worry darkening her eyes. Without a word, he pulled her into his arms, capturing her lips in a deep, lingering kiss. For a moment, she melted against him, the tension in her frame easing—just before he reluctantly pulled away.

###Chapter 212

The morning sun filtered through the heavy velvet curtains of Sebastian Blackwood's private study, casting golden streaks across the antique mahogany desk where Lillian sat nervously twisting her fingers. The scent of aged leather and sandalwood enveloped her as she waited for the Lycan chairman to finish his phone call.

"Understood," Sebastian's deep voice resonated through the room as he ended the call. His storm-gray eyes locked onto Lillian's. "We have a situation."

Lillian's pulse quickened. "Is it Donovan again?"

Sebastian's jaw tightened as he strode to the window. "Worse. Evelyn has gone missing."

"What?" Lillian shot up from her chair, knocking over a crystal paperweight that Theodore Whitmore barely caught mid-air. "When? How?"

"Last night after the pack gathering," Marcus Grayson interjected, entering with a tablet displaying security footage. "She never returned to her quarters."

The footage showed Evelyn arguing with someone in the shadows near the east gardens. Lillian's breath hitched when the figure stepped into the light. "That's... Victoria?"

Sebastian's fist connected with the wall, leaving a dent in the plaster. "My own daughter."

Lillian reached for his arm instinctively, then hesitated. "We should—"

A crash from the hallway interrupted them. Oliver burst in, his small face flushed. "Papa! Aunt Penelope says there's blood near the old stables!"

The group exchanged alarmed glances. Sebastian was already moving. "Marcus, secure the perimeter. Theodore, alert the gammas. Lillian—"

"I'm coming with you," she insisted, her werewolf senses on high alert.

As they raced toward the stables, Lillian's mind whirled. Why would Victoria target Evelyn? Was this about Donovan? The pieces didn't fit—Victoria had seemed genuinely happy about her engagement ending.

The metallic tang of blood hit Lillian's nose before they reached the clearing. Crimson droplets led to a trampled patch of grass where something—or someone—had clearly struggled. Sebastian knelt, examining a torn piece of fabric.

"Evelyn's dress," he confirmed grimly.

Oliver tugged at Lillian's sleeve. "Look!" He pointed to strange markings in the dirt—not paw prints, but something more deliberate. Symbols.

Lillian's blood ran cold. "Those are ancient Lycan runes. For... binding."

Sebastian's phone buzzed. A text from an unknown number displayed a single image: Victoria unconscious in what appeared to be a stone cellar, her wrists bound with silver chains.

The message below read: "Trade. The human for your heir. Midnight. Come alone."

Lillian's claws unsheathed involuntarily. This wasn't just about Donovan anymore. Someone was playing a dangerous game with the Blackwood legacy.

And as the wind carried the faintest trace of wolfsbane, Lillian realized with dawning horror—they weren't dealing with werewolves at all.

"I love you, Victoria," Donovan murmured against her lips, his voice barely above a whisper. "Never forget that."

For a fleeting moment, hesitation flickered in her gaze, but she nodded, offering him a fragile smile before he sealed his words with one last kiss.

As she stepped out of the car and disappeared into the villa, Donovan waited until the door closed behind her before driving off. His destination? The Northern sector of the pack. The drive was long, the road winding through dense woods until he finally spotted the imposing silhouette of a grand mansion.

And there, parked in the driveway—Sebastian Blackwood’s car.

Donovan’s fingers tightened around the steering wheel. Just as he reached for the door handle, movement caught his eye.

Sebastian burst out of the front door, his usually immaculate appearance in disarray—shirt half-tucked, hair tousled as if he’d been running his hands through it. He barely spared a glance around before sliding into his car and speeding off, tires screeching against the pavement.

Donovan sat frozen, watching the taillights vanish into the night.

Sebastian hadn’t even noticed him.

His gaze snapped back to the mansion. Only one light remained on—a dim glow from the second floor, facing the heart of the pack. A shadow moved past the window, and Donovan’s breath hitched.

Was that—

Lillian?

She stood there, staring out into the darkness where Sebastian had disappeared. Her hair was mussed, her expression unreadable—but for a heartbeat, he swore he saw something raw in her eyes. Something like sorrow.

Then she turned away.

The light flicked off.

Silence.

Donovan’s mind raced. What the hell was Lillian doing here? And why was Sebastian sneaking out like a thief in the night?

He snatched his phone, dialing the one person who might have answers.

"Hello, big brother," Arabella’s voice chimed through the speaker, light and teasing. "To what do I owe the pleasure?"

"Mom said Lillian moved in with Beatrice," Donovan bit out, his tone sharp. "Was she lying?"

A beat of silence. Then—

"I... don’t think any of us really know where she went," Arabella admitted, her voice dropping. "It all happened so fast. One minute she was packing, the next—Alpha Blackwood’s warriors showed up to take her."

Donovan’s blood ran cold.

"What?" The growl tore from his throat as his grip on the phone turned white-knuckled. "Are you telling me she’s living with Sebastian Blackwood?"

"I didn’t say that!" Arabella yelped. "But—why would someone like her be involved with him?"

The unspoken implication hung between them.

And Donovan’s world tilted on its axis.

Sebastian? I’m just saying his men escorted her out and took her somewhere. I’m assuming she’s with her friend.”

Calling Beatrice and getting any useful information out of her was impossible, but Donovan had somehow spotted Lillian in the window of that massive mansion. If what Arabella was saying was true—that meant there was a real possibility Lillian was actually living with Sebastian.

And if Sebastian had left looking disheveled, hastily fixing his shirt—could they be involved with each other?

His grip tightened around the phone until his knuckles turned white. Donovan was seething, and keeping his wolf in check was becoming exhausting.

"I don’t know anything more than that," Arabella continued.

She didn’t need to say anything else—she had already given him enough. Without another word to his sister, he ended the call and slammed the phone onto the passenger seat.

He needed to get Lillian out of that mansion before he lost her for good.

He didn’t want to involve Victoria in this—he had nearly lost her the last time Lillian was involved—but he might not have a choice. If Victoria found out Lillian was living in that mansion, acting like her father’s little plaything, she would make sure Lillian never stepped foot in there again.

A slow, cruel smirk spread across Donovan’s face.

He knew exactly what he had to do.

###Chapter 213

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains of Lillian's bedroom, stirring her from sleep. She stretched lazily, her muscles still sore from yesterday’s intense training session with Professor Montclair. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted up from the kitchen, signaling that Sebastian was already awake.

Downstairs, she found him seated at the dining table, reading through a stack of documents while Oliver chattered excitedly about his upcoming school project. The sight warmed her heart—this was the kind of domestic bliss she had never imagined she’d have.

"Morning," she murmured, pressing a kiss to Sebastian’s temple before taking the seat beside him.

He glanced up, his piercing blue eyes softening as they met hers. "Sleep well?"

"Like a log," she admitted, reaching for the coffee pot.

Before she could pour herself a cup, the front door burst open, and Beatrice stormed in, her cheeks flushed with agitation. "You won’t believe what just happened!"

Lillian arched a brow. "What now?"

Beatrice dropped into a chair, her hands trembling slightly. "I just ran into Evelyn at the café. She was with Donovan, and they were—" She hesitated, biting her lip.

Sebastian’s grip on his pen tightened. "Spit it out."

"They were talking about Victoria’s engagement party. Apparently, Donovan’s planning something big—something that involves you, Lillian."

A chill ran down Lillian’s spine. She exchanged a glance with Sebastian, whose expression had darkened.

"What kind of plan?" he demanded.

Beatrice shook her head. "I couldn’t catch all of it, but Evelyn mentioned something about ‘exposing the truth’ in front of everyone."

Lillian’s stomach twisted. The last time Donovan had tried to "expose" anything, it had nearly ruined her life.

Sebastian stood abruptly, his chair scraping against the floor. "We’re not waiting for him to make the first move."

Lillian reached for his hand, squeezing it reassuringly. "We’ll figure this out. Together."

But as she said the words, doubt gnawed at her. What truth was Donovan planning to reveal? And more importantly—was she ready to face it?

Mortification burned through me like wildfire. I couldn’t believe I had let myself get drugged last night—and worse, thrown myself at Sebastian Blackwood. The worst part? I remembered everything. No wonder he had slipped out in the middle of the night. The way he couldn’t even look at me this morning said it all.

But then I spotted the Tylertol and water on the nightstand. My stomach twisted with something between gratitude and humiliation. Sebastian had left them for me. The small act of kindness shouldn’t have made my chest ache, but it did.

I wanted to scream. To cry. To dissolve into the floor. But I swallowed it all down. I was stronger than this.

Snatching my phone from the nightstand, I winced at the flood of notifications—most from Beatrice.

Beatrice: I barely remember last night. Did you get home okay?

My fingers flew over the screen.

Me: Yeah. Sebastian took us both home. How are you feeling?

Beatrice: Like death warmed over. But I’m glad you’re okay. Did I do anything stupid?

I hesitated. She didn’t need to know about the vomiting. Or the drunken confession about her mate.

Me: Not at all. Just rest. We’ll talk later.

I set the phone down, exhaling sharply. Oh, I’d get the full story out of her—later. From what I’d pieced together, her so-called mate had been on a date with another woman. No wonder she’d drowned herself in tequila.

A mate’s betrayal was a special kind of agony.

Hunger gnawed at me as I threw on clothes and headed downstairs. The scent of something delicious led me straight to the kitchen, where Lucien Dubois was working his usual magic at the stove.

Giselle Beaumont stood nearby, arms crossed, irritation rolling off her in waves.

"I don’t know why you’re acting like this," she hissed.

"Because you’re the one who insisted we keep things professional," Lucien shot back, voice sharper than I’d ever heard.

I cleared my throat. "Everything okay?"

Giselle scowled. "Lucien’s being an ass."

He spun around, spatula in hand.

"You were the one who insisted on keeping things professional, Giselle. So how exactly am I the villain here?" Lucien challenged, his voice laced with irritation.

"Professional while we were working? We weren’t on the clock this morning when I tried to talk to you," she shot back, crossing her arms.

"Fine. Then start talking. What’s so urgent?" He arched a brow, his tone clipped.

A flush crept up Giselle’s cheeks. She glanced away briefly before meeting his gaze again. "It’s... personal. And I’d rather not discuss it here, in the middle of the kitchen," she admitted, nervously biting her lower lip.

"Then maybe you should drop it," he muttered, turning his back to her.

"Lucien, you’re acting off. What’s going on?" I finally interjected.

"Yeah, sorry. Just didn’t sleep well," he grumbled, avoiding eye contact.

"That’s a lie," Giselle accused, arms tightening across her chest. "I went to your room last night, and you weren’t there."

Lucien’s frown deepened. "Why were you in my room?"

Her face burned crimson. "Because I wanted to talk to you, but you were gone," she mumbled.

Without another word, Lucien turned back to the stove, his movements sharp as he finished the vegetable omelets. The rich aroma filled the kitchen, making my stomach growl. He was so engrossed in his task that he didn’t notice me studying him—until he turned to plate the food and caught me staring.

"Everything alright?" he asked, brow quirking.

"I could ask you the same thing," I countered. "What’s really going on between you and Giselle?"

He exhaled sharply. "We hooked up a few times to blow off steam. Now she’s acting like it meant something. One minute she wants nothing to do with me, the next she’s everywhere. It’s exhausting, being her backup plan whenever she feels like it."

I picked up my fork, nodding. "Sounds like she has feelings for you but doesn’t know how to admit it."

###Chapter 214

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s sprawling estate. The sun had barely risen, casting a golden hue over the dense forest beyond. She tightened the silk robe around her, her fingers brushing against the delicate fabric—another extravagant gift from Sebastian, one she still wasn’t used to accepting.

Inside, the mansion was already alive with activity. The clatter of dishes from the kitchen signaled Lucien’s breakfast preparations, while Giselle’s sharp voice directed the maids with practiced efficiency. Lillian exhaled, her breath forming a small cloud in the chilly air.

Three months.

That was how long she’d been living under Sebastian’s roof, bound to him not just by fate but by a promise neither of them could break. The memory of Donovan’s betrayal still stung, but the sharp edges of that pain had dulled with time. Now, there was only the quiet hum of uncertainty—what did the future hold for her in this world of Lycan politics and power plays?

A knock at the door pulled her from her thoughts.

"Lillian?" Beatrice’s voice was muffled through the wood. "You decent?"

Lillian chuckled. "Since when do you care?"

The door swung open, revealing Beatrice in a rumpled T-shirt and pajama bottoms, her dark curls a wild halo around her face. She held two steaming mugs, one of which she thrust toward Lillian.

"Drink. You look like you need it."

Lillian accepted the coffee, the rich aroma wrapping around her like a warm embrace. "What’s the occasion?"

Beatrice flopped onto the plush armchair by the fireplace, her expression unusually serious. "I heard something last night. Something about Donovan."

Lillian’s grip tightened around the mug. "What about him?"

"He’s back in town. And he’s not alone."

A cold weight settled in Lillian’s stomach. "Evelyn?"

Beatrice nodded. "They were spotted at The Silver Moon. Apparently, they’re making quite the scene."

Lillian’s jaw clenched. The Silver Moon was a high-end club frequented by the elite of their world—Lycan and werewolf alike. If Donovan was there with Evelyn, it wasn’t just a casual outing. It was a statement.

Before she could respond, the door opened again, and Sebastian strode in, his presence filling the room effortlessly. Dressed in a tailored suit, his dark hair slightly tousled, he looked every bit the powerful Lycan chairman he was. His sharp gaze flicked between them.

"Am I interrupting?"

Beatrice smirked. "Just girl talk. Nothing you’d be interested in."

Sebastian arched a brow but didn’t press. Instead, he turned to Lillian. "We have a meeting with Alpha Harrison in an hour. He’s pushing for an alliance."

Lillian frowned. "Since when do we need alliances with him?"

Sebastian’s lips curved into a humorless smile. "Since Donovan started making moves of his own."

The unspoken tension in the room thickened. Beatrice whistled low under her breath. "Well, isn’t this turning into a delightful morning?"

Lillian set her coffee down, her mind racing. If Donovan was making a play for power, and Alpha Harrison was involved, then the fragile peace they’d built was about to shatter.

And she was right in the middle of it.

Sebastian’s phone buzzed, and he glanced at the screen, his expression darkening. "We need to leave now."

Lillian didn’t ask why. The look in his eyes told her everything she needed to know.

The game had just changed.

And the stakes?

They’d never been higher.

Lucien raised his brows at me, his expression a mix of amusement and irritation.

"I think she enjoys playing games with me. What do you think?" He sighed, running a hand through his dark hair. "I'm just tired of it. Even I deserve a little more respect than that, don't I?"

"Well, yes, of course," I agreed, stirring my coffee absently. "But maybe she doesn’t want to play games anymore. Perhaps that’s what she’s been trying to tell you since last night."

He shot me a sharp look, his golden eyes narrowing.

"It doesn’t matter," he said dismissively, leaning back in his chair. "We don’t have a future. This was only ever meant to be fun. Nothing more."

I gave him a knowing smirk, taking a bite of my fluffy omelet. The rich flavors burst on my tongue, and I couldn’t help but hum in satisfaction. "I don’t think that’s true," I countered. "You wouldn’t be this upset if you didn’t care for her at least a little."

Lucien rolled his eyes, but there was a flicker of something unreadable in his gaze. "I like sex," he admitted bluntly. "She knew what this was from the beginning. I don’t do commitment. And she’s not the only one I’ve been with this week."

I wrinkled my nose in distaste. "Disgusting, Lucien."

He laughed, plucking an olive from my plate and tossing it into the air before catching it effortlessly in his mouth. Cocky bastard.

"Well," I said pointedly, "when you finally decide to take a relationship seriously, you should keep Giselle in mind."

His lips curled into a smirk as he poured himself another cup of coffee. "I’ll think about it."

I smiled to myself, satisfied with my meddling.

After breakfast, I went to find Giselle, wanting to make sure she was okay. Unsurprisingly, she was just as conflicted as Lucien—confused, upset, and clearly smitten. Just as I’d suspected, she wanted more than just a fling. She’d spent all night agonizing over it, mustering the courage to tell him, only for him to vanish before she could. And this morning? He’d brushed her off completely.

When I found her, she was crying softly in one of the mansion’s quiet corridors. We had a quick but heartfelt talk before she hurried off to her duties, her eyes still red-rimmed.

The rest of the weekend passed in solitude. I wasn’t surprised that Sebastian hadn’t come back—after practically throwing myself at him, I hadn’t expected him to.

Monday arrived, and I met Beatrice in the student lounge to study for upcoming exams. I wanted to ask her about her mate and what she knew, but judging by the way she—

The way Lillian avoided eye contact and shifted uncomfortably told me everything. She clearly didn’t want to talk about it. What she probably didn’t realize was that she’d already let slip enough for me to piece things together. Not wanting to embarrass her further, I stayed quiet, waiting for her to bring it up first.

But she never did.

By the time Frederick arrived to pick me up and drive me back to the Blackwood estate, the sun had dipped low in the sky. My breath hitched when I spotted Sebastian standing outside the grand entrance, his broad frame silhouetted against the fading light.

Had he been waiting for me?

"Hey…" I murmured as I stepped out of the car, my pulse quickening as I approached him. There was something almost boyish about the way he stood there, hands tucked into his pockets, like a loyal hound waiting for its master.

"Hey," he replied, his deep voice sending a shiver down my spine.

I tilted my head. "What are you doing out here?" I tried to keep my tone light, but the slight edge in my voice betrayed me. Two days. Two whole days without so much as a text. Not that I was keeping track—okay, maybe I was. Just a little.

"Oliver’s inside," he said, nodding toward the mansion. "He’s been waiting for you."

My stomach twisted with disappointment. Right. Of course. Oliver was still training here until the film crew wrapped up at the villa. "Thanks," I muttered, moving to walk past him.

Before I could take another step, his fingers curled around my wrist, stopping me in my tracks.

"About the other night," he said abruptly, his grip firm but not painful. My heart stuttered at the mention of that night. When I lifted my gaze to meet his, the intensity in his dark eyes made my cheeks burn. "I’m sorry."

I frowned. "For what?"

"For leaving like that," he admitted, his thumb brushing absently over my pulse point. "You were drugged, confused—"

"I remember," I cut in, my voice barely above a whisper.

His brows shot up. "You remember?"

I bit my lower lip, the memories flooding back—his hands on my skin, the way he’d soothed me through the feverish haze of my heat. "Yeah. And I never got to thank you… for, uh… helping me." My eyes dropped to the ground, suddenly fascinated by the cobblestone beneath my feet.

Silence stretched between us as he studied me, his gaze heavy. Then, just when I thought the tension would suffocate me, he spoke again.

"I’m glad it was me."

My head snapped up, surprise flickering through me.

"Yeah," I exhaled softly, my voice barely above a whisper. His lips curved into that familiar, heart-stopping smile as he closed the distance between us.

"Next time you need help... promise you'll call me," he murmured, his deep voice sending shivers down my spine.

Heat flooded my cheeks, and I nodded eagerly, my pulse racing.

"Okay," I managed to say, breathless. "I promise."

Before I could steady myself, his arms encircled me, pulling me flush against his chest in a warm, possessive embrace. The scent of him—spice and something uniquely him—wrapped around me, making my head spin. For a fleeting moment, time seemed to pause, the world narrowing to just the two of us.

Then—

"Lillian!" Oliver's voice shattered the quiet, his impatient shout echoing from the doorway. "I'm ready for tutoring! Stop hugging my dad and get in here!"

The spell broke.

I stiffened, my face burning even hotter as Sebastian chuckled against my hair before reluctantly letting me go.

Third Person POV

Donovan arrived at Lillian’s school late on Monday evening, timing his arrival just as her classes were about to end. He had spent the entire weekend watching her, but she hadn’t left the Blackwood estate in the past two days—nor had Sebastian returned since Friday night. Frustrated, Donovan had no choice but to park outside the school and wait, his grip tightening on the steering wheel as he kept his eyes locked on the entrance.

When Lillian finally emerged, she slipped into the same sleek black car she always used—Sebastian’s driver’s vehicle. Donovan’s jaw clenched. They were probably heading to her tutoring session with Oliver. Following them now would be pointless if they were just going back to the villa… but he couldn’t stop himself.

Keeping a safe distance, he trailed them, weaving through traffic to avoid suspicion. But when they entered Silver Crescent territory and took an unfamiliar route, Donovan’s pulse quickened. This wasn’t the way to the villa. After a few more minutes, they arrived at a grand mansion in the northern borderlands.

Donovan pulled over, watching as Lillian stepped out of the car. His breath hitched when he spotted a tall figure waiting at the entrance—Sebastian. The Lycan chairman stood there, his posture stiff yet expectant as Lillian approached. They exchanged words, and Donovan strained to listen, rolling down his window just enough to sharpen his hearing. But as a future Alpha, his senses weren’t strong enough yet.

Then, something worse happened.

Sebastian stepped closer, and Donovan saw the way Lillian’s cheeks flushed, her lips curving into a soft smile. The way Sebastian wrapped his arms around her—too intimate, too possessive—sent a surge of fury through Donovan. His wolf snarled, claws digging into his palms as he fought the urge to lunge from the car.

Instead, he grabbed his phone and snapped several photos, capturing every damning moment.

Just then, Oliver’s voice rang out from inside the mansion, calling for Lillian. Sebastian ran a hand through his dark hair, watching her go before exchanging a few words with the driver and following her inside.

Donovan’s blood boiled. Without hesitation, he pulled up Victoria’s contact. He had to be careful—if she suspected he was stalking Lillian, she’d leave him for good.

Attaching the photo, he typed:

Donovan: I was looking for your father to discuss pack matters. You mentioned he was at the northern mansion, so I went to find him… and saw this.

He hit send, then waited, his chest tight with anticipation.

Meanwhile, Victoria sat alone in the villa when the message came through. The film crew had gone into the city for dinner after a long day of shooting, and Oliver had left for his tutoring session.

Now, she stared at the screen, her fingers trembling.


###Chapter 215

Victoria sighed as she glanced at her phone. As usual, her father, Sebastian Blackwood, was supposedly at his northern mansion dealing with rogue attacks—or so he claimed. Lately, his behavior had been odd, but she hadn’t bothered to pry.

A part of her wondered if the "rogue attacks" were just an excuse to avoid Celeste Devereaux. The thought made her lips twitch. Since that very public kiss in front of the cameras, things had been tense. She knew her father wasn’t thrilled about it, but he’d get over it eventually.

Her phone buzzed, pulling her from her thoughts. A small smile curved her lips when she saw Donovan’s name flash across the screen. He hadn’t messaged much today, but over the past week, he’d been attentive—almost too attentive—and it warmed her in ways she didn’t want to examine too closely.

Then she opened the message.

Her stomach dropped.

Attached was a photo—her father, standing outside the northern mansion, arms wrapped around Lillian.

Donovan’s accompanying text was casual, almost too casual. "Had business with your father. Ran into Lillian. Thought you should know."

Victoria’s fingers tightened around her phone. She wasn’t sure she believed his innocent tone, but that didn’t matter. The truth was right there in the image.

No rogue attacks. No urgent pack business.

Just her father.

And Lillian.

Together.

Her heart twisted.

He had lied to her.

And now she knew exactly where—and with whom—he’d been spending his time.
###Chapter 216

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the lavish bedroom, but Lillian barely noticed. Her fingers trembled as she clutched the crumpled letter in her hands—the one Donovan had slipped into her bag before storming out of the café yesterday.

"Meet me at midnight. The old oak by the lake. Or else."

The words burned into her mind, each syllable laced with venom. She knew what this meant. Donovan wasn’t done with her. Not yet.

A soft knock at the door startled her. "Lillian?" Sebastian’s deep voice carried through the wood, smooth yet edged with concern. "You missed breakfast."

She hastily shoved the letter under her pillow, forcing a smile as she opened the door. "Sorry, I just... overslept."

Sebastian’s piercing gaze lingered on her face, as if he could see right through the lie. His jaw tightened, but he didn’t press. "Oliver’s been asking for you. He wants to show you his new sketch."

Guilt twisted in her chest. She’d been so consumed by Donovan’s threats that she’d neglected the little boy who adored her. "I’ll be right down."

As Sebastian turned to leave, his hand brushed hers—a fleeting touch that sent warmth spiraling through her. But the moment was shattered by the sharp ring of her phone.

Unknown number.

Her stomach dropped.

"Tick-tock, little wolf. Midnight won’t wait."

The screen went black, but the threat lingered, suffocating.

Downstairs, the mansion buzzed with its usual morning chaos. Beatrice chattered excitedly to Evelyn about some new boutique in town, while Oliver proudly displayed his crayon masterpiece—a lopsided but endearing portrait of Lillian with wolf ears.

"Look, Lillian! It’s you!" he beamed.

She forced a laugh, ruffling his hair. "It’s perfect, sweetheart."

But her eyes kept darting to the clock.

Sebastian leaned against the doorway, arms crossed. "Something’s wrong," he murmured, low enough that only she could hear.

Lillian swallowed hard. "It’s nothing."

His fingers curled around her wrist, gentle but firm. "Don’t lie to me."

The intensity in his gaze made her breath hitch. For a heartbeat, she considered telling him everything—about the letter, the text, the way Donovan’s presence still haunted her like a ghost.

But then Evelyn’s shrill laugh cut through the air, and the moment shattered.

"God, Lillian, could you be any more obvious?" Evelyn sneered, flipping her hair. "Stop clinging to Sebastian like some desperate—"

"Enough." Sebastian’s voice was ice.

Evelyn paled, snapping her mouth shut.

Lillian exhaled shakily. She couldn’t drag Sebastian into this. Not when Donovan had already proven how far he’d go to hurt her.

Midnight loomed like a guillotine.

And she had no choice but to face it alone.

Fury coiled like a venomous serpent in Victoria's chest as her fingers tightened around her phone. She needed Lillian out of that mansion—now. The girl was clearly using this tutoring gig as a stepping stone to worm her way back into Donovan's life, and judging by the way things were unfolding... it was working.

Victoria knew people in the media. If whispers of this little "relationship" reached the right ears, it would send Lillian running. Maybe for good this time.

She scrolled through her contacts until she landed on a name she knew all too well. With a sharp exhale, she pressed call and lifted the phone to her ear.

"Please tell me you've got something juicy for me," her friend drawled, sounding half-asleep. "I'm drowning in dry spells here. One more fluff piece and I might as well hand in my resignation."

A smirk curled Victoria's lips. "Oh, I think I’ve got exactly what you need." She loved his desperation—it meant he’d go all out for this story. "Check your inbox. I just sent you something."

A beat of silence. Then—

"What the hell is this?" he muttered. "Is that your dad?"

"Mm-hmm," Victoria purred. "That’s my father, wrapped around his much younger lover. My brother’s tutor. She’s practically my age, and trust me, she’s not here for the teaching gig. She’s after my fiancé. Expose her. Dig up whatever dirt you can and run this story."

Her friend snorted. "Since when do I take orders from you?"

Victoria rolled her eyes. "Do you want the scoop or not?"

A dark chuckle. "Oh, I want it. Give me twenty-four hours, and this’ll be plastered on every gossip site in the city."

"That’s what I was hoping to hear," she murmured, satisfaction dripping from every word. "Don’t disappoint me."

She ended the call and leaned back, watching the first domino tip.

Lillian’s POV

"So why are we doing tutoring here?" Oliver asked, kicking his legs under the coffee table after Sebastian disappeared upstairs to shower.

I arched a brow. "You don’t like it?"

He shrugged. "It’s fine. Just... far. Did you have to drive forever to get here?"

I smirked. "Closer than you’d think. Don’t worry about it. But yeah, we’re stuck here for the foreseeable future. At least until the film crew clears out of the villa."

Sebastian nodded.

"It's overwhelming there with so many people," he admitted, running a hand through his dark hair. "I'm glad to get out of that chaos. It's nice here. Peaceful."

I smiled, tucking a loose strand of hair behind my ear. "Well, maybe we can spend more time here even after they leave," I suggested. "I'm sure your father won't mind."

His golden eyes brightened as he nodded eagerly.

Just then, Giselle walked into the room carrying a silver tray of delicate pastries. The moment she spotted Oliver, her face lit up with genuine warmth.

"I thought I heard your voice," she said, setting the tray down before opening her arms for a hug. "It's been too long. You never come to visit anymore."

Oliver sighed. "I know. Dad never lets me come here."

Giselle winked. "Well, I'll just have to scold him for that."

Oliver laughed, the sound light and carefree. "Please do."

I'd never seen him so relaxed around anyone outside of family—or me. It was refreshing to witness, especially knowing how uncomfortable he'd been with his previous tutors.

As Giselle turned to leave, my gaze caught on a faint red mark peeking out from beneath the high collar of her uniform. A hickey. I bit back a smirk. I bet I know exactly where that came from. But I kept quiet, not wanting to embarrass her.

Oliver and I spent the next few hours alternating between tutoring and training. At one point, Sebastian joined us, and it was fascinating to watch the two of them spar—Oliver clearly adored every moment with his father.

What surprised me most was when Sebastian decided to stay the night at the mansion, even after sending Oliver home with Marcus. I hadn't expected him to linger, but he did, and we made the most of our time together.

By morning, however, my phone buzzed with a message from Beatrice.

All it said was: 911.

My stomach twisted. I immediately dialed her number.

"Beatrice? Are you okay?" I demanded the second she picked up.

"I'm fine... but you might not be," she murmured, her voice tight with worry.

"What do you mean?"

"You're all over the news, Lillian," she said, and my blood ran cold.

Heart pounding, I pulled up the headlines on my phone—and there it was. A massive photo of Sebastian and me locked in an embrace on the mansion's front porch.

My breath caught in my throat as my eyes landed on the scandalous headline splashed across the tabloid: Sebastian Blackwood's Secret Affair Exposed!

Beneath it, a grainy but unmistakable photo showed the imposing Lycan chairman locked in a passionate embrace with none other than me—Lillian Montague—on the grand marble steps of his estate. The caption beneath screamed:

Sebastian Blackwood caught in midnight tryst with mystery lover, Lillian Montague!

The world tilted. My fingers trembled as they clutched the glossy page, the words blurring before me. How? We had been so careful. The night had been quiet, the estate grounds empty—or so I’d thought.

But someone had been watching.

And now, our secret was out.
###Chapter 217

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian hurried across the campus quad. Her phone buzzed incessantly in her pocket—another message from Donovan, no doubt. She clenched her jaw, refusing to check it.

He made his choice.

The memory of Evelyn’s smug smile flashed in her mind, twisting her stomach. But she wouldn’t let it break her. Not again.

"Lillian! Wait up!" Beatrice’s voice cut through her thoughts. Her best friend jogged toward her, cheeks flushed from the cold. "You’re not seriously skipping Professor Sinclair’s lecture again, are you?"

Lillian sighed. "I can’t focus today."

Beatrice looped an arm through hers. "Then let’s grab coffee. Gabrielle just got a new pumpkin spice blend."

Before she could protest, Beatrice dragged her toward the café. The warmth inside was a stark contrast to the biting wind outside. Gabrielle waved from behind the counter, her dark curls bouncing.

"Two lattes, extra whipped cream?" she guessed, already reaching for the cups.

Lillian managed a small smile. "You know us too well."

As they settled into a corner booth, Beatrice leaned in. "Okay, spill. What’s really going on?"

Lillian traced the rim of her cup. "Sebastian texted. He wants to meet tonight."

Beatrice’s eyes widened. "The Lycan chairman? After everything?"

"He says it’s important."

"Or he’s just playing games." Beatrice scowled. "You know how these high-ranking wolves are—all power moves and no heart."

Lillian’s fingers tightened around her cup. "What if it’s about Oliver?"

Beatrice hesitated. "Okay, fine. But I’m coming with you."

Lillian shook her head. "He said alone."

A tense silence settled between them. Outside, the wind howled, rattling the café windows like a warning.

That evening, Lillian stood at the edge of Blackwood Manor’s sprawling gardens, her breath visible in the cold air. The mansion loomed ahead, its windows glowing like watchful eyes.

Sebastian emerged from the shadows, his broad frame silhouetted against the moonlight. "You came."

Her pulse spiked. "You said it was urgent."

He stepped closer, his scent—cedar and something darker—wrapping around her. "I need your help."

She scoffed. "Since when does a Lycan chairman need help from a college student?"

His gaze burned into hers. "Since my enemies started targeting you."

A chill ran down her spine. "What?"

Sebastian pulled out a folded note. "This was left at my office today."

Lillian unfolded it, her hands trembling as she read the scrawled threat:

"End things with her, or she’ll disappear like your wife did."

Her blood turned to ice.

Sebastian’s voice was low, dangerous. "I won’t let that happen. But I need to know—who have you told about us?"

Lillian’s mind raced. Who knew? Who would care enough to threaten Sebastian?

Then it hit her.

"Donovan," she whispered.

Sebastian’s eyes flashed gold. "Your ex-fated mate?"

Before she could answer, a twig snapped in the darkness behind them.

Sebastian snarled, shoving Lillian behind him as a figure stepped into the moonlight.

Evelyn smirked, her crimson lips curling. "Aw, did I interrupt something?"

Lillian’s heart pounded. This wasn’t a coincidence.

Sebastian’s growl reverberated through the night. "You have three seconds to explain why you’re here."

Evelynn laughed, tossing her hair. "Oh, Sebastian. Always so dramatic." She held up her phone, the screen displaying a live feed—of Oliver, asleep in his bed. "Let’s talk terms."

Lillian’s vision blurred with rage.

Game on.

The hot water from the shower had barely dried on my skin when I wrapped a towel around my waist and stepped out. The bedroom was empty—no sign of Lillian. My gaze swept over the rumpled sheets, my jaw tightening. She hadn’t even woken me before leaving.

I dressed quickly, not bothering with my damp hair, and strode downstairs. The moment I turned the corner, Giselle nearly collided with me.

"Where's Lillian?" I demanded, adjusting the hem of my shirt.

Giselle blinked up at me, startled. "She left early for school, Alpha."

My steps halted. "She left?"

"Yes, sir." Giselle dipped her head and scurried away before I could press further.

A low growl rumbled in my chest. She’d slipped out without a word. No goodbye, no explanation. Was this because of him? That insufferable Lucien Dubois. I tolerated the man only because his cooking was exceptional—though lately, the only thing that made this wing of the packhouse worth returning to was Lillian herself.

The rich aroma of breakfast hit me as I entered the kitchen. Lucien stood at the center of it all, effortlessly charming the kitchen staff with his smooth words and roguish grin.

"Enough flirting," I snapped, making him freeze mid-laugh.

He turned, flashing me that infuriating smirk. "Apologies, Alpha. But can you blame me? You surround me with such lovely distractions."

I clenched my jaw. "You’re paid to cook, not seduce my staff."

Lucien tilted his head, undeterred. "Why not both?"

My eyes narrowed. "What about Giselle?"

His smirk faltered.

Good. He hadn’t expected me to know about that. I made it my business to know everything that happened under my roof—especially when it involved my head chef and head maid sneaking around.

I saw the way Giselle looked at him—those lingering glances, the subtle touches that weren't so subtle. More than once, I'd caught them whispering in the supply closet or heard muffled laughter from his bedroom when I passed by. And that massive hickey Giselle was trying—and failing—to hide? Please. I wasn’t an idiot.

"We're just friends with benefits," Lucien murmured, flipping a pancake with practiced ease. "She knows what this is."

I didn’t buy it. If the way Giselle gazed at him like he hung the moon was any indication, she was head over heels for the fool. He was breaking her heart, and soon enough, she’d probably quit. Working alongside someone who shattered you? Nearly impossible.

I shook my head. "This is exactly why you don’t mess with coworkers."

He had the decency to look sheepish but stayed silent as he finished plating breakfast. With a smooth motion, he slid the plate toward me.

"Is Lillian coming down soon?" he asked.

I frowned. Did he really not know she’d already left? Guess that answered my earlier question.

"No, she left early this morning," I said, stabbing a fork into the fluffy pancakes. Damn him—they were perfect.

Lucien froze. "Without eating? Why would she rush off without even saying good morning? That’s not like her."

"Giselle mentioned she had an early class," I said around a mouthful. "Said she was running late."

Lucien’s jaw tightened. "She told Giselle and not me?"

I smirked. "Obviously. Giselle’s her handmaiden. You’re just the chef. She doesn’t owe you an itinerary."

He crossed his arms, eyes narrowing. "Well, since you got this intel from Giselle, I’m guessing she didn’t tell you either, Alpha."

The audacity. Normally, I’d have someone’s throat for that tone—but something about Lucien’s smirk made me bite back a laugh. I schooled my face into a glare instead.

After a beat, he cleared his throat and gestured to the sink. "I should probably clean up."

"You think?" I snapped.

The second he turned away, I let my guard down, shaking my head with a quiet chuckle.

Once I finished eating, I headed straight to my villa. The film crew should’ve wrapped by now—

Any moment now and I'll finally reclaim my personal space. I'd been steering clear of Celeste ever since that impulsive kiss—the one she'd orchestrated to make the tabloids believe there was something between us. The second the scandal broke, I'd called every major media outlet, demanding an immediate retraction. My blood had boiled seeing those fabricated headlines splashed across every gossip site, but what's done is done.

To avoid further complications, I'd given her the run of the estate while I divided my time between the mansion with Lillian and my office. The distance was necessary, though not without its frustrations. Every corner of the penthouse still carried traces of Celeste's cloying perfume—a relentless reminder of her calculated games.

Lillian, at least, had become an unexpected refuge. Her quiet presence in the library or the gardens was a balm to the chaos. She never pried, never demanded explanations. Just existing nearby with her sketchbook or a novel, radiating calm like moonlight through storm clouds.

Meanwhile, the staff tiptoed around me, especially Giselle and Lucien, exchanging glances whenever Celeste's name came up. Even Theodore, usually unflappable, had developed a telltale stiffness in his posture at the mention of her scheduled departure.

I checked my watch. Three more days until the film crew wrapped shooting. Three more days until the villa stopped feeling like a damned movie set. My phone buzzed—another message from Damien about location permits. I silenced it with a sigh.

Somewhere downstairs, a door slammed. Celeste's laughter floated up the staircase, followed by the click of stilettos on marble. My jaw tightened. Soon. Very soon, this would all be just another footnote in the tabloids' archives.

Until then? I'd keep to my wing, my office, and the rare moments of peace Lillian unknowingly provided. The countdown had begun.

###Chapter 218

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the Blackwood estate as Lillian stirred beneath silk sheets. Her fingers brushed against the empty space where Sebastian should have been, the lingering warmth suggesting he'd only recently left. She stretched, her muscles protesting slightly from last night's passionate encounter.

Downstairs, the scent of freshly brewed coffee mingled with Lucien's famous blueberry pancakes. Lillian padded into the kitchen to find Oliver already seated at the marble island, his legs swinging as he enthusiastically stabbed at his breakfast.

"Morning, sleepyhead," Beatrice chirped from her stool, her neon pink nails tapping against her coffee mug. "Sebastian left early for some pack business. Said he'd be back by lunch."

Lillian accepted the steaming cup Giselle offered, inhaling the rich aroma. "Did he say what kind of business?"

Beatrice shrugged. "Something about Alpha Voss sending envoys. You know how territorial these Lycans get."

The front door burst open before Lillian could respond. Sebastian strode in, his usually impeccable charcoal suit slightly rumpled, a deep frown marring his handsome features. Behind him, Marcus Grayson carried an ornate wooden box that made the hairs on Lillian's arms stand up.

"We have a problem," Sebastian announced, his golden eyes locking onto Lillian's. "Voss sent this."

He flipped open the box's lid to reveal a silver dagger resting on black velvet - the exact twin of the one Donovan had used to threaten Lillian months ago. The blade bore fresh bloodstains.

Lillian's wolf growled low in her chest. "Where's Donovan now?"

"That's just it," Marcus interjected. "He's disappeared. Vanished from the Winslow estate last night. His sister Arabella claims he left voluntarily, but..."

Sebastian's jaw tightened. "But the timing is suspicious. Voss wouldn't send this unless he had something planned."

Beatrice gasped. "You don't think... the challenge?"

Sebastian nodded grimly. "The annual Alpha Summit begins tomorrow. If Voss makes his move there..."

Lillian's coffee turned to acid in her stomach. The Summit gathered every major Lycan Alpha in the country - the perfect stage for a power play. And with Donovan missing...

Her phone buzzed violently on the counter. An unknown number. She swiped open the screen to reveal a single blood-red text: "You should have chosen me when you had the chance."

The mug slipped from Lillian's fingers, shattering against the tile as the past came rushing back in a crimson tide.

The filming was nearing its conclusion, so I'd promised Damien I would at least show up for the next few days.

"Oh, hello, Daddy," Victoria said as she descended the stairs, her arms crossed. "You were gone all night. Everything alright?" I raked my fingers through my damp hair and nodded. "Just business up north. Nothing you need to worry about. Did Oliver get to school okay?"

"Yes, Marcus took him," she answered, shifting her weight. "Donovan is picking me up later, so I won’t be home. Will Lillian be here today?"

"Not while the film crew is around," I told her, my tone firm. "But we need to talk about what happened between you two."

Victoria’s lips pressed into a thin line, her arms tightening across her chest.

"It was about Donovan," she muttered. "I wasn’t in the wrong."

"You attacked her, Victoria," I reminded her sharply.

"She started it!" she snapped, defiance flashing in her eyes. "It wasn’t my fault. I was defending my position as his future wife and Luna. She’s just jealous—"

"Ever since you found out Lillian is his fated mate, you’ve been nothing but hostile toward her," I pointed out.

At one point, Victoria and Lillian had been close—friends, even. But lately, that had changed. I wasn’t blind; I’d simply chosen not to interfere. But now, her behavior was causing disruptions in my household, and I wouldn’t tolerate it. She needed to understand that her resentment toward Lillian was unwarranted.

"I have every right to be upset," she hissed, her eyes narrowing. "They both lied to me!"

"Exactly. They both lied. You forgave Donovan—why not Lillian?"

She rolled her eyes, avoiding my gaze. "Because Donovan explained his intentions."

I frowned. "I’m sorry, what?"

Before she could respond, a new presence entered the foyer.

"Alpha Sebastian..." Celeste purred as she approached, her steps slow and deliberate. "Have you come to watch the shoot?"

"Yes," I answered tersely. "I promised Damien I’d be here today."

She fluttered her lashes, her lips curving into a practiced smile. "I wanted to talk to you about the other night," she murmured, then paused when she noticed Victoria.

"I’ll let you two talk," Victoria said quickly, already backing away.

"We’ll finish this conversation later," I called after her, but she was already hurrying out of the room. I exhaled, watching my daughter practically flee from a discussion she desperately needed to have.

Turning my attention back to Celeste, I suppressed a sigh. She had become an unwelcome complication in my life, stirring up issues without even realizing it.

"What can I do for you?" I asked, keeping my tone neutral.

She tilted her head, her smile turning coy. "Oh, Alpha... I think you already know."


The morning sun cast golden streaks across the marble floors as I stepped into the grand foyer of the villa. Celeste Devereaux stood there, her fingers twisting nervously in front of her. The usually poised actress looked uncharacteristically uncertain.

"I wanted to apologize," she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper. "My behavior was... embarrassing."

I arched a brow, though my expression remained impassive. "It’s already forgotten," I assured her, my tone clipped. "You can put it behind you."

Not in the mood for drawn-out conversations, I moved past her, my polished shoes clicking against the marble as I strode toward the back patio. The film crew was bustling about, packing equipment and preparing to relocate to the pack center. Today would be chaos—the first time they were shooting in public. By now, word had undoubtedly spread like wildfire through the pack.

Damien Laurent, the director, gave me a curt nod as I approached. Without a word, I helped them load the last of the equipment into the vans. As expected, the moment we reached the town square, pandemonium erupted.

Paparazzi swarmed like vultures, their cameras flashing incessantly. Onlookers pressed against the barricades, phones raised to capture every moment. My security team struggled to hold them back, but sheer numbers made it a losing battle. Most of them were desperate for Celeste’s attention, shouting her name in hopes of a reaction.

"Alpha Blackwood!" one reporter barked, shoving against a guard. "Do you have a minute for questions?"

The guard—built like a brick wall—barely budged. I barely spared the man a glance.

"Not now," I said coolly, turning away.

But he wasn’t deterred. "What about the rumors of your new relationship?" he called after me, his voice sharp with accusation. "Are they true?"

My steps faltered for half a second.

Celeste appeared beside me then, her eyes bright with something dangerously close to hope. She reached for my hand—

I jerked away, my glare sharp enough to make her flinch. She took a hasty step back, her cheeks flushing.

"I—I’m sorry," she stammered. "I just thought, since we’re both single—"

I cut her off with a single, icy sentence.

"Who said anything about being single?"

The silence that followed was deafening.
###Chapter 219

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting a golden glow over the room. Lillian stretched lazily, her body still humming with the remnants of last night’s passion. Beside her, Sebastian Blackwood lay sprawled across the bed, his muscular frame taking up most of the space. His dark hair was tousled, and the sheets barely covered his sculpted torso.

A soft knock at the door interrupted the peaceful silence.

"Come in," Lillian called, pulling the sheets higher.

The door creaked open, and Oliver’s small face peeked in. "Dad? Lillian?" His voice was hesitant, his big eyes darting between them.

Sebastian stirred, blinking sleepily before sitting up. "What is it, Oliver?"

Oliver fidgeted, clutching a stuffed wolf toy to his chest. "I had a bad dream."

Lillian’s heart softened instantly. She patted the space beside her. "Come here, sweetheart."

Oliver scrambled onto the bed, nestling between them. Sebastian ruffled his son’s hair, his expression uncharacteristically tender. "Tell us about the dream."

"It was dark," Oliver whispered, his voice trembling. "And there were monsters. They wanted to take me away."

Lillian wrapped an arm around him, pulling him close. "No one’s taking you anywhere. Your dad and I won’t let that happen."

Sebastian’s jaw tightened, a flicker of protectiveness flashing in his eyes. "She’s right. You’re safe here."

Oliver sniffled, then looked up at Lillian with sudden curiosity. "Are you going to be my new mom?"

The question caught her off guard. Lillian’s cheeks warmed, and she glanced at Sebastian, whose expression was unreadable.

Before she could answer, the door burst open, and Evelyn stormed in, her face flushed with anger. "There you are!" she snapped, glaring at Lillian. "I’ve been looking everywhere for you!"

Sebastian’s demeanor shifted instantly, his body tensing like a coiled spring. "Evelyn," he growled, his voice laced with warning. "You don’t barge into my room uninvited."

Evelyn ignored him, her gaze locked onto Lillian. "You think you can just waltz in here and replace me? You’re nothing but a cheap imitation!"

Oliver whimpered, pressing closer to Lillian.

Lillian’s pulse quickened, but she kept her voice steady. "I’m not trying to replace anyone. I just—"

"Save it," Evelyn spat. "Donovan may have been fooled by your act, but I see right through you."

Sebastian stood, his towering presence filling the room. "That’s enough. Get out."

Evelyn hesitated, her confidence wavering under his glare. With a final scowl, she turned on her heel and stalked out, slamming the door behind her.

Silence settled over the room once more. Oliver looked up at Lillian, his eyes wide. "Is she going to hurt you?"

Lillian forced a smile, though her stomach churned. "No, sweetheart. She’s just upset."

Sebastian exhaled sharply, running a hand through his hair. "This isn’t over."

Lillian met his gaze, a silent understanding passing between them. The peace they’d found was fragile, and the storm was far from gone.

But for now, she held Oliver close, determined to protect him—and herself—from whatever came next.

Celeste stood frozen, her mind reeling from Sebastian's words. Had she heard him correctly? Was he actually confirming his relationship with Lillian? She had assumed it was just a fling—nothing Victoria had mentioned suggested her father was seriously involved. The heat rushed to her cheeks as the paparazzi captured her humiliation in perfect, high-definition clarity.

Before Celeste could respond, one of the photographers cut in.

"Actually, we're referring to your relationship with Lillian Montague."

Sebastian stiffened, his expression momentarily blank before his eyes sharpened with fury. Celeste could see the confusion flicker across his face before it was replaced by something far more dangerous. He turned on the paparazzi with a glare that could melt steel.

"What the hell are you talking about?" he growled, his voice low and lethal.

The photographers exchanged uneasy glances. One of them cleared his throat and pulled out his phone, swiping to a photo of Sebastian and Lillian locked in an intimate embrace.

Celeste leaned in, her stomach plummeting when she saw the image. Her throat tightened, and she took an instinctive step back. Being seen with him now would ruin her. The tabloids would paint her as the villain—the woman who tried to steal another’s mate. It was clear Victoria had downplayed their relationship, and Celeste felt like a fool for trusting her. She wanted Sebastian, yes, but not at the cost of her reputation. She had worked too hard to be labeled a homewrecker.

"Take this down. Now," Sebastian demanded, his voice laced with barely restrained rage.

The paparazzi scrambled, pulling out their phones to make frantic calls. In the chaos, Sebastian turned his glare on Celeste, who looked just as bewildered as the rest of them.

"Did you know about this?" he snapped.

She shook her head immediately. "No," she answered truthfully.

He studied her face, then exhaled sharply, dragging a hand through his hair. "I have to go," he muttered before striding away without another word.

Damien appeared moments later, frowning as he watched Sebastian leave. "Everything alright?"

Celeste sighed. "Yeah. But I think I need to back off. He's clearly taken. I was misled..."

"Sorry to hear that," Damien said gently. "Maybe it's for the best. Now you can focus on the film."

Celeste nodded, but her mind was already racing. She had a reputation to protect—and a career to salvage.

Celeste nodded and turned to face the director.

"You're absolutely right. Let's wrap this up already."

They spent the next several hours finishing the final scenes. The crew was set to leave in a few days, and honestly, Celeste couldn’t wait. She needed a break—some time to just breathe before diving into post-production edits.

Later that night, as Celeste was about to head upstairs for some much-needed rest, Victoria’s voice cut through the quiet.

"Where’s my father?"

Celeste froze mid-step, one hand on the railing. She turned slowly, arching a brow. "How should I know?" She crossed her arms. "Probably with his girlfriend."

Victoria’s eyes narrowed. "What are you talking about?"

"Please," Celeste scoffed. "You used me as a pawn. I don’t know what your problem is with Lillian Dumont, but my career matters. I won’t get dragged into your petty drama."

"Lillian?" Victoria’s voice sharpened. "She’s not his girlfriend. She’s a gold-digging social climber who only wants one thing—his money."

Celeste smirked, pulling out her phone. "Oh, really? Because the tabloids say otherwise." She shoved the screen in Victoria’s face.

Victoria’s breath hitched.

The headline blared: "Billionaire Lycan Chairman’s Mystery Lover Revealed!"

The article painted Lillian not as a mistress, but as Sebastian Blackwood’s official love interest. Worse—the comments were flooded with praise. People adored the idea of them together, calling them a "power couple."

Victoria’s stomach twisted. This was the opposite of what she’d wanted. She’d intended to humiliate Lillian, not elevate her.

"I want nothing to do with this," Celeste snapped, snatching her phone back. "Now, if you’ll excuse me."

Victoria watched, seething, as Celeste disappeared upstairs.

Her hands clenched into fists.

It wasn’t fair.

How did Lillian always win? She had Donovan’s lingering obsession, and now she was stealing her father’s attention too?

Fine.

If Lillian wanted a war, she’d get one.

Victoria knew one thing for certain—Sebastian Blackwood would always choose his children over anyone else.

And she was about to remind him of that.
###Chapter 220

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the marble floors of Sebastian Blackwood's penthouse as Lillian stirred awake. Her limbs tangled in silk sheets that smelled faintly of cedar and something distinctly Sebastian. The events of last night flooded back - the gala, the whispered threats from Donovan, Sebastian's protective embrace that had lasted far longer than necessary.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. "Miss Lillian?" Giselle's crisp voice carried through the door. "Mr. Blackwood requests your presence in the dining room. There's... a situation."

Lillian's bare feet hit the cold floor as she scrambled for her discarded dress. The urgency in the head maid's tone sent adrenaline coursing through her veins. She found Sebastian standing rigid by the floor-to-ceiling windows, his knuckles white around a crumpled newspaper.

"Morning, sleeping beauty," he said without turning, voice dripping with sarcasm. "Care to explain why my ex-fiancée's face is splashed across Page Six with claims you pushed her down a staircase?"

Lillian's breath hitched. "That's impossible! Victoria left the gala perfectly fine last night!"

Sebastian finally turned, revealing dark circles under his stormy eyes. "Yet here we are. The Winslows are demanding retribution, and the board is calling an emergency meeting." He tossed the paper onto the glass coffee table where the headline screamed: "LYCAN HEIRESS ATTACKED BY ROGUE WEREWOLF."

The door burst open before Lillian could respond. Oliver charged in, his small face flushed. "Dad! Aunt Penelope says there's reporters everywhere and we can't go to school and-" His wide eyes locked onto Lillian. "Are you really in trouble?"

Sebastian's jaw tightened as he scooped up his son. "Everything's under control, champ. Why don't you help Lucien make those chocolate croissants you love?"

As Oliver scampered off, Sebastian's phone buzzed incessantly. He glanced at the screen and cursed. "Donovan's giving interviews. Claims he warned me about your violent tendencies." His gaze burned into Lillian. "This reeks of setup."

Lillian's fingers trembled as she scrolled through her own phone. Social media had exploded with #JusticeForVictoria hashtags. Campus forums she'd frequented now featured threads debating whether werewolves belonged in human society at all. The most damning post came from Cassandra - a blurry photo of Lillian near the grand staircase captioned: "Some people will do anything to climb the social ladder."

The intercom crackled. "Sir?" Marcus's voice held uncharacteristic tension. "Alpha Harrison's here with the Winslow family. They're demanding... well, they're demanding Miss Lillian be handed over for disciplinary action."

Sebastian's canines elongated. "Like hell." He grabbed Lillian's wrist. "We're leaving through the service elevator. Marcus will stall them."

"But running makes me look guilty!" Lillian protested even as Sebastian dragged her toward the back hallway.

His grip tightened. "And staying makes you dead. The Winslows don't play fair, darling. Not when their precious bloodline's at stake."

As the elevator doors closed, Lillian caught a glimpse of Oliver peeking around the kitchen doorway, his small face crumpled in confusion. The last thing she heard before descending was Archibald Winslow's booming voice: "That mongrel has until sundown to turn herself in, or we'll tear this city apart to find her."

The game had changed overnight. And Lillian wasn't sure even Sebastian could protect her from what came next.

The morning sun filtered through the heavy drapes of Lillian's bedroom, casting golden streaks across the rumpled sheets. She stretched languidly, her muscles protesting slightly from last night's training session with Sebastian. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted upstairs, mingling with the faint aroma of bacon - Lucien must have started breakfast early today.

Downstairs, the mansion buzzed with unusual activity. Giselle directed a team of maids carrying floral arrangements through the grand foyer while Theodore coordinated security details with Marcus near the entrance. Lillian paused at the top of the marble staircase, her bare feet sinking into the plush carpet.

"Good morning, Miss Lillian," Theodore greeted with his usual impeccable timing, looking up from his tablet. "Mr. Blackwood is expecting you in his study after breakfast."

Her stomach fluttered at the mention of Sebastian. Even after all these months, the mere thought of him sent her pulse racing. "Thank you, Theodore. Is Oliver up yet?"

"The young master is already in the garden with Miss Victoria," he replied, adjusting his cufflinks. "They're preparing for today's... special occasion."

Lillian frowned. Special occasion? She'd been so preoccupied with her final exams and pack duties that she'd completely forgotten if there was some event scheduled. Before she could ask, Beatrice burst through the front doors, her arms laden with shopping bags and her cheeks flushed with excitement.

"There you are!" Beatrice exclaimed, nearly dropping a Tiffany-blue box in her haste. "I've been calling you for hours! We have so much to do before tonight!"

Lillian caught the tumbling box with werewolf reflexes. "What's happening tonight?"

Beatrice's eyes widened comically. "You can't be serious. The annual Blackwood Gala? The event everyone in high society kills to get invited to?" She grabbed Lillian's wrist and dragged her toward the east wing. "We have exactly," she checked her diamond-encrusted watch, "seven hours to turn you from campus werewolf to Lycan royalty."

As they rounded the corner, Lillian nearly collided with a solid chest. Strong hands steadied her shoulders, and she didn't need to look up to recognize Sebastian's distinctive sandalwood and leather scent.

"Running late, little wolf?" His deep voice rumbled against her ear, sending shivers down her spine.

Beatrice immediately straightened, suddenly very interested in her manicure. "I'll just... go set up in your room," she muttered, making a hasty retreat.

Lillian tilted her head back to meet Sebastian's piercing gaze. The morning light caught the silver streaks in his dark hair, making him look every inch the powerful Lycan chairman he was. "You could have reminded me about the gala," she accused lightly.

His lips quirked in that infuriatingly sexy half-smile. "Where would be the fun in that?" He leaned down, his breath warm against her cheek. "Besides, I enjoy watching you flustered."

Before she could retort, his phone buzzed. The shift in his demeanor was immediate - his shoulders tensed, his jaw tightened. "I have to take this," he said curtly, already striding away. "Don't be late tonight, Lillian. It's... important."

As he disappeared down the hallway, Lillian caught a whiff of something unexpected beneath his usual scent - the faintest trace of... anxiety? That wasn't like Sebastian at all. Whatever was happening tonight, it was clearly more than just another society event.

Her phone chimed with a text from Beatrice: Get your butt up here NOW. We have a crisis - Celeste Devereaux just arrived unannounced and she's wearing YOUR color scheme.

Lillian groaned. Just what she needed - a showdown with the famous actress who'd made no secret of her designs on Sebastian. Whatever secrets tonight held, one thing was certain: this gala would be anything but ordinary.

Lillian was about to learn that lesson the hard way.

Everywhere she turned, eyes followed her. The whispers were relentless, the stares unbearable. She had tried to keep her head down, but how could she when the entire campus had seen the scandalous headline? According to the tabloids, she was in a serious relationship with Sebastian Blackwood—something that couldn’t be further from the truth.

He had texted her that morning, assuring her he would handle it, telling her not to worry. But the damage was already done. The article had spread like wildfire, and now, everyone had an opinion about her love life.

Her stomach twisted with humiliation. The worst part? It was all a lie. She and Sebastian weren’t together. They were just… keeping things uncomplicated. Casual. Nothing more than physical. But explaining that to the entire school would only make both of them look worse, so she kept her mouth shut.

"It’s not as bad as you think," Beatrice said, looping her arm through Lillian’s. "Seriously. People will move on soon enough."

Lillian shot her a skeptical look, her fingers tightening around the strap of her bag. "How can you be so sure?" she muttered, hugging herself. "This was supposed to stay private."

Beatrice shrugged, glancing around at the students who kept sneaking glances at them. "Trust me. Something juicier will happen, and then no one will even remember your name."

Lillian exhaled sharply. "I hope you’re right."

They parted ways, and Lillian forced herself through each class, though it was impossible to focus when she could feel the gossip swirling around her. The only thing keeping her sane was the thought of seeing Sebastian after school. He would fix this. He had to.

She waited outside the school gates, alone. Beatrice had an after-school study session, so Lillian stood by herself, tapping her foot impatiently. She checked her phone with a frown—Frederick was never late. Usually, he was already waiting for her before she even stepped outside.

Sinking onto a nearby bench, she propped her elbows on her knees, her mind racing. The media frenzy, the whispers, even the way her professors had eyed her today—it was all too much.

Then, a sleek black car pulled up in front of her.

Her breath hitched.

It wasn’t Frederick’s car.

The door swung open, and her entire body went rigid as a familiar figure stepped out.

"Tell me it’s not true," Donovan demanded, striding toward her.

Lillian’s pulse spiked. "Donovan?" she choked out, disbelief flooding her. What was he doing here? They were in public. If he caused a scene now, it wouldn’t just ruin his reputation—it would destroy any chance he had left.

And yet, here he was.

Staring at her like she had betrayed him.

Like she was the one who had walked away.

The tension in the air was suffocating as Donovan blocked my path, his dark eyes burning with fury. I could practically feel the heat radiating off him, his jaw clenched so tightly I feared his teeth might shatter.

"I saw the news, Lillian," he spat, shaking his head as he stepped closer, invading my personal space. "Tell me it's not true. Are you really involved with him?"

I crossed my arms, tilting my chin up defiantly. "Whether it's true or not, it's none of your business."

His lip curled in disgust, his face twisting into something ugly. "None of my business?" he repeated, voice dripping with venom. "He's going to be my father-in-law! Do you have any idea how twisted that is? I can't believe you'd stoop so low!"

A bitter laugh escaped me. "You left me for another woman, Donovan. What I do now is my choice, not yours." I took a step back, my patience wearing thin. "I don’t know why you’re here, but this harassment needs to stop."

I moved to walk past him, my pulse racing. Frederick wasn’t here yet, but anywhere was better than standing in front of Donovan’s wrath.

He wasn’t having it.

His hand shot out, fingers digging into my arm as he yanked me back, forcing me to face him. His grip was bruising, his breath hot against my face as he snarled, "I won’t let you go back to him, Lillian. You were mine first, and I’m not letting you go that easily."

The possessiveness in his voice sent a chill down my spine.

But I wasn’t the same weak girl he’d left behind.

I wrenched my arm free, glaring up at him. "I don’t belong to anyone—least of all you."

His eyes darkened, a storm brewing in their depths.

And I knew this wasn’t over.

Not by a long shot.
###Chapter 221

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains, stirring Lillian from her restless sleep. She blinked against the light, her mind still foggy from the whirlwind of emotions that had consumed her the night before. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted into the room, a comforting reminder that she wasn’t alone in Sebastian’s sprawling estate.

Downstairs, the mansion hummed with quiet activity. Maria moved gracefully through the halls, setting the breakfast table while Lucien, the head chef, prepared an elaborate spread. The aroma of warm pastries and sizzling bacon filled the air, but Lillian’s stomach twisted with unease.

She had barely slept, replaying the confrontation with Donovan in her mind. His betrayal still stung, but what unsettled her more was the way Evelyn had looked at her—like she was the one who had stolen something precious.

A soft knock at the door pulled her from her thoughts.

"Lillian?" Beatrice’s voice was gentle but firm. "You’ve been in there forever. Are you coming down or do I have to drag you?"

Lillian sighed, rubbing her temples. "I’ll be down in a minute."

She forced herself out of bed, splashing cold water on her face before slipping into a simple sundress. The reflection in the mirror showed dark circles under her eyes, evidence of the sleepless night.

When she finally descended the stairs, the dining room was already lively. Oliver was chattering excitedly about his upcoming school project, while Sebastian listened with quiet amusement. His sharp gaze flicked to Lillian as she entered, and for a moment, the air between them crackled with unspoken tension.

"Good morning," he murmured, his voice low and smooth.

Lillian managed a small nod before taking her seat beside Beatrice.

"You look like you wrestled a ghost," Beatrice whispered, nudging her with an elbow.

Lillian snorted. "Close enough."

Sebastian’s phone buzzed, and his expression darkened as he read the message. He stood abruptly, his chair scraping against the floor.

"We have a problem," he announced, his tone leaving no room for argument.

Lillian’s pulse quickened. "What is it?"

"Donovan’s pack is making moves near the northern border. They’ve challenged our patrols."

A heavy silence settled over the table. Beatrice’s grip tightened on her fork.

Lillian swallowed hard. "He’s trying to provoke you."

Sebastian’s jaw clenched. "And it’s working."

The air thickened with tension, the unspoken question hanging between them—what would they do next?

Lillian met his gaze, her voice steady despite the storm inside her. "Then we answer."

Sebastian’s lips curled into a dangerous smile. "Exactly."

The game had just begun.

My breath hitched as I stared at Donovan, his face twisted in fury, his grip on my wrist like a vice. Pain shot up my arm, but I clenched my jaw, ready to flip him onto the pavement. All those years of combat training meant I could take him down in seconds. I’d never used my strength against him before—didn’t want to bruise his fragile ego—but enough was enough. He’d crossed the line for the last time.

Just as I reached for his arm, a sickening crunch echoed through the air. Donovan collapsed, blood gushing from his nose, his grip on me instantly slackening. I stumbled back, blinking in shock. His agonized curses filled the air as he writhed on the ground, clutching his shattered nose.

Then I saw him—Marcus Grayson, Beta of the Blackwood pack, standing over Donovan with a clenched fist, knuckles still red from impact.

"Touch her again," Marcus snarled, his voice a lethal whisper, "and I’ll break more than just your nose."

My pulse pounded in my ears, the reality of what just happened sinking in slowly. Marcus turned to me, his sharp gaze scanning for injuries.

"Are you hurt?" he demanded.

I shook my head, still processing. "What are you doing here?"

"Alpha Blackwood sent me. The paparazzi are out for blood." His lips curled in amusement. "They’ve been hounding the estate all day, trying to dig up details about you and him. Sebastian’s been pulling strings to shut them down, but they keep circling back like vultures."

My stomach dropped. "So I can’t go home?"

"Not unless you want to be swarmed."

"You bastard!" Donovan spat from the ground, still groaning in pain.

Marcus ignored him, jerking his chin toward the sleek black car idling nearby. "Let’s go."

I slid into the backseat without another glance at Donovan. The moment we left campus, my jaw nearly hit the floor.

Marcus hadn’t been exaggerating.

Dozens of photographers swarmed the streets, cameras flashing as they lunged toward the car, desperate for a shot. The tinted windows shielded me, but the sheer hunger in their eyes sent a chill down my spine.

This wasn’t my world. I wasn’t someone who got noticed.

And yet, here they were—hunting me like prey.

By the time we reached the villa, the paparazzi were far behind us. Extra security guards stood watch outside the wrought-iron gates, ensuring no unwanted intruders could slip past. The sight of them eased the tension in my shoulders—we were finally safe.

"What about my tutoring session... and the film crew?" I asked as Sebastian parked the sleek black car in the driveway.

"The film crew wrapped up early today," he replied, his deep voice steady. "Your tutoring session will be here. It’s not safe to return to the mansion yet."

Marcus had been waiting inside when we entered, and the brief flicker of relief in his sharp eyes didn’t escape me. But right now, my nerves were too frayed to dwell on it.

"I'm handling it," he assured me before I could even speak. "If I have to smash every last one of their cameras, I will."

"Marcus already told me everything," I said, shaking my head. "I doubt it’ll come to that. But who took that photo in the first place?" That was the question gnawing at me all day—someone had been lurking outside the mansion, waiting for the perfect moment to snap that incriminating shot. The thought sent an uneasy chill down my spine.

Marcus frowned, his jaw tightening.

"I don’t know," he admitted. "But I will find out. And when I do, their phone won’t be the only thing destroyed."

A small smile tugged at my lips despite myself. He could be so fiercely protective—adorable in his own intense way. I would’ve teased him about it if the pack gammas and Beta hadn’t suddenly surrounded us.

"Is Oliver in the parlor already?" I asked, glancing around, half-expecting to see the little boy darting toward me.

"Yes," Marcus confirmed. "By the time your session is over, it’ll be safe for you to return to the mansion. You have my word."

I nodded, though uncertainty still lingered in the back of my mind. Still, I trusted him.

I moved to step past him toward the parlor, but his hand shot out, fingers wrapping gently around my wrist. The contact sent a jolt of electricity through me—warmth flooded my cheeks, and my pulse kicked up a notch.

"We’ll talk later, okay?" His voice was low, intimate, meant only for me.

I bit my lower lip, praying the others didn’t notice the flush creeping up my neck.

"Okay," I murmured before slipping away and heading toward the parlor.

Inside, Oliver was already hunched over his books, scribbling furiously in his notebook. I arched a brow as I shut the door behind me.

"What’s all this?" I asked, gesturing at the chaos—three open textbooks, scattered papers, and a notebook filled with his messy scrawl.

He barely glanced up. "Homework," he muttered. "Dad said I have to finish it before dinner."

I smirked. "And you waited until now to start?"

Oliver groaned dramatically, flopping back against the couch. "It’s boring."

Laughing, I settled beside him. "Well, lucky for you, I’m here to make it less painful."

He shot me a skeptical look. "You promise?"

"Cross my heart."

With a dramatic sigh, he shoved a textbook toward me. "Fine. But if I fall asleep, it’s your fault."

I rolled my eyes. "Deal."

But as I helped him work through his assignments, my mind kept drifting back to the paparazzi, the photo, and the lingering question—who had betrayed us?

And more importantly—what else were they planning?
###Chapter 222

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains, painting delicate patterns across the silk sheets. Lillian stirred, her body still humming with the lingering warmth of last night’s passion. Beside her, Sebastian lay sprawled, his muscular frame taking up most of the bed, his breathing slow and steady.

She traced the faint scars along his shoulder, remnants of battles fought long before she entered his life. A small smile tugged at her lips. Mine. The word echoed in her mind, fierce and possessive.

The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted into the room, signaling that Giselle, the head maid, had already begun her duties. Lillian carefully slipped out of bed, not wanting to wake Sebastian. She padded barefoot to the window, pushing aside the heavy drapes to gaze at the sprawling estate below.

The gardens were already alive with activity—gardeners trimming hedges, staff setting up for the day’s events. Today was important. The annual Lycan Summit was being held at Blackwood Manor, and tensions were high.

A knock at the door startled her. "Come in," she called softly.

The door creaked open, and Oliver peeked in, his dark curls tousled from sleep. "Morning, Lillian," he whispered, his bright eyes darting to Sebastian before returning to her. "Did I wake you?"

She shook her head, motioning for him to join her. "Not at all. Couldn’t sleep?"

He shrugged, a habit he’d picked up from his father. "Too excited. All the Alphas are coming today."

Lillian ruffled his hair. "And you get to meet them properly this time."

Oliver grinned, but then his expression faltered. "Do you think… Alpha Harrison will be here?"

Her fingers stilled. The memory of that night—drunken laughter, hands too rough, fear coiling in her gut—flashed through her mind. She forced a smile. "If he does, he won’t dare look at you or me. Your father made sure of that."

Sebastian’s voice, rough with sleep, cut through the quiet. "Damn right I did."

Lillian turned to see him propped up on one elbow, his amber eyes sharp despite the early hour.

Oliver beamed. "Dad!"

Sebastian smirked. "Come here, trouble."

The boy bounded over, clambering onto the bed with all the grace of an overexcited puppy. Lillian watched them, warmth blooming in her chest.

Then, a sharp knock—urgent this time.

Marcus, Sebastian’s Beta, stood at the door, his expression grim. "Alpha, we have a problem."

Sebastian’s playful demeanor vanished. "What is it?"

"Alpha Voss just arrived early. And he didn’t come alone."

Lillian’s stomach dropped. Maximilian Voss. The rival Lycan chairman who had been circling Blackwood’s territory like a vulture.

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "Where is he?"

"At the gates. With an entourage."

Lillian exchanged a glance with Sebastian. This wasn’t just a courtesy visit.

War was coming.

And it had just knocked on their door.

Oliver glanced up, a mischievous grin spreading across his face.

"I wanted to finish this quickly so we could spar outside!" he said excitedly. "Though I kinda miss the mansion. It was nicer there."

"Your father thinks it's safer here with all the paparazzi around," I explained. "Until things settle down, it's better if we stay."

I hoped Sebastian would resolve the issue soon. The last thing I wanted was to remain under the same roof as Victoria. The tension between us was already unbearable, and spending more time with her father would only make things worse.

Oliver nodded thoughtfully before flashing another grin.

"So… are you going to be my mom?"

I nearly choked on air as I sat beside him.

"Excuse me—what?" I blurted, snapping my head toward him.

He shrugged as if he hadn’t just dropped that bombshell.

"I saw the news. I’m not clueless," he said, eyeing me with a knowing look that made my cheeks burn. "And I wouldn’t mind if you were. Actually, I’d really like it."

My heart clenched. I didn’t want to hurt him, but marriage to Sebastian? That wasn’t even on the table.

"Oliver… maybe we should talk about this another time?"

His smile dimmed slightly, but he nodded. He wasn’t stupid—he knew I was dodging the question. Still, he was polite enough not to push.

We finished his homework, then headed to the backyard to spar. Now that the film crew was gone, we finally had the space to ourselves again.

I didn’t notice we had company until Oliver’s eyes widened in surprise.

"Oh, hello, Miss Devereaux," he greeted.

I turned—and nearly dropped my sword when I saw Celeste approaching. She gave Oliver a brief nod before her sharp gaze landed on me. My face heated under her scrutiny.

"H-Hello," I managed, hating how my voice faltered.

"Can we talk?" she asked coolly.

My pulse spiked. What could she possibly want with me? I glanced at Oliver, who took the hint and quickly resumed his archery practice.

Forcing a smile, I faced Celeste. "What’s this about?"

A perfectly arched brow lifted. "You know exactly what this is about." Her voice was smooth, deliberate. "You and Sebastian."

My cheeks burned hotter than before. I wanted to explain that what we had wasn’t exactly a relationship—at least, not in the way she assumed. But the words stuck in my throat. My wolf refused to let me speak them, as if denying the truth would somehow make it less real. I wasn’t sure what that meant, but I found myself pressing my lips together and letting her continue.

Celeste sighed, her expression earnest. "Had I known he was already involved with someone, I never would have pursued him," she admitted. "I just wanted you to understand—I’m not the kind of woman who steals another’s mate. And I can’t afford to have the tabloids painting me that way."

Her words caught me off guard.

"No one’s calling you that," I reassured her quickly.

She bit her lip, a faint flush creeping up her neck. "I kissed him on camera. Sooner or later, someone will connect the dots. Right now, they’re too focused on his new romance to dig deeper. Sebastian’s trying to suppress the stories, but… I can’t risk my reputation."

Before I could think better of it, the words tumbled out. "If it comes to that, I’ll tell them our relationship is new—that he was single when you met him."

The moment I said it, I wanted to take it back. Was I really about to publicly claim I was involved with Sebastian Blackwood? As if my life wasn’t complicated enough already.

Celeste blinked, surprised, then slowly nodded.

"Just don’t make it sound like he left me for you," she said with a playful wink, though her tone held an edge of warning. Then, softer, she added, "I truly am sorry for any confusion. I thought whatever was between you two wasn’t serious. I wouldn’t have crossed that line otherwise."

"It’s fine," I said, forcing a smile. "We kept things quiet. That’s not your fault."

Her shoulders relaxed slightly, and she gave a small nod.

"Well, that’s all I wanted to say." She turned to leave but hesitated, glancing back. "Oh, and Lillian?"

"Yes?"

Her gaze turned unexpectedly sincere. "Hold onto him. Tightly. He’s a good man… and he deserves someone who won’t let go, no matter what."

The moon hung low over Blackwood Manor as Lillian paced her bedroom, her bare feet sinking into the plush carpet. Outside her window, the scent of night-blooming jasmine mixed with the faint metallic tang of lycan pheromones - Sebastian was nearby again.

She paused mid-step when her phone buzzed violently against the mahogany nightstand. Beatrice's name flashed across the screen with three heart emojis - their secret code for urgent gossip.

"Tell me you're not still obsessing over Donovan's engagement party," Beatrice's voice crackled through the speaker before Lillian could even greet her.

Lillian's fingers tightened around the phone. "I wasn't—"

"Liar. Your scent is practically screaming anxiety from across campus." Beatrice's tone softened. "Listen, Vivienne just called. The Winslows are bringing that Evelyn girl to the pack gathering tomorrow. You need to—"

A sharp knock at the door made Lillian jump. "One sec," she whispered, padding across the room.

The door swung open to reveal Sebastian's imposing frame filling the doorway, his silver eyes glowing faintly in the dim light. Behind him, little Oliver peeked around his father's legs, clutching a worn stuffed wolf.

"Papa said you're sad," the boy announced solemnly. "We brought chocolate."

Sebastian held up a velvet box from La Maison du Chocolat, the scent of dark cocoa and sea salt wafting through the air. "Oliver insisted on the caramel-filled ones."

Lillian's throat tightened. These small kindnesses from the Blackwood men always undid her completely.

Beatrice's muffled voice came through the phone: "Lil? You still there? This is important—"

Sebastian's gaze dropped to the device in her hand, his expression darkening when he recognized Beatrice's voice. "Tell Beatrice we'll discuss pack business tomorrow."

Oliver tugged at his father's sleeve. "Can Lillian read me my story now? The one about the brave she-wolf?"

As Sebastian's large hand came to rest possessively on her lower back, Lillian felt the familiar electric current between them. Beatrice's warning about Evelyn would have to wait - the Blackwood men had claimed her attention, just as they'd claimed her heart.

But beneath the warm domesticity, Lillian couldn't shake the feeling that tomorrow's gathering would change everything. The Winslows never made moves without calculation, and Evelyn's sudden appearance reeked of Donovan's meddling.

She allowed herself to be led toward Oliver's room, Sebastian's fingers tracing secret patterns against her spine. Whatever storm was coming, they'd face it together - Alpha and Luna, as fate intended.

###Chapter 223

By the time we finished training, the sun had already dipped below the horizon. Exhaustion weighed on me like a second skin, and all I wanted was to return to the mansion—to Sebastian. The memory of his fingers grazing my arm earlier sent a shiver down my spine, my cheeks flushing at the thought. A small, secretive smile tugged at my lips.

"What are you smiling at?" Sebastian's voice cut through my thoughts. I froze mid-step as I turned the corner, finding him leaning casually against the corridor wall, arms crossed over his broad chest.

"Just thinking," I teased, brushing past him toward the bathroom. But his hand shot out, fingers wrapping around my wrist, spinning me back to face him. In an instant, my back met the wall, his body caging me in. Heat flared under my skin, my breath hitching as his proximity sent sparks through my veins.

We were alone—thankfully—because if anyone saw us like this, the rumor mill would never stop churning.

"What were you thinking about?" he murmured, lips quirking in that infuriating smirk. My pulse hammered wildly as I met his gaze.

"Wouldn’t you like to know?" I shot back, wiggling in vain against his hold. His grip only tightened, pinning me effortlessly. Before I could protest, his lips crashed onto mine, igniting a fire that raced through every nerve.

His kiss was softer than I expected, his lips moving against mine with practiced ease. A teasing swipe of his tongue against my bottom lip had me parting for him without hesitation. A soft moan escaped me as I tangled my fingers in his hair, pulling him closer.

Celeste’s words echoed in my mind: He deserves someone who will stay, no matter what.

Was that me? Could I trust my heart to another man after Donovan had shattered it so completely? What if Sebastian hurt me the same way? Did he even want something real with me?

Questions swirled, but right now, all I wanted was his mouth on mine. He lifted me effortlessly, my legs wrapping around his waist as his hands slid beneath my shirt, tracing the bare skin of my back. The bathroom door loomed ahead—until a scream shattered the moment like glass.

Sebastian dropped me so fast I barely registered the impact before my back hit the floor with a painful thud. A sharp curse slipped past my lips as he bolted down the corridor toward the commotion.

Gritting my teeth, I pushed myself up, only to hiss in pain as a sharp ache shot through my leg. I hadn’t even realized I’d hurt it in the fall.

"Miss Lillian?" Marcus’s voice startled me as he rounded the corner. "Are you all right?" He rushed forward, steadying me before I could collapse again.

"Just a clumsy fall," I muttered, forcing a smile. "Who screamed?"

"Victoria took a tumble down the stairs," he said, brows furrowed. "Sebastian’s with her now. He wants you taken home."

"What about the paparazzi?" I asked, wincing as I tested my weight on my injured leg.

Marcus chuckled. "Sebastian handled it. The stories were pulled, and after his threats, they won’t dare cross him again." He slipped an arm around my waist, guiding me toward the foyer.

Sebastian stood there, cradling a sobbing Victoria. His glare snapped to Marcus the second we entered.

"Where the hell were you?" he growled.

Marcus blinked. "You said to take Lillian home—"

"Frederick can do that. This is more important," Sebastian snapped. "We need to get to the hospital. Now."

The words stung like a slap. Of course, his daughter came first—but the way he dismissed me without a second glance cut deeper than I expected.

Marcus hesitated, glancing at me. "Will you be okay?"

I nodded, forcing another smile. "Go."

He released me, and I barely caught myself against the wall as Sebastian stormed past, Victoria in his arms. Just before they disappeared, her eyes met mine—and I swore I saw the ghost of a smirk on her lips.

Had she done this on purpose?

Third Person POV

"Your tutoring session is over already?" Victoria asked, poking her head out of her bedroom as Oliver passed by.

He nodded. "Yeah. We’ve been at it all day."
###Chapter 224

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the grand terrace of the Blackwood estate. The evening was quiet, save for the distant rustling of trees and the occasional hoot of an owl. She wrapped her arms around herself, the thin fabric of her sweater doing little to ward off the chill.

Behind her, the French doors creaked open. She didn’t need to turn around to know who it was—Sebastian’s presence was unmistakable, his aura wrapping around her like a warm embrace even before he spoke.

"You should come inside," he murmured, his deep voice laced with concern. "It’s too cold out here."

Lillian exhaled, watching her breath form a mist in the air. "I needed a moment alone," she admitted, though she didn’t resist when Sebastian draped his coat over her shoulders. The weight of it was comforting, carrying his scent—spiced oak and something uniquely him.

He leaned against the railing beside her, his gaze fixed on the moonlit gardens below. "Thinking about Donovan again?"

She stiffened. Even the mention of her ex-fated mate sent a ripple of unease through her. "Not just him," she said quietly. "Everything. The engagement, the pack politics, the fact that your ex-wife’s sister still glares at me like I’m a thief in her own home."

Sebastian chuckled, the sound low and rich. "Penelope has always been territorial. But she’ll adjust."

Lillian shot him a skeptical look. "Will she? Because I’m pretty sure if looks could kill, I’d be six feet under by now."

His expression softened. "You’re my chosen mate, Lillian. No one’s opinion changes that."

She wanted to believe him. But the weight of the past few weeks pressed down on her—Donovan’s betrayal, Evelyn’s smug smiles, the whispers that followed her in the halls of Blackwood Manor.

Sebastian reached for her hand, his fingers intertwining with hers. "You’re not alone in this," he reminded her. "I’m here. Oliver adores you. Even Beatrice would claw someone’s eyes out if they so much as looked at you wrong."

A small smile tugged at her lips. "Beatrice would."

He squeezed her hand. "Come inside. Dinner’s ready, and Oliver’s been asking for you."

Lillian hesitated, then nodded. As they turned toward the doors, a flicker of movement in the garden caught her eye. She paused, squinting into the darkness.

"Did you see that?" she whispered.

Sebastian followed her gaze, his posture tensing. "See what?"

For a moment, there was nothing. Then—a shadow shifted near the hedges, too deliberate to be the wind.

Lillian’s pulse quickened. "Someone’s out there."

Sebastian’s grip on her hand tightened. "Stay behind me."

Before he could take a step forward, a figure emerged from the shadows—tall, cloaked, face obscured by the hood of a dark jacket.

Lillian’s breath hitched.

The stranger lifted their head slightly, moonlight glinting off pale, familiar features.

Donovan.

Her stomach twisted.

"What the hell are you doing here?" Sebastian growled, stepping protectively in front of her.

Donovan’s lips curled into a smirk. "I came to deliver a message." His gaze slid past Sebastian, locking onto Lillian. "You’re making a mistake, little wolf. And when it all falls apart, don’t say I didn’t warn you."

Then, as quickly as he appeared, he melted back into the shadows.

Lillian’s heart pounded.

Sebastian turned to her, his expression unreadable. "We need to talk."

The night had just gotten a lot more complicated.

"Is Lillian still here?" Victoria asked, her voice laced with irritation.

"I think she went to the bathroom and then was leaving," Oliver replied with a careless shrug. "Any more questions, or can I go back to my room now?" His tone was sharp, clearly annoyed by the interruption.

Victoria rolled her eyes and waved him off dismissively. The moment his bedroom door clicked shut, she bolted from her room and dashed down the stairs. She hadn’t seen her father in days—he’d been too busy trying to suppress those scandalous rumors circulating about their family.

As she rounded the corner toward the bathroom, the sound of breathy moans stopped her dead in her tracks. Her eyes narrowed, and she pressed herself against the wall, peering around the corner to confirm her suspicions.

Her stomach twisted when she saw Sebastian pinning Lillian against the wall, his lips locked onto hers in a heated kiss. Victoria had suspected something was going on between them, but witnessing it firsthand made her blood boil.

Lillian was such a snake.

It was obvious she was just using Sebastian to get closer to Donovan. Donovan himself had hinted as much, and Victoria trusted him more than anyone in the world. Lillian had always been like this—flirty, deceitful, and willing to betray her own fated mate. There was no way Victoria would let this manipulative witch toy with her father’s heart and then discard him.

Another sinful moan escaped Lillian’s lips as Sebastian lifted her effortlessly, her legs wrapping around his waist. Victoria felt sick. She couldn’t just stand there and watch. She needed to act—now.

Silently, she tiptoed back toward the foyer, relieved that the late hour meant most of the staff had retired for the night. Only a few guards remained, patrolling the grounds outside.

Victoria climbed halfway up the grand staircase, took a deep breath, and then—

She let herself fall.

It wasn’t a long drop, and she made sure to land on her arms to minimize injury, but she let out a blood-curdling scream that echoed through the mansion. The impact left her with a few bruises, nothing serious, but the performance had to be convincing.

Tears sprang to her eyes instantly—a skill she’d perfected over the years. Clutching her perfectly fine leg, she wailed dramatically on the floor.

Within seconds, guards burst into the foyer, their faces pale with alarm.

Then came Sebastian, his hair disheveled, his shirt half-untucked, his expression frantic.

"Victoria!" he gasped, rushing to her side. "What happened?"

"I—I fell down the stairs!" she sobbed, letting tears streak down her cheeks.

Marcus Grayson, the Beta, appeared moments later, frowning. "Everything alright?"

Sebastian waved him off impatiently.

Victoria clung to her father, her cries growing louder. Perfect. Now, he wouldn’t have time to return to her.

And Lillian?

She could wait.

Alone.

"Take Lillian home," Sebastian ordered without sparing a glance at his Beta. "Victoria fell down the stairs—I need to tend to her."

"Understood," Marcus replied. "Where is Lillian?"

"Bathroom." Marcus gave a curt nod and strode in that direction.

Sebastian turned his attention back to his trembling daughter, whose tear-streaked face twisted in pain. "Where does it hurt, sweetheart?"

"My leg..." Victoria whimpered, clutching her injured limb. "It hurts so much, Daddy."

A low growl rumbled in Sebastian's chest as his wolf surged forward, his glare slicing through the frozen guards. "And where the hell were any of you when this happened?"

"W-we were patrolling outside, Alpha," one managed to stammer.

Victoria tightened her grip on her father's sleeve. "It's not their fault. I was just... clumsy. I went down for a snack and missed a step."

"You should have been more careful," Sebastian muttered, gently probing her leg.

Victoria shrieked. "Ow! Daddy, please—it's unbearable!"

"Damn it, it might be broken," Sebastian muttered under his breath. "We need to get you to the hospital. Someone fetch Frederick and have him bring the car around."

The guards exchanged uneasy glances.

"Alpha... you sent Frederick back to the mansion earlier to secure it for Lillian's return," one reminded hesitantly.

"Fuck!" Sebastian snarled, raking a hand through his hair. He'd completely forgotten. "Call him back immediately. Tell him it's an emergency."

"Yes, Alpha!" The guard scrambled for his phone.

Just then, Marcus returned with Lillian—who looked just as unsteady as Victoria. Victoria's sharp eyes caught the way Lillian leaned heavily against Marcus, her steps uneven, her face pale.

No. She won't steal my moment.

Victoria let out a fresh sob, burying her face against her father's chest as he lifted her into his arms. She clung to him, her cries growing louder, more desperate—anything to keep his attention from straying to Lillian.

Sebastian made a snap decision. "Marcus, you're taking us to the hospital. Lillian can wait for Frederick."

As they moved to leave, Victoria glimpsed Lillian bracing herself against the wall, barely able to stand. A smirk curled her lips.

Perfect.

Her plan was unfolding exactly as she'd hoped.

###Chapter 225

The crisp morning air carried the faint scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood's sprawling estate. The sun had barely risen, casting golden streaks across the dew-laden grass. She wrapped her arms around herself, the thin fabric of her robe doing little to ward off the chill.

Inside, the mansion was already stirring to life. The clatter of dishes echoed from the kitchen, where Lucien Dubois, the head chef, was preparing breakfast with his usual theatrical flair. Giselle Beaumont, the head maid, moved with practiced efficiency, directing the staff with quiet authority.

Lillian's thoughts drifted to the events of the previous night—Donovan's unexpected arrival, the tension that had crackled between him and Sebastian, the way Evelyn had clung to his arm like a possessive shadow. A bitter taste filled her mouth. She had thought she was over him, but seeing him again had stirred emotions she'd rather forget.

A soft knock at the door pulled her from her thoughts. "Come in," she called, turning to see Beatrice standing in the doorway, her expression a mix of concern and excitement.

"You're up early," Beatrice remarked, stepping inside. "Couldn't sleep?"

Lillian sighed. "Too much on my mind."

Beatrice grinned, mischief sparkling in her eyes. "Well, I have just the thing to distract you. Guess who's coming to visit today?"

Lillian raised an eyebrow. "Who?"

"Isabella Fontaine," Beatrice announced with a flourish. "My sister just texted—she's flying in this afternoon for a photoshoot nearby and wants to see us."

Lillian's mood lifted instantly. Isabella was always a breath of fresh air—glamorous, confident, and unapologetically herself. "That’s perfect. I could use a distraction."

Beatrice nodded. "Thought so. Oh, and Sebastian asked if you'd join him for breakfast. He said it’s important."

Lillian frowned. "Did he say why?"

"Nope. But he looked serious."

A knot formed in Lillian's stomach. Sebastian rarely summoned her formally unless something was wrong. Had Donovan done something? Or was it about Oliver? The boy had been unusually quiet lately, and she worried he was still struggling with the loss of his mother.

"Alright," she said, squaring her shoulders. "I'll be down in a minute."

Beatrice gave her a reassuring smile before slipping out.

Lillian took a deep breath, steeling herself for whatever awaited her downstairs. The game was far from over, and she had a feeling the next move would change everything.

Frederick was kind enough to escort me into the mansion and to my room. I knew I’d recover by morning—my wolf’s healing abilities were usually swift. But I couldn’t shake what had happened from my mind.

Sebastian hadn’t meant to hurt me. If he knew the truth, he’d never forgive himself, so I kept it to myself. Still… the way he prioritized rushing Victoria to the hospital over me stung. Not that I could blame him—she was his daughter, after all. But couldn’t he see through her act? That smirk she shot me as they left? She was faking.

For a Lycan chairman, he was surprisingly easy to fool, and that bothered me more than I cared to admit.

Lucien brought dinner to my room, uncharacteristically subdued. No flirtatious remarks, no teasing. Had he seen the news reports before they were taken down? The thought almost made me laugh. Maybe some good had come from the mess after all.

Giselle was equally attentive, fussing over me until I assured her I was fine. I appreciated them both, even if the tension between them was palpable.

By morning, I felt much better. It was Friday, and the promise of a lazy weekend lifted my spirits. I needed a distraction—something to take my mind off everything. A girl’s night with Beatrice sounded perfect. She’d been dying to see the mansion since I moved in, and we both needed an escape.

“Guess what we’re doing this weekend?” I asked when I spotted her at school.

She arched a brow, intrigued. “Enlighten me.”

“Girl’s night.” A grin spread across my face.

Maybe tonight, I’d finally get her to open up. She’d been distant since the party, ever since she mentioned the mate bond. I hadn’t pressed her—if she wanted me to know, she’d tell me sober. But the secrecy stung. Didn’t she trust me?

“I’ll grab snacks, and we can binge junk food,” I added. “Tomorrow?”

Her eyes lit up. “At the mansion?”

I nodded, laughing as she squealed and threw her arms around me.

Perfect. A night of gossip, comfort food, and maybe—just maybe—some answers.

The evening air was crisp as I finished tutoring Oliver in his room. My fingers lingered on the textbook’s pages, half-expecting Sebastian to walk in, to pull me into his arms and murmur something about how much he’d missed me. But the door remained shut, the silence stretching like an unspoken disappointment.

Instead, Marcus, his ever-efficient Beta, delivered the news with practiced neutrality. "The Chairman is occupied with Miss Victoria’s condition. He sends his apologies."

I forced a smile, though my chest tightened. "Of course. Thank you, Marcus."

Frederick, Sebastian’s chauffeur, drove me back to the Blackwood estate in silence. My phone lay heavy in my lap, its screen stubbornly dark. Not a single message. Not even a perfunctory "How was your day?"

Third Person POV

What am I even doing here? Beatrice’s fingers trembled as she stood outside the boutique, its polished windows reflecting the dim glow of streetlights. The place was familiar—too familiar—but tonight, it felt like standing at the edge of a cliff.

She had questions. Too many. And she wasn’t sure if she’d survive the answers.

But she had to try.

The door chimed softly as she stepped inside, the scent of lavender and expensive fabric enveloping her.

Amélie looked up from the counter, her smile warm but puzzled. "Beatrice? Back so soon?"

Beatrice swallowed hard, the door clicking shut behind her like the seal of a vow.

The morning sun filtered through the heavy drapes of Lillian's bedroom at Blackwood Manor. She stretched beneath the silk sheets, her werewolf senses immediately picking up the scent of freshly brewed coffee and warm croissants. The digital clock read 7:15 AM - she had overslept again.

"Miss Lillian?" A gentle knock came at the door. "Mr. Blackwood requests your presence in the dining room."

Lillian groaned, rubbing sleep from her eyes. "Tell Sebastian I'll be down in fifteen minutes, Sophia."

She dragged herself from the comfort of her bed, her bare feet sinking into the plush carpet. The en suite bathroom's marble counter was already prepared with her favorite lavender-scented toiletries. As she brushed her teeth, her reflection showed dark circles under her eyes - another sleepless night spent worrying about Donovan's threats.

Dressing quickly in a cream-colored sweater and dark jeans, Lillian hurried downstairs where the rich aroma of breakfast grew stronger. The dining room's double doors stood slightly ajar, revealing Sebastian already seated at the head of the long mahogany table, newspaper in hand. His piercing blue eyes lifted as she entered.

"You're late," he remarked, folding the paper neatly. "Again."

Lillian slid into her usual seat to his right. "I was up late studying," she lied, reaching for the coffee carafe.

Sebastian's eyebrow arched. "Is that why Beatrice called me at midnight asking if you'd taken sleeping pills again?"

The porcelain cup nearly slipped from Lillian's fingers. "She had no right-"

"Enough." Sebastian's tone brooked no argument. "We have more pressing matters. Victoria arrives today with her... entourage."

Lillian's stomach twisted at the mention of Sebastian's daughter and her former fiancé Donovan. "I thought they weren't coming until next week."

"Change of plans." Sebastian's jaw tightened. "Marcus intercepted communications suggesting Donovan may attempt to challenge my position during the Blood Moon gathering."

The Blood Moon - the one night when werewolf laws permitted challenges to pack leadership. Lillian's coffee suddenly tasted bitter. "He wouldn't dare."

"Don't underestimate him." Sebastian pushed back his chair. "I've arranged additional security. You're not to leave the estate grounds without Julian or myself."

Lillian opened her mouth to protest when the front door burst open. Oliver came barreling into the dining room, his backpack bouncing wildly. "Dad! The car's here! Victoria's early!"

Sebastian was on his feet instantly. Lillian followed more slowly, her pulse racing as they moved toward the grand foyer. Through the open doorway, she could see the black limousine idling in the circular drive, its tinted windows hiding their unwelcome guests.

The driver's door opened, and Frederick stepped out to open the rear passenger door. First emerged Victoria, her designer heels clicking sharply on the pavement. Then Donovan, his golden hair gleaming in the morning light, his arm possessively around Evelyn's waist.

But it was the third figure that made Lillian's blood run cold - a tall, broad-shouldered man with silver-streaked hair stepping from the front seat. Alpha Harrison. The very wolf who'd tried to take advantage of her at the fraternity party.

Sebastian's growl vibrated through the foyer. "What is he doing here?"

Victoria smiled sweetly. "Father, don't be rude. Harrison is Donovan's guest for the Blood Moon. And we all know what that means..."

The unspoken challenge hung in the air like a storm cloud. Lillian's fingers found Sebastian's sleeve, gripping tight. The games had begun, and the stakes were higher than ever.

###Chapter 226 

"I'm having a girls' night with my bestie tonight, so I wanted something cozy," Beatrice lied smoothly, twirling a strand of hair around her finger. Truthfully, she had drawers full of sleepwear, but she needed an excuse for her sudden return to the boutique.

Amélie, the boutique clerk, didn't question it. "Perfect timing," she said with a warm smile, stepping out from behind the counter. "We just got a fresh shipment of pajamas yesterday."

Lucky me... Beatrice thought bitterly, her gaze lingering on Amélie. The woman was stunning—soft curves, effortless elegance, the kind of beauty that made men weak. This was the woman her fated mate had chosen over her. The realization twisted like a knife in her chest with every heartbeat.

Amélie returned with a delicate silk pajama set, the fabric shimmering under the boutique's soft lighting. Beatrice forced a smile, barely glancing at it. "It's perfect," she murmured, her voice hollow.

"Would you like to try it on?" Amélie offered, holding it up.

"No need," Beatrice said quickly, biting her lower lip. "I'm sure it'll fit."

Amélie chuckled and turned back toward the register. "Alright then."

Beatrice followed, her pulse quickening. "So..." she began casually, leaning against the counter. "How was your date the other night?"

Amélie shrugged, ringing up the pajamas. "It was... fine. He was a gentleman," she admitted. "I thought he might invite me back to his place, but he just dropped me off with a kiss on the cheek."

Beatrice's stomach lurched. His lips on her skin. The image burned behind her eyelids, acidic jealousy rising in her throat. She swallowed hard.

"But lately, he's been... distant," Amélie continued, frowning. "Like something's weighing on him. We've gone out a few times since, but he’s always distracted—staring at his phone, brushing me off when I try to get closer. He hasn’t even kissed me properly. Just... cheeks."

Beatrice arched a brow. "Did you ask who he was talking to?"

Amélie nodded. "He said it was just a friend. But I don’t know if I believe him."

"Oh..." Beatrice feigned sympathy, her fingers tightening around her purse.

Amélie shrugged, unfazed. "Dating’s like that sometimes. It’s not like we’re serious. I’ll survive."

"So... are you going to try to make it work?" Beatrice pressed, digging for her wallet, her hands trembling slightly.

Amélie handed her the bag. "Probably not. If we had a real connection, maybe. But honestly? I think it’s just physical—at least on my end. I wanted him, but he barely touched me." She sighed. "He asked me out again tonight, but I said no. Better to just be friends."

Beatrice nodded stiffly, handing over her credit card. As Amélie processed the payment, she forced another smile, though her chest ached.

When the transaction was done, Amélie handed back the card with a polite smile. "Enjoy your girls' night."

Beatrice took the bag, her grip tight. "Thanks," she murmured, already turning away.

The moment she stepped outside, the weight of the conversation crashed over her. He hadn’t kissed her. He was distracted. Thinking of someone else.

Her.

The thought should have thrilled her. Instead, it only made the knife in her chest twist deeper.

###Chapter 227

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s sprawling estate. The sun had barely risen, casting a golden hue over the dense forest surrounding the property. She wrapped her arms around herself, the thin silk robe doing little to ward off the chill.

Behind her, the bedroom door creaked open.

“You’re up early,” came Sebastian’s deep, velvety voice.

Lillian turned, her breath hitching slightly at the sight of him. His dark hair was tousled from sleep, his chiseled jaw shadowed with stubble. The white linen shirt he wore hung loosely over his broad shoulders, revealing just a hint of the powerful muscles beneath.

“Couldn’t sleep,” she admitted, forcing a small smile.

Sebastian stepped closer, his piercing gaze studying her. “Thinking about Donovan again?”

Lillian stiffened. Even the mention of her ex-fated mate sent a sharp pang through her chest. “It’s not just him,” she murmured. “Everything feels… unsettled.”

Sebastian exhaled, his warm breath ghosting over her cheek as he leaned against the railing beside her. “The alliance with Alpha Harrison is still shaky. And with Evelyn now officially mated to Donovan, tensions are higher than ever.”

Lillian clenched her fists. Evelyn—Donovan’s new mate—had been flaunting their bond at every opportunity, twisting the knife deeper into Lillian’s heart.

“We need to act fast,” Sebastian said, his voice low and urgent. “If we don’t solidify our position before the next full moon, Harrison will make his move.”

Lillian swallowed hard. The thought of another pack war made her stomach churn. But she knew Sebastian was right.

“What’s the plan?” she asked, squaring her shoulders.

Sebastian’s lips curled into a dangerous smirk. “We strike first.”

Downstairs, the mansion buzzed with activity. Marcus Grayson, Sebastian’s beta, was already in the war room, maps and strategy charts spread across the massive oak table. Theodore Whitmore, the ever-efficient butler, poured steaming coffee into delicate china cups.

“Morning,” Beatrice chirped, strolling in with a plate of pastries. “Figured you two could use some fuel.”

Lillian smiled gratefully at her best friend, though her mind was still racing.

Sebastian wasted no time. “Marcus, status update.”

Marcus straightened. “Our scouts confirmed Harrison’s forces are gathering near the eastern border. They’re waiting for something—or someone.”

Lillian frowned. “Who?”

“That’s the question,” Sebastian muttered.

Just then, the doors burst open, and Oliver—Sebastian’s seven-year-old son—rushed in, his cheeks flushed. “Dad! Aunt Penelope is here!”

Sebastian’s expression darkened. “What does she want?”

Before anyone could answer, Penelope swept into the room, her designer heels clicking against the marble floor. Her sharp eyes flicked over the assembled group before landing on Lillian.

“Well, isn’t this cozy,” she drawled.

Lillian resisted the urge to roll her eyes. Penelope, the late Luna’s sister, had never hidden her disdain for her.

“Penelope,” Sebastian said coolly. “To what do we owe the pleasure?”

She smirked. “I bring news. Harrison isn’t just gathering forces—he’s made a deal with the Darkmoon Pack.”

A stunned silence fell over the room.

Lillian’s pulse spiked. The Darkmoon Pack was notorious for their brutality. If they allied with Harrison…

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. “When?”

“Last night,” Penelope said, inspecting her manicure. “And rumor has it, they’re bringing in Tristan Whitlock.”

Lillian’s blood ran cold. Tristan—Alpha Levi’s most lethal warrior.

Sebastian’s eyes flashed with fury. “Then we don’t have time to waste.”

Lillian met his gaze, determination hardening her resolve. Whatever was coming, they would face it together.

But as the meeting continued, one thought nagged at her—why was Penelope, of all people, helping them?

And what game was she really playing?

"If you have any handsome guy friends, send them my way. I could use some variety in my life," Amélie teased with a playful wink.

Beatrice laughed, shaking her head in amusement. "I'll keep that in mind."



Beatrice was relieved that Amélie had decided not to go out with her mate again, but who was this mysterious woman in his life that had distracted him so much during their date? She thanked Amélie before leaving the boutique, her mind buzzing with more questions than when she had arrived.

Later that evening, Beatrice made her way to the Blackwood Mansion, using the address Lillian had given her.

"Are you Beatrice?" one of the guards asked as she approached the grand iron gates.

She smiled, touched that Lillian had informed them of her arrival. "Yes, that's me."

"Come with me. Miss Dumont is waiting for you inside," he said, gesturing for her to follow.

Beatrice nodded and trailed behind the guard toward the mansion’s entrance. The guard was undeniably attractive—tall, with sharp features and an air of quiet confidence. She made a mental note to ask if he was single—not for herself, but for Amélie. The thought made her chuckle as she stepped into the breathtaking foyer of the Blackwood estate.

"Beatrice!" Lillian squealed, rushing forward to envelop her in a tight hug. "I’m so glad you’re here! Come on, let me give you the grand tour!"

Laughing, the two friends wandered through the mansion, marveling at its lavish interiors—the crystal chandeliers, the sweeping staircases, and, most impressively, the stunning infinity pool in the backyard. Beatrice couldn’t help but feel a pang of envy at Lillian’s living situation. Her bedroom alone was the size of Beatrice’s entire apartment, with floor-to-ceiling windows offering a breathtaking view of the city skyline.

"I’m going to change into my new pajamas," Beatrice announced, heading toward Lillian’s ensuite bathroom.

"Perfect! Then we’ll crack open that bottle of wine I’ve been saving. I also ordered pizza, and we can binge-watch the cheesiest rom-coms we can find," Lillian declared, flopping onto her plush bed with a grin.

Beatrice laughed. This was exactly what she needed—a distraction from the whirlwind of thoughts in her head.

She quickly changed into her soft pajamas and twisted her hair into a messy bun before rejoining Lillian downstairs in the living room. Lillian poured them each a generous glass of wine before settling onto the couch beside her.

"We so needed this," Lillian said, clinking her glass against Beatrice’s before taking a sip.

"Absolutely," Beatrice agreed, savoring the rich taste of the wine.

For a moment, she considered telling Lillian about her mate—but voicing it aloud would make it real, and she wasn’t ready for that yet. Not until she had more answers. Not until she knew what she was going to do about him.

So, for now, she pushed the thought aside and let herself sink into the comfort of good wine, bad movies, and the company of her best friend.

"Are you lighting incense or something?" Beatrice asked abruptly, catching a whiff of something delicious. "It smells amazing in here."

"Could be Lucien in the kitchen. He mentioned making dessert for us," Lillian replied.

Beatrice arched a brow.

"Who's Lucien?" she inquired.

"The head chef." Beatrice laughed.

"Of course you'd have a personal chef," Beatrice teased.

Lillian shrugged.

"Can't blame the Blackwoods for that," Lillian sighed. "But Lucien's a good guy. Charming, a bit of a flirt, but harmless."

"I need to see what he's making," Beatrice declared, rising to her feet. "That scent is irresistible."

Lillian frowned, inhaling deeply.

"I don’t smell anything. My nose is a bit stuffy," she admitted. "The kitchen’s just around the corner. I’ll stay here and pick a movie."

Beatrice nodded, taking one last generous sip of her wine before setting the glass down. She hurried toward the kitchen, the aroma growing richer with each step. It was oddly familiar, and her curiosity burned—what was he making? Maybe this Lucien would let her sneak a taste.

But the moment she stepped into the kitchen, her entire body locked in place.

###Chapter 228

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the Blackwood estate, illuminating the grand dining hall where Lillian sat across from Sebastian. The air between them was thick with unspoken tension, the weight of last night’s revelations pressing down on them.

Oliver, perched on the edge of his seat, swung his legs excitedly. "Papa, can we go riding today?" His bright eyes darted between his father and Lillian, sensing the shift in the atmosphere but too young to fully grasp it.

Sebastian set down his coffee cup with deliberate calm. "Perhaps later, Oliver. First, I need to speak with Lillian." His deep voice carried an edge of authority, though his gaze softened when it landed on the boy.

Lillian’s fingers tightened around her fork. She knew what was coming. The confrontation she had been dreading since the moment she stepped foot into this world of power and secrets.

Theodore, the ever-discreet butler, appeared at Sebastian’s side. "Sir, Alpha Harrison has arrived. He insists on speaking with you immediately."

Sebastian’s jaw clenched. "Tell him to wait."

Lillian’s pulse spiked. Alpha Harrison—the man who had tried to take advantage of her at the bar. The memory of his predatory smirk sent a shiver down her spine.

Oliver, oblivious to the tension, tugged at Sebastian’s sleeve. "Papa, who’s Alpha Harrison?"

Sebastian exhaled sharply. "Someone who doesn’t know his place." He turned to Lillian, his expression unreadable. "We’ll finish this conversation later."

As he strode out of the room, Lillian’s mind raced. She couldn’t shake the feeling that something was about to go terribly wrong.

Beatrice burst into the dining hall, her cheeks flushed. "Lillian! You won’t believe what just happened—" She froze, noticing the empty chair where Sebastian had been. "Oh. Where’s Alpha Blackwood?"

Lillian forced a smile. "Dealing with an unexpected guest."

Beatrice leaned in, lowering her voice. "Well, while he’s busy, you need to hear this. Evelyn was seen sneaking into Donovan’s apartment last night."

Lillian’s stomach twisted. So, Donovan had moved on—or at least, he wanted her to think he had.

But why did it still hurt?

A sharp knock at the door interrupted them. Marcus Grayson, Sebastian’s beta, stepped inside, his expression grim. "Lillian, Alpha Blackwood requests your presence in his study. Now."

Lillian exchanged a glance with Beatrice. Whatever was happening, it wasn’t good.

As she followed Marcus down the hall, her mind whirled with possibilities. Was this about Alpha Harrison? Donovan? Or something else entirely?

The door to Sebastian’s study loomed ahead, heavy and imposing.

Taking a deep breath, she pushed it open—and froze.

Because standing beside Sebastian, with a smirk that made her blood run cold, was Donovan.

And he wasn’t alone.

Evelyn clung to his arm, her triumphant gaze locked onto Lillian.

"Ah, there she is," Donovan drawled. "The runaway mate."

Sebastian’s eyes darkened. "Lillian," he said, his voice dangerously calm. "We have a problem."

And just like that, the fragile peace shattered.

The rich red wine swirled in my glass as I took another sip, the warmth spreading through my veins, loosening the tension in my shoulders. My fingers drummed restlessly against the stem of the glass, my gaze flickering yet again to my phone lying face-up on the table. Still nothing. No missed calls. No new messages.

A sharp pang twisted in my chest, and I hated it.

Sebastian was with his family. That was all. It wasn’t like he was losing interest—not that it should matter. This was just a casual arrangement, wasn’t it? A mutually beneficial distraction. A way to keep prying eyes off our backs.

So why did the silence sting?

I exhaled sharply and set my glass down with more force than necessary, pushing my phone away. Enough.

My attention shifted to Beatrice’s half-finished wine. She had gone to check on Lucien’s cooking progress ages ago. Too long, actually.

Frowning, I stood, smoothing the wrinkles from my dress before heading toward the kitchen.

The door was slightly ajar, and I could just make out Beatrice’s rigid silhouette in the doorway. My lips curved into a smirk—until I noticed the tension in her posture. She was frozen, her back unnaturally straight, like she’d been turned to stone.

"Beatrice?" I called softly, stepping closer.

She didn’t respond.

Peering over her shoulder, I understood why.

Lucien and Giselle.

Giselle was perched on the counter, her legs locked around Lucien’s waist, her fingers tangled in his hair as she kissed him with a fervor that bordered on desperation. Lucien’s hands rested loosely on her hips, but his stance was oddly passive, as if he were merely tolerating her enthusiasm rather than matching it.

I wasn’t shocked. This wasn’t the first time I’d stumbled upon them entangled somewhere they shouldn’t be. But it was the first time they’d been so careless—right in the middle of the kitchen, where anyone could walk in.

Like Beatrice, who looked like she’d been struck by lightning.

Biting back a laugh, I rested a hand on her shoulder. "You okay?"

She flinched so hard I thought she might shatter.

I didn’t wait for her to recover. Instead, I turned my attention to the oblivious couple and cleared my throat—loudly.

They sprang apart like they’d been electrocuted. Giselle nearly toppled off the counter, catching herself at the last second, while Lucien’s face flamed crimson.

Then, in a blink, all the color drained from his skin.

He wasn’t looking at me anymore.

His gaze was locked on Beatrice.

And he looked terrified.

Lucien's gaze locked onto Beatrice, his eyes widening in unmistakable horror. I saw the way his breath hitched, fingers twitching at his sides as if he wanted to reach for her but couldn’t. Beatrice took a shaky step back, her entire frame trembling like a leaf in the wind. My stomach twisted when I noticed how pale she’d become—her usual rosy cheeks now drained of color.

I turned to Giselle, who stood frozen beside me, her lips parted in silent shock. Neither of them spoke a word, the air between them thick with tension.

"Beatrice?" I reached for her arm, my voice barely above a whisper. "What’s wrong?"

"Lucien?" Giselle tried nudging him with her foot, but he recoiled as if burned, putting more distance between them.

A shuddering breath escaped Beatrice before she finally tore her gaze away from Lucien to look at me. My chest constricted when I saw the tears welling in her striking blue eyes—eyes that usually sparkled with mischief. Now, they were filled with something raw and painful.

She looked... shattered.

Something was terribly wrong, and I needed to find out what.

###Chapter 229

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s sprawling estate. Below, the pack grounds buzzed with activity—warriors training, maids tending to the gardens, and children darting between the trees in playful chaos. Yet, despite the lively scene, her thoughts were anything but peaceful.

Last night’s confrontation with Donovan still burned in her mind. The way his new mate, Evelyn, had smirked at her, as if she had already won. The memory made her fingers curl into fists.

"Thinking about him again?"

Lillian turned to see Beatrice leaning against the railing beside her, a steaming cup of coffee in hand. Her best friend’s sharp eyes missed nothing.

"Not by choice," Lillian muttered, crossing her arms. "It’s just—how could he move on so quickly? After everything we—"

"Because he’s a coward," Beatrice cut in, her tone uncharacteristically harsh. "And Evelyn? Please. She’s about as genuine as a three-dollar bill."

Lillian huffed a laugh despite herself. Beatrice always knew how to lighten the mood.

Before she could respond, the sound of hurried footsteps drew their attention. Oliver, Sebastian’s seven-year-old son, skidded to a stop in front of them, his cheeks flushed with excitement.

"Lillian! Dad wants to see you in his office. Right now!"

Her heart skipped a beat. Sebastian rarely summoned her so urgently.

Beatrice raised a brow. "Wonder what that’s about."

Lillian swallowed hard. "Guess I’ll find out."

Sebastian’s office was as imposing as the man himself—dark mahogany furniture, shelves lined with ancient tomes, and the faint scent of leather and cedar. He stood by the window, his broad frame silhouetted against the morning light.

"You wanted to see me?" Lillian asked, her voice steadier than she felt.

He turned, his piercing gaze locking onto hers. "We have a problem."

Her stomach twisted. "What kind of problem?"

"Donovan and Evelyn are making moves against us," he said, his voice low and dangerous. "They’ve been spreading rumors—questioning your place in this pack, your loyalty."

Lillian’s breath hitched. "That’s ridiculous. I’ve done nothing but—"

"I know," Sebastian interrupted, his tone softening slightly. "But perception is everything in our world. And right now, they’re winning the narrative."

She clenched her jaw. "So what do we do?"

A slow, predatory smile curved his lips. "We fight back. And we do it publicly."

Lillian’s pulse quickened. "How?"

Sebastian stepped closer, his presence overwhelming. "There’s a gathering tonight—Alphas from neighboring packs will be there. You’ll attend as my guest. And you’ll remind everyone exactly who you are."

Her mind raced. A public appearance? After weeks of whispers and sidelong glances?

Beatrice’s words echoed in her head. Coward.

Lillian lifted her chin. "I’ll be ready."

Sebastian’s eyes gleamed with approval. "Good. Because tonight, we show them all exactly what happens when they underestimate you."

As she left his office, Lillian’s phone buzzed. A message from an unknown number.

Looking forward to seeing you tonight, little wolf. Don’t disappoint.

Her blood ran cold.

Donovan.

The game was on.


“Bea…” I whispered, my voice barely audible. “What’s wrong?”

She swallowed hard, her fingers trembling as she tore her gaze away from me to stare at the floor. “I’m so sorry…” Her voice was rough, strained. “But I can’t stay here…”

“Wait—what?” My brows shot up in alarm. “Why not? What happened? Talk to me, please.”

She shook her head violently, her lips pressed into a thin line as she fought back tears.

“I have to go…” The words were barely a whisper, but they hit me like a punch to the gut.

Before I could react, she was already rushing past me, her footsteps echoing through the grand foyer as she bolted for the front door.

“Beatrice!” I called after her, but it was too late. The heavy door slammed shut behind her, leaving me standing there, stunned.

I turned back to Lucien, who let out a shaky exhale, his expression dazed, as if he’d just snapped out of a trance. His dark eyes flickered to me, then to Giselle, who was watching him with narrowed eyes, arms crossed over her chest as she slid off the kitchen counter.

“What the hell was that about?” she demanded, her tone sharp.

Lucien didn’t answer her. Instead, his gaze locked onto me, intense and searching.

“Who was that?” he asked, his voice low but urgent.

I blinked. “What? Why?”

“Just answer the question,” he repeated, firmer this time, making me instinctively take a step back. His eyes were wild, his jaw clenched—something was very, very wrong. My pulse hammered in my throat, a mix of confusion and rising unease.

“My best friend,” I said slowly, studying his reaction. “Beatrice Whitaker.”

For a brief moment, his expression softened, something unreadable flickering in his gaze.

“Beatrice…” He murmured her name like he was savoring it, rolling it over his tongue. And from the way his lips curved ever so slightly, it was clear—he liked the taste of it.

That only made me more suspicious. I’d never seen Beatrice act like this before, and Lucien? This was completely out of character for him too.

I glanced over my shoulder at the closed door, my mind racing with possibilities.

“Did you know her or something?” Giselle cut in, her voice laced with a sharp edge of jealousy. Her cheeks flushed crimson, her fingers tightening around her arms.

Lucien looked at her, and I could see the apology in his eyes—but he didn’t voice it. Instead, he turned away, striding past me with purpose, heading straight for the front door.

He didn’t run like Beatrice had, but his steps were quick, determined.

And I couldn’t just let him leave without answers.

I chased after him, following him out onto the sprawling front patio. The cool evening air brushed against my skin as Lucien scanned the empty driveway, his frown deepening.

I could practically hear Lucien's heart hammering against his ribs. I was equally stunned that Beatrice had managed to slip away so effortlessly. She must’ve bolted to her car and sped off, leaving no trace behind. Lucien slumped against the porch railing, exhaling heavily as his shoulders sagged under some invisible weight.

The front door flew open and then slammed shut with enough force to rattle the windows. I didn’t need to turn around to know who had stormed out after us. Glancing over my shoulder, I saw Giselle standing there, arms crossed tightly over her chest, lips pressed into a razor-thin line. Her glare could’ve melted steel.

“What the hell, Lucien?” she snapped, her voice sharp enough to cut glass. “Who was that woman? How could you just chase after her and leave me standing there like an idiot?”

Lucien dragged a hand through his tousled blond hair before turning to face her. His expression was uncharacteristically solemn, and the intensity in his gaze made Giselle take an involuntary step back.

“I’m sorry, Giselle,” he murmured, his voice low but firm. “Kissing you in the kitchen was a mistake. It shouldn’t have happened. You were right—we shouldn’t mix business with pleasure.”

His words hit me like a punch to the gut. Since when did Lucien—the king of reckless flirting—suddenly grow a conscience? Giselle looked just as blindsided, her mouth falling open in shock.

“W-what are you saying?” she demanded, her voice cracking slightly as she fought to keep her composure.

Lucien exhaled sharply, his jaw tightening. “I’m saying this—whatever this is—” He gestured between them. “—it’s over.”

The finality in his tone left no room for argument.


The morning sun cast golden streaks across Lillian's bedroom as she stirred awake. Her body still hummed with the lingering sensations from last night's passionate encounter with Sebastian. A delicious shiver ran down her spine as she recalled how his strong hands had explored every inch of her body, marking her as his in ways that went beyond the physical.

"Morning, beautiful," Sebastian's deep voice rumbled beside her, his fingers tracing lazy patterns on her bare shoulder. The sheets barely covered his sculpted torso, revealing fresh scratch marks from their lovemaking.

Lillian turned to face him, her cheeks flushing. "Someone was... enthusiastic last night," she teased, brushing her fingertips over the marks.

Sebastian captured her hand, pressing a kiss to her palm. "Can you blame me? My mate smells irresistible after a full moon." His golden eyes darkened with renewed desire. "And you taste even better."

Before Lillian could respond, the door burst open. Oliver stood there, his small face scrunched in disgust. "Eww! Dad, why are you naked again?"

Sebastian sighed, pulling the sheets higher. "Knocking, Oliver. We've talked about this."

"But Victoria said—"

"Victoria needs to mind her own business," Sebastian growled, though there was no real heat behind it.

Lillian giggled, reaching for her robe. "Come on, let's get you breakfast." As she moved to stand, a sharp pain shot through her abdomen. She gasped, clutching her stomach.

Sebastian was at her side instantly. "Lillian? What's wrong?"

"I... I don't know," she panted, the pain intensifying. "It feels like—"

Her words cut off as her body convulsed violently. Sebastian caught her just as her eyes rolled back, her body going limp in his arms.

"Lillian!" Sebastian roared, panic lacing his voice. "Theodore! Call Dr. Langford now!"

Oliver began to cry as Sebastian carried Lillian's unconscious form to the bed. "Is she gonna die like Mommy did?"

Sebastian's jaw clenched. "No. Never." But as he looked down at his mate's pale face, a cold dread settled in his chest. This wasn't normal. This wasn't just morning sickness.

And when he caught the faintest whiff of wolfsbane beneath Lillian's natural scent, his blood ran cold.

Someone had poisoned his mate.
###Chapter 230
Lillian's POV

“A...are you serious right now??” Giselle gasped, her voice trembling as she stared at Lucien in disbelief.

He gave a slow nod, his expression heavy with regret.

“Yes, Giselle. I’m sorry,” he murmured before brushing past her and disappearing into the mansion. Giselle remained frozen in place, her cheeks flushed with a mix of fury and heartbreak. My chest ached for her—I knew exactly how deeply she cared for Lucien. It was written all over her face every time he was near. I understood the pain of unrequited feelings all too well... or worse, being cast aside so effortlessly. But despite my sympathy for Giselle, my thoughts kept circling back to Beatrice.

“I’m so sorry...” I whispered, unsure of what else to say.

“I just don’t understand...” Giselle’s voice was barely audible as she stared at the ground. “Everything was fine. Then she showed up and...” Her words dissolved into silence.

“Do you think they’re involved?” she finally asked, lifting her gaze to mine. “I know Lucien went on a date recently. Could it have been with her?”

I shook my head firmly. Beatrice would’ve told me if she’d gone out with someone. The fact that she hadn’t mentioned anything only deepened the mystery.

“I’m not sure, Giselle,” I admitted carefully.

Giselle sniffed, hastily wiping away a stray tear before turning away.

“I’m going inside. If you need anything... I’ll be in my room,” she muttered.

Without another word, she retreated into the mansion. I watched her go, exhaling sharply before pulling out my phone. The screen remained stubbornly blank—no missed calls, no texts. A pang of disappointment twisted in my gut. Sebastian hadn’t reached out, and now Beatrice was ignoring me too.

I dialed Beatrice’s number, pressing the phone to my ear. It rang endlessly before her voicemail picked up.

“Hey, Beatrice. Call me back,” I said, my voice tight with worry. “I need to know you’re okay.”

Hanging up, I trudged back inside. The mansion was eerily quiet, the kitchen now deserted. Lucien must’ve already retired for the night. The meal he’d prepared sat untouched on the counter. Though my appetite was nonexistent, I covered the dish with plastic wrap and tucked it into the fridge. Then I grabbed a sponge and scrubbed the counters clean, trying not to dwell on whatever had transpired here earlier.

Once the kitchen was spotless, I retreated to my room. The abrupt end to what was supposed to be a fun girls’ night left me hollow. I stepped into the bathroom, pulling my hair into a loose ponytail before washing away the remnants of makeup. As I brushed my teeth, my mind wandered back to Beatrice’s strange reaction. It was so unlike her. The party, her sudden distress—she’d mentioned something about finding her mate, hadn’t she?

My hand stilled mid-brush.

Could Lucien be Beatrice’s mate?

The thought sent an uneasy chill down my spine. My reflection in the mirror stared back, wide-eyed, toothbrush dangling from my lips. It would explain their intense reactions to each other. But if that were true... did Lucien know? And yet he’d still gone on a date with another woman? Not to mention whatever had happened with Giselle in the kitchen earlier?

If that was the case, maybe Lucien wasn’t as harmless as I’d believed.

I spat into the sink, rinsing my mouth before setting the toothbrush aside. Drying my hands, I leaned against the counter, suddenly lightheaded. The weight of everything pressed down on me, and all I wanted was to collapse into bed.

After a few steadying breaths, I flicked off the bathroom light and stepped into my bedroom. The emptiness without Sebastian was suffocating. I’d grown accustomed to his presence, even if it had been unexpected at first.

One last check of my phone confirmed the silence—still nothing. I tried Beatrice again, only to be met with her voicemail. Frustrated, I plugged my phone in and crawled under the covers. I hated this loneliness. I wanted Sebastian’s steady reassurance, but he was busy. I wanted Beatrice’s voice, but she was shutting me out.

I had no answers, only questions. Maybe morning would bring clarity.

Sleep came reluctantly, dragging me under despite my restless thoughts.

When I woke, the sunlight filtering through the curtains did little to ease the numbness clinging to me. I grabbed my phone, my pulse jumping when I spotted a message from Sebastian. Sent early this morning. Biting my lip, I opened it.


###Chapter 231

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the campus quad, her boots crunching against the gravel path. The morning sun cast golden streaks through the trees, painting the world in warm hues. She adjusted the strap of her backpack, her thoughts drifting to the upcoming midterms—and the fact that she hadn’t seen Donovan in weeks.

Not that she cared.

Or so she told herself.

Her phone buzzed in her pocket, and she pulled it out to see a message from Beatrice:

"You’re not going to believe who just showed up at the coffee shop."

Lillian frowned. "Who?"

The reply came instantly. "Evelyn. And she’s not alone."

A cold knot formed in Lillian’s stomach. She quickened her pace, weaving through clusters of students until she reached The Moonlit Bean, the campus café where Beatrice worked part-time. Through the large glass windows, she spotted Evelyn sitting at a corner table, her glossy dark hair cascading over one shoulder. Across from her, his back to the window, was a man whose broad shoulders and familiar posture made Lillian’s pulse stutter.

Donovan.

Her fingers tightened around the strap of her bag. She should walk away. She shouldn’t care.

But then Evelyn leaned forward, her lips curving into a smirk as she whispered something to Donovan. His shoulders tensed, and he turned his head slightly—just enough for Lillian to catch the sharp line of his jaw, the way his fingers drummed impatiently against the table.

He wasn’t happy.

That realization sent a flicker of satisfaction through her.

Before she could decide whether to leave or confront them, the café door swung open, and Sebastian Blackwood stepped out, his piercing blue eyes locking onto hers.

"Lillian," he said, his voice low and smooth. "Fancy meeting you here."

She blinked. "Sebastian? What are you—"

He cut her off with a glance toward the café window, where Donovan had just turned fully in his seat, his gaze landing on them. His expression darkened.

Sebastian smirked. "Looks like we have an audience."

Lillian swallowed hard. This was trouble.

And yet, as Donovan pushed back his chair and stood, his eyes burning with something dangerously close to jealousy, she couldn’t help the thrill that shot through her.

Sebastian: Sorry I couldn't cover last night. I'd like to see you tonight though. Dinner tonight?

A warm flutter spread through my chest as I read the message. My fingers hovered over the screen before typing out my reply.

Me: That sounds perfect!

I hit send and immediately tossed my phone aside, swinging my legs out of bed. Still in my pajamas, I padded barefoot down the grand staircase toward the kitchen, my stomach growling in protest. After skipping dinner last night, I was ravenous.

To my surprise, Lucien was already bustling around the kitchen, his sleeves rolled up as he expertly chopped vegetables. The usual kitchen staff were nowhere in sight, leaving only the rhythmic sound of his knife against the cutting board.

I hesitated in the doorway, scanning the empty space. "Where is everyone?"

Lucien paused mid-chop, his dark eyes flicking up to meet mine. For a moment, he just studied me, as if debating whether to answer. Then, with a slow smirk, he set the knife down.

"Morning, petite loup," he purred, leaning against the counter. "Didn’t expect to see you up so early."

I crossed my arms. "You didn’t answer my question."

His grin widened. "Maybe I wanted the kitchen to myself today."

I narrowed my eyes. Lucien was always like this—charming, evasive, and infuriatingly good at dodging straight answers.

Before I could press further, my phone buzzed again. Sebastian.

Sebastian: Good. I’ll pick you up at seven.

My irritation melted instantly. Tonight couldn’t come fast enough.

But as I turned back to Lucien, I caught the way his gaze lingered—calculating, almost knowing.

And suddenly, I wondered if he already knew exactly where this night would lead.

###Chapter 232

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the grand marble staircase of the Blackwood estate. Her fingers tightened around the railing, her heart pounding with a mix of anticipation and dread. The last time she had seen Donovan, he had shattered her world with his betrayal. Now, he stood in the foyer below, his new mate, Evelyn, clinging to his arm like a prized possession.

Sebastian Blackwood’s presence beside her was a steady anchor, his towering frame radiating quiet authority. His piercing gaze swept over the gathered guests, lingering briefly on Donovan before returning to Lillian. “Remember,” he murmured, his voice low and firm, “you owe him nothing.”

Lillian exhaled shakily, nodding. She had spent months rebuilding herself after Donovan’s abandonment, and she refused to let him unravel her progress now.

Downstairs, Evelyn’s laughter rang out, sharp and mocking. “Oh, Lillian,” she called, her voice dripping with false sweetness. “I almost didn’t recognize you. You look… different.”

Lillian forced a smile, refusing to rise to the bait. “Funny, I was just thinking the same about you.”

Donovan’s jaw tightened, his eyes flickering with something unreadable. “Lillian,” he began, but Sebastian cut him off with a single step forward.

“If you’re here to cause trouble, you’re wasting your time,” Sebastian said coolly. “This is a celebration, not a battleground.”

The tension in the room thickened, the other guests shifting uncomfortably. Beatrice, Lillian’s best friend, appeared at her side, squeezing her hand in silent support.

Then, from the top of the stairs, a small voice piped up. “Papa?”

Oliver, Sebastian’s seven-year-old son, peered down at the scene with wide, curious eyes. The sight of him seemed to break the spell.

Sebastian’s expression softened. “Come here, Oliver.”

As the boy descended, Donovan’s gaze followed him, a shadow crossing his face. Lillian couldn’t help but wonder—was that regret in his eyes?

But before she could dwell on it, Victoria, Sebastian’s daughter, swept into the room, her arm linked with Julian Mercer, the Gamma assigned to protect her. “Father,” she said smoothly, “the guests are waiting in the ballroom.”

Sebastian gave a curt nod, then extended his hand to Lillian. “Shall we?”

As they turned away, Lillian caught the faintest whisper from Donovan. “I never meant to hurt you.”

Her steps faltered for only a second before she squared her shoulders and walked on.

The past was behind her. And tonight, under the glittering chandeliers of the Blackwood estate, she would prove—to herself and everyone else—that she was no longer the broken girl Donovan had left behind.

But as the music swelled and the night unfolded, one question lingered in the back of her mind: Why had Donovan really come?

And more importantly—what did he want now?

Lillian's POV

Lucien stared at me with a shocked expression, his mouth practically hanging open. I could see the turmoil in his eyes, and it made me look away again. I didn’t want him to pity me, but I also couldn’t keep lying to him. He was clearly wrestling with his own emotions, struggling to accept that he had found his mate. He hadn’t said it out loud yet, but I knew that was the root of his distress. Beatrice was just as conflicted, and my heart ached for both of them.

I wanted them to be happy. If they just gave each other a real chance, they could be perfect for one another. But the idea of having a mate terrified them—or maybe Beatrice was just terrified of Lucien being hers. Their first few encounters hadn’t exactly been smooth.

The first step was admitting the truth—if not to me, then at least to each other. They needed to talk it out and figure out where to go from there.

"Victoria?" Lucien finally spoke, bracing himself against the counter as if his legs might give out. "Wait... your mate is Donovan Winslow? From the Winslow family?"

I wasn’t surprised he recognized Donovan’s name. Everyone knew who he was. The Winslows were practically royalty in our territory—not as influential as Sebastian Blackwood, but still powerful. And now, with Donovan engaged to Victoria, the most sought-after heiress in the world, their name was everywhere.

I nodded.

"Yes," I admitted. "The one and only. He left me for her. I can’t even blame him, but... it destroyed me. And my wolf."

Lucien exhaled sharply. "Yeah, I mean... he was your mate. That’s got to be brutal, watching him with someone else—"

His voice cut off abruptly, and I saw pure horror flash across his face. He paled, just like he had the night before. I waved a hand in front of him, trying to snap him out of it.

"Hey," I said softly. "What’s going through your head?"

"I..." He hesitated, then went completely still.

"Lucien?" I pressed.

When his eyes finally met mine, they were filled with regret.

"I hurt her, Lillian," he whispered.

I sighed, leaning back in my chair. I didn’t want to drag this out.

"She’s your mate, isn’t she?"

His shock at my words was evident, but then he exhaled and nodded.

"Yes," he admitted. "I saw her the other day when I was out with Amélie. I was so stunned I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t want to just abandon Amélie, but Beatrice... she looked at me like I’d stabbed her."

I winced. No wonder Beatrice had gotten so drunk at the party. I wished she had told me about this when she was sober. It stung that she hadn’t—I was supposed to be her best friend.

"Why didn’t you go after her?" I asked, trying not to sound accusatory, but I couldn’t help it.

Lucien’s jaw tightened. "I was scared."

And there it was—the truth neither of them wanted to face.

Finding one's mate was a monumental occasion, and I wanted nothing but the best for my dearest friend.

Lucien looked utterly defeated as he gave a half-hearted shrug.

"Like I said... I was in complete shock, and I couldn't just abandon Amélie after being the one to ask her out in the first place. I thought about tracking her down afterward to explain, but honestly, I had no clue who she was or where to even begin searching. I tried asking Amélie about her, but she barely gave me any details and kept steering the conversation elsewhere. Rightfully so—she didn’t want to discuss another woman on our date."

I nodded along, my chest tightening as I listened to his story.

"And what about now?" I pressed. "What about you and Giselle yesterday? You already knew you had a mate—you saw her with your own eyes—and yet you still chose to make out with Giselle in public?"

He dragged his fingers through his dark hair, his gaze fixed on the counter between us.

"Not my finest moment," he admitted quietly. "I genuinely didn’t think I’d ever see her again. I had no idea you were friends with her or that she’d witness that..."

I understood what he meant, but frustration still simmered inside me. Beatrice was hurting, and she refused to talk to—

###Chapter 233

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood's mountain retreat. Below her, the resort sprawled across the valley like a jewel nestled in emerald velvet. She tightened the silk robe around her waist, the fabric whispering against her skin.

"Miss Lillian?" A familiar voice interrupted her thoughts. Theodore Whitmore stood at the doorway, his silver tray bearing a single espresso. "Mr. Blackwood requested you join him in the study after breakfast."

Lillian accepted the coffee, the rich aroma mingling with the mountain breeze. "Thank you, Theodore. Is Oliver awake yet?"

"The young master is currently engaged in his fencing lesson with Professor Montgomery." The butler's lips twitched. "He insisted on wearing his pirate costume."

A laugh bubbled up in Lillian's chest. That explained the distant clanging of swords she'd heard earlier. She took a sip of coffee, the bitterness perfectly balanced with a hint of caramel—just how Sebastian preferred it.

The study door stood slightly ajar when she arrived. Through the gap, she could see Sebastian bent over blueprints spread across his mahogany desk, his dark hair falling across his forehead. The morning light caught the silver streaks at his temples, making them gleam like polished steel.

"You're staring." His deep voice startled her, though he hadn't looked up.

Lillian pushed the door open fully. "I was admiring the view." She gestured toward the floor-to-ceiling windows showcasing the snow-capped peaks.

Sebastian finally glanced up, his golden eyes knowing. "Of course you were." He tapped a spot on the blueprint. "Come here. I want your opinion on the new pack hospital designs."

As she approached, his scent enveloped her—oakmoss and something uniquely Sebastian. He straightened, his towering frame making the spacious study suddenly feel intimate.

Lillian focused on the blueprints. "The pediatric wing should be closer to the gardens. Sunlight helps healing."

Sebastian's fingers brushed hers as he adjusted the paper. "I knew there was a reason I kept you around."

Before she could retort, Marcus Grayson burst in, his usually composed face tight with tension. "Alpha, we have a situation. The Winslows just crossed into our territory."

Sebastian's posture shifted instantly, all business. "How many?"

"Reginald and Archibald, plus a full security detail." Marcus's gaze flicked to Lillian. "They're demanding to see Miss Lillian."

Ice slid down her spine. After everything Donovan had done—after he'd chosen Evelyn over her—what could his family possibly want now?

Sebastian's hand found the small of her back, warm and steadying. "Tell them they'll wait until I'm good and ready." His thumb traced small circles through her robe. "Let them sweat a little."

Lillian leaned into his touch, drawing strength from his unshakable presence. Whatever storm was coming, they'd face it together.

The grandfather clock in the corner ticked ominously as they waited, each second stretching like taffy. Somewhere in the house, Oliver's laughter echoed down the halls, blissfully unaware of the gathering storm.

Sebastian's phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, his expression darkening. "It seems our guests brought a...peace offering." He turned the screen toward her.

Lillian's breath caught. The photo showed Arabella Winslow—Donovan's youngest sister—bound and gagged in what appeared to be a wine cellar.

A message flashed below the image: We'll trade.

The coffee turned to acid in Lillian's stomach. This wasn't just a visit. This was a declaration of war.

"I'm not sure if I'm serious about anything," Sebastian blurted, panic flashing in his stormy gray eyes. "I haven't even had time to process this properly—to figure out what I truly want. Finding a mate was never part of my plans, Lillian. I never believed I'd have one, let alone want one."

"Wait... what?" My voice sharpened as I narrowed my eyes at him. "Are you seriously considering rejecting her?"

His teeth sank into his lower lip, his gaze darting away. That single hesitation was answer enough. My chest ached for Beatrice.

"Then if you're going to reject her, do it quickly," I snapped, bitterness lacing my words. My appetite vanished. I shoved my plate aside and stood abruptly. "Don't drag it out. Spare her the agony." Without waiting for a response, I turned on my heel and strode out of the kitchen, leaving him alone with his turmoil.

Sebastian's POV

"Alpha Blackwood, I've run three separate X-rays, but there's no physical injury to Victoria's leg," Dr. Langford said, adjusting her glasses.

I exhaled sharply, leaning against the sterile hospital wall. We'd been here since yesterday, trapped in this suffocating white hallway while Victoria sobbed about phantom pain, refusing to let me leave. My fingers raked through my disheveled hair as exhaustion weighed on me. Sleeping in that stiff hospital chair had been impossible—between the discomfort and Victoria's constant whimpering, rest was a lost cause.

I trusted Dr. Langford implicitly. She was the best in her field, and if she said nothing was wrong, then nothing was.

"Understood," I muttered. "So she can go home?"

Dr. Langford nodded. "Yes. Rest in her own bed might help. I'll prescribe placebo pills—tell her they're pain medication. If she believes she's being treated, the 'pain' should fade. It's purely psychological."

"Appreciate it," I said, rubbing my temples.

"I'll prepare the prescription immediately," she replied before disappearing down the hall.

With another sigh, I pushed open the door to Victoria's room. She was scowling at her phone, fingers flying across the screen.

"Everything alright?" I asked.

She startled, hastily dropping her phone and clutching her leg, tears welling up instantly. "Y-yes, it's just... my leg hurts so much, and Donovan hasn't even bothered to visit me!" Her voice cracked theatrically.

I sank onto the edge of her bed, taking her hands in mine. "I'm sure he's preoccupied. Let's get you home—"


"Take me home?!" Victoria gasped, her voice trembling. "But what about my leg? Daddy, it hurts so much!"

I gave a solemn nod.

"I know, sweetheart," I murmured, brushing a strand of hair from her tear-streaked face. "Dr. Langford will prescribe strong medication to help you rest."

She bit her lower lip, fresh tears spilling down her cheeks.

"O-okay," she stammered, her fingers clutching the hospital blanket.

Once the pain subsided, we could—

"As soon as we're home, we'll try calling Donovan. Maybe he can come see you. I’m not even sure if anyone told him you were hurt," I said gently.

She sniffled and wiped her eyes with the back of her hand.

Glancing at the clock, I realized it was already mid-afternoon. I told Lillian I’d pick her up soon—we could have dinner together and spend the evening making up for lost time. Guilt gnawed at me. I’d been distant lately, leaving her to fend for herself. Tonight, I wanted to fix that.

Dr. Langford returned with the medication, handing Victoria a pill and a glass of water.

"This is potent, so only one dose per day," she warned before meeting my gaze with a knowing wink.

Mouthing a silent thank you, I turned back to Victoria, who swallowed the pill with a grimace.

Marcus Grayson, my Beta, met us at the hospital and drove us home. After helping Victoria settle into bed with her phone, I retreated to my room to prepare for my evening with Lillian.

Just as I stepped into the hallway, a piercing scream shattered the silence.

My blood ran cold.

I sprinted back to Victoria’s room, my wolf bristling beneath my skin—only to find her alone, sobbing into her hands.

"What happened?" I demanded, scanning the room for any threat.

"Donovan won’t answer my calls!" she wailed, her voice breaking.

I suppressed a groan. Then her tear-filled eyes locked onto me, narrowing in accusation.

"Are you leaving?" she whispered.

I glanced down at my tailored suit and hesitated.

"Yes, I was just—"

Her cries intensified. "Please don’t go, Daddy! Donovan’s ignoring me, and I have no one else! I need you!"

"I can have one of the maids stay with you," I offered.

Tears streaked her flushed cheeks. "You’re never here anymore! I miss you!" Her voice cracked. "Please… don’t leave me again!"

###Chapter 234

The morning sun filtered through the silk curtains of Lillian's bedroom, casting golden patterns across the rumpled sheets. She stretched languidly, her werewolf senses immediately picking up the faint scent of bergamot and sandalwood lingering in the air - Sebastian had already left for his morning meeting.

Her phone buzzed violently on the nightstand. Beatrice's name flashed across the screen with three consecutive messages:

"Emergency brunch. NOW."
"Don't even think about saying no."
"Oliver spilled grape juice on your favorite designer blouse."

Lillian groaned, dragging herself out of bed. The marble floors felt cool beneath her bare feet as she padded to the walk-in closet. Her fingers brushed against the silk blouse in question - now sporting a suspicious purple stain near the hem.

"Damn it, Oliver," she muttered, though without real heat. The seven-year-old had wormed his way into her heart despite his mischievous streak.

The penthouse elevator doors slid open to reveal Beatrice pacing the foyer, her stiletto heels clicking against the polished floors. "Finally!" she exclaimed, grabbing Lillian's wrist. "We have a situation."

"What now?" Lillian allowed herself to be dragged toward the private elevator. "Did Donovan do something stupid again?"

"Worse." Beatrice's expression turned grim as the elevator descended. "Victoria's back in town."

Lillian's stomach dropped. Sebastian's daughter had been studying abroad since the disastrous engagement party where Donovan had publicly rejected her. "When?"

"Last night. And guess who picked her up from the airport?" Beatrice's grip tightened. "Your dear ex-fated mate himself."

The elevator doors opened to the building's private café where Oliver sat swinging his legs, a guilty expression on his face as he poked at a stack of pancakes. Theodore, Sebastian's ever-composed butler, stood nearby with a discreet stain remover kit.

"Miss Lillian," Theodore greeted smoothly. "Might I suggest changing into the emerald Balmain dress for today's... unexpected developments?"

Lillian barely registered his words as her phone buzzed again. An unknown number. The message contained only a single image: Donovan's arm draped casually around Victoria's shoulders as they exited a black town car, both smiling like conspirators.

Beatrice snatched the phone, her eyes widening. "That's taken outside Blackwood Enterprises. They're meeting Sebastian right now."

Oliver chose that moment to look up, syrup smeared across his cheek. "Aunt Lillian? Daddy said if Victoria comes home, we have to be extra nice to her. But I don't wanna." His lower lip trembled. "She's mean."

Theo placed a gentle hand on the boy's shoulder. "Now, Master Oliver, we mustn't—"

The sound of shattering glass cut him off. Lillian stood amidst the remains of her coffee cup, her wolf eyes flashing amber. "They're plotting something," she growled. "Donovan wouldn't just show up with Victoria unless..."

Beatrice finished her thought: "Unless they're making a move against Sebastian."

The café doors burst open, revealing Marcus Grayson, Sebastian's beta, his usually impeccable suit rumpled from haste. "Miss Whitaker," he gasped. "You need to come immediately. Alpha Harrison just arrived at headquarters with a formal challenge against Mr. Blackwood."

Lillian's blood ran cold. The pieces clicked into place - Donovan's sudden reappearance, Victoria's convenient return, now this challenge from one of Sebastian's oldest rivals.

Beatrice was already dialing her sister Isabella, the fashion model who moved in elite circles. "We need intel on Victoria's activities abroad," she hissed into the phone.

Oliver tugged at Lillian's sleeve, his blue eyes wide with childish understanding. "They're being bullies, aren't they?"

Lillian crouched to his level, forcing calm into her voice. "Your father can handle bullies, sweetheart. But we're going to help him, okay?"

As Theodore handed her a fresh phone (she'd apparently crushed hers), Lillian's mind raced. This wasn't just about pack politics anymore - someone was playing a dangerous game with her family. And the werewolf princess had learned one vital lesson since coming to live with the Blackwoods: nobody threatened what was hers.

Not Donovan. Not Victoria. Not even an entire pack of rival lycans.

"Marcus," she said, her voice steady with newfound resolve. "Take me to Sebastian. Now."

Lillian's POV



Sebastian wanted to take me out tonight. His text had been brief—Be ready by seven—but my pulse had spiked the moment I read it. After leaving the kitchen this morning, I’d locked myself in my room for an hour-long soak, desperate to scrub away the tension clinging to me like a second skin.

I’d tried calling Beatrice three times already, but her phone was off, every attempt shunted straight to voicemail. Even my texts sat unread, little blue bubbles mocking my worry. My chest ached. She didn’t deserve this. Lucien didn’t deserve to put her through this.

School tomorrow meant I’d see her, but now—now, I needed to know she was okay. Wrapping a towel around myself, I yanked the drain plug and caught my reflection in the fogged mirror. Dark circles bruised my under-eyes; my hair hung in damp, tangled waves. A sigh escaped me. Pulling off presentable for Sebastian tonight would take a miracle.

A knock rattled my door. I whirled, heart lurching—Beatrice?—but logic snuffed the hope instantly. Still, when I swung the door open, the sight of Giselle froze me mid-step. Her usually pristine bun sagged, her nose was blotchy, and her red-rimmed eyes told me everything.

We weren’t close—not like Lucien and I were—but the raw pain on her face twisted something in me.

"Giselle?" My voice softened. "Are you okay?"

She swiped at her cheeks, forcing a smile that didn’t reach her eyes. "Fine. Just checking if you needed anything. I’ve been... distracted lately."

I waved her off. "Don’t apologize. But you—yesterday was brutal. Are you sure you’re—"

"I’m fine," she cut in, too quickly. Then, quieter: "I just... need a distraction."

An idea sparked. Grinning, I grabbed her wrist and hauled her inside, shutting the door behind us. She stumbled, blinking, and I laughed. "Perfect. I have a sort-of date tonight."

Her flinch was immediate. Right—dating was the last thing she wanted to think about.

"Not officially dating," I amended. "Sebastian’s... complicated."

A flicker of understanding crossed her face. "I know complicated."

"Figured you would." I flopped onto the bed. "Haven’t seen him in days, and now he wants dinner. Problem? I look like I haven’t slept since the Stone Age."

Giselle studied me, then smirked. "Wasn’t gonna say it, but... yeah. You look like hell."

I arched an eyebrow at Giselle, my lips quirking into a teasing smirk.

"Someone's suddenly full of opinions," I shot back playfully.

A flush crept up her neck, painting her cheeks pink, and I bumped her shoulder lightly with mine.

"Relax, I'm only joking," I reassured her with a chuckle. "Honestly? I think we both need this distraction."

Her eyes sparkled with sudden interest. "So you're saying you want my help getting ready for your... whatever-this-is with Sebastian?"

I burst out laughing at her phrasing but nodded eagerly.

"You have killer style, and your makeup skills? Goddess, I'm jealous. I was hoping you could work your magic on me too."

Giselle practically glowed at the compliment, clapping her hands together. "Absolutely! This is perfect—I actually dreamed of being a makeup artist before..." Her voice trailed off.

I tilted my head. "Before what?"

She shrugged, tucking a loose curl behind her ear. "Beauty school costs a fortune. That's why I'm here—saving up every penny until I can afford it."

My chest tightened with understanding. If anything, it made me respect her more.

"Trust me, I get it," I said, leaning against the vanity. "That's exactly why I tutor Oliver. Every credit counts when you're paying your own way."

Her eyebrows shot up. "Wait, you're putting yourself through Gamma training too?"

"Combat and Defense specialization," I confirmed, rolling my shoulders. "Full warrior track."

"Ahhh," she drawled, snapping her fingers. "Now the combat lessons with Oliver make total sense."

I grinned, but her next question caught me off guard.

"What made you choose this path?"

The smile faded as memories surfaced—dark ones. "Because our kingdom deserves better protectors," I said quietly. "After what happened to my family... I never want to feel that helpless again."

The unspoken words hung between us, heavy with shared determination.

Giselle studied me for a long moment before nodding decisively. "Alright then. Let's make you look like the future Gamma warrior you are." She winked, already reaching for her makeup bag. "Sebastian won't know what hit him."

I groaned but didn't correct her assumption. Some battles were better left unfought.

###Chapter 235
The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s luxurious penthouse. The city sprawled beneath her, bathed in golden sunlight, yet her mind was anything but at peace.

Last night’s confrontation with Donovan still burned in her memory—his cold dismissal, the way he had chosen Evelyn over her without hesitation. She clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms. How could he?

The sliding door behind her opened, and Sebastian stepped out, his towering frame casting a shadow over her. His dark eyes, usually unreadable, held a flicker of concern. "You’re up early," he remarked, his voice low and smooth.

Lillian exhaled sharply. "Couldn’t sleep."

Sebastian leaned against the railing beside her, his presence both comforting and unnerving. "Thinking about him again?"

She didn’t answer. She didn’t need to.

A muscle ticked in Sebastian’s jaw. "He’s not worth it, Lillian."

She turned to face him, her amber eyes flashing. "You don’t understand. He was supposed to be my mate."

Sebastian’s gaze hardened. "And yet, he chose someone else. That’s his loss."

Before she could retort, her phone buzzed in her pocket. A message from Beatrice:

"Meet me at the café in an hour. We need to talk."

Lillian frowned. Beatrice rarely sounded this urgent.

Sebastian noticed her expression. "Problem?"

"Beatrice wants to meet," she said, slipping her phone away. "I should go."

He nodded. "Take Marcus with you."

She rolled her eyes. "I don’t need a babysitter."

Sebastian’s lips curved into a smirk. "Consider him a bodyguard. Or would you prefer I accompany you myself?"

The thought sent an unexpected shiver down her spine. "Fine. Marcus it is."

The café was bustling when Lillian arrived, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingling with the chatter of students. Beatrice sat at their usual corner table, her fingers drumming impatiently against the wood.

Lillian slid into the seat opposite her. "What’s going on?"

Beatrice leaned in, her voice barely above a whisper. "I overheard Evelyn talking to someone last night. She’s planning something—something big."

Lillian’s pulse quickened. "What do you mean?"

Beatrice hesitated, then dropped the bombshell. "She’s working with Alpha Harrison. They’re going to challenge Sebastian’s authority at the next council meeting."

Lillian’s blood ran cold. If Harrison succeeded, Sebastian’s position—and by extension, her own safety—would be at risk.

She gripped her coffee cup, her mind racing. "We need to warn Sebastian."

Beatrice nodded grimly. "And fast."

Just then, the café door swung open, and Evelyn sauntered in, flanked by two burly enforcers. Her smirk was venomous as her gaze locked onto Lillian.

"Well, well," Evelyn purred. "If it isn’t the rejected mate."

Lillian’s wolf snarled within her. This wasn’t just a chance encounter.

Evelyn had come for a fight.

And Lillian was more than ready to give her one.


She looked like she was about to press for more details, but I silently prayed she wouldn’t. My family drama wasn’t exactly dinner table conversation. Thankfully, she must’ve read the tension in my expression because she snapped her mouth shut and gave a quick nod.

A relieved sigh escaped me. I was grateful she respected the unspoken boundary.

Giselle snatched up the dress I’d left on the bed—a simple, understated thing—and held it up with a skeptical glance.

“You were seriously considering this?” She wrinkled her nose.

I crossed my arms. “It’s not that bad.”

She shook her head, already rifling through my closet. “Oh, honey, no. You need something that’ll make Sebastian do a double take. Let’s see what else you’ve got hiding in here.”

An hour later, after turning my wardrobe inside out, she emerged victorious with a slinky little number I’d completely forgotten about. Beatrice had forced me to buy it ages ago during one of her infamous shopping sprees, but I’d never had the guts to wear it. The neckline plunged dangerously low, and the hem barely grazed mid-thigh.

Giselle grinned, mischief sparkling in her eyes. “You can always throw on a cardigan if you chicken out.”

I burst out laughing. Fine. She’d won.

The next few hours blurred as Giselle transformed me. When she finally stepped back, I barely recognized the woman in the mirror. My reflection stared back—smoky eyes, tousled waves, lips stained a deep rose.

“Holy…” I breathed.

Giselle giggled, resting her chin on my shoulder. “Told you. You’re a knockout. And I deserve all the credit.”

“You absolutely do,” I admitted, still dazed. “You’re going to slay in beauty school.”

Her smile could’ve powered the entire city. She took a step back, dusting her hands off dramatically.

“Well, my masterpiece is complete.” She checked her watch, then gasped. “Wait—we’ve been in here all day?”

I glanced at the clock and nearly choked. She wasn’t kidding. The sun had set while we’d been lost in this makeover vortex. I grabbed my phone, hoping for a message from Beatrice—but the screen stayed blank.

Giselle caught my frown. “Still nothing from the Alpha?”

I shook my head, my stomach twisting.

###Chapter 236

"He'll be here to pick me up in about thirty minutes," I said, my fingers nervously tapping against my phone screen. "But that's not what's bothering me. It's Beatrice. I can't reach her at all. We haven't spoken since she left yesterday."

Giselle's expression faltered for a brief moment before she wrapped her arms around herself, as if trying to hold back the worry creeping into her voice. "That doesn't sound like her," she murmured. "Beatrice always answers your calls."

I swallowed hard, my stomach twisting with unease. "Exactly. Something feels off."

The silence between us stretched, heavy with unspoken concern. The bright morning sunlight streaming through the windows suddenly felt too harsh, too indifferent to the gnawing dread settling in my chest.

Giselle exhaled sharply, her fingers tightening around her elbows. "Have you tried tracking her phone?"

I shook my head. "She turned off her location sharing last week after that argument with Tyler. Said she needed space."

A shadow crossed Giselle's face. "You don't think... he had something to do with this, do you?"

My pulse spiked at the thought. Tyler had been charming at first, but lately, his possessiveness had started to unsettle even Beatrice. "I don't know," I admitted, my voice barely above a whisper. "But I'm going to find out."

Just then, my phone buzzed—a message notification. My breath hitched as I swiped it open, only for my hope to shatter.

Unknown Number: Stop looking for her.

The screen blurred as my hands began to shake.

Giselle's sharp inhale told me she'd seen it too. "Lillian," she said urgently, "we need to call Sebastian. Now."

But before I could react, another message came through—this time, a photo.

My blood turned to ice.

It was Beatrice.

And she wasn't alone.

I was in worse shape than when I'd started.

Slowly, I peeled off my dress and slipped back into my pajamas, twisting my hair into a messy knot before heading to the bathroom to scrub away the smeared makeup. The tears wouldn’t stop. I shouldn’t have been this upset over Sebastian canceling on me.

He wasn’t my real boyfriend. This was just an arrangement—mutually beneficial, nothing more. I needed Donovan out of my life, and he needed his family off his back. That was the deal. We both got what we wanted. I’d known the terms from the beginning, so why did this sting so much?

But my wolf didn’t seem to care about logic. She was devastated, just like when Donovan had chosen Evelyn over me. I’d sworn I’d never let myself feel this way again, yet here I was, drowning in foolish disappointment.

I decided to lock myself in my room for the rest of the night. Facing Giselle and Lucien wasn’t an option—I couldn’t handle their pity on top of my own mess of emotions. Better to hide, to bury myself under the covers and pretend sleep would come.

The next morning, I slipped out before dawn, avoiding them both. I wasn’t ready for questions.

###Chapter 237

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, illuminating the scattered papers on his mahogany desk. Lillian sat across from him, her fingers nervously twisting the hem of her sweater. The air between them was thick with unspoken tension, the weight of their recent argument still lingering.

"You can't just ignore this, Lillian," Sebastian said, his deep voice laced with frustration. His piercing blue eyes bore into hers, demanding an answer.

She swallowed hard, her gaze dropping to the contract in front of her. The terms were clear—signing it would bind her to him, not just as his mate, but as the future Luna of his pack. The thought sent a shiver down her spine.

"I need time," she whispered, her voice barely audible.

Sebastian exhaled sharply, running a hand through his dark hair. "Time is a luxury we don’t have. The council is pressing for an official announcement. If we delay any longer, they’ll assume weakness."

Lillian bit her lip, her mind racing. She had spent her entire life running from expectations, from the suffocating rules of werewolf society. But now, standing at the precipice of a future she never imagined, she wasn’t sure if she was ready to leap.

A knock at the door interrupted them. Theodore Whitmore, Sebastian’s ever-composed butler, stepped inside. "Forgive the intrusion, Alpha, but Miss Evelyn is here to see you."

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "Send her in."

Lillian stiffened as Evelyn sauntered into the room, her designer heels clicking against the marble floor. The scent of her expensive perfume filled the air, cloying and overpowering.

"Sebastian," Evelyn purred, her crimson lips curving into a smirk. "I was hoping we could discuss the upcoming gala. The press is already speculating about your special guest." Her eyes flicked to Lillian, dripping with condescension.

Lillian’s fingers curled into fists. She had no patience for Evelyn’s games, not when so much was at stake.

Sebastian’s expression darkened. "This isn’t the time, Evelyn."

Evelyn’s smirk faltered, replaced by a flicker of irritation. "Fine. But don’t keep me waiting too long." With a final glare at Lillian, she turned on her heel and strode out.

The moment the door clicked shut, Lillian exhaled sharply. "She’s never going to stop, is she?"

Sebastian’s gaze softened slightly. "She’s irrelevant. The only thing that matters is what you want."

Lillian met his eyes, her heart pounding. The truth was, she did want this—him, the pack, the future they could build together. But fear still held her back.

Before she could respond, her phone buzzed. A message from Beatrice lit up the screen:

"You need to see this. Now."

Attached was a grainy photo of Donovan—her ex-fated mate—standing outside a high-end hotel with a woman who looked eerily like her.

Lillian’s blood ran cold.

Sebastian noticed the shift in her expression immediately. "What is it?"

She handed him the phone, her voice hollow. "He’s back."

Sebastian’s grip on the device tightened, his eyes flashing with barely restrained fury. "This changes nothing."

But Lillian knew better.

Donovan’s return wasn’t just a coincidence.

It was a threat.

And it was only the beginning.

The morning sun filtered through the large windows of the student union as I checked my watch for the third time. Beatrice should have been here by now. Her early morning lecture ended fifteen minutes ago, and she always came straight to our usual corner afterward.

I'd arrived early enough to secure our favorite table by the fireplace and ordered two caramel macchiatos - her usual. The steam still curled from the cups when I noticed the first odd glance thrown my way.

Camille Fournier nearly tripped over her own feet when I called out to her. "Hey, Camille!"

She froze like a deer caught in headlights, her cheeks flushing crimson. "Oh! L-Lillian... hi." Her eyes darted everywhere but at me.

My fingers tightened around the warm coffee cup. This wasn't just Camille's usual shyness. As I scanned the room, at least a dozen students quickly looked away, their whispers hanging in the air like static electricity. The hair on my neck stood up.

Had Sebastian not managed to suppress all those tabloid photos? My pulse thundered in my ears as I turned back to Camille, who was twisting the strap of her backpack like a lifeline.

"Was Beatrice in class today?" I forced my voice to stay even.

Camille shook her head so hard her glasses slipped. "She emailed Professor Sinclair that she'd be absent for... for a few days."

The words hit like a physical blow. Beatrice hadn't mentioned anything about skipping classes. My coffee cup crumpled slightly in my grip as I nodded. "Thanks."

Before Camille could scurry away, I caught the pity in her eyes. That stung worse than the whispers. I dumped both untouched coffees in the trash with more force than necessary, my stomach churning.

Outside, the quad buzzed with activity. A group of students were hanging banners for the annual Gamma Trials between the oak trees. I'd nearly forgotten - only elite combat students could compete for the prestigious Gamma Cup. The winner would earn a coveted spot in the Elite Gamma Force, the most skilled warriors who protected all werewolf territories.

My feet carried me toward the humanities building on autopilot, but my mind was already planning to confront Beatrice at her apartment after my last seminar. Whatever was happening, I'd get answers tonight.

The whispers followed me across campus like shadows stretching in the afternoon sun.


Being chosen for the Elite Force had always been my ultimate dream. But deep down, I never truly believed I stood a chance.

Rumors swirled that the Head Gammas overseeing the Elites, accompanied by one of the Lycan Chairmen, would soon arrive at the academy to handpick students for the upcoming competition.

Just as I reached the entrance of the building, the door swung open abruptly. A towering figure stepped out—an undeniable force of nature. Startled, I stumbled back, my breath catching in my throat. His presence alone was overwhelming, an Alpha power so potent it forced my gaze downward. Instinctively, I bowed, unable to meet his eyes.

Several other men flanked him, their auras strong but paling in comparison. They wore the distinctive armor of Gammas, marking them as warriors of high rank.

"Ah, Lillian..." A familiar voice snapped me out of my daze.

I lifted my head just enough to see my combat professor, his expression a mix of surprise and something else—nervousness?

"Professor Sinclair..." I murmured, still unable to look directly at the Alpha before me.

"We were just discussing you," he said with a strained chuckle, his eyes flickering between me and the floor. "Allow me to introduce Alpha Maximilian Voss."

My mind reeled. Alpha Maximilian Voss—one of the most formidable Lycan Chairmen, the very one leading the Elite Gamma recruitment for the competition.

And, as fate would have it, Sebastian Blackwood's sworn rival.

###Chapter 238

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains, stirring Lillian from her restless sleep. She blinked against the light, her mind still heavy with the weight of last night’s confrontation. Donovan’s words echoed in her ears, sharp and venomous—"You were never enough for me."

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Lillian?" Sebastian’s deep voice carried through the wood, laced with concern. "Are you awake?"

She swallowed hard, forcing herself to sit up. "Come in."

The door creaked open, revealing Sebastian’s towering frame. His dark eyes scanned her face, taking in the shadows beneath her eyes. "You didn’t sleep well."

It wasn’t a question.

Lillian sighed, running a hand through her tangled hair. "Not really."

Sebastian stepped inside, closing the door behind him. The scent of freshly brewed coffee clung to him, mingling with his natural woodsy musk. He held out a steaming cup. "Thought you might need this."

She accepted it gratefully, the warmth seeping into her fingers. "Thanks."

Silence stretched between them, thick with unspoken tension.

Sebastian exhaled sharply, his jaw tightening. "I should’ve been there last night."

Lillian shook her head. "It wasn’t your fault. I didn’t expect Donovan to show up like that."

His fingers curled into fists at his sides. "He had no right to speak to you that way."

She took a slow sip of coffee, letting the bitterness ground her. "It doesn’t matter anymore. He made his choice."

Sebastian’s gaze burned into her. "It matters to me."

The intensity in his voice sent a shiver down her spine.

Before she could respond, her phone buzzed on the nightstand. Beatrice’s name flashed across the screen, followed by a string of frantic texts:

"Lillian, you need to see this. NOW."

Frowning, she unlocked her phone—and froze.

A photo filled the screen. Donovan and Evelyn, wrapped in each other’s arms, laughing under the neon lights of some high-end club. The timestamp? Last night.

Her stomach twisted.

Sebastian’s hand settled on her shoulder, his grip firm. "What is it?"

Wordlessly, she turned the screen toward him.

A low growl rumbled in his chest. "That bastard."

Lillian’s fingers trembled around the phone. "He was with her the whole time."

Sebastian’s expression darkened. "He’s playing games."

She clenched her jaw. "And I’m done being his pawn."

A knock at the door startled them both.

"Alpha?" Marcus’s voice called from the hallway. "We have a situation."

Sebastian’s eyes never left Lillian’s. "What kind of situation?"

Marcus hesitated. "It’s about Donovan. He’s at the gates—demanding to speak with Lillian."

Lillian’s blood ran cold.

Sebastian’s lips curled into a snarl. "Tell him to leave. Now."

But Lillian stood abruptly, setting the coffee aside. "No. I’ll handle this."

Sebastian caught her wrist. "Lillian—"

She met his gaze, her voice steady. "Trust me."

For a heartbeat, he searched her eyes—then released her with a reluctant nod.

Lillian squared her shoulders and strode toward the door.

This time, she wouldn’t run.

This time, he would regret ever crossing her.

Lillian's POV

Everyone was aware of the bitter rivalry between Maximilian Voss and Sebastian Blackwood. They were two of the most powerful Lycan Chairmen in existence. Centuries ago, all Lycans had ruled the werewolf territories together, but as power dynamics shifted and conflicts arose, they chose to divide their rule across different regions. Sebastian, the strongest among them, claimed the largest territory—a decision that never sat well with Maximilian, who was formidable in his own right but not quite at Sebastian’s level.

Rumors swirled that Maximilian had spent years scheming to overthrow Sebastian, sending spies and recruiting rogue wolves to destabilize his rule. None of it had ever been confirmed, but whispers persisted.

Having another Lycan in our territory was unsettling, to say the least—especially one who openly sought Sebastian’s downfall.

Professor Montclair smiled at me, but his eyes betrayed his nerves. I could tell he was thinking the same thing. The presence of Alpha Maximilian and the Elite Gamma Force was unnerving, particularly since Sebastian was the one who funded the Elites. Shouldn’t he be the one here instead?

"So, this is the Lillian Dumont you spoke of?" Maximilian’s voice was deep, laced with undeniable authority.

"Yes, Alpha," Professor Montclair replied. "She’s one of my most exceptional students."

I could feel Maximilian’s piercing gaze on me, and my cheeks burned under his scrutiny.

"She doesn’t appear particularly impressive," he mused. "Are you certain she can fight?"

"Absolutely, Alpha," Professor Montclair assured him, a proud smile curving his lips. "Don’t let her size fool you. She’s quick, fierce, and relentless."

Warmth spread through my chest at his praise.

Alpha Maximilian studied me a moment longer before turning to the Gammas behind him, nodding for them to proceed. They moved past me without a second glance, but Maximilian lingered, his icy stare sending a shiver down my spine. I quickly averted my eyes, focusing on a crack in the pavement, chewing my lip until it throbbed.

"I look forward to seeing what you’re capable of," he said, his tone laced with quiet challenge. Then, with those words hanging in the air, he strode away with the Gammas.

I stood frozen, pulse racing, unsure what had just happened.

Professor Montclair exhaled sharply and leaned against the doorframe.

"They’re here to recruit from the student pool today," he explained in a hushed tone. "I put in a strong recommendation for you."

"But why is Alpha Maximilian here?" I asked. "Shouldn’t it be Sebastian Blackwood?"

"The council voted for Maximilian to accompany the Elites this time. Sebastian has his hands full—running his own pack, managing his territory, and raising his children alone. Maximilian has no such responsibilities, so it was easier for him to go."

I nodded, absorbing his words.

"You’ve got this, Lillian," Professor Montclair said firmly. "I’ve always seen your potential. Now it’s time for them to see it too. Just fight like you always do—and win."

Easier said than done. Before, it had just been about class rankings and personal pride. Now? The stakes were infinitely higher.

I wished more than anything that Beatrice were here. Her unwavering support would have steadied me. After exchanging a final nod with my professor, I squared my shoulders and stepped forward—ready to prove myself.

###Chapter 239

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, painting the marble floors in warm hues. Lillian stretched beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming from last night’s passion. The scent of Sebastian—dark, intoxicating, and undeniably alpha—lingered on her skin, a possessive claim she no longer resisted.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, pulling the duvet higher.

The door creaked open, revealing Giselle Beaumont, the head maid, balancing a silver tray laden with breakfast. "Good morning, Miss Lillian. Mr. Blackwood instructed me to bring you this before your meeting."

Lillian smiled. "Thank you, Giselle."

The maid hesitated, her gaze flickering to the empty space beside Lillian. "He left early for the office. Said something about an urgent call from Alpha Maximilian."

Lillian’s fingers tightened around the fork. Maximilian Voss. The name alone sent a ripple of unease through her. The rival Lycan chairman had been a thorn in Sebastian’s side for years, and his sudden interest was never a good sign.

She forced a smile. "I’ll be down shortly."

Giselle nodded and retreated, leaving Lillian alone with her thoughts.

The Blackwood Enterprises lobby buzzed with activity when Lillian arrived. Executives in tailored suits hurried past, their voices hushed but urgent. She barely had time to process the tension before Marcus Grayson, Sebastian’s beta, intercepted her.

"Lillian," he greeted, his usual composed demeanor frayed at the edges. "Sebastian’s in a meeting. He asked me to brief you."

Her stomach knotted. "What’s going on?"

Marcus exhaled sharply. "Voss made a move. He’s challenging Sebastian’s claim over the northern territories—and he’s brought evidence."

Lillian’s pulse spiked. "What kind of evidence?"

Before Marcus could answer, the elevator doors slid open, revealing Sebastian. His storm-gray eyes darkened when they landed on her.

"Lillian," he said, voice rough. "We need to talk."

The way his jaw clenched told her everything.

This wasn’t just business.

This was war.

In the privacy of his office, Sebastian finally spoke. "Voss has documents suggesting my father’s dealings with the Winslows were... less than legal."

Lillian’s breath hitched. The Winslows—Ethan’s family. If this got out, the scandal could topple Sebastian’s empire.

She stepped closer. "What do we do?"

Sebastian’s fingers brushed her cheek, his touch both tender and fierce. "We fight." His lips curled into a dangerous smile. "And we make sure Voss regrets ever crossing us."

Outside, thunder rumbled, as if the sky itself warned of the storm to come.

But Lillian wasn’t afraid.

With Sebastian by her side, she’d face anything—even the devil himself.

Three grueling classes later, I finally had a brief respite before my last class of the day—Combat Training.

This was the course that would shape my entire future. My pulse hammered in my throat as I sat in the student lounge, flipping through notes and finishing assignments from earlier lectures.

I’d tried calling Beatrice a few more times since settling in, but each attempt went straight to voicemail. Frustration coiled in my chest as I shoved my phone back into my pocket. Was she avoiding me? The thought prickled at me, but I shook it off. I hadn’t done anything wrong—there was no reason for her to be upset.

...Right?

A glance at the clock sent a jolt through me. Oh no. I had mere minutes to get to combat class before I’d be marked late. Where had the time gone?

I scrambled to shove my books into my bag and bolted from the lounge. Thankfully, the gym wasn’t far, but when I skidded into the combat center, my jaw nearly hit the floor.

The place was packed.

Students who weren’t even in the class had crowded in, buzzing with anticipation. The Elite Gamma Force Trials only happened once every decade, and today’s session would determine who got recruited. This wasn’t just a class—it was a spectacle.

“You’re late,” Professor Montclair said coolly as I stumbled through the doors.

I swallowed hard.

“Lost track of time,” I admitted.

His sharp gaze swept over me before he jerked his chin toward the locker room. “Get changed. Now.”

I didn’t need to be told twice.
###Chapter 240

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains of Lillian’s bedroom, stirring her awake. She stretched lazily, her muscles still sore from yesterday’s training session with Professor Montclair. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted up from the kitchen, making her stomach growl.

Downstairs, Donovan sat at the dining table, scrolling through his phone with a scowl. Evelyn was beside him, whispering something that made his lips curl into a smirk. Lillian clenched her fists, forcing herself to remain calm. She had long accepted that Donovan was no longer hers, but seeing him with Evelyn still stung.

"Morning," Beatrice chirped, sliding a plate of pancakes toward her. "You look like you could use some sugar."

Lillian managed a small smile. "Thanks, Bea."

Sebastian Blackwood entered the room, his presence commanding immediate attention. His dark eyes flickered toward Lillian, and for a brief moment, she thought she saw something unreadable in his gaze.

"We leave for the summit in an hour," he announced. "Pack light. We won’t be staying long."

Lillian nodded, though her stomach twisted with nerves. The Lycan Summit was a high-stakes event where rival packs negotiated alliances—or declared war. And with Alpha Maximilian Voss rumored to be attending, tensions were already high.

As she finished her breakfast, Oliver bounded into the room, his face alight with excitement. "Lillian! Are you really going to see the other Alphas?"

She ruffled his hair. "Yep. But don’t worry, I’ll bring you back something cool."

Sebastian’s phone buzzed, and his expression darkened as he read the message. "We have a problem."

Marcus Grayson, his Beta, stepped forward. "What is it?"

"Alpha Voss has already arrived," Sebastian said grimly. "And he’s brought reinforcements."

Lillian’s pulse quickened. This wasn’t just a negotiation—it was a power play.

Beatrice grabbed her hand. "Be careful out there."

Lillian squeezed back. "Always am."

But as she followed Sebastian out the door, she couldn’t shake the feeling that this summit would change everything.

And not necessarily for the better.

I nodded and continued observing the various sparring matches. Soon, it was my turn to face Odette.

As I’d mentioned before, she was massive—which meant I could use my petite frame and agility to wear her down before striking. My instructors had always drilled into me: never repeat the same move twice. We’d sparred before, so she already knew some of my techniques. That meant I needed to switch things up.

Darting around her, I slipped between her legs, tucking into a roll to evade her grasp. She snarled, her wolf flashing briefly in her eyes.

"You won’t win this time!" she hissed, her voice laced with fury.

She lunged, but before she could reach me, I seized the climbing rope hanging from the ceiling and swung myself out of her reach. Her eyes widened as I soared over her head like some bizarre, vengeful pixie.

Gasps and cheers erupted from the students as I used the momentum to kick Odette square in the shoulder. She staggered back, and I twisted the rope around her torso, yanking her off balance. The move caught her so off guard that she toppled, taking us both down. Luckily, I landed on top of her—her body cushioning my fall.

She hit the mat first. Victory was mine.

The crowd roared, including Professor Montclair.

My gaze flicked to Alpha Maximilian, who was scribbling notes in his journal. Odette cursed under her breath as she stormed away. Her friends tried to console her, but she brushed them off, insisting she was fine.

Next up: Étienne. He looked downright furious as he stepped forward.

"Do I seriously have to fight a girl?" he muttered.

I smirked. "What’s the matter, Étienne? Scared I’ll wipe the floor with you?"

His nostrils flared. "In your dreams, sweetheart."

The bell rang, and we clashed. He was a far better opponent than Odette, matching me blow for blow. Like her, though, he knew some of my moves, so I couldn’t recycle the rope trick. For a moment, I thought I’d lose—until he made one critical mistake.

He tried to flip me over his shoulder and slam me onto the mat. The second my back hit the ground, he’d have won. What he didn’t expect was for me to reverse our positions midair. His shoulder struck the mat first.

Cheap shot? Maybe. But it worked.

The crowd went wild. Seeing someone my size take down two of the biggest fighters in class must’ve been hilarious. Most of these students had never witnessed—

###Chapter 241

The morning sun cast golden rays through the grand windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s estate, illuminating the polished marble floors. Lillian stretched lazily in bed, her fingers brushing against the silk sheets. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted from the hallway, signaling the start of another day in the Lycan chairman’s world.

She had barely sat up when a soft knock echoed at her door.

"Come in," she called, pulling the duvet closer.

The door creaked open, revealing Beatrice, her best friend, holding a tray of breakfast pastries. "Morning, sleepyhead," Beatrice teased, setting the tray on the bedside table. "Sebastian’s already in his office, and Oliver’s been asking for you since dawn."

Lillian groaned, rubbing her eyes. "What time is it?"

"Nearly ten," Beatrice said with a smirk. "You’d think after everything that’s happened, you’d be an early riser."

Lillian shot her a glare but reached for a croissant anyway. The buttery flakiness melted on her tongue, and she sighed in contentment. "Fine, I’ll get up. But only because Oliver’s waiting."

Beatrice rolled her eyes. "Sure, blame the kid."

As Lillian dressed, her mind wandered to the events of the past few weeks—Donovan’s betrayal, Evelyn’s sudden appearance, and the growing tension between the packs. She had hoped things would settle after the confrontation at the gala, but if anything, the stakes had only gotten higher.

Downstairs, Oliver was bouncing on his heels near the grand staircase, his dark curls tousled from running around. "Lillian! You’re finally awake!" He tugged at her hand. "Come on, Dad said we could go riding today!"

Lillian laughed, letting him drag her toward the stables. The crisp autumn air greeted them as they stepped outside, the scent of fallen leaves mingling with the earthy aroma of horses.

Sebastian stood near the paddock, his broad shoulders silhouetted against the morning light. He turned as they approached, his piercing gaze softening at the sight of them. "Took you long enough," he murmured, though there was no real reproach in his tone.

Lillian smirked. "Blame Oliver. He insisted I needed my beauty sleep."

Sebastian arched a brow but didn’t argue. Instead, he handed her the reins of a sleek black mare. "She’s spirited," he warned. "But I think you can handle her."

The challenge in his voice sent a thrill through her. Lillian mounted the horse with ease, her fingers tightening around the reins. "Watch me."

As they rode through the sprawling estate, the tension of the past weeks melted away, replaced by the simple joy of the moment. But beneath the surface, Lillian couldn’t shake the feeling that this peace was fleeting—that soon, the storm brewing between the packs would break.

And when it did, she would have to choose—between the life she’d built with Sebastian and the past that still haunted her.

For now, though, she let herself enjoy the ride.

Sebastian's POV

"Alpha, he's here," Marcus said as he stepped into my office. His voice was tight with tension. "Alpha Maximilian arrived in our territory this morning."

I pressed my fingers against my temples, feeling the beginnings of a migraine. The last person I wanted to deal with today was Alpha Maximilian Voss—but fate had other plans. As the appointed recruiter for the Elite Gamma Trials, he traveled across packs to select the most promising warriors for the decade-long competition.

And as much as I wished I could oversee the selections myself, my responsibilities as Lycan Chairman kept me anchored here.

"Make sure the guards deny him access to my estate," I muttered. "The less I have to see of him, the better."

Marcus hesitated before speaking again. "Rumor has it he’s already chosen his candidate. He might leave by tonight."

My head snapped up. "Already? How many?"

"Just one, from what I’ve heard. No confirmation on who it is yet."

I waved him off. "No need to dig further. I’ll be at the Trials next week anyway."

Marcus nodded. "Your flight arrangements are set. Lycan Alpha Nathaniel has already granted you passage through his lands."

I checked the time—Lillian’s tutoring session with Oliver would start soon. Guilt gnawed at me for canceling on her last night. I needed to make it up to her.

Marcus suddenly paled. "Shit. I’m late—I have to get Lillian."

My gaze sharpened. "Why you? Where’s Frederick?"

"He requested the night off. I told him I’d handle it."

A growl rumbled in my chest. "And you didn’t think to inform me?"

Marcus shrugged, unfazed. "Didn’t seem like a big deal. As long as someone picks her up—"

I cut him off with a glare. "Get moving. Now."

He had the nerve to smirk before bolting out the door.

But he was right about one thing—Lillian would be waiting. Alone.

And that thought sent a surge of possessiveness through me.

The thought of Beatrice being out there alone sent chills down my spine. Anything could happen to her. Especially with Alpha Maximilian Voss lurking around the territory.

Lillian's POV

I stared down at the packet Alpha Maximilian had handed me before I left the gym. It contained all the details I needed for the upcoming competition—hotel reservations, transportation arrangements, and even my plane ticket. This was really happening. In just one week, I'd be boarding that plane to compete in the most crucial event of my life.

My heart hammered wildly in my chest. I was the only one they had chosen, which didn’t sit well with the rest of the class. But honestly, I was skeptical too. More than anything, I wished I could tell Beatrice about it, but I’d have to wait until I figured out where she was and why she was ghosting me. For now, I was just relieved to be heading back to the villa so I could tell Sebastian. I had to let him know I’d be taking a few weeks off—I wouldn’t be around to tutor Oliver.

Standing outside the school gates, I checked my watch with a frown. It wasn’t like Frederick to be late, but here I was, waiting. The delay made me uneasy—was something wrong?

Minutes later, a sleek black car pulled up in front of me, and my entire body tensed. I knew that car. And I really didn’t want to deal with him right now. Without hesitation, I turned on my heel, ready to march back toward campus. Frederick could text me when he arrived.

But before I could take more than two steps, I heard the car door slam shut, followed by rapid footsteps closing in behind me.

"Stop running away from me!" Donovan’s voice cut through the air as his hand clamped around my wrist, yanking me around to face him. "What the hell is your problem?"

I narrowed my eyes, wrenching my arm free.

"Don’t touch me," I snapped, crossing my arms tightly over my chest. "What are you doing here, Donovan?"

###Chapter 242

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s sprawling estate. The sun had barely risen, casting a golden hue over the dense forest that bordered the property. She tightened the silk robe around her, the fabric whispering against her skin.

Last night’s confrontation with Donovan still burned in her mind. His betrayal had cut deeper than she’d ever admit, but she refused to let it break her. Not again.

A soft knock at the door pulled her from her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, turning to see Beatrice stride in, her usual bubbly energy subdued.

"You look like you didn’t sleep," Beatrice remarked, flopping onto the plush armchair by the fireplace.

Lillian sighed, running a hand through her tousled hair. "Couldn’t."

Beatrice’s expression softened. "Still thinking about him?"

Lillian clenched her jaw. "I’d rather not."

Beatrice leaned forward, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "Well, you might want to brace yourself. Sebastian’s called a pack meeting. Rumor has it, Donovan’s making a move."

Lillian’s pulse spiked. "What kind of move?"

Beatrice shrugged. "No one knows yet. But Marcus is already gathering the warriors."

Lillian’s wolf stirred beneath her skin, restless. If Donovan was planning something, she wouldn’t be caught off guard. Not this time.

Just then, the door swung open again, and Sebastian strode in, his presence commanding the room. His dark eyes locked onto hers, unreadable as ever.

"Lillian," he said, his voice low. "We need to talk."

She squared her shoulders. "About?"

His lips curved into a smirk that didn’t reach his eyes. "Your ex-fated mate is challenging my authority."

A cold dread settled in her stomach. "What does that mean?"

Sebastian stepped closer, his scent—cedar and something distinctly alpha—wrapping around her. "It means war."

The word hung between them, heavy with unspoken consequences.

Beatrice gasped. "You can’t be serious."

Sebastian didn’t look away from Lillian. "Deadly serious."

Lillian swallowed hard. If Donovan was foolish enough to challenge Sebastian, he wouldn’t survive. And despite everything, a part of her still cared.

But war was coming. And she’d have to choose a side.

"I came to ask you if the news reports are true," Donovan said, his eyes darkening as he stepped closer. "Are you and Sebastian together?"

My breath hitched, and I instinctively took a step back, my pulse quickening.

"What are you talking about?" I feigned ignorance, though my fingers curled into fists at my sides.

"Don't play dumb, Lillian," he snarled, closing the distance between us, his presence suffocating. "I saw the headlines last week. The photos. Are you really with him? Is that why you’ve been avoiding me?"

A bitter laugh escaped me. "I’ve been avoiding you because you betrayed me, Donovan. Then you had the audacity to try and blackmail me into being your dirty little secret. This has nothing to do with Sebastian and everything to do with you," I spat, jabbing my finger into his chest.

His jaw clenched with every sharp press of my finger.

"Break it off with him," he demanded, his voice low and dangerous.

I scoffed. "My relationship is none of your business." I turned to leave, but his hand shot out, gripping my wrist so tightly I gasped. Pain flared as he spun me back to face him, his eyes blazing with fury.

"Everything about you is my business," he hissed through gritted teeth. "Make no mistake, Lillian. You will always be mine."

"Not a chance," I snapped, struggling against his bruising grip. "Let me go—you're hurting me!"

"I’ll let you go when I decide to," he sneered, tightening his hold until I winced. "I’ve been patient, but my patience has run out. You owe me."

"Donovan—" My voice was barely a whisper now, my wrist throbbing under his crushing grip. I could feel the bones straining, the skin bruising.

"Tell me you're mine," he growled, ignoring my pain.

"Donovan, stop—"

"TELL ME!"

Just as I was about to lash out, Donovan suddenly released me with a sharp cry. A sickening crack echoed through the air, followed by the metallic scent of blood. He stumbled back, clutching his nose as crimson spilled between his fingers.

I staggered away, stunned, before looking up—

Marcus Grayson stood there, his fist still clenched, his expression thunderous.

"She told you to let go," he said coldly, flexing his fingers. "You should’ve listened."

I stared, speechless. Marcus had just punched Donovan. For me.

"Marcus...?" I whispered, my voice trembling.

His gaze softened as he turned to me. "Are you okay?"

After a beat, I nodded. "I—I think so."

Donovan writhed on the ground, groaning as blood dripped onto the pavement.

"Come on, let’s get you out of here," Marcus said, offering me his hand. I took it, stepping over Donovan’s crumpled form.

"You bastard!" Donovan snarled as we walked away. "You’ll regret this! Do you even know who I am?"

I turned back, my voice icy. "In case you missed it the first hundred times—we’re done. Stay away from me."

His growl was feral, his wolf barely restrained. "Never."

With a sigh, I let Marcus guide me to his car. Once inside, I exhaled shakily, my wrist still throbbing.

"Thank you," I murmured.

He glanced at me through the rearview mirror, a faint smile tugging at his lips. "Of course. Sebastian would’ve skinned me alive if I hadn’t stepped in."

I swallowed hard. "Can we... keep this between us? I don’t want Sebastian to worry. Or Victoria."

Marcus was silent for a moment before nodding. "Alright. Our secret."

As the car pulled away, I didn’t look back.

###Chapter 243

The morning sun filtered through the heavy velvet curtains of the master suite, casting golden streaks across the rumpled silk sheets. Lillian stirred beneath the weight of Sebastian's arm draped possessively over her waist. His steady breathing tickled the nape of her neck, sending shivers down her spine despite the warmth radiating from his body.

She carefully extracted herself from his embrace, pausing when he murmured something unintelligible in his sleep. The sight of the mighty Lycan chairman looking so vulnerable made her heart clench. The faint scar running along his jawline - a souvenir from last week's border skirmish - stood out starkly against his tanned skin.

The marble floor was cool beneath her bare feet as she padded toward the ensuite bathroom. The reflection staring back at her in the gilded mirror showed dark circles under her eyes - three nights of interrupted sleep since Oliver's fever had broken. The seven-year-old had clung to her like a limpet during his illness, his small hands fisting in her nightgown whenever she tried to leave.

A sudden vibration from the nightstand made her jump. Sebastian's phone lit up with a notification - Victoria's name flashing across the screen. Lillian's fingers hovered over the device, torn between curiosity and propriety. The engagement between Victoria and Donovan had been officially called off after the truth about Evelyn's pregnancy came to light, but the fallout still rippled through their lives.

The shower's steaming water did little to wash away her unease. She could still hear Donovan's venomous words from their last encounter: "You'll regret choosing him over me, Lillian." The memory made her scrub her skin harder, as if she could erase the phantom touch of his fingers on her wrist.

Dressed in a simple cotton sundress, she found Beatrice already in the kitchen, animatedly discussing menu options with Lucien. The head chef's dramatic hand gestures sent his white apron flapping like the wings of an agitated swan.

"Morning, sunshine!" Beatrice chirped, pushing a steaming mug of chamomile tea across the breakfast bar. "You look like you wrestled a werebear and lost."

Lillian managed a weak smile. "Feels like it. Oliver kept kicking me all night."

The kitchen door swung open to reveal Theodore, his usually impeccable suit rumpled, dark circles mirroring her own. "Miss Lillian," he rasped, "Alpha Harrison is at the gates. He claims it's urgent pack business."

Ice water seemed to flood her veins. The last time she'd seen Alpha Harrison, he'd been leering at her across a crowded bar, his intentions as clear as the full moon. Sebastian had nearly ripped his throat out for the disrespect.

Before she could respond, heavy footsteps announced Sebastian's arrival. He filled the doorway in nothing but low-slung pajama pants, his bare chest displaying fresh scratches from their passionate night. The sight made Beatrice wolf-whistle while Lucien pretended to fan himself.

"Tell Harrison to wait in the formal parlor," Sebastian growled, his voice still rough with sleep. His golden eyes locked onto Lillian, darkening with possessiveness. "You're not going anywhere near him."

Lillian opened her mouth to protest when Oliver came barreling into the room, his pajamas covered in what appeared to be chocolate smears. "Daddy! I drew you a picture!" He waved a crayon masterpiece that suspiciously resembled a decapitated werewolf.

As Sebastian scooped up his son, Lillian caught the flicker of pain in his eyes. The upcoming Alpha summit would mean three days apart - the longest they'd been separated since mating. And with Donovan still lurking in the shadows, the timing couldn't be worse.

The doorbell chimed again, more insistently this time. Marcus appeared in the hallway, his expression grim. "Sebastian," he said quietly, "Harrison isn't alone. He's brought witnesses from the Council."

The air in the kitchen thickened with tension. Council visits never meant good news. Sebastian's jaw tightened as he handed Oliver to Lillian. "Take him upstairs," he ordered softly. Then, with a kiss that left her lips tingling, he added, "No matter what you hear, stay there."

As Lillian climbed the stairs with Oliver's small hand in hers, the front door creaked open below. Harrison's oily voice slithered through the foyer: "Sebastian Blackwood, by order of the Lycan High Council, you are hereby summoned to answer for the crime of mate theft..."

The rest was drowned out by Oliver's sudden squeal of delight at seeing his pet ferret. But Lillian's blood had turned to ice. Mate theft? That was a capital offense in some territories. And with Donovan's connections on the Council...

Her grip tightened on the banister as realization dawned. This wasn't just a power play. It was a carefully laid trap. And she'd walked right into it the moment she rejected her fated mate.

Third Person POV

Donovan's wounds were already knitting together, his werewolf healing kicking in before Lillian sped away. His gaze burned into the distance where her car had vanished, fury simmering beneath his skin. How dare she treat him like this? After everything they had shared, she thought she could just discard him like trash. Two years—two damn years—and now she was tossing him aside without a second thought.

And then there was Sebastian Blackwood, stealing what was rightfully his. The whole point of cozying up to Victoria had been to secure her father’s favor, but now? Now he despised the man with every fiber of his being.

A sudden, overwhelming presence prickled at Donovan’s senses. He whirled around to find a group of Elite Gamma warriors striding toward him. Their pristine uniforms and imposing physiques made his eyes widen. He’d known the Elites would be arriving soon, but today?

Among them walked the source of that suffocating aura—Alpha Maximilian Voss. A formidable Lycan Chairman. Not quite as powerful as Sebastian Blackwood, but close enough, and more importantly, Sebastian’s sworn enemy.

Maximilian’s sharp gaze locked onto Donovan, narrowing slightly at the blood staining his clothes.

"Alpha Voss," Donovan said, dipping his head in respect. "It’s an honor."

"You look familiar," the Alpha rumbled, his voice thick with authority. "Have we met?"

"No, sir. But you’ve met my father."

"And who might that be?" Maximilian asked, feigning disinterest while still watching him closely.

"Archibald Winslow."

Maximilian’s brows lifted slightly. "The Winslow family?" His eyes raked over Donovan’s face, assessing.

"Yes, sir. Donovan Winslow," he replied, pride lacing his words.

The Alpha considered this for a moment before nodding. "I see." Then, his gaze flicked to the blood on Donovan’s face. "And what happened to you?"

Donovan had nearly forgotten about his injuries. Heat crept up his neck. "Just a minor accident."

Maximilian’s eyes narrowed. Without a word, he jerked his chin at one of his Gammas, who immediately stepped forward and hauled Donovan to his feet. Donovan tensed, expecting violence, but the Gamma merely steadied him before stepping back.

"Thank you," Donovan muttered.

"What kind of accident?" Maximilian pressed.

Donovan hesitated, swallowing hard as he met the Alpha’s piercing stare. "I—what?"

"I asked what kind of accident," Maximilian repeated, impatience creeping into his tone. "Don’t make me use my Alpha command to drag the truth out of you."

"No need, sir," Donovan said quickly. "I got into a fight with Marcus Grayson—Beta of the Silver Crescent pack."

A dark glint flickered in Maximilian’s eyes. He knew exactly whose pack that was.

"The Silver Crescent pack?" he echoed, interest sharpening.

Donovan’s lips curled into a slow smirk. "Yes, sir. Alpha Sebastian Blackwood’s pack." He feigned shock, slapping a hand over his mouth. "Apologies, Alpha. That was… uncalled for."

Maximilian arched a brow. "Not a fan of Alpha Sebastian?"

"Not since he stole what was mine," Donovan muttered, crossing his arms.

"And what, exactly, did he steal?"

"My mate."

Maximilian’s brows shot up. "He took your mate?"

"Yes," Donovan spat. "Lillian and I were together for two years. I came here to remind her she still belongs to me, but then that Beta blindsided me. Cheap shot. I could’ve taken him if I’d been ready."

"Big words," Maximilian mused. "But can you back them up?"

"Absolutely," Donovan said, brushing dirt from his pants. "I’ll do whatever it takes to get Lillian back and put Sebastian in his place."

"Lillian?" Maximilian’s lips twitched. "Montague?"

Donovan stiffened. "Y-yes."

For a long moment, Maximilian just stared at him. Then, to Donovan’s shock, the Alpha threw his head back and laughed—a deep, mocking sound. Donovan forced an awkward chuckle, unsure of the joke.

"Oh, this is delicious," Maximilian finally said, eyes gleaming with malice.

"What is?"

"Lillian is my recruit. She’ll be under my wing for quite some time."

Donovan’s smirk faltered. "Oh. I see."

Silence stretched between them before Maximilian leaned in.

"Tell me, Donovan…" His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Are you willing to do whatever it takes to get her back? Even if the price is higher than you’re ready to pay?"

Donovan held the Alpha’s gaze, pulse racing. This man could give him everything—Lillian, power, a title.

And he was willing to pay any price.

###Chapter 244

The evening air was thick with tension as Lillian stood in the grand hall of the Blackwood estate. The chandeliers cast a golden glow over the assembled guests, but the warmth did nothing to ease the chill running down her spine.

Sebastian Blackwood, the formidable Lycan chairman, stood beside her, his presence both reassuring and intimidating. His piercing gaze swept over the room, lingering briefly on Donovan, who stood near the entrance with Evelyn clinging to his arm. The sight of them together still sent a sharp pang through Lillian’s chest, though she refused to let it show.

Beatrice nudged her gently. "You okay?" she whispered.

Lillian forced a small smile. "I’m fine."

But she wasn’t. Not really.

The gathering was supposed to be a celebration—a formal introduction of the visiting delegates from the neighboring packs. Yet beneath the veneer of polite conversation and clinking glasses, the undercurrents of rivalry and old grudges were impossible to ignore.

At the far end of the room, Alpha Harrison leaned against a marble pillar, his smirk unmistakable as he watched her. Lillian suppressed a shudder. She hadn’t forgotten the way he’d cornered her that night at the bar, his intentions anything but honorable.

Sebastian’s hand brushed against hers, grounding her. "Stay close," he murmured, his voice low and commanding.

She nodded, grateful for his silent reassurance.

Then, the doors swung open, and a hush fell over the crowd.

A woman strode in, her silver gown shimmering under the lights, her presence commanding every eye in the room. Celeste Devereaux—the famous actress and model—had arrived.

Lillian’s breath hitched. She had heard rumors of Celeste’s visit, but seeing her in person was something else entirely. The woman was breathtaking, her confidence radiating like a force of nature.

And then, Celeste’s gaze locked onto Sebastian.

A slow, knowing smile curved her lips as she approached him, her movements graceful and deliberate. "Sebastian," she purred, extending a perfectly manicured hand. "It’s been too long."

Lillian’s fingers twitched at her side.

Sebastian took Celeste’s hand, his expression unreadable. "Celeste. I wasn’t expecting you until tomorrow."

She laughed, the sound like tinkling bells. "I couldn’t resist making an entrance."

Lillian swallowed hard, her pulse quickening.

Beatrice leaned in again, her voice barely audible. "Don’t let her get to you. She’s just trying to rattle you."

But it was working.

Celeste’s eyes flicked to Lillian, assessing her with a single glance before dismissing her entirely. The message was clear: You don’t belong here.

Lillian clenched her fists.

Then, from the corner of her eye, she caught Donovan watching her, his expression unreadable. Evelyn whispered something in his ear, and he turned away, but not before Lillian saw the flicker of something—regret? Guilt?—in his eyes.

The night was far from over.

And Lillian had a sinking feeling that the real storm was just beginning.

"I want to be the Alpha of the Redmoon Pack," Donovan declared abruptly. "But I also want Lillian back."

Alpha Maximilian's lips curled into a knowing smirk.

"I can get you both," he assured Donovan, his voice dripping with calculated charm. "Sebastian Blackwood isn't the only one who wields power."

"I'll do whatever it takes," Donovan replied, a slow, predatory grin spreading across his face.

"Excellent," Maximilian murmured, reaching into his tailored coat and producing a sleek black business card. He handed it to Donovan with deliberate precision.

"If you want our alliance to succeed, you must surrender complete control to me—mentally and physically," Maximilian continued, his golden eyes glinting with unspoken threats. "No secrets. You will tell me everything. Call me when you're ready for the next step."

With that, he signaled to his gammas, and within moments, they vanished into the night, leaving Donovan standing alone, the weight of his ambition and the promise of revenge simmering in his veins.

Lillian's POV

"Can we stop by Beatrice's place before heading to the villa?" I asked Marcus as soon as we left the university gates.

"Of course," he replied, his sharp gaze flickering to me through the rearview mirror. "Everything alright?"

"I don't know," I admitted, my fingers twisting nervously in my lap. "She hasn’t answered any of my calls since she stormed out of the mansion on Saturday. I’m worried."

Marcus gave a thoughtful nod, remaining silent as we pulled up to the apartment complex just off campus. Beatrice’s building was a short walk away. I already knew the passcode to enter, as well as the spare key she kept hidden beneath a ceramic pot of lavender by her door. I wasn’t going to bother knocking—she’d been ignoring me for days.

"Want me to come with you?" Marcus asked, rolling down the window as I hesitated on the sidewalk, staring up at her building.

"Yes," I blurted before I could second-guess myself. A cold dread had settled in my stomach, whispering that something was wrong. If it was, I didn’t want to face it alone.

He parked swiftly and joined me outside the building, his presence steadying. With an encouraging nod from him, I punched in Beatrice’s code. The lock clicked open, and Marcus held the door for me.

We climbed to the second floor in silence. Beatrice’s apartment was at the end of the hall, the only one with a potted plant outside. I’d always teased her about how obvious it was, but she’d insisted no one would think to look there.

My fingers trembled as I sifted through the soil, finally closing around the small silver key. I glanced up at Marcus, my voice barely above a whisper.

"I’m scared."

His hand brushed my shoulder reassuringly. "I’m right here."

I took a shaky breath, turned the key in the lock, and pushed the door open—only to freeze at the sight before me.

Beatrice’s apartment was in complete disarray.

I've always known Beatrice to be meticulous about cleanliness, which made the scene before me all the more jarring. The living room looked like a tornado had swept through—pizza boxes scattered across the floor, empty beer bottles littering every surface, and the stale scent of spilled alcohol hanging thick in the air. The television blared some trashy reality show, its flickering glow casting eerie shadows across the mess. The fridge door stood ajar, a puddle of water pooling beneath it, and when I peered inside, the stench of spoiled food hit me like a physical blow.

Marcus Grayson wrinkled his nose in disgust as he took in the disaster zone, his sharp eyes scanning the chaos before landing on the coffee table, where a half-eaten slice of pizza had congealed into an unappetizing mess. Without a word, he snatched the remote and silenced the TV, plunging the room into an unsettling quiet.

My pulse pounded in my ears.

"Beatrice?!" I called out, my voice cracking with desperation. Silence answered me.

I turned to Marcus, my breath coming in short gasps. His jaw tightened, but he kept his voice steady. "Maybe she's in her room."

Swallowing hard, I forced myself to move down the narrow hallway, each step heavier than the last. Marcus followed close behind, his presence both grounding and suffocating. When I reached her bedroom door, my hand trembled as I turned the knob.

The moment I pushed it open, my entire world screeched to a halt.

Beatrice lay sprawled on the floor, motionless, her face pressed into a pool of vomit.

"B-Beatrice?!" The scream tore from my throat as I lunged forward, my vision blurring with tears.

"Jesus Christ," Marcus muttered, already pulling his phone from his coat. "I'm calling an ambulance. I'll make sure my contact meets us at the hospital."

But his words barely registered. All I could focus on was the terrifying pallor of Beatrice's skin, the way her chest barely rose with each shallow breath. I grabbed her wrist, my fingers fumbling for a pulse, and nearly collapsed in relief when I found it—weak but there.

"Hold on, Beatrice," I sobbed, cradling her face. "Just hold on. We're getting you help."

###Chapter 245

The evening air was thick with tension as Lillian stood in the grand hall of the Blackwood estate. The chandeliers cast a golden glow over the gathered guests, their whispers like a restless wind. She could feel Donovan’s gaze burning into her from across the room, his new mate, Evelyn, clinging possessively to his arm.

Sebastian Blackwood, the formidable Lycan chairman, stood beside Lillian, his presence an unspoken shield. His fingers brushed lightly against hers, sending a jolt of warmth through her. She glanced up at him, catching the flicker of something dangerous in his dark eyes—protectiveness, possessiveness, maybe even something more.

"Relax," he murmured, his voice low and velvety. "No one touches what’s mine."

Lillian swallowed hard, her pulse quickening. She wasn’t used to being claimed so openly, but she couldn’t deny the thrill it sent through her.

Across the room, Beatrice nudged her with an elbow, grinning. "Look at you, all official now. The whole pack’s watching."

Lillian exhaled sharply. "I know. It’s just… a lot."

Beatrice smirked. "You’ll get used to it. Especially when you realize how many people are jealous."

Lillian’s gaze flickered to Cassandra, her rival from school, who was glaring daggers at her from the edge of the crowd. Then there was Victoria, Sebastian’s daughter, who had once been engaged to Donovan. Her expression was unreadable, but the tension in her posture was unmistakable.

Before Lillian could dwell on it, the music swelled, signaling the start of the formal introductions. Sebastian’s grip on her hand tightened as he led her forward.

"Time to make our presence known," he said, his voice carrying the weight of command.

Lillian lifted her chin, steeling herself. Whatever came next, she was ready.

But as she stepped forward, she caught a glimpse of Donovan’s face—twisted with something dark and unspoken.

And she knew.

This night was far from over.

Lillian's POV

With Marcus's help, the ambulance arrived in record time. I accompanied Beatrice to the hospital, my hands shaking uncontrollably as I sank into a chair in the waiting room. Tears blurred my vision, guilt gnawing at me like a relentless beast. If only I had checked on her sooner.

Beatrice had no visible injuries, but her pallor was alarming—her skin ghostly white, dark circles bruising the delicate skin beneath her eyes. The apartment had been littered with empty liquor bottles, but no sign of pills or drugs. I had no idea what was wrong, and that terrified me.

Relief washed over me when Dr. Langford appeared the moment we arrived. She pressed a quick kiss to Marcus’s cheek before following the EMTs into the emergency room, promising to personally oversee Beatrice’s care.

Time stretched endlessly in the sterile waiting room. Eventually, Marcus returned, his presence steadying in the chaos.

"You don’t have to stay," I murmured, wiping my damp cheeks. "I’m sure you have more important things to do."

He shrugged, leaning back in the uncomfortable plastic chair. "Right now, my job is to look after you. So that’s exactly what I’m doing." His tone left no room for argument.

I frowned. "Why would Sebastian assign you to babysit me?"

Marcus exhaled, rubbing the back of his neck. "Sebastian’s swamped. With Alpha Maximilian in the pack, there’s a lot to handle. He wanted to be here himself, but he sent me instead—to stay with you and report back."

My stomach twisted. Did Sebastian tell him about us? Marcus avoided my gaze, his attention fixed on the scuffed linoleum floor.

"I didn’t expect Sebastian to come," I admitted quietly.

"He wanted to." Marcus’s voice was firm. "But he trusts me to keep you safe."

I bit my lip, unsure how to respond. Things between Sebastian and me had been strained lately—distant, cold. He barely acknowledged me when we crossed paths. So why did he care now?

The silence between us thickened, heavy with unspoken questions.
###Chapter 246

Unless she had been here before.

Victoria's gaze lingered on the sleek black sedan parked near the curb, her brows knitting together in thought. She'd seen that car before—its vanity license plate reading "Felicity" had caught her attention weeks ago. At the time, she hadn't paid it much mind, but now, standing here, an unsettling familiarity settled over her.

Was that this woman's name?

The woman—presumably Felicity—let out a quiet sigh before turning, only to freeze when her eyes locked onto Victoria.

Victoria's breath hitched. The resemblance was uncanny. Felicity's features mirrored Lillian's almost perfectly—except for the striking emerald hue of her eyes, the slightly sharper cheekbones, and the softer curve of her jaw. It was a haunting similarity, one that sent an inexplicable chill down Victoria's spine.

Felicity's lips parted in shock, her tear-streaked face flushing crimson. She looked as though she wanted to speak, but before Victoria could utter a word, she stammered, "I—I'm sorry. I shouldn't be here."

Without another moment's hesitation, Felicity spun on her heel and rushed to her car, her movements frantic. The engine roared to life, and within seconds, she was gone—leaving Victoria standing there, heart pounding, questions swirling in her mind.

###Chapter 247

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting a golden glow over the room. Lillian stretched lazily, her muscles still sore from yesterday’s training session. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted up from the kitchen, making her stomach growl.

She padded downstairs, her bare feet silent against the polished wood. The mansion was unusually quiet, save for the distant clinking of dishes.

"Good morning, Miss Lillian," Giselle greeted with a warm smile as she set a tray of pastries on the dining table.

"Morning," Lillian murmured, rubbing her eyes. "Where is everyone?"

"Master Sebastian left early for a meeting with Alpha Maximilian," Giselle replied, pouring her a cup of coffee. "And young Master Oliver is still asleep."

Lillian nodded, taking a sip of the rich, dark brew. The bitterness jolted her awake, and she reached for a croissant.

Just then, her phone buzzed. A message from Beatrice lit up the screen:

"Emergency! Meet me at the café in 20. You won’t believe what I just found out."

Lillian frowned. Beatrice rarely used the word emergency unless it was serious. She quickly finished her breakfast and grabbed her jacket.

The campus café was bustling when she arrived. Beatrice sat in their usual corner booth, her expression tense.

"What’s going on?" Lillian slid into the seat across from her.

Beatrice leaned forward, lowering her voice. "I overheard Cassandra talking to Professor Sinclair. They’re planning something—something about Donovan and Evelyn."

Lillian’s grip tightened around her cup. "What kind of plan?"

"I don’t know all the details," Beatrice admitted, "but it sounded like they’re trying to sabotage Donovan’s engagement to Victoria. And… they mentioned your name."

A chill ran down Lillian’s spine. She had hoped to leave the past behind, but it seemed Donovan and his new mate weren’t done with her yet.

Before she could respond, the café door swung open. Donovan strode in, his arm draped possessively around Evelyn’s shoulders. Their eyes locked with Lillian’s, and a smirk curled Evelyn’s lips.

"Looks like trouble just walked in," Beatrice muttered.

Lillian forced herself to stay calm. Whatever they were planning, she wouldn’t let them catch her off guard. Not again.

But as Donovan’s gaze lingered on her, dark and calculating, she couldn’t shake the feeling that this was only the beginning.

Lillian's POV

My phone buzzed insistently, cutting through the rhythmic thuds of my sparring session with Oliver.

I dashed to the tree where my gym bag lay, fishing out the device with trembling fingers. The screen flashed with a name that sent my pulse skyrocketing—Dr. Langford from the hospital.

Heart hammering, I swiped to answer and pressed the phone to my ear.

"Hello?" I forced my voice steady despite the nerves coiling in my stomach.

"Lillian, it's Dr. Langford," came the crisp, professional tone. "I'm calling about Beatrice Whitaker."

My throat tightened. "Is she... okay?"

"Better than expected," she reassured me. "She's awake, responding well to antibiotics, and will be discharged tomorrow afternoon. Can you arrange to pick her up?"

"Absolutely," I blurted, relief flooding me. "I'll be there. Thank you."

"Of course. She's a fighter," Dr. Langford added warmly before ending the call.

I exhaled sharply, unaware I'd been holding my breath.

"Everything alright?"

The deep voice startled me. Whirling around, I found Sebastian Blackwood striding toward me, sunlight glinting off his tousled dark hair. His gaze locked onto mine, lips quirking in that faint, maddening smile that always made my stomach flip. But beneath the amusement, concern flickered in his storm-gray eyes.

Was it wishful thinking, or did he look... glad to see me?

We hadn't spoken properly in days—not since the tension between us thickened like summer humidity. Maybe I was imagining things.

"Y-yeah," I stammered, shoving my phone into my pocket. "Just Dr. Langford. About Beatrice."

"How is she?" He closed the distance between us, close enough that his cedar-and-rain scent enveloped me. "Marcus mentioned she had food poisoning."

Heat crept up my neck. Had he asked about her? Or was Marcus just keeping him updated? I swallowed hard.

"She's recovering. Surgery went well, and she's resting. They're releasing her tomorrow."

Sebastian nodded thoughtfully.

"Have her stay at the mansion," he suggested abruptly, catching me off guard. "She lives alone, doesn't she? It'd be safer with people around in case she needs help."

I hesitated. Beatrice despised Lucien Dubois—the mansion's flirtatious head chef—for driving her to drink in the first place. But airing that dirty laundry felt like a betrayal.

Pressing my lips together, I nodded. "I'll ask her."


Sebastian gave a subtle nod, his piercing gaze never wavering from mine.

After a weighted pause, he cleared his throat and shifted slightly, an uncharacteristic hint of boyish awkwardness flickering across his usually composed expression. It was unexpectedly endearing, and I had to press my lips together to suppress a smile.

“So, I’ve been thinking—” he began, but his words were abruptly cut off.

“Papa!”

We both turned to see Victoria striding toward us. My stomach twisted—of course she’d appear the moment Sebastian tried to speak to me alone. Lately, it felt like her sole mission was to ensure we never had a private conversation. And, frustratingly, she was succeeding.

My chest constricted when I took in her appearance. Normally, she’d approach with that infuriatingly smug smirk, but this time, her face was flushed, her eyes swollen and red-rimmed. Something was wrong. She didn’t look triumphant—she looked broken.

Her arms were wrapped tightly around herself, as if she were holding herself together by sheer will. A single tear escaped, sliding down her cheek before she hastily wiped it away with trembling fingers. Her gaze dropped to the ground, her breath hitching in a quiet, stifled sob.

This wasn’t just another interruption.

This was something far worse.

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting a golden glow across Lillian's dorm room. She stretched lazily, her muscles still sore from yesterday's combat training. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted in from the hallway, courtesy of Gabrielle, the ever-cheerful barista who worked at the campus café.

Lillian's phone buzzed on her nightstand. A message from Beatrice lit up the screen: "Meet me at the boutique in 20. Emergency shopping needed!" She groaned, rubbing her temples. Beatrice's "emergencies" usually involved last-minute parties or impromptu dates. Still, she couldn't say no to her best friend.

As she hurried through the bustling campus, Lillian caught a whiff of Donovan's cologne—woodsy and faintly bitter, like his personality. Her stomach twisted. Even after all this time, her wolf still reacted to him, a cruel reminder of their broken bond. She quickened her pace, nearly colliding with Oliver, Sebastian Blackwood's mischievous seven-year-old son, who was chasing a butterfly with unbridled enthusiasm.

"Watch where you're going, clumsy!" Oliver teased, his silver eyes sparkling with mischief.

Lillian forced a smile. "Sorry, kiddo. Where's your dad?"

Oliver pointed toward the administration building. "Meeting with Headmaster Wellington again. Someone might have put glue on his chair yesterday."

Lillian stifled a laugh. Oliver's pranks were legendary, much to Sebastian's exasperation.

The boutique was a whirlwind of silk and sequins when she arrived. Beatrice stood in front of a full-length mirror, holding up a crimson dress against her frame. "Lillian! Thank the Moon Goddess you're here. Isabella's fashion show is tonight, and I have nothing to wear."

Amélie, the boutique clerk, offered Lillian a sympathetic smile. "She's tried on everything in the store twice."

Lillian sighed. "Let's find you something before you bankrupt yourself."

As Beatrice disappeared into the dressing room again, Lillian's phone buzzed. An unknown number flashed on the screen: "Stay away from Donovan. He's mine now."

Her blood ran cold. Evelyn.

Before she could react, the boutique door swung open, and in walked Donovan, his arm draped possessively around Evelyn's waist. Their eyes locked, and for a heartbeat, the world stopped.

Then Evelyn smirked, tightening her grip on Donovan. "Oh, Lillian. Fancy seeing you here."

Beatrice emerged from the dressing room, took one look at the scene, and immediately stepped between them. "Wow, the trash really took itself out today."

Donovan's jaw tightened. "This doesn't concern you, Beatrice."

Lillian straightened, her wolf bristling beneath her skin. "Let's go, Bea. Some people aren't worth the air they breathe."

As they left, Evelyn's laughter followed them, sharp and mocking. But Lillian refused to look back.

Some bonds were meant to stay broken.
###Chapter 248

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains, painting delicate patterns across the silk sheets. Lillian stirred, her body still humming with the lingering warmth of Donovan’s embrace. She stretched, her muscles pleasantly sore, and turned to find the space beside her empty.

A note rested on the pillow, written in Donovan’s bold script:

"Had an early meeting. Didn’t want to wake you. Breakfast is ready downstairs."

A smile tugged at her lips as she traced the words with her fingertips. The scent of freshly brewed coffee and buttery croissants drifted up from the kitchen, making her stomach growl.

She slipped out of bed, wrapping herself in Donovan’s discarded shirt—its fabric still carrying his intoxicating scent. Padding barefoot to the window, she pushed the curtains aside and inhaled the crisp morning air. The estate sprawled before her, lush gardens and towering oaks bathed in sunlight.

Downstairs, the dining room was a picture of quiet elegance. A silver tray held an assortment of pastries, fruits, and a steaming pot of coffee. But what caught her eye was the single red rose placed beside her plate, its petals velvety and perfect.

Lillian’s heart fluttered.

She had just taken her first sip of coffee when the front door burst open, followed by the sound of hurried footsteps. Beatrice rushed in, her cheeks flushed, clutching a glossy magazine.

"Lillian! You have to see this!"

Before Lillian could respond, Beatrice thrust the magazine onto the table. The headline screamed in bold letters:

"Sebastian Blackwood’s Secret Affair: Scandal Rocks the Lycan Elite!"

Beneath it was a grainy photo—Donovan, his arm wrapped around a stunning brunette, their faces inches apart.

Lillian’s breath hitched.

The caption read: "Lycan Chairman Donovan Blackwood spotted with socialite Evelyn Laurent at exclusive gala—just days after reconciling with his mate."

Beatrice’s voice was tight with fury. "That snake! How could he do this to you?"

Lillian’s fingers trembled as she set down her coffee cup. The room spun.

She had trusted him. She had believed him.

And now?

Now, she wasn’t sure of anything.

Sebastian noticed how upset she was, his initial irritation melting into concern as he turned fully toward his daughter.

"What's wrong?" Sebastian asked, his piercing gaze narrowing.

She sniffled, her lower lip trembling.

"C-Can I talk to you...?" Her voice was thick with unshed tears. She flicked a glance at me before lifting her eyes to him. "Alone."

Sebastian stiffened, but he nodded without hesitation.

"Of course, sweetheart," he murmured, his tone softening.

He gestured toward the house, and she nodded, casting me one last uncertain look before turning away. The moment she disappeared inside, Sebastian’s attention snapped back to me, though I could already see his mind was elsewhere.

"Go," I urged, forcing a reassuring smile. "She needs you. I should head out anyway."

He exhaled, nodding.

"Alright," he said, though his voice was distant. "I'll see you later?"

I nodded, my smile brittle. He didn’t notice the strain in my expression or the ache in my chest as he hurried after her. Left standing there, I felt like a fool—an outsider in a moment that wasn’t mine to share.

Later, when I returned to the mansion, the sound of raised voices in the kitchen stopped me in my tracks. One voice was sharp and furious—undoubtedly Giselle’s—while the other was calm, almost chilling in its detachment. Lucien.

I crept closer, their words becoming clearer.

"You barely knew her!" Giselle hissed. "And now you're ready to throw us away for some nobody you just met?"

"Don’t call her that," Lucien replied, exhaustion lacing his tone. This argument had clearly been going on for a while. "There was never an 'us,' Giselle. It was just fun. I thought you understood that."

"Fun?" Her voice cracked. "I thought we were building something real, Lucien. I thought you cared about me."

"I do care about you," he sighed. "But I’m not in love with you. I’m sorry if you thought otherwise—"

"I know what we had," she cut in, her voice dripping with conviction. I envied that certainty, even as it made my stomach twist.

"Giselle—"

"I’m not giving up on us," she declared. "I love you. I always have. From the moment we met, I knew. So what if we’re not fated? We can choose each other. Isn’t that what life’s about? The Goddess gave us free will—I choose you, Lucien."

I nudged the door open just enough to see inside. She stood too close, her hand on his arm, her touch making him tense. She tilted her face up, batting her lashes, lips parted just so.

His jaw tightened.

"Nothing is happening between us again," he said firmly.

Her hands dropped to her sides, fingers curling into fists.

"We’ll see about that," she muttered.

Without waiting for a response, she spun on her heel and stormed out the back door. Lucien exhaled roughly, bracing himself against the counter like the weight of the world had settled on his shoulders.

I didn’t linger. Pushing the door open fully, I stepped inside, startling him.

"Sorry," I said, lifting my hands in surrender. "Just me."

His shoulders relaxed slightly when he saw me. Leaning back against the counter, he crossed his arms.

"Did you hear any of that?" he asked, his voice weary.

###Chapter 249

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains of Lillian's bedroom, casting golden patterns across the silk sheets. She stretched languidly, her werewolf senses immediately picking up the faint scent of lavender and bergamot that always lingered in Sebastian Blackwood's mansion.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. "Miss Lillian? Breakfast is ready," called Sophia Delacroix, the head maid.

"Thank you, Sophia. I'll be down shortly," Lillian replied, running fingers through her tousled hair. The events of last night still played vividly in her mind - Donovan's unexpected appearance at the gala, his new mate Evelyn clinging possessively to his arm, and that venomous glare he'd shot her when Sebastian had placed a protective hand on her waist.

Downstairs, the dining room buzzed with activity. Oliver, Sebastian's seven-year-old son, was enthusiastically describing his latest school project to Theodore Whitmore, the butler, while Marcus Grayson, Sebastian's beta, reviewed documents over coffee.

"Good morning," Lillian murmured as she took her seat beside Sebastian. His piercing blue eyes softened when they met hers, and he discreetly squeezed her hand under the table.

"Sleep well?" he asked, his deep voice sending pleasant shivers down her spine.

Before she could answer, Oliver piped up, "Papa, can Lillian come to my soccer game today? Please?"

Sebastian arched an eyebrow. "That depends on whether Miss Lillian has other plans."

Lillian smiled at the eager boy. "I'd love to, Oliver."

Their peaceful breakfast was interrupted when Victoria, Sebastian's daughter, stormed into the room. "Father, we need to talk," she demanded, her gaze flickering disdainfully toward Lillian.

Sebastian's expression hardened. "Not now, Victoria."

"But Donovan—"

"I said not now." The alpha's tone brooked no argument.

As Victoria huffed away, Beatrice Whitaker, Lillian's best friend, burst through the front door, her cheeks flushed. "You won't believe what just happened!" she exclaimed, ignoring the formal setting. "Cassandra just publicly challenged you to a duel at the university!"

Lillian's fork clattered against her plate. "What?"

Sebastian's grip on his coffee cup tightened. "Explain."

Beatrice gulped. "She claims Lillian used forbidden magic to manipulate you, Alpha Blackwood. The whole campus is talking about it."

A dangerous glint appeared in Sebastian's eyes. "Is that so?" He turned to Lillian. "We'll handle this together."

But Lillian shook her head, determination settling over her features. "No, this is my fight. I won't have anyone questioning my place by your side."

The tension in the room thickened as Sebastian studied her. Finally, he nodded. "Very well. But Marcus will accompany you."

As Lillian prepared to leave, Sebastian caught her wrist. "Remember," he murmured, his breath warm against her ear, "you're stronger than you think. And you're mine."

Her heart pounded as she stepped into the sunlight, unaware that Donovan watched from the shadows, his expression unreadable. The game was far from over.

I bit down on my lower lip and gave a hesitant nod. Lying to him wasn’t an option.

“Yes,” I confessed, my voice barely above a whisper. “Are you alright?”

Lucien’s piercing gaze held mine, searching for any hint of sincerity. After a tense moment, he exhaled sharply, his shoulders relaxing slightly.

“Yeah… she’s going to complicate things,” he muttered, running a hand through his dark hair. “She doesn’t take rejection well.”

“You did the right thing by being honest,” I reassured him. “Leading her on would only make it worse.”

He nodded, though his expression remained troubled.

“I never wanted to hurt anyone,” he admitted. “I’ve always been clear about where I stand. Honestly, I never expected to find my mate. I wasn’t even sure I wanted one.”

“And now?” I pressed, watching the conflict flicker in his eyes.

He hesitated, his gaze dropping to the floor before meeting mine again.

“I’m still figuring it out,” he admitted. “But the moment I saw her, I knew I had to see her again. I can’t just let her go without at least talking to her first. Giselle was right—I don’t know her. If I reject her without even trying… I’d regret it forever.”

I studied him, processing his words before nodding slowly.

“Alright,” I said. “So, what’s your plan?”

“Can you arrange for her to come here?” he asked. “Maybe tonight? I need to talk to her, and then we can decide together. She deserves that much. Rejection could break her—and her wolf—if we’re not on the same page.”

My chest tightened at the thought of Beatrice, my best friend, caught in this emotional storm.

“You’re right,” I agreed. “But it’ll have to wait until she’s recovered. She’s in the hospital until tomorrow.”

Lucien’s entire body stiffened, his face draining of color.

“W-what?” he choked out, his voice rough. “What are you talking about?”

“She’s in the hospital,” I repeated, crossing my arms. “She spent days drowning in alcohol, and one of the beers she drank was expired. She got alcohol poisoning. They had to perform surgery, and now she’s recovering.”

For a heartbeat, Lucien looked like he’d stopped breathing. His eyes darkened, his wolf surfacing in an instant.

Then, without warning, he turned on his heel and strode past me.

“Whoa, hold on!” I grabbed his arm, yanking him back. “She’s been through enough, Lucien.”

He whirled on me, his eyes blazing with raw intensity.

“What?” he growled, his voice laced with barely restrained fury.

The air between us crackled with tension.


"I told you, she's been through enough. Let her rest," I repeated firmly, my voice edged with finality. "I'll bring Beatrice here tomorrow, and then you can talk all you want. But for tonight, just drop it."

Sebastian's piercing gaze held mine for what felt like an eternity, his jaw clenched tight. I braced myself for an argument, half-expecting him to storm out in that infuriatingly stubborn way of his. But then—surprise of surprises—he relented. A heavy sigh escaped him as his shoulders slumped, his hands dropping to his sides.

I gave his back a reassuring pat, feeling the tension coiled beneath his skin. "Get some sleep," I told him, my tone softening. "Because tomorrow, we're picking Beatrice up from the hospital. And you, my friend, are driving."

###Chapter 250

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, painting the room in warm hues. Lillian stretched lazily in the plush king-sized bed, the silk sheets cool against her skin. The scent of freshly brewed coffee and buttery croissants drifted in from the kitchen, making her stomach growl.

She had barely opened her eyes when a deep, velvety voice murmured beside her, "Good morning, little wolf."

Sebastian was already awake, his piercing blue eyes watching her with an intensity that sent a shiver down her spine. His dark hair was tousled from sleep, and the faint stubble along his jaw only made him look more dangerously attractive.

Lillian propped herself up on her elbows, blinking away the remnants of sleep. "Morning," she murmured, her voice still thick with drowsiness.

A smirk tugged at Sebastian’s lips as he reached out, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear. "Sleep well?"

She nodded, though the truth was, she had barely slept at all. The events of last night replayed in her mind—Donovan’s unexpected appearance at the gala, the way his new mate, Evelyn, had clung to his arm like a trophy. The way Donovan’s gaze had lingered on Lillian, full of regret and something darker.

Sebastian’s fingers brushed against her cheek, pulling her back to the present. "Don’t think about him," he said, his voice firm but gentle.

Lillian exhaled sharply. "It’s hard not to."

Sebastian’s expression darkened, a flicker of possessiveness flashing in his eyes. "He lost his chance. You’re mine now."

The declaration sent a thrill through her, but before she could respond, a loud knock echoed through the penthouse.

"Alpha Blackwood!" Marcus Grayson’s voice carried through the door, urgent.

Sebastian sighed, pressing a quick kiss to Lillian’s forehead before rolling out of bed. "Duty calls."

Lillian watched as he pulled on a black robe, his muscular frame moving with effortless grace. She couldn’t help but admire the way the fabric clung to his broad shoulders.

The moment the door opened, Marcus stepped inside, his expression grim. "We have a problem."

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "What is it?"

"Alpha Harrison is making moves again," Marcus said, his voice low. "He’s been seen meeting with Donovan. They’re planning something."

Lillian’s blood ran cold. Donovan and Alpha Harrison working together? That couldn’t be good.

Sebastian’s eyes flickered to her, his expression unreadable. "Stay here," he ordered before turning back to Marcus. "Call a meeting. I want every Beta and Gamma in the war room in ten minutes."

As the door closed behind them, Lillian sat frozen in bed, her mind racing. If Donovan was aligning with Alpha Harrison, it meant he wasn’t just after her—he was after Sebastian’s pack.

And she wasn’t about to let that happen.

Throwing off the covers, she reached for her phone and dialed Beatrice’s number.

"Bea, we have a situation."

Her best friend’s voice was groggy but alert. "What’s wrong?"

Lillian took a deep breath. "Donovan’s making his move. And I need your help to stop him."

The line was silent for a beat before Beatrice sighed. "I’ll be there in twenty."

Hanging up, Lillian clenched her fists. She had fought too hard to let Donovan ruin everything now.

This time, she wouldn’t run.

This time, she would fight.

Third Person POV

Beatrice felt utterly humiliated by her alcohol poisoning incident.

For days, she had barricaded herself inside her tiny apartment, drowning in liquor, shutting out the world. She had ignored her best friend, Lillian, completely—something that weighed heavily on her conscience. But what twisted her stomach into knots even more was the realization that it had been Lillian who found her in that state, barely conscious, and rushed her to the hospital. Fingers nervously picking at the hospital blanket, Beatrice swallowed hard.

Her head throbbed. Her stomach ached. And her heart? Shattered.

"Good morning, Beatrice," greeted one of the nurses as she stepped into the room. "How are you feeling today?" Beatrice recognized her as the nurse who had tended to her the night before. Dark circles shadowed the woman’s eyes, exhaustion evident after her long shift.

"Like I just had my stomach scraped clean," Beatrice muttered, pressing a hand to her abdomen and wincing at the lingering soreness.

"Your wolf will heal you soon enough," the nurse reassured her. "Though, I must say, you drank enough to intoxicate even your wolf. That’s... quite the accomplishment."

Beatrice shuddered at the memory of just how much she had consumed.

Guilt gnawed at her for putting her wolf through that, but she had needed something to dull the pain—even if just for a little while. Her wolf was just as devastated as she was. Their mate, Lucien Dubois, was nothing but a shameless flirt. First, he had taken Amélie Rousseau out on a date, and now he was caught making out with someone in the kitchen of Sebastian Blackwood’s mansion.

And the worst part? He knew Lillian. Because he worked in the very mansion where Lillian had been staying.

Why hadn’t Lillian told her about him?

Then again, why would she? Lillian had no idea Lucien was Beatrice’s mate.

The nurse held out a small slip of paper. "I wanted to give you this."

Scrawled on it was a name: Dr. Alistair Whitmore, followed by a phone number.

Beatrice frowned. "Who is this?"

"Dr. Whitmore is a psychiatrist—one of the best," the nurse explained, catching Beatrice off guard.

"I don’t need a psychiatrist," Beatrice insisted, trying to hand the note back. But the nurse shook her head firmly, refusing to take it.

"Something drove you to drink so much that you nearly killed your wolf in the process," the nurse said, her expression darkening. "When you came in last night, your wolf was so weak, I wasn’t sure she’d pull through. You need to talk to someone about whatever’s eating at you. You were found alone, Beatrice. If this happens again, it will kill you—and your wolf."

Beatrice wanted to argue that it wasn’t the alcohol that had nearly killed her wolf. It was the crushing heartbreak over their mate. The rejection—unspoken but painfully clear—had weakened them both. But admitting that out loud? Too humiliating.

Forcing a thin smile, Beatrice nodded, though she knew it didn’t reach her eyes. The nurse’s concern only deepened.


"Thank you," Beatrice murmured, placing the phone number on the bedside table.

The nurse offered her a warm, reassuring smile. "You're being discharged today. I already called your friend, Lillian. She's on her way to pick you up."

Beatrice's gaze snapped up. "You called Lillian?" Her stomach twisted. Facing her best friend right now was the last thing she wanted—yet the only person she could face. If she had to choose someone, it would always be Lillian.

The nurse nodded. "She insisted on being the first call when you were ready. And honestly? Sebastian Blackwood backed her up. Try saying no to him."

Sebastian knew too?

Could this day get any worse?

Without another word, the nurse slipped out, leaving Beatrice alone with her spiraling thoughts. She stared at the ceiling, dizziness and exhaustion pressing down on her. Inside, her wolf stirred restlessly—still raw, still aching for their lost mate.

Despite the agony, her wolf worked tirelessly to heal the wound. Within the hour, the searing pain in her abdomen dulled to nothing. Relief washed over her as she finally felt strong enough to move. She pushed herself upright—only to sway dangerously, catching herself on the bedside table.

All she wanted was to wash up. She felt filthy, desperate for some semblance of normalcy.

Then she spotted it: a small duffel bag tucked by the chair. Inside, fresh clothes, undergarments, toiletries—even her favorite toothpaste. Lillian. Of course. A faint smile tugged at her lips. Even unconscious, her best friend had taken care of her.

I don’t deserve her.

###Chapter 251

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the campus grounds, her boots crunching over the scattered foliage. The morning sun cast a golden glow over the stone buildings, but her mind was far from serene.

Donovan’s betrayal still gnawed at her, a wound that refused to heal. She had once believed him to be her fated mate, but now, the mere thought of him made her stomach twist.

"Lillian!" Beatrice’s voice cut through her thoughts as her best friend jogged toward her, cheeks flushed from the cold. "You look like you’ve seen a ghost. What’s wrong?"

Lillian forced a smile. "Just thinking about how much has changed."

Beatrice looped an arm through hers. "Well, stop dwelling on the past. You’ve got a future now—one that includes a certain Lycan chairman who can’t take his eyes off you."

Lillian’s cheeks warmed at the mention of Sebastian Blackwood. The man was an enigma—powerful, commanding, yet unexpectedly tender when it came to her. But their relationship was complicated, tangled in pack politics and the shadow of his late wife.

As they walked, Lillian spotted Cassandra leaning against a lamppost, whispering to a group of girls. The moment Cassandra noticed her, a smirk curled her lips.

"Look who’s finally showing her face," Cassandra drawled. "I heard Donovan and Evelyn are expecting a pup. Must sting, knowing he replaced you so easily."

Lillian’s fingers curled into fists, but before she could respond, Beatrice stepped forward. "Jealousy doesn’t suit you, Cassandra. Then again, neither does that cheap perfume."

Cassandra’s smirk faltered, but she recovered quickly. "Enjoy your little fantasy while it lasts. Sebastian Blackwood won’t settle for a nobody like you."

Lillian exhaled sharply. She wouldn’t let Cassandra get under her skin. Not today.

But as she turned away, her phone buzzed. A message from Sebastian lit up the screen:

"Meet me at the pack house. We need to talk."

Her pulse quickened. Those words never meant anything good.

The Blackwood estate loomed before her, its grandeur both breathtaking and intimidating. The moment she stepped inside, the scent of cedar and leather enveloped her—Sebastian’s scent.

He stood by the fireplace, his broad shoulders tense. When he turned, his golden eyes burned with an intensity that made her breath catch.

"You’re here," he said, voice low.

Lillian swallowed. "What’s going on?"

Sebastian hesitated, then spoke the words that shattered her fragile peace:

"Donovan’s back. And he’s demanding a challenge for your hand."

The room spun.

Lillian’s knees threatened to buckle. After everything, Donovan still thought he had a claim on her?

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "I won’t let him take you. But you need to decide—do you want to fight him yourself, or do you trust me to handle this?"

Her heart pounded. This wasn’t just about Donovan. It was about her future. Her choice.

And she refused to be a pawn in their game.

Lifting her chin, she met Sebastian’s gaze.

"I’ll face him. But not for you—for me."

Sebastian’s lips curved into a slow, approving smile. "Then let’s make sure you win."

The battle lines were drawn. And this time, Lillian wouldn’t run.

Beatrice grabbed the bag and slipped into the bathroom. Just as she’d hoped, she found her toothbrush and toothpaste inside. She scrubbed her teeth quickly, then finished freshening up. Splashing cold water on her face, she sighed in relief—Lillian had remembered her favorite cleanser too.

After changing into jeans and a fitted T-shirt, she tossed the hospital gown into the laundry basket tucked in the corner. As she stepped out, muffled voices reached her ears. Lillian must have arrived and was probably chatting with one of the nurses.

Her stomach twisted with nerves. The embarrassment of facing Lillian after everything was almost unbearable. But she couldn’t hide forever. Delaying would only make it worse.

Taking a deep breath, she gripped the door handle and pushed it open. The moment she stepped into the room, her wolf perked up, senses sharpening. A rich, intoxicating scent flooded her nose—warm spices and something woodsy—so potent it nearly buckled her knees.

Lillian turned, her face lighting up with a relieved smile. "There you are, Bea. I was starting to think you'd climbed out the window." She opened her arms, and Beatrice didn’t hesitate, pulling her into a tight embrace. Lillian was a few inches shorter, so Beatrice rested her chin on top of her best friend’s head.

"I’m sorry I scared you," Beatrice murmured.

Lillian pulled back, studying her with sharp eyes. "You look better. Did your wolf patch you up?"

Beatrice nodded, pressing a hand to her stomach. "Good as new. Ready to get out of this place."

Lillian smirked, then turned toward the doorway, arms crossed. "Are you just going to stand there like a statue?"

Beatrice followed her gaze—and her heart stopped.

There, leaning against the doorframe, was him.

Pale blue eyes locked onto hers, intense and searching. His dark hair was slightly tousled, as if he’d been running his hands through it. The way he looked at her—like she was the only thing in the room—sent heat rushing through her veins.

"Oh, for Goddess’ sake," Lillian groaned, stomping over and yanking him forward. "Stop being weird, Lucien."

Lucien.

That was his name.

Beatrice barely registered Lillian explaining that Lucien was the head chef at the Blackwood estate. Which meant her mate—her fated mate—worked for Sebastian Blackwood.

The irony wasn’t lost on her. She’d spent years dreaming of becoming a chef herself, studying culinary arts in secret between pack duties. And now the Goddess had dangled the one man who embodied that dream right in front of her—only to make him completely off-limits.

Cruel.

"I didn’t mean to ambush you," Lillian said, watching Beatrice carefully. "But you two really need to talk."

There was no way Lillian didn’t know. The way she kept glancing between them—knowing, expectant.

Beatrice’s cheeks burned. Did Lucien know why she’d been hospitalized? That she’d nearly drunk herself into oblivion? Humiliation coiled in her gut, and she wished the floor would swallow her whole.

Lucien cleared his throat, stepping closer. "I can give you a ride home," he offered, voice low. "Unless you’d rather—"

"I’ll find another way," Beatrice cut in, too quickly.

Lillian groaned. "Oh, come on—"

But Beatrice was already grabbing her bag, avoiding Lucien’s gaze. She couldn’t do this. Not now. Maybe not ever.

The Goddess had a sick sense of humor.

"Absolutely not!" Beatrice's voice came out sharper than intended, her fingers tightening around the strap of her bag. "Please, don't leave me alone with him..."

She caught the flicker of pain in Lucien's dark eyes, but she forced herself to look away, turning instead to Lillian. Her best friend blinked in surprise but quickly nodded, offering a reassuring squeeze to Beatrice's trembling hand.

"How about you take the front?" Lillian suggested, her voice steady. "That way, I can keep an eye on you."

Beatrice wanted to argue—to insist she could handle walking back to her apartment alone. But the truth settled heavily in her chest. She didn't want to be alone. Not now. Not after everything.

"Fine," she relented, exhaling sharply.

The silence between them stretched until Lucien finally spoke, his voice smooth as velvet, sending an unwelcome warmth through her. But then the memory of him with those women—laughing, touching—flashed behind her eyelids, and the warmth turned to ice.

"I think we've said all there is to say," Beatrice muttered, grabbing her coat and deliberately avoiding his gaze. "Unless you're planning to reject me now? In that case, by all means, get it over with."

She hesitated, then lifted her chin, meeting his eyes. Her pulse hammered in her throat as she forced out the question burning inside her.

"Lucien?" Her voice barely wavered. "Do you plan to reject me?"

###Chapter 252

The morning sun filtered through the heavy velvet curtains of Sebastian Blackwood's private study, casting golden streaks across the antique mahogany desk where Lillian sat fidgeting with her pen. The scent of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the faint aroma of leather-bound books that lined the walls.

"Stop chewing your lip, darling," Sebastian murmured without looking up from his documents. His silver cufflinks caught the light as he turned a page. "You'll draw blood."

Lillian startled, unaware he'd been observing her. Across the room, Oliver played quietly with his toy soldiers near the fireplace, his small brow furrowed in concentration. The crackling flames painted dancing shadows across his serious expression - so like his father's.

"I wasn't—" Lillian began, then sighed when Sebastian arched one perfect eyebrow. His storm-gray eyes held that particular intensity that made her pulse quicken, even now.

The study door burst open before she could continue. Beatrice rushed in, her chestnut curls bouncing wildly. "You'll never guess who just arrived!" Her amber eyes sparkled with barely contained excitement.

Sebastian set down his fountain pen with deliberate calm. "Do enlighten us, Miss Whitaker."

"Victoria! And she's brought—"

The rest of Beatrice's announcement was drowned out by the sharp click of heels on marble. A statuesque blonde swept into the room, her designer dress hugging every curve. Victoria Blackwood hadn't aged a day since Lillian last saw her - still every inch the ice princess.

"Father." Victoria's greeting was cool as she air-kissed Sebastian's cheeks. Then her glacial blue eyes landed on Lillian. "And the little werewolf bride. How... quaint."

Oliver scrambled to his feet, his toy soldiers forgotten. "Aunt Tory!"

Victoria's expression softened marginally as she patted his head. "You've grown, imp."

Lillian's fingers tightened around her pen. The tension in the room thickened like fog. She could practically taste Victoria's disapproval in the air - bitter as burnt coffee.

Sebastian rose smoothly, his towering frame commanding the space. "To what do we owe this unexpected visit, daughter?"

Victoria's crimson lips curved. "I've brought someone special." She turned toward the doorway. "Donovan, darling, stop lurking."

The air left Lillian's lungs in a rush as Donovan Winslow stepped into view. His golden hair was shorter now, his jaw more angular, but those emerald eyes still held the same predatory glint that once made her heart race. His arm was draped possessively around Evelyn's waist.

"Well, well," Donovan drawled, his gaze raking over Lillian. "If it isn't my former mate. Still playing house with the Lycan King, I see."

Oliver moved instinctively closer to Lillian, his small hand finding hers. She squeezed it gently, drawing strength from the contact.

Sebastian's voice dropped to that dangerous purr Lillian knew too well. "Mind your tongue, Winslow. You're a guest in my home."

Donovan smirked. "Of course, Your Majesty." The title dripped with mockery.

Evelyn's giggle grated against Lillian's nerves. "Don't be mean, Donny. We're all family here." Her saccharine smile didn't reach her cold eyes.

Beatrice made a strangled noise beside Lillian. "Since when?"

Victoria's manicured fingers adjusted the diamond pendant at her throat. "Since Donovan and I have decided to reconcile. For the sake of the alliance between our packs, of course."

The grandfather clock in the corner ticked loudly in the sudden silence. Lillian's pulse roared in her ears. This couldn't be happening. Not after everything.

Sebastian's expression remained unreadable, but Lillian saw the muscle jump in his jaw. "Interesting timing," he remarked mildly. "Considering your engagement was dissolved after certain... indiscretions came to light."

Donovan's smile turned wolfish. "Water under the bridge, Blackwood. Victoria understands the realities of our world." His gaze slid to Lillian. "Unlike some."

Lillian's wolf stirred beneath her skin, itching to put this arrogant bastard in his place. But before she could respond, Oliver tugged her hand.

"Lily," he whispered urgently. "Your eyes are glowing."

She took a steadying breath, forcing her wolf to settle. Sebastian moved subtly closer, his presence a silent shield.

Victoria clapped her hands together. "Enough posturing. We're here for the full moon gala tomorrow night. Donovan will be my escort, naturally."

Beatrice snorted. "Naturally."

Evelyn pouted. "I wanted to see the famous Blackwood ballroom. Donovan promised me a dance."

Donovan smirked. "Plenty of time for that, sweetheart."

Lillian's stomach churned. The thought of Donovan prowling through Sebastian's home, touching his things, breathing his air—it made her claws extend involuntarily.

Sebastian's hand found the small of her back, warm and grounding. "Theodore," he called without raising his voice.

The butler materialized in the doorway as if summoned by magic. "Yes, Alpha?"

"Show our... guests to their rooms. The east wing suites should suffice."

Victoria's smile turned brittle. "Not the family wing?"

Sebastian's answering smile was all teeth. "You stopped being family when you betrayed my trust, Victoria. Be grateful you're under my roof at all."

The temperature in the room seemed to drop several degrees. Even Donovan looked momentarily chastened.

As Theodore ushered the unwelcome visitors out, Beatrice let out a low whistle. "Well. That was..."

"Expected," Sebastian finished grimly. He turned to Lillian, his expression softening. "Are you alright?"

Lillian exhaled shakily. "I will be." She glanced down at Oliver, who was watching them with wide, worried eyes. "We all will be."

Sebastian cupped her cheek, his thumb brushing just beneath her glowing golden eyes. "Remember whose mate you are, little wolf. No one touches what's mine."

The promise in his words sent a shiver down her spine. Tomorrow's gala would be a battlefield, and Donovan had just declared war.

But Sebastian Blackwood didn't lose battles. And neither did his Luna.

Lillian's POV


The tension in the car was suffocating.

Lucien didn’t answer Beatrice’s question—he was too stunned to speak. He hadn’t expected her to ask something so direct, nor was he ready to make that kind of decision. Despite her efforts to mask the hurt in her voice and eyes, it was still painfully obvious. I could see it. And I knew Lucien could too.

The ride back was silent. Beatrice refused to sit in the front, so I took the passenger seat while Lucien drove. His eyes kept flickering to the rearview mirror, stealing glances at her. She stubbornly avoided his gaze, staring out the window, but I could tell she felt the weight of his attention the entire way.

When we finally pulled up to the mansion, Lucien parked in his usual spot but hesitated before turning off the engine.

Beatrice didn’t wait.

The second the car stopped, she flung the door open and bolted toward the entrance. I lingered, watching Lucien, silently willing him to go after her. But he didn’t. He just sat there, his fingers tightening around the steering wheel as he watched her disappear inside.

"She hates me," he murmured, his voice rough.

"She doesn’t hate you," I said firmly. "She can’t hate you. You’re her mate. She just needs time."

"How much time?" He finally turned to me, his golden eyes shadowed. "She won’t even look at me, Lillian."

I smirked, trying to ease the tension. "I’ve never seen you this wrecked over a woman before."

And it was true. Lucien had always been the charming playboy—flirting with a different girl every weekend, much to Giselle’s frustration. When he wasn’t out partying, he was either in the kitchen experimenting with new recipes or hiding in Giselle’s room, avoiding responsibilities.

I’d always assumed that if Lucien ever got serious about someone, it would be Giselle.

Hell, I’m sure she thought so too.

None of us saw this coming. None of us expected him to find his mate—and certainly not my best friend.

"So," I finally asked, "what are you going to do?"

Lucien exhaled sharply, running a hand through his dark hair.

"I don’t know," he admitted after a long pause.

"Are you going to reject her?"

A deep growl rumbled in his chest before he could stop it, his wolf flashing dangerously in his eyes. That reaction alone told me everything—his wolf wanted her. It was the man who was hesitating.

"I don’t know," he repeated, frustration lacing his words. "I never thought I’d have a mate. I never thought I’d have to make this kind of choice."

I sighed and pushed open the car door. "Well, you’d better figure it out fast before you lose her for good."

I turned back to him one last time.

"You already broke her heart. Either tear the bandage off completely or start putting her back together. I hate seeing her like this."

Seeing Beatrice like this shattered my heart. "Lucien," I whispered under my breath, "I hate that it's you who's making her feel this way."

Without another word, I stepped out of the car and rushed toward the mansion. The grand foyer stretched before me, empty and silent. My eyes darted around, searching for any sign of Beatrice.

"She went upstairs," one of the maids murmured, answering my unspoken question before I could even ask.

I gave her a quick, grateful nod and sprinted up the staircase, my pulse racing. Pushing open the door to my room, I found Beatrice curled up on my bed, clutching a pillow to her chest. Silent tears streaked down her flushed cheeks.

"How long have you known?" she asked hoarsely, not even lifting her gaze to meet mine.

I stepped inside and shut the door behind me, my stomach knotting. "Known what?" I hedged, though I already knew exactly what she meant.

Her watery eyes flicked up to mine, sharp despite the pain. "That Lucien is my mate. You knew."

I exhaled and nodded, unable to lie to her. "After you left the other day," I admitted, biting my lip. "I put it together from the way Lucien was acting."

She let out a shuddering breath and turned her face away, fresh tears spilling over. "I always dreamed of finding my mate," she whispered, voice breaking. "But I never imagined he'd be... him."

I sank onto the bed beside her, reaching out to brush a strand of hair from her damp face. "Lucien isn't as bad as he seems," I offered carefully. "Yes, he's got a reputation, but deep down, he's kind. Loyal."

Beatrice let out a bitter laugh. "He went on a date with Amélie—the girl from my favorite boutique. That’s how I first met him."

My breath caught. I remembered Beatrice mentioning meeting her mate once, but she’d been too drunk to give details. And she had gone into the city that night to buy a dress for the frat party...

Realization hit me like a punch.

That was why she drank so much that night.

"He saw me," she continued, her voice trembling. "I know he recognized me as his mate, just like I recognized him. But he still walked away with her. He chose her over me."

"It wasn’t like that," I said quickly, squeezing her hand. "He was probably just shocked. And he’d already made plans with her—he wouldn’t just abandon her without a word."

Beatrice shook her head, fresh tears falling. "Then why does it still hurt so much?"

I had no answer for that.

###Chapter 253

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian strolled through the Blackwood estate gardens. Her fingers brushed against the petals of late-blooming roses, their crimson hue stark against the golden foliage.

She had barely taken three steps when Donovan’s voice cut through the tranquility.

"Lillian."

Her spine stiffened. She turned slowly, meeting his cold gaze. Beside him stood Evelyn, her arm looped possessively through his. The sight sent a sharp pang through Lillian’s chest, though she refused to let it show.

"Donovan," she acknowledged coolly. "Evelyn."

Evelyn’s lips curled into a smirk. "Enjoying your little stroll? Must be nice, having nothing better to do."

Lillian arched a brow. "Better than clinging to someone else’s leftovers."

Evelyn’s smirk faltered, but Donovan stepped forward, his expression darkening. "Watch your tongue, Lillian. You’re in no position to insult anyone."

Before she could retort, a deep voice interrupted.

"Actually, she’s in my position."

Sebastian Blackwood emerged from the shadows of the garden path, his presence commanding the space effortlessly. His golden eyes flicked between Donovan and Evelyn with icy disdain before settling on Lillian.

"Ready for our meeting?" he asked, tone smooth but edged with unspoken authority.

Lillian exhaled, grateful for the interruption. "Yes."

Sebastian extended his arm, and she took it without hesitation, ignoring the way Donovan’s jaw clenched. As they walked away, she could feel Evelyn’s glare burning into her back.

"You handled that well," Sebastian murmured.

Lillian smirked. "I’ve had practice."

Sebastian’s lips twitched. "Good. Because we have bigger problems."

She frowned. "What now?"

He glanced at her sidelong. "Victoria’s engagement party is tomorrow. And Donovan’s family is bringing reinforcements."

Lillian’s stomach dropped. "Reinforcements?"

Sebastian’s grip on her arm tightened slightly. "The Winslows don’t just want a wedding. They want a war."

The words hung between them, heavy with implication.

Lillian squared her shoulders. "Then we’ll give them one."

Sebastian’s smile was razor-sharp. "That’s what I like to hear."

As they disappeared into the manor, the wind carried the distant howl of a wolf—ominous, foreboding.

The game had just begun.

"So, he just abandoned me? His fated mate?" Beatrice's eyes widened as she stared at me, her voice trembling. "How does that even make sense, Lillian?"

I hesitated, struggling to find the right words.

"I don't know," I admitted, exhaling slowly. "Everything's so overwhelming right now. I'm sorry you're going through this."

She let out a frustrated sigh and tossed a decorative pillow across the room.

"I don't even want to think about it anymore," she muttered, wiping at her damp lashes. "Let's talk about you instead."

A small smile tugged at my lips.

"What about me?" I asked, feigning innocence.

She rolled her eyes dramatically.

"Oh, please. Don't play dumb, Lillian. You're living in his mansion. You've already admitted you two are sleeping together, but I know there's more to it. You have real feelings for him, and it's painfully obvious he feels the same."

My cheeks burned. "What are you talking about? It's just casual. We both agreed—it's nothing serious."

"Casual? Seriously?" She gestured around the lavish penthouse suite. "He moved you into his private estate. You're basically living like royalty."

I couldn't help but laugh.

"I'm not royalty," I said, swatting her arm playfully. "And Sebastian hasn't even been here in days."

The bitterness in my tone was unmistakable, and my smile faded.

Beatrice frowned. "What do you mean? Is something wrong?"

I shrugged, chewing on my lower lip.

"I don't know," I confessed. "One minute, he can't keep his hands off me, and the next, he's avoiding me completely. He keeps canceling our plans whenever Victoria throws a tantrum."

"Victoria is causing trouble again?" Beatrice arched a brow.

I nodded, then sighed.

"She's his daughter, so I can't blame him for prioritizing her. But it's constant. Every time she's in a bad mood or has the slightest sniffle, he drops everything for her. I haven't seen him properly in days. When I do catch a glimpse of him while tutoring Oliver, he brushes me off—claims he's too busy to talk. I don't even think he's sleeping at the villa anymore. Which makes me wonder... where is he staying if not here... and not with me?"

The words spilled out before I could stop them. I was spiraling, but I couldn't help it. The confusion gnawed at me.

Beatrice gave me a sympathetic look. "He's Sebastian Blackwood. He's probably just swamped with work. Don't overthink it."

"I could say the same to you," I teased weakly. "You're heartbroken over your mate, and I'm stressing over a guy I'm sleeping with. What happened to us?"

"Is this what adulthood feels like?" Beatrice murmured, wrinkling her nose in distaste. "Because I'm not enjoying it. Too many messy emotions."

I chuckled and pulled her closer, letting her rest her head against my shoulder. The evening air was crisp, carrying the faint scent of pine from the surrounding woods.

"Honestly? I'm not a fan either," I admitted, tracing idle patterns on my knee with my fingertip. "But I don't think what I'm doing counts as 'grown-up.' More like my own stubborn mistake—thinking I could compartmentalize my feelings."

Beatrice exhaled heavily, her breath warm against my arm.

"Sometimes I wish I could separate myself from my wolf," she confessed quietly. "It's her emotions that keep twisting me up inside."

I understood all too well. When Donovan had left me for Evelyn, I'd wanted to burn every bridge between us. But my wolf? She'd anchored me, whispering promises that our mate would return. She clung to hope, while I drowned in bitterness.

Our wolves only know one truth: Mates belong to us, and only us. They would never choose another.

Focusing on Beatrice and Lucien had been a welcome distraction from my own tangled heart.

"I should tell you something," I said suddenly, breaking the comfortable silence between us.

She lifted her head, curiosity bright in her hazel eyes.

"You can tell me anything," she assured me, offering a small but genuine smile. It was good to see that smile again after everything she'd endured these past few days.

"I was nominated for the Gamma Trials."

Her eyes widened, lips parting in shock.

"Lillian. That’s amazing!" she gasped, squeezing my arm. "Congratulations! This is everything you’ve worked for!"

"Thanks," I said softly. It was the first time I'd spoken the words aloud to anyone. I'd wanted Sebastian to be the first to know—but he'd been conspicuously absent for days. "It's on the other side of the country, though. I’ll be gone for weeks."

Her smile faltered.

"Oh," she breathed. "So... you're leaving?"

I nodded, worrying my lower lip between my teeth.

"Next week," I confirmed.

Her shoulders slumped slightly, but she forced another smile.

"I’ll miss you," she murmured. "I don’t know what I’ll do without you here. But maybe... maybe some time away will be good for you."

That’s when the idea struck me.

"You’re right," I agreed, turning to face her fully. "And you know what? It’d be good for you too. Come with me."

###Chapter 254

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian strolled through the Blackwood estate gardens, her fingers brushing against the dew-kissed petals of late-blooming roses. The morning sun cast a golden glow over the sprawling grounds, painting everything in warm hues.

She had barely slept last night, her mind restless with thoughts of Donovan and his sudden reappearance. The way he had looked at her—like she was still his—sent a shiver down her spine. But she wasn’t his anymore. She belonged to Sebastian now, and she wouldn’t let Donovan’s lingering presence shake her resolve.

A rustling sound made her turn. Oliver, Sebastian’s seven-year-old son, peeked out from behind a towering oak, his mischievous grin unmistakable.

"Are you hiding from your tutor again?" Lillian arched a brow, fighting a smile.

Oliver giggled, darting forward to clutch her hand. "He’s boring! He keeps talking about numbers and letters. I want to train with the warriors!"

Lillian ruffled his hair. "You will, one day. But first, you have to learn how to read battle strategies."

Oliver pouted but didn’t argue further. His attention shifted suddenly, his small body tensing. "Someone’s coming."

Lillian followed his gaze. Victoria, Sebastian’s daughter, strode toward them, her expression unreadable. The engagement ring on her finger glinted in the sunlight—a cruel reminder of the past.

"Lillian," Victoria greeted coolly. "Father wants to see you."

Lillian’s pulse quickened. "Did he say why?"

Victoria’s lips curled slightly. "No. But I’d hurry if I were you. He doesn’t like to be kept waiting."

Without another word, she turned and walked away, her heels clicking against the stone path.

Oliver tugged at Lillian’s sleeve. "Don’t go. She’s mean."

Lillian squeezed his hand reassuringly. "It’s okay. I’ll be fine."

But as she made her way to Sebastian’s study, unease coiled in her stomach. Something was off. The air felt heavier, charged with tension.

When she reached the door, she hesitated before knocking.

"Come in," Sebastian’s deep voice called.

She stepped inside, only to freeze.

Because standing beside Sebastian, his cold eyes locked onto her, was Donovan.

And the smirk on his face told her this wasn’t a coincidence.

He had planned this.

Sebastian’s expression was unreadable as he spoke.

"Lillian," he said smoothly. "We have a problem."

Her heart dropped.

What now?

Lillian's POV

“You want me to go with you?” Beatrice asked, her eyes widening in surprise.

I nodded eagerly.

“Yes,” I told her, unable to hide my excitement. “It’ll only be for a few weeks. And honestly, I think we both need this break.”

She hesitated, biting her lip. “Are you sure? I don’t want to intrude.”

“You could never intrude, Bea,” I assured her, squeezing her hand. “Besides, I don’t want to go alone.”

A slow grin spread across her face.

“Well… I do have a ridiculous amount of unused vacation days,” she mused.

“And it’s during the school break, so you won’t miss anything,” I added, nudging her playfully. “Come on, Bea. Say yes.”

She laughed, then nodded. “Okay, yes!”

The rest of the night was spent catching up on everything we’d missed over the past few days. Having my best friend back felt like a missing piece slotting into place. The more we talked—and the more we planned for our tropical getaway—the more our excitement grew.

I pulled up the email detailing the competition venue—a luxurious resort in an exotic location, fully sponsored by the event organizers. The only thing Beatrice needed to arrange was her flight and, of course, a new swimsuit.

Luckily, the seat beside mine was still available, and she managed to book it without any issues before the night was over.

Lucien hadn’t bothered us for the rest of the evening, and I couldn’t shake the worry gnawing at me. At one point, while Beatrice dozed off, I slipped out to check on him. But he wasn’t in the kitchen, and one of the night guards mentioned seeing him leave shortly after we returned.

I figured he needed space, so I let him be.

Beatrice left early the next morning to freshen up before her late classes. When I finally dragged myself downstairs, I walked straight into a heated argument between Lucien and Giselle.

“How could you choose her over me?” Giselle hissed, her voice trembling with barely restrained fury. “After everything we’ve been through? I’ve waited for you for years—”

“I never asked you to wait,” Lucien cut in, shaking his head. “I thought we agreed to keep our personal lives separate from work. Why are you confronting me like this?”

“Because you won’t talk to me otherwise!” she cried, her voice breaking. “This isn’t fair, Lucien!”

“You’re the one being unfair, Giselle,” he shot back, turning to face her fully. “I’ve found my mate. You were once my friend. You should be happy for me.”

Her arms crossed tightly over her chest. “I’m in love with you,” she whispered, her voice raw with emotion. “I thought you felt something too—”
###Chapter 255

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s mansion. The moon hung low in the sky, casting silver light over the sprawling estate. She exhaled slowly, her breath forming a faint mist in the cool night.

Inside, the grand hall buzzed with activity. The annual Lycan Council gathering was in full swing, and the most powerful werewolves in the region had gathered under one roof. Lillian could hear the clinking of glasses, the murmur of conversations, and the occasional burst of laughter.

Her fingers tightened around the railing. She shouldn’t be here. Not like this. Not when Donovan—her former fated mate—was somewhere inside, likely whispering sweet nothings to Evelyn, his new chosen partner. The thought made her stomach twist.

A familiar presence approached from behind. "You’re missing the party," Sebastian’s deep voice rumbled, his tone laced with amusement.

Lillian didn’t turn. "I needed air."

He stepped beside her, his broad frame blocking the chilly breeze. "Avoiding someone?"

She shot him a sidelong glance. "Wouldn’t you?"

Sebastian smirked. "If I were you? Probably."

The silence stretched between them, comfortable yet charged. Lillian had grown used to his presence, his scent—dark oak and something uniquely him—filling her senses. It was dangerous, this closeness. She knew better than to let herself rely on him.

A sudden crash from inside shattered the moment. Raised voices followed, sharp and angry.

Sebastian’s expression darkened. "Stay here."

Before she could protest, he was gone, disappearing into the crowd. Lillian hesitated, then followed.

The scene inside was chaos. Donovan stood at the center, his face flushed with fury, while Evelyn clung to his arm, her eyes wide with alarm. Across from them, Alpha Harrison—a notorious troublemaker—grinned, his posture relaxed despite the tension.

"You always did have a habit of taking what isn’t yours," Harrison taunted, his gaze flickering to Lillian as she approached.

Donovan snarled. "Stay out of this, Harrison."

Sebastian stepped between them, his voice a low warning. "Enough."

The room fell silent.

Lillian’s pulse pounded in her ears. This wasn’t just about her. It was about power, alliances, old grudges. And she was caught in the middle.

Then, from the back of the room, a voice cut through the tension.

"Father?"

Oliver, Sebastian’s young son, stood in the doorway, his small face pale with worry.

Sebastian’s demeanor shifted instantly. He turned, his voice softening. "Oliver, go back to your room."

But the damage was done. The moment was broken.

As the guests dispersed, murmuring among themselves, Lillian met Donovan’s gaze across the room. His expression was unreadable.

She knew one thing for certain—this wasn’t over.

Not by a long shot.

Lillian narrowed her eyes.

“Isn’t this a bit sudden?” Donovan asked, arching a brow.

I crossed my arms over my chest.

“I didn’t exactly get much warning either,” I admitted. “But this is huge. I can’t just walk away from it.”

After a brief pause, Donovan gave a slow nod.

“I’ll inform the Alpha,” he said. “He’s finally letting me speak again. Next week is school break, so it’s not like Master Oliver needs tutoring during that time.”

I nodded in thanks before turning to leave, but Victoria rushed down the stairs, cutting me off. Her eyes were red-rimmed, her cheeks damp—she’d been crying. She froze when she saw me, hastily wiping her face with the back of her hand.

“Oh, Lillian…” she exhaled. “You’re early.”

“Didn’t have much else going on today,” I said with a shrug. “Thought I’d get a head start.”

The tension between us was undeniable. She no longer saw me as a friend, and honestly? After everything, I didn’t see her as one either. But something twisted in my gut at the sight of her—pale, thinner than before, her eyes hollow. She was unraveling, and it showed.

I sighed, relenting.

“Are you okay, Victoria?” I asked, hating that I still cared.

She hesitated, shifting on her feet before finally meeting my gaze.

“Can I ask you something?” Her voice was barely above a whisper.

I bit my lower lip but nodded.

“Of course.”

“What really happened between you and Donovan?”

The question caught me off guard. My brows shot up.

“What?”

“The truth,” she pressed, her voice trembling. “Why did you two break up?”

For a second, I considered lying. The truth would only hurt her more. But the reason she hated me in the first place was because I’d lied. I wouldn’t do it again.

“He cheated on me,” I said flatly. “With you.”

Her breath hitched. “What?”

“You met him at that conference with your father, didn’t you?” I shrugged, feigning indifference. “He fell for you. Left me. We’d been marked, mated for two years by then. Every time he’s with you, I feel our bond tearing apart. It won’t stop until he marks you—which, I assume, will be after the wedding.” I met her horrified gaze. “That’s what happened. He met you, and he left me.”
She exhaled sharply, as if she'd been holding her breath since the moment she first asked the question.

The devastation on Victoria's face was palpable, her expression crumbling under the weight of my confession.

I wanted to tell her everything—how Donovan had been trying to manipulate me into becoming his secret lover, how he wanted to keep his engagement to her while indulging in his selfish desires. I wanted to reveal that he didn’t love her, that he was only using her to get closer to her father, Sebastian Blackwood. I wanted to expose how he'd been blackmailing me, how I was certain he was the reason my father was now imprisoned with loan sharks hunting him down.

But the words stuck in my throat, refusing to come out.

She was already drowning in pain—she didn’t need the full storm crashing down on her just yet. Besides, withholding the rest wasn’t technically lying. I had answered her question honestly. Unless she asked for more, I didn’t owe her every ugly detail.

"I'm sorry I had to be the one to tell you this, Victoria. And I'm sorry I didn’t say it sooner," I murmured, the apology genuine.

She didn’t respond. Her gaze remained fixed on the floor, her body unnervingly still.

"Are you okay?" I asked after a long, suffocating silence.

She blinked rapidly, as if snapping back to reality.

"I... I don’t know," she admitted, her voice rough and barely audible. "I had no idea..."

I sighed, hating how much her pain affected me. Despite everything, a part of me still cared. She had once been my friend, and she was Sebastian’s daughter—some invisible thread still tied me to her.

"I know I might be the last person you want to talk to right now. But if you need anything... I'm here," I offered, forcing a small, reassuring smile.

I turned to leave, unsure what else to say and needing to find Oliver for our daily training session. Besides, I doubted Victoria truly wanted me here. Once the shock wore off, she’d remember she saw me as the enemy.

Then—

"I think he’s cheating on me," she blurted, freezing me mid-step.

###Chapter 256

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, illuminating the scattered papers on his desk. Lillian stretched lazily in the oversized armchair, her fingers tracing the rim of her half-empty coffee cup. The scent of freshly brewed espresso lingered in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of Sebastian’s cologne.

“You’re staring,” she murmured, catching his gaze.

Sebastian leaned back in his chair, his lips curving into a smirk. “Can’t help it. You’re distracting.”

Lillian rolled her eyes, but a flush crept up her neck. The tension between them had been simmering for weeks—ever since Donovan’s betrayal and Evelyn’s sudden appearance in their lives.

A knock at the door interrupted the moment.

“Come in,” Sebastian called, his voice sharp with authority.

The door swung open, revealing Marcus Grayson, his Beta, his expression grim. “We have a problem.”

Lillian straightened, her playful mood evaporating. “What happened?”

Marcus hesitated, glancing between them. “It’s about Donovan. He’s made a move.”

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. “Explain.”

“He’s been seen meeting with Alpha Harrison. They’re planning something—something big.”

Lillian’s stomach twisted. Alpha Harrison was the same man who had tried to take advantage of her when she was vulnerable. If Donovan was aligning with him, it could only mean one thing: revenge.

Sebastian stood abruptly, his chair scraping against the hardwood floor. “Gather the warriors. We’re not waiting for them to strike first.”

Lillian reached for his arm. “Sebastian, we need to think this through. If we act rashly—”

“There’s no time for caution,” he cut in, his eyes darkening. “They’re coming for us. For you.”

The weight of his words settled over her. She knew he was right. Donovan had never been one to forgive or forget.

Marcus cleared his throat. “There’s more. Evelyn was spotted leaving the city last night. She took a private jet—destination unknown.”

Lillian’s breath hitched. Evelyn’s sudden disappearance couldn’t be a coincidence.

Sebastian’s phone buzzed on the desk. He snatched it up, his expression growing colder with each passing second.

“What is it?” Lillian asked, dread coiling in her chest.

He looked up, his voice eerily calm. “Oliver’s school just called. He never arrived this morning.”

The room spun. Lillian’s hands trembled as she shot to her feet. “We have to find him. Now.”

Sebastian was already moving, his phone pressed to his ear as he barked orders. “Lock down the city. No one gets in or out without clearance.”

Lillian’s mind raced. If Donovan had Oliver…

She couldn’t finish the thought.

The game had changed.

And this time, the stakes were higher than ever.

Lillian's POV

Her words hit me like a punch to the gut. Slowly, I turned to face Victoria, but she refused to meet my eyes. Her fingers twisted the hem of her blouse nervously, and her breathing was uneven—shallow, almost panicked.

"What?" I asked, narrowing my eyes.

"I think he's cheating on me," she repeated, her voice barely above a whisper. The way she said it made me think she was on the verge of hyperventilating. "I went to his place because I hadn’t seen him in days, and there was a woman standing outside. She looked like she was about to knock, but when she saw me, she just... left."

A woman? My chest tightened. "Do you know who she was?"

Victoria shook her head.

"No, never seen her before."

"What did she look like?" I pressed.

For a moment, Victoria hesitated, her expression darkening as realization dawned on her. Then, her gaze sharpened—icy, accusatory—as if she suddenly remembered who she was talking to. The warmth in her eyes vanished, replaced by something venomous.

The shift was so sudden, so hostile, that I instinctively took a step back.

"She looked like you," she spat. "I need to leave."

Without another word, she turned on her heel and stormed up the stairs.

I frowned, watching her go.

That was... strange.

Shaking off the uneasy feeling, I spent the rest of the day with Oliver—tutoring him, then running through combat drills. I half-expected Sebastian to show up at some point, but he never did. By the time I left the villa, the sun had long since set, and exhaustion weighed heavily on my limbs.

Frederick drove me home. When I asked if he’d heard from Sebastian, he gave a vague, dismissive answer.

"The Alpha’s been busy," he said. "Don’t worry about him."

"Busy with what?" I demanded.

He didn’t answer.

That only made me more suspicious. Was there someone else? Was he spending all his time with another woman? My mind immediately jumped to Celeste—maybe he’d finally given in and taken her up on her advances.

The thought made me nauseous.

Part of me wanted to march straight to his office and demand answers. But the other part—the part that feared rejection—held me back.

So I let it go.

I told myself he’d come to me when he was ready.

He didn’t.

A week passed, and still—nothing.

I was leaving tomorrow morning, and Sebastian had no idea. At least, I didn’t think he did. Theodore had said—

The afternoon sun cast long shadows across my bedroom as I folded the last of my clothes into the suitcase. My phone buzzed against the duvet—another text from Beatrice. We'd been coordinating our packing all day, though neither of us mentioned the elephant in the room: Lucien.

Not since that painfully silent car ride had Beatrice spoken to him, and judging by Giselle's reports, the usually flirtatious chef had become a ghost in the mansion kitchens. No more impromptu dessert tastings. No lingering smiles by the staff entrance. Just... silence.

Victoria hadn't returned my calls either. Seven days of radio silence. Was she mortified about her confession? Or had she told Sebastian everything? My fingers trembled as I zipped the suitcase shut.

Downstairs, Oliver's disappointed pout when I canceled our training sessions nearly broke me. "But you'll be on TV!" he'd exclaimed, tiny fists clutching my sleeves. The Gamma competition broadcast was his new obsession—right after werewolf chess and strawberry milkshakes. His excitement almost made up for the guilt gnawing at my ribs.

Almost.

The grandfather clock chimed five. Somewhere in this too-quiet mansion, Sebastian was working. Always working. Just like me. Just like Beatrice. Just like everyone drowning in the things we wouldn't say.

My reflection in the vanity mirror looked exhausted. Shadows pooled beneath my eyes. Tomorrow, the competition would begin. Tonight? Tonight I'd stare at my ceiling and wonder if silence could suffocate a person.

###Chapter 257

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, painting the marble floors in warm hues. Lillian stretched lazily in the silk sheets, her body still humming from the previous night’s passion. The scent of sandalwood and something distinctly Sebastian clung to her skin, a heady reminder of their bond.

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Miss Lillian?" Sophia Delacroix’s voice floated in, gentle but firm. "Mr. Blackwood has requested your presence in the dining room. Breakfast is served."

Lillian sighed, running a hand through her tousled hair. "Thank you, Sophia. I’ll be down shortly."

She slipped into a satin robe, the fabric whispering against her skin as she padded barefoot toward the ensuite bathroom. The reflection in the mirror showed a woman glowing—cheeks flushed, lips slightly swollen, eyes bright with satisfaction.

Mated life suits you, her wolf purred.

Lillian smirked. Shut up.

Downstairs, the dining room was a vision of elegance. Crystal chandeliers dripped light over the long mahogany table, where Sebastian sat at the head, impeccably dressed in a tailored navy suit. His dark eyes lifted as she entered, a slow, possessive smile curving his lips.

"Good morning, darling." His voice was a velvet caress.

Lillian’s pulse stuttered. Even after all this time, he could still make her breath catch. "Morning," she murmured, sliding into the chair beside him.

Theodore Whitmore, the ever-efficient butler, appeared with a silver tray of freshly brewed coffee and pastries. "Your usual, Miss Lillian."

"Thank you, Theodore." She took a sip, savoring the rich, dark blend.

Sebastian’s fingers brushed against hers beneath the table, sending a jolt of electricity up her arm. "Sleep well?"

Lillian arched a brow. "You know I didn’t."

His chuckle was low, sinful. "Neither did I."

Before she could retort, Marcus Grayson strode in, his expression grim. "Alpha, we have a situation."

Sebastian’s playful demeanor vanished in an instant. "Report."

"Evelyn and Donovan were spotted near the eastern border last night. They’ve been gathering rogue werewolves—possibly planning an attack."

Lillian’s grip tightened around her coffee cup. Donovan. Her ex-fated mate, the man who had betrayed her in the worst possible way.

Sebastian’s jaw clenched. "Double the patrols. I want every inch of our territory secured."

Marcus nodded. "Already done. But there’s more." He hesitated, glancing at Lillian. "They’ve been spreading rumors… about you and the Alpha."

Lillian frowned. "What kind of rumors?"

Marcus exhaled sharply. "That your mating bond is a sham. That Sebastian forced you into it."

Sebastian’s growl reverberated through the room, the air thickening with his barely restrained fury. "They’re testing my patience."

Lillian placed a hand on his arm, feeling the tension coiled beneath his skin. "Let them talk. It doesn’t change anything."

But the unease in her chest said otherwise.

Because if Donovan was bold enough to challenge Sebastian publicly, he wasn’t just after power.

He was after her.

Later that afternoon, Beatrice burst into Lillian’s dorm room, her cheeks flushed with excitement. "You’ll never guess who just arrived on campus!"

Lillian barely looked up from her textbook. "Who?"

"Celeste Devereaux! The supermodel! She’s here for some charity event, and rumor has it she’s very close with Sebastian."

Lillian’s pen stilled.

Beatrice winced. "Oh. You didn’t know?"

Lillian forced a smile. "Of course I knew."

But the sinking feeling in her stomach told her this was far from over.

And when her phone buzzed with an unknown number—a single photo of Sebastian and Celeste laughing intimately at a gala—Lillian’s blood ran cold.

The caption read: Does he tell you everything, little mate?

Her wolf snarled.

Game on.

Every shifter across the globe had their eyes glued to these competitions, their nerves frayed at the thought that I might be one of the competitors they’d be watching. And honestly? I was thrilled—not just to escape for a few weeks, but to finally step into the arena I’d dreamed of for so long.

But excitement wasn’t the only thing coursing through me.

Nerves. Raw, unrelenting nerves.

This was it. My entire future hinged on this moment, on this competition. One misstep, and everything I’d worked for could crumble.

My professors assured me I was ready. My family and friends cheered me on. But the one person whose support I craved most? Nowhere to be found.

Sebastian.

Just thinking his name made my chest tighten. He’d been avoiding me for weeks, and I didn’t know why.

Distracted, I barely registered Oliver’s movements as we sparred. I knew better than to train with my mind elsewhere, but arrogance whispered that I could handle it. That I was good enough to push through.

I wasn’t.

Mid-demonstration of a new archery technique, my focus shattered. My aim faltered. And before I could react—

Thunk.

A scream tore through the night.

Oliver’s.

I didn’t remember sprinting to him, only the sickening sight of an arrow embedded in his thigh, blood soaking through his pants. My hands shook as I pressed against the wound, terrified to pull the shaft free.

He’d never cried like this before. Never clung to me with such desperation, his face pale, tears streaking down his cheeks.

Thank the Moon it wasn’t worse. Even without his wolf, Oliver would heal—but not without help.

“OLIVER!” Victoria’s shriek cut through the chaos. When had she arrived? Before I could speak, she shoved me aside with enough force to send me sprawling. “You monster! I saw what you did! You shot him!”

I opened my mouth. Closed it.

What could I say? She wasn’t wrong. I’d been careless. Reckless. That arrow could’ve killed him.

“We need an ambulance,” Victoria snapped, her voice trembling.

Fumbling for my phone, I barely registered the blood smearing across the screen as I dialed. The conversation blurred into white noise, my body numb as I sat there—

My back pressed against the rough bark of an ancient oak, fingers trembling around the phone that had just delivered devastating news. The call had cut off abruptly, leaving me staring in horror at the scene unfolding before me. Oliver lay sprawled on the forest floor, his small frame shuddering with each labored breath as crimson pooled beneath him. Victoria cradled her little brother, her usually flawless designer blouse now stained scarlet as she desperately tried to stem the bleeding. The arrow protruding from Oliver's thigh looked grotesquely out of place - like some medieval torture device in our modern world.

"Don't pull it!" I wanted to scream, but my voice had abandoned me. The metallic scent of blood hung thick in the air, mixing with the earthy aroma of damp leaves. Oliver's face had taken on a ghastly pallor, his lips tinged blue against his ashen skin. Each passing second seemed to stretch into eternity as we watched the life drain from those bright eyes that usually sparkled with mischief.

Somewhere in the distance, I heard the faint wail of approaching sirens. Would they make it in time? My knees buckled as the reality of the situation crashed over me - Sebastian's precious son, the heir to the Blackwood legacy, might die right here in this clearing because of me. The weight of that possibility pressed down on my chest like a physical force, making it impossible to breathe.

Victoria's tear-streaked face turned toward me, her expression shifting from desperation to something far more dangerous. In that moment, I saw the truth reflected in her eyes - this wasn't just an accident. Someone had targeted Oliver deliberately. And as the future Alpha female of the pack, she would make them pay in blood.
###Chapter 258

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, illuminating the sleek marble floors. Lillian stretched lazily in the king-sized bed, her fingers brushing against the cool silk sheets. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted in from the kitchen, mingling with the faint trace of Sebastian’s cologne still lingering on the pillow beside her.

She sighed, rolling onto her back. Last night had been… unexpected.

A sharp knock at the door startled her.

"Lillian?" Sebastian’s deep voice resonated through the wood. "Are you awake?"

She bolted upright, clutching the sheets to her chest. "Y-yes! Just a second!"

Her heart hammered as she scrambled for her discarded clothes. The memories of the previous evening flooded back—Donovan’s betrayal, the gala, the way Sebastian had pulled her into his arms when she stumbled, drunk and vulnerable.

She had sworn she wouldn’t fall for him.

And yet, here she was.

The door creaked open before she could fully dress. Sebastian stood in the doorway, impeccably dressed in a tailored suit, his dark eyes sweeping over her disheveled state. A smirk tugged at his lips.

"Sleep well?"

Lillian’s cheeks burned. "I—I need to go. Beatrice is probably worried sick."

Sebastian stepped forward, blocking her path. "Not so fast." He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small velvet box.

Her breath hitched.

"I believe this belongs to you." He flipped it open, revealing the silver pendant she had lost at the gala—the one her mother had given her before she died.

Lillian’s fingers trembled as she took it. "How did you—?"

"I have my ways." His gaze darkened. "But we need to talk about last night."

Her stomach twisted. "Nothing happened."

"Didn’t it?" He stepped closer, his voice dropping to a whisper. "Because I distinctly remember you clinging to me, begging me not to let go."

Lillian’s pulse spiked. She had been drunk. Emotional. Weak.

And he had seen it all.

Before she could respond, his phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, his expression hardening.

"It’s Victoria."

Lillian stiffened. His daughter—the one engaged to Donovan.

Sebastian exhaled sharply. "She’s on her way here."

Panic surged through her. If Victoria found her here, in his penthouse, wearing yesterday’s dress—

"Go," Sebastian ordered, nodding toward the private elevator. "Marcus will take you home."

Lillian didn’t argue. She snatched her purse and bolted for the door, but not before catching the conflicted look in Sebastian’s eyes.

This wasn’t over.

Not even close.

As the elevator doors closed behind her, one thought echoed in her mind:

What have I done?

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian hurried across the campus quad. Her fingers tightened around the strap of her backpack, the weight of her textbooks a familiar comfort. She had just finished her afternoon lecture when her phone buzzed with an urgent message from Beatrice.

"Meet me at the coffee shop. Now. It's about Donovan."

Lillian’s heart skipped a beat. Donovan—her ex-fated mate, the man who had betrayed her for Evelyn. Whatever Beatrice had discovered couldn’t be good.

The campus coffee shop, Brewed Awakening, was unusually crowded for a weekday afternoon. Gabrielle, the barista and Lillian’s classmate, gave her a sympathetic smile as she entered. Beatrice sat in their usual corner booth, her expression grim.

"You look like you’ve seen a ghost," Lillian said, sliding into the seat opposite her.

"Worse," Beatrice muttered, pushing a folded newspaper across the table. "Look at page three."

Lillian unfolded the paper, her eyes scanning the headlines until she found it—a society column featuring Donovan and Evelyn, announcing their engagement party at the Winslow estate. The date was set for next weekend.

Her stomach twisted. "So soon?" she whispered.

Beatrice leaned forward. "That’s not all. Rumor has it Sebastian Blackwood is attending."

Lillian’s breath caught. Sebastian—the enigmatic Lycan chairman who had become an unexpected ally. His presence at Donovan’s engagement party could only mean one thing: trouble.

"Why would he go?" Lillian asked, though she already suspected the answer.

Beatrice’s eyes darkened. "Revenge. Donovan humiliated you publicly. Sebastian doesn’t strike me as the type to let that slide."

Lillian’s fingers trembled as she traced the edge of the newspaper. The thought of Sebastian confronting Donovan sent a thrill down her spine—but also a pang of fear. If things escalated, the fallout could be catastrophic.

"We have to stop him," she said suddenly.

Beatrice arched a brow. "And how do you plan to do that? Sebastian doesn’t exactly take orders."

Lillian bit her lip. She had no leverage over Sebastian, no way to influence his decisions. But the idea of him risking his reputation—or worse—for her sake was unbearable.

"I’ll talk to him," she said firmly.

Beatrice sighed. "Good luck with that. But if you’re going, I’m coming with you. Someone needs to keep you from doing something reckless."

Lillian managed a small smile. "Since when have I ever been reckless?"

Beatrice snorted. "Since always."

As they left the coffee shop, Lillian’s mind raced. She needed to find Sebastian before he made a move that couldn’t be undone. But first, she had another problem to deal with—Oliver, Sebastian’s seven-year-old son, had a school play tonight, and she’d promised to attend.

The day was far from over, and the stakes had never been higher.

My mind went blank. Every ounce of Gamma training evaporated as I stood frozen, staring at Oliver's bleeding leg. The arrow protruded grotesquely, and his small body trembled violently against the grass.

"What happened?" Sebastian's voice cut through the chaos as he sprinted toward us. I hadn't heard him return. The commotion must have drawn him from inside the mansion.

In a blur of motion, he was at Oliver's side. With one swift movement, he tore off his dress shirt and began fashioning a tourniquet. When had he removed the arrow? The bloodied projectile now lay discarded on the lawn, its silver tip glinting ominously.

"It was Lillian!" Victoria spat, jabbing an accusatory finger at me. Her eyes burned with venom. "She did this deliberately. She shot Oliver!"

Sebastian's head snapped up, his gaze locking onto mine for the first time. Storm clouds gathered in those usually warm amber eyes, his jaw clenched so tightly I heard his teeth grind. His wolf simmered just beneath the surface as his eyes raked over my bloodstained blouse and trembling hands.

"Explain." The single word rumbled with barely contained fury, his Alpha power lacing through the command like barbed wire.

"I—" My voice failed me, emerging as nothing more than a broken whisper.

"She's lying!" Victoria shrieked. "I saw everything! This is the second time Oliver's been hurt under her watch!"

A guttural growl vibrated in Sebastian's chest. Whether directed at me or his daughter, I couldn't tell. His piercing stare never wavered from mine as the weight of Victoria's accusations settled between us like falling ash.

The approaching wail of sirens brought momentary relief.

"Leave." The word struck like a physical blow. "Don't come back."

His voice held the glacial detachment of a stranger. The raw hatred twisting his aristocratic features shattered what remained of my composure. Hot tears streaked down my cheeks, mingling with Oliver's blood as I swiped at them frantically.

My entire body shook. That look—I'd never seen it before, not even during our worst arguments. My wolf whimpered, curling into herself in shame. My legs refused to obey, rooted to the spot despite my screaming instincts to flee.

"I'm so sorry," I choked out to Oliver, who clung to his father like a lifeline. His pallor was improving, the tremors less violent now. "It was an accident... I swear..."

"GO!" Sebastian's Alpha command hit me like a tidal wave, forcing my knees to buckle. He'd never used his power against me before. The betrayal stung worse than the compulsion.

Stumbling backward, I turned and fled the estate, the iron gates slamming shut behind me with finality.

###Chapter 259

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, illuminating the sleek marble floors. Lillian stretched beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming from last night’s passionate encounter with the Lycan chairman.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, pulling the duvet higher.

The door creaked open, revealing Giselle Beaumont, the head maid, balancing a silver tray laden with breakfast. "Good morning, Miss Lillian. Mr. Blackwood instructed me to bring you breakfast in bed."

Lillian’s cheeks warmed at the thought of Sebastian’s consideration. "Thank you, Giselle."

The maid set the tray down, her eyes twinkling knowingly. "He also mentioned he’ll be back by noon. There’s… something important he wishes to discuss with you."

Lillian’s pulse quickened. Important? Was this about their bond? Their future?

Before she could ask, Giselle excused herself, leaving Lillian alone with her swirling thoughts. She picked at the fresh fruit, her mind racing.

Meanwhile, across town, Donovan Winslow paced the length of his penthouse, his phone pressed to his ear. "I don’t care what it takes," he growled. "Find her. Now."

Evelyn lounged on the couch, filing her nails. "Still obsessing over your little werewolf ex?" she drawled.

Donovan shot her a venomous glare. "This doesn’t concern you."

Evelyn smirked. "Oh, but it does. If you’re planning to challenge Sebastian Blackwood for her, you’ll need my family’s backing."

His jaw clenched. She wasn’t wrong.

Back at the penthouse, Lillian’s phone buzzed. A message from Beatrice:

"Emergency. Meet me at The Crimson Bean in 20. It’s about Donovan."

Lillian’s stomach dropped. She dressed hastily, her fingers trembling as she buttoned her blouse.

What had Donovan done now?

The Crimson Bean was unusually quiet for a Saturday morning. Beatrice sat in a corner booth, her expression grim.

"He’s planning something," she whispered as Lillian slid into the seat opposite her. "Donovan’s been meeting with Alpha Harrison. And Evelyn’s family."

Lillian’s blood ran cold. "Why?"

Beatrice leaned closer. "Rumor has it he’s gathering allies to challenge Sebastian’s claim on you."

Lillian’s fork clattered against her plate. "He wouldn’t dare."

But even as she said it, doubt crept in. Donovan had always been ruthless. And now, with Evelyn’s connections and Alpha Harrison’s influence…

Her phone buzzed again—Sebastian.

"Where are you?"

Her heart pounded. She needed to warn him.

But before she could reply, the café door swung open.

Donovan stood there, his golden eyes locked onto hers.

"Hello, mate," he purred.

Lillian’s breath hitched.

The game had just begun.

Sebastian's POV

"Why are you avoiding going home?" Marcus asked, lounging in the chair across from my desk.

I arched a brow. "What makes you think I am?"

He shrugged, his smirk irritatingly knowing.

"It's been over a week, and you've barely set foot in your own villa," Marcus pointed out. "Is this about Lillian?"

My jaw tightened.

"No," I said sharply, shaking my head. "Why would I be avoiding Lillian?"

"Because you haven't been sneaking off to see her like you usually do," Marcus countered, that infuriating grin widening. "Deny it all you want, but I know you've been slipping away to the other estate. Ever since that gala, you've been tangled up with her. Don’t think I forgot—you kickedout of the car that night just so you could have your fun."

I exhaled heavily, leaning back in my chair.

"I'm not avoiding her. I'm just… keeping my distance. Victoria made it clear she doesn’t want Lillian around."

Marcus scoffed. "So you're doing this because Victoria said so?"

"I'm doing this for my family," I snapped. "Lillian understands my children cfirst. There are no hard feelings."

"You sure about that?"

I hesitated, the memory of Lillian’s crestfallen expression flashing in my mind every tI canceled our plans these past weeks. My chest constricted at the thought. I’d told Marcus it was because of Victoria, but that wasn’t the whole truth.

Yes, Victoria had been more difficult lately, but that wasn’t the real issue.

The real problem was Alpha Maximilian Voss.

If he found out about Lillian and me, he’d use it as leverage. Until he was gone, it was safer to stay away.

"Positive," I muttered.

Marcus crossed his arms. "Alright, if you're not avoiding your villa because of Lillian, then why are you sleeping in your office?" He gestured to the couch in the corner, still strewn with my blanket and pillow. "You’ve practically moved in here."

I dragged a hand down my face. "Victoria’s been insufferable. More clingy than usual. I don’t know what’s gotten into her—I just needed space."

"So you're avoiding your own daughter?" Marcus raised a brow. "That’s worse."

I growled. "Don’t push me."

He chuckled, standing. "You won’t do shit, and we both know it." Straightening his jacket, he added, "I’m heading out—got a date with my mate. But take sadvice: go home, Sebastian. Deal with your mess like an Alpha. Stop hiding in your office." He shota look. "I’ll send Frederick to pick you up."

With that, he left, leavingalone with my thoughts.

He was right. I couldn’t stay here forever. My children needed me. And maybe… I owed Lillian an explanation. It wasn’t her. It was the uncertainty—where she stood with me, with my kids, with the whole damn mess involving Maximilian. I just wanted to do what was best for everyone. And right now, continuing whatever this was between us? It wasn’t fair. Not to her, not to anyone.

True to his word, Marcus sent Frederick to drivehome.

The moment I stepped inside, chaos erupted.

Screams.

From the training grounds.

I sprinted, heart pounding—only to find Victoria crouched over Oliver, her hands pressed to his bleeding arm as he sobbed.

Blood. Everywhere.

###Chapter 260

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse suite, illuminating the scattered paperwork on his desk. Lillian stood by the window, her fingers tracing the condensation on her glass of iced tea. The tension in the room was palpable, thick enough to cut with a knife.

Sebastian’s deep voice broke the silence. "We need to talk about what happened last night."

Lillian turned, meeting his piercing gaze. "I know." Her voice was steady, but her fingers tightened around the glass.

The memory of the gala replayed in her mind—the way Donovan had cornered her near the balcony, his words dripping with venom. "You think you belong here? With him? You’re nothing but a stray."

Sebastian’s jaw clenched. "He had no right to speak to you like that."

Lillian exhaled sharply. "It doesn’t matter. He’s just trying to get under my skin."

Sebastian crossed the room in three long strides, stopping inches from her. "It does matter. You’re my mate, Lillian. No one disrespects you and walks away unscathed."

Her breath hitched at the possessive edge in his tone. The air between them crackled with unspoken promises—of protection, of retribution.

A knock at the door interrupted them.

"Come in," Sebastian called, not breaking eye contact with Lillian.

The door swung open, and Marcus Grayson stepped inside, his expression grim. "We have a problem."

Sebastian’s eyes darkened. "What is it?"

Marcus hesitated, glancing at Lillian before continuing. "Donovan’s been spotted near the eastern border. He’s not alone—he’s with Evelyn."

Lillian’s stomach twisted. Evelyn. The woman who had stolen Donovan’s mark, who had taken everything from her.

Sebastian’s voice was dangerously calm. "Gather the warriors. We move at dusk."

Lillian reached for his arm. "Sebastian, wait—"

He turned to her, his gaze softening just slightly. "This ends tonight."

The determination in his eyes left no room for argument.

As Marcus left to relay the orders, Lillian’s mind raced. Donovan had always been reckless, but this—this was a direct challenge. And if Sebastian retaliated, the consequences could ignite a war between packs.

She swallowed hard.

Tonight, everything would change.

My vision blurred with fury.

Who dared harm my nephew?

My first instinct pointed to Levi—had that bastard somehow breached my villa?

I sprinted toward Oliver, dropping to my knees beside him. Instinct took over. The wound was superficial—a quick assessment of the arrow confirmed it could be removed safely if I acted fast. Without hesitation, I yanked off my shirt, pressing the fabric against the wound to staunch the bleeding. The distant wail of sirens grew louder, signaling help was on its way.

As I worked, I demanded answers from Victoria. Her voice trembled as she revealed the truth—Lillian had fired the arrow.

Only then did I notice her.

Lillian sat slumped against a tree, dazed, her hands stained crimson, her expression hollow. When our eyes met, tears shimmered in hers.

Rage. Disappointment.

That was all I felt as I glared at her.

How could she let this happen?

How dare she endanger Oliver like this?

I knew it wasn’t intentional, but that didn’t excuse her recklessness. Oliver was hurt because of her.

Yes, he would recover—it was just a flesh wound, and the arrow wasn’t laced with silver. With proper care, he’d heal swiftly. But Lillian was supposed to protect him. If that arrow had struck anywhere vital…

She had betrayed my trust.

The words tore from me before I could stop them, my anger boiling over. All I saw was red.

The EMTs arrived, replacing my makeshift bandage with proper medical supplies. They confirmed Oliver wouldn’t need hospitalization—his Alpha lineage accelerated his healing. After administering pain relief, they advised rest.

I carried him to his room, his small body limp from the medication. He looked so fragile, his face pale against the pillows. My chest ached. He didn’t deserve this.

But I knew Lillian hadn’t meant it.

The way she flinched when I ordered her to leave—like she feared I’d strike her—told me everything.

I needed the full story.

Victoria’s scent led me to the parlor. She sat curled on the couch, arms wrapped around herself. Tears glistened in her eyes as she looked up.

"How’s Oliver?" she asked, nearly leaping to her feet.

"Asleep. He’ll be fine—just needs rest," I assured her.

She sank back into the cushions, exhaling in relief.

But my fury hadn’t subsided.

Someone would answer for this.

"Thank the Moon Goddess," Lillian breathed out, letting her head fall back against the plush couch cushions. I settled beside her, the silence between us comfortable yet weighted with unspoken thoughts.

The evening light filtered through the tall windows, casting golden streaks across the room. After a moment, I broke the quiet.

"I'll be gone for a few weeks. Leaving tomorrow night."

She nodded, her fingers absently tracing the embroidery on a throw pillow.

"The Gamma Trials, right?" she asked, already knowing the answer.

I confirmed with a tilt of my head. "Sebastian has arranged everything. Marcus will stay behind—he’ll handle pack affairs and keep an eye on you and Oliver."

Lillian rolled her eyes, a familiar stubbornness flashing in her gaze. "Dad, I don’t need a babysitter. I can take care of myself."

I smirked, though my tone remained firm. "Humor me. With Oliver still recovering, an extra pair of hands won’t hurt."

Her lips pursed, but she didn’t argue further. Instead, she leaned into my side, a quiet acceptance in her posture.

Outside, the distant howl of a patrol wolf echoed through the trees, a reminder of the world beyond these walls—one I’d soon be stepping back into.

###Chapter 261

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s estate. The sun had barely risen, casting golden streaks across the sprawling gardens below. She tightened the silk robe around her, the fabric whispering against her skin.

Last night had been… unexpected.

Her fingers traced the faint mark on her neck—Sebastian’s claiming bite. The memory of his lips against her skin sent a shiver down her spine. She had never imagined she would be mated to the most powerful Lycan in the country, let alone under such circumstances.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

“Lillian?” Beatrice’s voice was muffled through the door. “Are you awake?”

Lillian turned, her bare feet padding across the cool marble floor. She opened the door to find her best friend holding two steaming mugs of coffee. Beatrice’s eyes widened as she took in Lillian’s disheveled appearance.

“Oh my Goddess,” Beatrice breathed, stepping inside and shutting the door behind her. “It’s true, then? You and Sebastian—?”

Lillian accepted the coffee, the warmth seeping into her palms. “It’s… complicated.”

Beatrice snorted. “Complicated? You’re mated to the Lycan Chairman, Lillian. That’s not complicated—that’s life-changing.”

Lillian sighed, sinking into the plush armchair by the window. “I know. But it wasn’t exactly planned.”

Beatrice perched on the edge of the bed, her expression turning serious. “What about Donovan?”

Lillian’s grip tightened around the mug. Donovan, her former fated mate—now engaged to Victoria, Sebastian’s daughter. The irony wasn’t lost on her.

“He made his choice,” Lillian said quietly. “And I made mine.”

A sharp rap at the door made both women jump.

“Miss Lillian?” Theodore Whitmore’s smooth voice carried through the wood. “Mr. Blackwood requests your presence in his study.”

Lillian exchanged a glance with Beatrice. “I’ll be right there.”

As Theodore’s footsteps faded, Beatrice leaned in. “What do you think he wants?”

Lillian set down her untouched coffee. “I have a feeling I’m about to find out.”

Sebastian’s study was bathed in the soft glow of morning light, the scent of aged leather and cedar filling the air. He stood by the window, his broad shoulders silhouetted against the sunrise.

“You wanted to see me?” Lillian’s voice was steady, though her pulse betrayed her.

Sebastian turned, his golden eyes locking onto hers. “We need to talk about last night.”

Lillian swallowed. “What about it?”

He closed the distance between them in three strides, his presence overwhelming. “You’re my mate now, Lillian. That means certain… expectations.”

Her breath hitched. “Such as?”

A slow, predatory smile curved his lips. “For starters, you’ll be moving into my wing of the estate.”

Lillian’s heart pounded. “And if I refuse?”

Sebastian’s fingers brushed her jaw, sending sparks across her skin. “You won’t.”

Before she could respond, Marcus Grayson burst into the room, his expression grim.

“Sebastian, we have a problem.”

Sebastian’s grip on Lillian tightened imperceptibly. “What is it?”

Marcus hesitated, his gaze flicking to Lillian. “It’s Donovan. He’s challenged you to a duel.”

Silence.

Then—

Lillian’s blood ran cold.

Sebastian’s smile turned lethal. “Tell him I accept.”

Victoria nodded, her fingers twisting nervously in her lap. The tension in the room was thick enough to cut with a knife. I knew I had to ask—now, before the moment slipped away.

“What exactly did you see earlier, Victoria?” I pressed, keeping my voice steady. “You said you saw Lillian shooting him?”

She swallowed hard before turning to face me, her blue eyes dark with accusation.

“She did it on purpose.”

A heavy sigh escaped me as I dragged a hand through my hair. I knew Lillian—better than most—and the idea of her intentionally hurting someone was absurd.

“She wouldn’t do that,” I murmured, shaking my head.

Victoria’s arms crossed over her chest, her glare sharpening.

“She can’t be trusted, Father,” she stated coldly.

I frowned. “What do you have against Lillian?”

She blinked rapidly, as if trying to clear her vision. “What?”

“You used to be friends,” I reminded her. “Then you found out she was once mated to your fiancé. That can’t be the whole story. What’s your real problem with her?”

Victoria’s lips pressed into a thin line. “She was never my friend. She lied to me. Betrayed me.”

“Her only mistake was not telling you the truth about her past with Donovan.”

“She still wants him!” Victoria burst out. “Donovan told me—”

“Donovan also lied to you, Victoria,” I cut in firmly. “If you’re going to blame Lillian, then you should hold him just as accountable. It’s not fair to treat her like she’s the villain here. She didn’t want to hurt you—that’s why she kept quiet. There’s nothing more to it.”

“But—” she started, but I raised a hand.

“I need you to let this go, Victoria,” I said, locking eyes with her. “This grudge isn’t healthy for either of you. Oliver was badly injured—”

“That wasn’t my fault!” she snapped.

“I’m not saying it was. But right now, we need to focus on him, not our own selfishness,” I said firmly. “Can you put your anger aside for your brother’s sake? He’s going to need you in the coming weeks while I’m away, and I’d like to leave knowing you’re thinking clearly.”

She bit her lower lip, her gaze dropping to the floor. Silence stretched between us before she finally exhaled and gave a reluctant nod.

“Fine,” she whispered.

“So, tell me,” I pressed again, hoping for a different answer this time. “What did you really see?”

She hesitated, her fingers tightening around the hem of her sleeve. Then, slowly, she lifted her eyes to mine—glossy with unshed tears.

“It was a mistake,” she admitted softly. “Lillian was the one who fired the arrow into his leg, but she was aiming at the target. Her timing was off… I don’t think she meant to hurt him.”

I let out a slow breath and gave a reluctant nod. Lillian—I needed to check on Lillian immediately. The moment I confirmed Oliver was unharmed, the sharp claws of fury loosened their grip on my chest, leaving behind only a gnawing unease. It was unsettling how quickly the anger had dissipated, replaced by this restless concern that churned inside me like a brewing storm.

The hallway stretched before me, its polished floors reflecting the dim evening light filtering through the windows. My footsteps echoed softly as I moved, my mind racing.

Why this sudden shift?

One moment, I had been ready to tear through anyone who stood between me and Oliver. Now? Now all I could think about was Lillian’s face when she had seen Donovan with Evelyn. The way her shoulders had stiffened, the flicker of hurt in her eyes before she masked it.

I clenched my fists.

She shouldn’t have had to mask anything.

The door to her room was slightly ajar, a sliver of golden light spilling into the corridor. I hesitated, then knocked lightly.

"Lillian?"

No answer.

Pushing the door open further, I stepped inside. The room was empty, the bed neatly made, her scent faint—like she hadn’t been here in hours.

My pulse spiked.

Where was she?

A rustle of fabric made me turn. Beatrice stood in the doorway, her arms crossed, one eyebrow arched.

"Looking for someone?" she drawled.

"Where’s Lillian?"

Beatrice smirked, but there was no real amusement in it. "Oh, now you care?"

I gritted my teeth. "Beatrice."

She sighed, relenting. "Roof. Said she needed air."

Without another word, I turned on my heel and headed for the stairs.

The rooftop was quiet, the night air crisp. Lillian sat on the ledge, her legs dangling over the side, her back to me. The wind played with her hair, tossing dark strands across her shoulders.

For a moment, I just watched her. The tension in her posture, the way her fingers gripped the edge of the stone.

Then I stepped forward.

"You shouldn’t sit like that."

She didn’t turn. "Why not? Worried I’ll fall?"

Yes.

But I didn’t say it. Instead, I moved closer, leaning against the ledge beside her. The city lights stretched below us, a sea of gold and shadow.

Silence settled between us, thick and heavy.

Finally, she spoke, her voice barely above a whisper.

"Did you find Oliver?"

I nodded. "He’s safe."

A small exhale. "Good."

Another pause. Then—

"I’m sorry."

I frowned. "For what?"

She finally turned to look at me, her eyes glinting in the dim light. "For making you choose."

The words hit like a punch.

I opened my mouth—to say what, I wasn’t sure—but she stood abruptly, brushing past me.

"Lillian—"

She didn’t stop.

And just like that, the moment shattered, leaving me standing alone under the cold, indifferent stars.

###Chapter 262

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood's penthouse, painting the marble floors in warm hues. Lillian stretched lazily beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming with the lingering traces of last night's passion.

A deep chuckle rumbled beside her. "Someone's awake."

She turned to find Sebastian propped on one elbow, his dark eyes gleaming with amusement. His tousled hair and the faint stubble along his jaw only added to his rugged appeal.

"Barely," she muttered, though her lips curved into a smile.

His fingers traced idle patterns along her bare shoulder. "Sleep well?"

"Mm. Surprisingly."

The truth was, she hadn't slept this soundly in months. Not since Donovan had shattered her world. But here, wrapped in Sebastian's arms, the nightmares stayed at bay.

A sharp knock at the door interrupted the moment.

"Dad?" Oliver's muffled voice carried through the wood. "Are you awake?"

Sebastian sighed, pressing a quick kiss to Lillian's temple before rolling out of bed. "Duty calls."

She watched as he pulled on a robe, his movements effortless despite the early hour. The man was a force of nature—powerful, commanding, impossible to ignore.

The door creaked open, revealing Oliver's tousled head. His bright eyes darted past Sebastian, landing on Lillian. A grin split his face. "You're still here!"

She laughed, tugging the sheets higher. "Good morning to you too."

Sebastian ruffled his son's hair. "What's the emergency?"

"Victoria's downstairs. She says it's important."

A shadow crossed Sebastian's face. Lillian didn't miss the way his jaw tightened.

"I'll be right down."

Oliver scampered off, leaving silence in his wake.

Lillian sat up, frowning. "Everything okay?"

Sebastian's expression was unreadable. "Stay here. I'll handle it."

But curiosity burned in her veins. She waited until his footsteps faded before slipping out of bed. The plush carpet muffled her steps as she crept to the top of the grand staircase.

Below, Victoria stood in the foyer, her posture rigid. Even from this distance, Lillian could see the tension in her shoulders.

"—can't keep ignoring this," Victoria hissed.

Sebastian's voice was low, dangerous. "I said enough."

"You don't understand—"

"I understand perfectly." His tone left no room for argument. "This ends now."

Victoria's hands clenched into fists. "You're making a mistake."

Lillian's pulse quickened. What the hell was going on?

Before she could retreat, Victoria's gaze snapped upward—locking onto her.

A slow, venomous smile curled the other woman's lips.

Oh no.

Sebastian turned, his eyes widening when he spotted Lillian.

Victoria's voice dripped with malice. "Looks like we have an audience."

The air crackled with tension.

Lillian swallowed hard.

Something told her this wasn't just a family squabble.

This was war.

Lillian's POV

"So, are you ever going to tell me what really happened between you and Donovan?" Beatrice's voice cut through the silence of my dorm room like a knife. I froze mid-step, the teacup in my hand trembling slightly.

The afternoon sunlight streamed through the half-open blinds, casting striped shadows across Beatrice's concerned face. She sat cross-legged on my bed, her fingers nervously twisting the edge of my floral duvet cover.

I set the cup down with deliberate care, watching the steam curl upward. "There's nothing to tell," I lied smoothly, turning to face the window where students milled about the quad below. "Ancient history."

Beatrice snorted. "Don't give me that. I saw the way you reacted when Evelyn walked into the dining hall with him yesterday." She threw a pillow at my back. "You nearly shattered your water glass."

A muscle in my jaw twitched. The memory flashed before me - Donovan's arm possessively around Evelyn's waist, her triumphant smirk as she'd deliberately brushed past my table. The scent of her cloying perfume still lingered in my nightmares.

"You know what's ironic?" I said suddenly, tracing the condensation on my windowpane. "All those years believing he was my fated mate, only to discover the Moon Goddess has a twisted sense of humor."

Beatrice's expression softened. She moved to stand beside me, our reflections ghostly in the glass. "You're better off without him, Lils. Anyone can see how Sebastian looks at you-"

"Don't." I cut her off sharply, then immediately regretted my tone. "Just... don't go there. Not now."

The silence stretched between us, filled with unspoken words and the distant laughter of students outside. My wolf stirred restlessly beneath my skin, agitated by the emotional turmoil.

Beatrice finally broke the quiet. "Fine. But you can't avoid this forever." She grabbed her bag from my desk chair. "I'm late for my shift at the coffee shop. Gabrielle will murder me if I'm late again."

As the door clicked shut behind her, I exhaled shakily and pressed my forehead against the cool glass. My phone buzzed in my pocket - another message from Donovan, no doubt. I'd been ignoring them for weeks.

Outside, dark clouds began rolling in, mirroring the storm brewing in my chest. Somewhere across campus, Sebastian would be finishing his meeting with Alpha Harrison. And Donovan... Donovan was probably whispering sweet lies into Evelyn's ear right now.

I clenched my fists, my nails biting into my palms. The truth was, Beatrice was right. I couldn't avoid this forever. But tonight... tonight I just wanted to pretend everything was normal. Just for a few more hours.

The first drops of rain hit the window as I reached for my abandoned teacup. The liquid had gone cold.
###Chapter 263

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s mansion. Her fingers tightened around the railing, the cold metal biting into her skin. The moon hung low in the sky, casting an eerie glow over the sprawling estate.

Inside, the grand hall buzzed with tension. Donovan’s voice cut through the murmurs, sharp and venomous. "You think you can just take what’s mine?" His gaze locked onto Lillian, a predator circling its prey.

Sebastian moved like a shadow, positioning himself between them. His voice was calm but carried an unmistakable warning. "She was never yours to claim."

Evelyn, Donovan’s new mate, scoffed from the sidelines. "Pathetic. Still clinging to scraps?"

Lillian’s wolf bristled beneath her skin. She had spent months rebuilding herself, but the past had a way of clawing its way back. Beatrice, ever the loyal friend, squeezed her hand. "Ignore them. They’re not worth it."

But the night wasn’t done with its surprises.

A sudden commotion erupted at the entrance. Victoria, Sebastian’s daughter, stormed in, her face flushed with fury. "Father! You can’t seriously expect me to—" She froze mid-sentence, her eyes landing on Lillian. A flicker of recognition, then something darker.

Theodore Whitmore, the ever-composed butler, cleared his throat. "Dinner is served."

Yet no one moved. The air was thick with unspoken threats, old wounds, and new rivalries.

Lillian exhaled slowly. This wasn’t just a dinner—it was a battlefield.

And she was ready to fight.

"Oh, I understand," she whispered, her fingers nervously twisting the hem of her sweatshirt. "That makes you quite extraordinary then."

"What about you?" I tilted my head. "Aren't you participating in the competition?"

Her gaze dropped to her faded college logo again, shoulders curling inward slightly as if trying to disappear into the fabric.

"No," she admitted quietly. "But I have to attend. My gamma expects me there."

"Oh?" My brows lifted in question.

She exhaled sharply before meeting my eyes, a flush creeping up her neck.

"We're... involved."

My lips parted in surprise.

"You're dating your pack's gamma?"

A jerky nod, teeth worrying her bottom lip. Beatrice scanned the boarding area with a frown.

"Then where is he?" she pressed.

"He left earlier with his friends," the girl murmured, fingers tightening around her backpack straps. "I got left behind. But I'm still going."

The overhead speaker crackled to life, announcing our boarding group. I glanced at Beatrice, who gave a sharp nod - she'd heard it too.

"We need to go," I said, rising. "Maybe we'll run into you there?"

A fragile smile flickered across her face.

"Maybe," she echoed softly.

With that, Beatrice and I moved toward the gate, handing our tickets to the stewardess before stepping onto the jet bridge.

"Next stop - island getaway!" Beatrice declared, dragging me forward with infectious enthusiasm.

Third Person POV

Back at the Blackwood estate, Victoria hesitated outside her brother's door.

The phone call with Donovan still burned in her ears. He'd been evasive, defensive. That woman at his penthouse - Lillian - was clearly more than just some random pack member. She wouldn't rest until she uncovered the truth. But her father's warning echoed in her mind. This wasn't just Lillian's deception. Donovan had lied too.

Perhaps his betrayal cut deeper.

She rapped sharply on Oliver's door. When silence answered, she pushed inside.

Her little brother sat cross-legged on his gaming chair, controller in hand, eyes glued to the screen. Typical.

"Hey," she called, stepping inside.

"What do you want?" he snapped without looking up.

The venom in his voice froze her mid-step. Since when did her baby brother speak to her like that?

“What’s with that tone?” Victoria demanded, crossing her arms tightly as she glared down at Oliver.

His fingers paused on the game controller, and he finally tore his gaze from the screen to meet hers with a defiant scowl. “I heard what you said to Lillian yesterday,” he muttered, his voice thick with accusation. “You were awful to her. You blamed her for my accident when it wasn’t her fault.”

“Because she shot you,” Victoria snapped, jabbing a finger toward his bandaged leg—already healing well, thankfully. “She was the one holding the bow.”

“No, it was my fault.” Oliver’s jaw clenched. “I moved in front of the target because I saw something on the ground. Lillian told me a hundred times not to shift position when someone’s shooting. She aims based on placement. I messed her up by moving. It was a stupid mistake.”

Victoria froze, stunned into silence. She had seen Oliver step out of position, but Lillian should’ve noticed before releasing the arrow.

“She wasn’t even aiming at me,” Oliver continued, his voice cracking. “She was showing me a trick shot. The arrow just happened to go where I moved.”

“A trick shot?” Victoria repeated, her brows knitting together.

“You don’t know anything about what Lillian can do,” Oliver shot back, his small hands curling into fists. “She’s an amazing archer—better than anyone I’ve ever seen. This wasn’t her fault. I tried to tell her last night, but everyone was yelling, and then Dad listened to you and made her leave. He Alpha-commanded her, Victoria. Because of you.”

Her stomach twisted.

“I—I didn’t—” she stammered.

A sharp knock interrupted them. Sebastian stepped inside, his sharp gaze flickering between them. “Everything alright in here?”

“The accident wasn’t Lillian’s fault,” Oliver repeated, his eyes shimmering with unshed tears. “I moved after she told me not to. If anyone should be blamed, it’s me. But please… don’t be mad at her anymore. I don’t want her to quit. I don’t want her to leave.”

A pang of guilt speared through Victoria’s chest. What have I done? All of this—the accusations, the anger—just for Donovan? Was he even worth it?

Sebastian rested a hand on Oliver’s shoulder. “Thank you for telling me.”

“Dad… you’re not going to fire her, right?” Oliver’s voice wavered.

Sebastian shook his head. “No. I’ve been trying to reach her, but her phone’s off. I’ll have to talk to her when I get back.” He straightened. “Actually, I came to tell you both I’m leaving now. I’ll be gone for a few weeks.”

“Are you going straight to the Gamma competition?”

“Not yet. It doesn’t start for a couple of days. I’m heading to the resort first—might meet some competitors for dinner tonight.” His gaze hardened slightly. “Behave while I’m gone. Both of you. Call if you need anything. Marcus will be here if you do.”

“Okay…” they mumbled in unison.

Sebastian left, and Victoria turned back to Oliver, who was still blinking back tears.

In that moment, she knew—she’d messed up. Badly.

###Chapter 264

The night air was thick with tension as Lillian stood frozen in the dimly lit hallway of the Blackwood estate. Her heart pounded erratically against her ribs, each beat echoing like a drum in her ears. She had come here seeking answers, but the sight before her made her blood run cold.

Sebastian Blackwood, the formidable Lycan chairman, stood mere inches away from Evelyn, Donovan’s new mate. His towering frame cast a long shadow over her, his expression unreadable. Lillian’s breath hitched as she watched Evelyn’s fingers trail along the lapel of Sebastian’s tailored suit—a gesture too intimate to be mistaken for anything but deliberate.

What the hell is going on?

Her wolf stirred restlessly inside her, a low growl vibrating in her chest. She had trusted Sebastian, had even begun to let herself believe in the fragile bond forming between them. But this—this felt like betrayal.

Before she could retreat, Sebastian’s sharp gaze flickered toward her, his golden eyes locking onto hers with predatory precision. A flicker of something unreadable crossed his face before his lips curled into a smirk.

"Lillian," he drawled, his voice dripping with amusement. "I didn’t expect you to join us."

Evelyn turned, her lips parting in surprise before a sly smile curved her mouth. "Oh, Lillian. How… unfortunate that you had to see this."

Lillian’s nails dug into her palms, her pulse roaring in her ears. She wanted to scream, to demand an explanation, but the words lodged in her throat. Instead, she forced herself to lift her chin, meeting Sebastian’s gaze with defiance.

"Don’t bother explaining," she said, her voice steady despite the storm raging inside her. "I know exactly what this is."

Sebastian’s smirk deepened, but there was something darker lurking beneath—something that made her stomach twist. "Do you?"

Before she could respond, the sound of hurried footsteps echoed down the hall. Beatrice appeared, her face pale, her eyes wide with urgency. "Lillian! You need to come—now."

Lillian hesitated, torn between confronting Sebastian and whatever crisis Beatrice had stumbled upon.

Sebastian’s gaze never wavered. "Run along, little wolf. Duty calls."

The dismissal stung, but Lillian refused to let him see it. With one last searing glare, she turned on her heel and followed Beatrice, her mind racing with unanswered questions.

As they rounded the corner, Beatrice grabbed her arm, her grip tight. "It’s Oliver," she whispered, her voice trembling. "He’s gone."

Lillian’s blood turned to ice. Gone?

The game had just changed. And she had no idea who to trust anymore.

Third Person POV

"So, I gather intel on Alpha Sebastian's business?" Donovan asked, seated at a polished mahogany table in an upscale restaurant several territories away from his own pack. Strangers—each with their own covert assignments—occupied the remaining chairs. Dressed in tailored suits and sharp blazers, they exuded authority. Donovan blended in seamlessly.

At the head of the table sat Alpha Maximilian Voss, the mastermind behind this operation.

"What exactly am I supposed to uncover?" Donovan scanned the faces around him.

"Everything," Maximilian answered coolly. "To dismantle his empire, I need to understand its inner workings. You're already inside—engaged to his daughter, welcomed into his home. Dig up personal records, financial dealings, anything. All of it is valuable."

Donovan gave a stiff nod.

"Yes, Alpha," he murmured, bowing his head as the Lycan's dominance pressed against his will.

"And what about the girl?" A woman at the table—Donovan couldn’t recall her name—spoke up. "You mentioned she’s competing in the Gamma trials?"

He knew she meant Lillian. Lillian had been a topic of discussion before, and Maximilian was well aware of her past entanglement with Sebastian.

"I already have eyes on her there," Maximilian replied smoothly. "And I’ll be attending myself tomorrow. Sebastian will be present as well, which gives you the perfect window to gather more intel over the next few weeks. Can I trust you to deliver?"

His piercing gaze locked onto Donovan, demanding obedience.

"Yes, Alpha," Donovan repeated, voice steady.

Maximilian gave a curt nod before addressing the rest.

"You know your roles. Dismissed."

Chairs scraped back as the operatives collected their belongings and filed out. Donovan raked a hand through his hair, turning to leave—but Maximilian’s voice halted him at the threshold.

"Donovan."

He froze.

"Don’t disappoint me. The consequences won’t be pleasant."

A shudder ran down Donovan’s spine. He exhaled sharply before stepping out into the night.

The drive back to the Blackwood estate took over an hour. Victoria called midway, asking if he was coming. He lied smoothly—of course he was. Guilt gnawed at him for not visiting her in the hospital, but between Alpha Maximilian’s demands and endless meetings, he hadn’t had a moment to spare.

When he arrived, Sebastian was already gone—a relief. Keeping his secrets intact around the Lycan was nearly impossible. One slip, and Maximilian would make good on his threats.

He expected Victoria to rush into his arms as usual, but instead, she stood stiffly in the parlor, arms wrapped tightly around herself. Her eyes were red-rimmed.

"What’s wrong?" Donovan stepped closer.

"I went to your place yesterday," she said, catching him off guard. He hadn’t seen her at all—barely caught her scent when he returned at dawn.

"And?" He feigned indifference.

"There was a woman there," Victoria whispered, her voice breaking. "Standing at your door."

His pulse spiked. He’d been reckless lately. While he’d been careful these past few weeks, he’d never officially ended things with his flings. Most were paid companions who understood the arrangement—but one hadn’t.

Scarlett.

She looked too much like Lillian, moved like her, even sounded like her in the dark. He’d indulged too many times, and she’d mistaken it for something more. His biggest mistake? Inviting her to his home. They’d spent the night tangled in sheets, but he’d ghosted her afterward, hoping she’d take the hint.

Now, she’d come looking for him.

And Victoria had seen her.
###Chapter 265

The night air carried a crisp chill as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood's penthouse suite. Below her, the city lights twinkled like scattered stars against the velvet sky. She wrapped her arms around herself, the silk of her emerald gown whispering against her skin.

Inside, the celebration continued without her. The clinking of champagne glasses and laughter floated through the open French doors. They were celebrating Donovan's engagement to Victoria - the very thought made Lillian's stomach twist.

A shadow moved beside her. "Escaping the festivities?" Sebastian's deep voice rumbled close to her ear. His cologne - something expensive with notes of sandalwood and spice - wrapped around her like an embrace.

Lillian didn't turn. "Just needed air." Her fingers tightened on the railing. "You should be inside with your guests."

Sebastian leaned against the balcony beside her, his tailored suit stretching across broad shoulders. Moonlight caught the silver streaks in his dark hair. "I'd rather be out here with you."

The simple statement sent warmth flooding through her veins. Dangerous warmth.

From inside, a burst of laughter caught their attention. Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, they saw Donovan twirl Evelyn across the dance floor, her champagne-colored dress flaring. Victoria watched them with a tight smile, her fingers white around her glass.

"Your daughter doesn't look pleased," Lillian observed.

Sebastian's jaw tightened. "She'll learn. In our world, alliances matter more than affection."

The bitterness in his voice surprised her. She turned to study his profile - the strong nose, the stubborn set of his jaw. This close, she could see the faint scar running along his temple, a souvenir from some long-ago battle.

"You don't approve of the match," she realized.

His dark eyes met hers, unreadable. "I approve of what keeps my pack safe." A beat. "Even if it costs my daughter's happiness."

The raw honesty in his words stole her breath. In that moment, she saw past the Lycan chairman to the man beneath - one who carried his responsibilities like chains.

Music swelled inside, a waltz. Without thinking, Lillian held out her hand. "Dance with me."

Sebastian stilled. "Out here?"

"Right here." She stepped closer, the scent of him filling her senses. "Unless the great Sebastian Blackwood is afraid of scandal."

A slow smile curved his lips. He took her hand, his palm warm against hers. "When it comes to you, Lillian, I stopped caring about scandal weeks ago."

As he pulled her into his arms, the city lights blurred around them. There, under the watchful moon, they moved together - two souls caught in a dance more dangerous than either would admit.

And inside, unnoticed by the revelers, Victoria's gaze found them through the glass. Her champagne flute shattered against the marble floor.

The music played on.

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, illuminating the scattered papers on his desk. Lillian stirred in the massive bed, her body still humming from the intensity of last night. She stretched lazily, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her.

Sebastian was already gone.

A faint scent of his cologne lingered in the air—spicy, intoxicating, and undeniably his. Lillian inhaled deeply, her wolf purring in satisfaction. Then reality crashed back in.

Donovan.

Her stomach twisted. The rogue ex-mate who had betrayed her, who had chosen Evelyn over her, was still out there. And now, with the alliance between the Blackwood and Whitmore packs in jeopardy, she couldn’t afford to be distracted.

The door creaked open, and Oliver bounded in, his dark curls bouncing. "Lillian! You’re finally awake!"

She forced a smile. "Morning, little wolf. Where’s your dad?"

Oliver plopped onto the bed, swinging his legs. "Meeting with Marcus. Something about war." His voice dropped to a whisper, eyes wide.

Lillian’s pulse spiked. War?

Before she could press further, Beatrice burst into the room, her phone clutched in a death grip. "Lillian, you need to see this."

The screen displayed a news headline:

"LYCAN COUNCIL DEMANDS BLACKWOOD’S SURRENDER—OR FACE ANNIHILATION."

Lillian’s blood ran cold.

Sebastian had been keeping things from her. Again.

She threw off the covers, her bare feet hitting the cold marble floor. "Where is he?"

Beatrice hesitated. "The council hall. But Lillian—"

She didn’t wait for the rest.

Dressed in nothing but Sebastian’s discarded shirt, Lillian stormed out, her wolf snarling beneath her skin.

This time, she wouldn’t be left in the dark.

This time, she would fight.

Donovan had been faithful to Victoria for weeks, but the suspicion in her piercing blue eyes told him she wasn’t convinced. It had to be Lillian who showed up unannounced at his doorstep. No one else would dare—no one else even knew where he lived. Only her.

"Did she say anything to you?" Donovan asked, his voice thick with forced calm.

Victoria shook her head, tucking a loose strand of platinum-blonde hair behind her ear. "No. But she looked devastated. Like she'd been crying."

A breath escaped him, relief flickering in his chest before he could smother it. As long as Lillian hadn’t spilled anything, he could still salvage this.

"Must’ve been the wrong house," he lied smoothly, his confidence returning. "I wasn’t expecting visitors yesterday."

Victoria studied him, her lips pressed into a thin line, suspicion darkening her gaze. "Are you sure about that?" she challenged. "Because she looked exactly like Lillian."

Donovan stiffened. How much had she pieced together?

"What are you implying?" he snapped, too quickly.

"I’m saying it’s not a coincidence—"

"Lillian’s face is forgettable," he scoffed, waving a dismissive hand. "I could point out a dozen girls who resemble her. She’s nothing special."

"Then why was she at your house, Donovan?" Victoria stepped closer, her voice trembling. Tears welled in her eyes, and for a fleeting second, guilt twisted in his gut. Under different circumstances, he might’ve confessed. But not now. Not when he had everything to lose.

He was a spy first, a liar second, and a fiancé last.

"I don’t know," he murmured, gripping her shoulders, his thumbs brushing soothing circles. "I’ve been swamped with pack duties. Barely home these past weeks. If someone stopped by, I wouldn’t have known." He forced a weary sigh. "You know how it is—my family’s holding the pack together until a new Alpha’s chosen. People come begging for favors. Maybe that’s why she came. But I didn’t invite her."

Victoria searched his face, her teeth worrying her lower lip.

"I just... have this awful feeling," she whispered.

Donovan pressed his lips to her forehead, then pulled back to cradle her face. Tears streaked her flushed cheeks.

"I promise you, Victoria. I’m not cheating. There’s nothing going on." He thumbed away a tear. "I love you. Why would I propose if I didn’t?"

After a tense silence, she gave a small nod.

"Okay," she relented.

He smiled, sealing the lie with a kiss—soft, lingering, just enough to make her melt against him.

"Your father’s not home, is he?" he murmured against her lips, smirking.

She shook her head.

Donovan didn’t hesitate. He swept her into his arms, carrying her toward the staircase, his mind already racing ahead—how long until Lillian became a problem he couldn’t ignore?

But for now, Victoria believed him.

And that was enough.

"Of course, I'll join you shortly. Just need to make a quick call first," Victoria murmured, forcing a smile.

Donovan gave a curt nod before disappearing up the grand staircase toward her chambers. The moment his polished shoes vanished from view, her shoulders slumped. A heavy exhale escaped her lips as she pressed trembling fingers to her temples.

She wanted—desperately—to believe Donovan's honeyed words. To trust him like she had during their first moonlit stroll through the rose gardens. But the past months had sharpened her instincts to razor precision. She'd cataloged every micro-expression, every barely-there twitch that betrayed his lies. The subtle flare of his nostrils. That infuriatingly patronizing eyebrow lift. Both had appeared when he'd denied knowing the mystery woman.

The realization settled like ice in her veins. He was lying. Again.

Victoria swept into the marble foyer where Theodore sat ensconced in a wingback chair, his spectacles glinting as he turned a page of some leather-bound tome. At her approach, he glanced up, one silvered brow arching in silent inquiry.

"I require absolute discretion," she stated without preamble, her voice low and urgent.

Her phone screen illuminated with the damning photograph—the stranger's license plate captured in crisp detail during her hasty retreat from Donovan's estate. She'd held onto it like a live grenade, praying he'd come clean. Foolish hope. With a decisive tap, she sent the image to Theodore's device. A soft chime echoed through the cavernous hall.

The butler retrieved his phone, his frown deepening as he studied the picture. "Whose vehicle is this?"

"That's precisely what I need you to uncover." She leaned in, the scent of his bergamot cologne mingling with the faintest trace of old books. "Your technical prowess is unmatched, Theodore. Can you trace this registration?"

A beat of silence. Then a slow, deliberate nod.

"Naturally, Miss Blackwood."

"Excellent." She straightened, smoothing nonexistent wrinkles from her silk blouse. "Report your findings directly to me. Immediately."

Without waiting for a response, Victoria turned on her heel, her stilettos clicking a staccato rhythm against the marble as she ascended toward the lion's den—and the man who thought her blind to his deceit.

The scent of pine and damp earth filled Lillian's senses as she sprinted through the moonlit forest, her bare feet pounding against the soft forest floor. Behind her, Donovan's enraged snarls echoed through the trees, growing closer with each passing second.

"Lillian! Stop running!" His voice was laced with desperation and fury, the sound making her blood run cold. She could feel the bond between them straining, the remnants of their broken mate connection pulsing painfully in her chest.

She wouldn't stop. Couldn't stop. Not when Sebastian's life depended on her reaching him first.

A branch snapped to her left. Lillian barely had time to react before Evelyn lunged from the shadows, her claws extended. The impact sent them both tumbling to the ground in a tangle of limbs and snarls.

"You stupid little bitch," Evelyn hissed, her golden eyes glowing with malice. "Did you really think you could escape us?"

Lillian twisted beneath her, using her smaller frame to slip free. She rolled to her feet just as Donovan emerged from the trees, his massive form blocking her path. His chest heaved with exertion, his normally perfect hair disheveled from the chase.

"Enough games," he growled, advancing toward her. "You're coming with us. Sebastian will pay for what he's done."

Lillian's heart pounded against her ribs. She could see the madness in Donovan's eyes - the same madness that had made her reject their bond in the first place. Behind him, Evelyn circled like a predator, cutting off any chance of escape.

Then she heard it - the faintest rustle of leaves from above. A shadow detached itself from the canopy, landing silently between her and Donovan.

Sebastian.

His presence filled the clearing, his power radiating outward in palpable waves. Lillian had never seen him like this - his usual controlled demeanor replaced by something primal and dangerous.

"Touch her again," he said, his voice deadly quiet, "and I'll tear you both apart."

Donovan bared his teeth in a feral grin. "This ends tonight, Blackwood."

The air crackled with tension as the three werewolves faced off beneath the silver moonlight. Lillian could feel the shift coming, the moment when words would give way to violence.

And then the forest exploded into motion.

###Chapter 266

Lillian's POV

"Ow, Lillian!" Beatrice yelped. "You're crushing my arm!"

My nails dug so deep into her skin that tiny beads of blood surfaced. My heart hammered violently against my ribs, and my ears throbbed as if they might burst. Squeezing my eyes shut, I clung to her like a lifeline while she struggled to pry my fingers loose.

"Seriously, let go!" she hissed through gritted teeth.

Finally, I released her and gripped the armrests instead, my knuckles turning white. Rubbing her sore arm, Beatrice muttered under her breath, "Training to be a gamma, yet you’re terrified of a little turbulence."

She wasn’t wrong. Flying petrified me. Wolves weren’t meant to be suspended thousands of feet in the air—we belonged on solid ground. What if the engines failed? What if we plummeted into the ocean in a fiery wreck? This was a risk I never wanted to take, yet here I was, strapped into a metal death trap, hurtling toward some tropical destination.

Beatrice, however, seemed utterly unfazed. She pressed her face against the window, marveling at the cottony clouds drifting past. "You’re missing the most breathtaking view," she murmured, her voice filled with awe.

Reluctantly, I cracked my eyes open. The plane had finally steadied, and the pressure in my ears eased slightly. Beatrice’s radiant smile caught me off guard—after everything we’d endured these past few days, I hadn’t expected to see joy light up her face again. Maybe this nightmare flight was worth it after all.

"How much longer?" I croaked, refusing to glance outside.

"We just took off," she laughed. "Relax. Breathe."

"Relax? We’re dangling in the sky like a bird’s chew toy!"

She shrugged. "No other way to get there unless you fancy swimming across three oceans." A teasing smirk played on her lips. "Besides, you’re the one who insisted on this competition."

The sudden appearance of the stewardess made me jump. "Anything to drink, ladies?"

"Water, please," I rasped. She handed me a bottle before turning to Beatrice.

"Coffee would be perfect," Beatrice said.

"We just had coffee," I reminded her.

She shrugged again. "It’s a long flight. I need to stay awake."

The stewardess poured her a cup, adding sweeteners and creamer before moving down the aisle. I gulped my water, willing my pulse to slow.

"You’ll survive, Lillian," Beatrice said, nudging me. "Just pretend you’re on a really fast train."

I exhaled sharply, gripping the armrests tighter. "Trains don’t fall out of the sky."

She rolled her eyes but grinned. "Yet."

"Have you talked to Lucien?" I asked, desperate to distract myself from the fact we were cruising at thirty thousand feet.

Beatrice's face drained of color at my question.

"No," she whispered, fingers tightening around her armrest. "I've been glued to your side since yesterday. When exactly would I have spoken to him?"

I shrugged, taking a slow sip of my sparkling water.

"He's got your number. Didn't know if he'd reached out," I said casually, though my pulse kicked up a notch.

"Excuse me?!" Beatrice's head snapped toward me, her golden eyes blazing. "Why in the goddess's name does he have my number?!"

I squirmed under her glare, the airplane seat suddenly feeling like a torture device.

"I... might have given it to him..."

"Lillian!" Her shriek made several passengers turn their heads. "Have you lost your damn mind?!"

"Because he was worried!" I blurted out. "When I mentioned you were coming with me—"

"You told him where I was going?!" Her voice dropped to a horrified whisper. "That's a massive breach of trust!"

"Lucien's my friend, Bea..."

"And I'm supposed to be your best friend. Your ride-or-die." A single tear tracked down her cheek. "I thought you were on my side."

"I am on your side!" I grabbed her trembling hands. "Always. Which is exactly why I gave your fated mate your digits. You'll thank me when I'm catching your bouquet at your wedding."

Beatrice yanked her hands away, crossing her arms like armor. "What makes you so certain there'll be a wedding? The man's bedpost has more notches than a lumberjack's axe."

"He hasn't so much as glanced at another woman in weeks. Not even Giselle—and gods know I thought those two were endgame." The moment the words left my mouth, I wanted to claw them back. Beatrice went sheet-white, her lower lip quivering.

I reached for her, but she flinched away. "I'm sorry, that was insensitive. I know how sacred the mate bond is... but Bea, Lucien isn't Donovan. If you'd just give him a chance—"

"I'll wind up exactly like you."

The words hit like a silver dagger to the gut. My breath stuttered, the cabin air suddenly too thin.

"What?" My voice came out strangled.

"Donovan cheated. Shattered your bond. Left you bleeding out emotionally every time he touches that witch." Beatrice's tears fell freely now. "I can't watch it destroy you day after day... why would you wish that hell on me?"

The overhead lights flickered as turbulence rocked the plane, but the real storm was raging between us. My wolf whimpered in my chest, mirroring the fresh ache spreading through me. Beatrice had just voiced my deepest fear—that I'd never be whole again.

And in that moment, thirty thousand feet above the Atlantic, I realized something terrifying: maybe my best friend was right to be afraid.
###Chapter 267

The night air was thick with tension as Lillian stood frozen in the dimly lit hallway of the Blackwood estate. Her heart pounded against her ribs, each beat echoing like a drum in her ears. She had overheard something she wasn’t supposed to—something that could change everything.

Footsteps approached, deliberate and heavy. She recognized them instantly—Sebastian Blackwood, the Lycan chairman, her fated mate. But tonight, his presence didn’t bring comfort. Instead, it sent a shiver down her spine.

Had he known all along?

She pressed herself against the wall, willing herself to disappear into the shadows. The conversation she had just overheard replayed in her mind like a broken record.

"The alliance with the Winslows is non-negotiable," Sebastian had said, his voice cold and unyielding. "Lillian will understand."

Understand what? That he was still entangled with the Winslows? That his engagement to Victoria—his own daughter—was more than just a political farce?

Her fingers curled into fists, nails biting into her palms. She had trusted him. Loved him. And now, it felt like the ground beneath her was crumbling.

A door creaked open nearby, and she held her breath.

"Lillian?"

Sebastian’s voice was soft, almost hesitant. It was the tone he used when he knew she was upset. But this time, it only fueled her anger.

She stepped out of the shadows, meeting his gaze head-on. His silver eyes, usually so warm when they looked at her, were now guarded.

"We need to talk," she said, her voice steady despite the storm raging inside her.

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "I know what you heard."

"Do you?" She crossed her arms, her wolf bristling beneath her skin. "Then explain to me why you’re still negotiating with the Winslows behind my back. Explain why you lied to me."

His expression darkened. "It’s not that simple."

"Then make it simple."

For a moment, silence stretched between them, heavy and suffocating. Then, Sebastian exhaled sharply.

"Fine. You want the truth? The Winslows have leverage. Something that could destroy us both."

Lillian’s breath hitched. "What kind of leverage?"

Sebastian hesitated, his gaze flickering toward the closed door behind him. When he spoke again, his voice was barely above a whisper.

"They know about Matt."

The words hit her like a physical blow. Matt—Sebastian’s seven-year-old son, the boy she had come to love as her own.

Her voice trembled. "What about him?"

Sebastian’s eyes burned with a mixture of fury and fear. "They’ve threatened to expose his true lineage. If that happens, he’ll never be safe."

Lillian’s blood ran cold. The Winslows weren’t just playing games—they were targeting an innocent child.

Her wolf snarled, demanding action. "Then we protect him. Together."

Sebastian’s expression softened, but only for a second. "There’s more. They’ve demanded a public reaffirmation of my engagement to Victoria. If I refuse, they’ll act."

Lillian’s stomach twisted. A public display would humiliate her, undermine her position as his mate. But worse—it would put Matt in danger.

She swallowed hard, forcing down the lump in her throat. "What do we do?"

Sebastian reached for her, his fingers brushing against hers. "We play their game. For now."

She pulled her hand away. "And then?"

His lips curved into a dangerous smile. "Then we destroy them."

The promise in his voice sent a thrill through her. This wasn’t over. Not even close.

But as she turned to leave, a new thought struck her—one that sent a fresh wave of dread through her veins.

What if the Winslows weren’t the real threat?

The hallway seemed to stretch endlessly before her, shadows whispering secrets she wasn’t ready to hear.

And somewhere in the darkness, unseen eyes watched. Waiting.

I wanted to reassure Beatrice that it wouldn’t happen to her, but the words died in my throat. How could I promise something I couldn’t control? She was right—she could end up just like me, and I had been selfish to drag her into this mess. But her words still stung, sharp as a blade. I clenched my jaw and turned away, staring at my water bottle like it held all the secrets of the universe.

She sighed and leaned against the window, her reflection blurred against the glass. The tension between us was thick enough to choke on. I didn’t want to spend this flight fighting with my best friend, but the tears burning behind my eyelids made it impossible to look at her without crumbling.

Eventually, exhaustion pulled me under. I only woke when the pressure in my ears spiked, signaling our descent. My fingers dug into the armrests as the plane dipped sharply, my stomach lurching. The moment the wheels touched down, I exhaled in relief.

The seatbelt light flicked off, and passengers shuffled into the aisle. Stepping onto solid ground felt like a miracle. Beatrice and I hadn’t spoken since our argument, and even now, the silence between us was heavy. She moved like a ghost beside me, lost in thought—just as I was.

We collected our luggage and headed for the exit. I braced myself for the heat, but nothing could’ve prepared me for the wall of scorching air that hit us the second we stepped outside. It stole my breath, leaving me gasping.

Beatrice, however, looked perfectly at ease. Summer was her season.

“What now?” she asked, scanning the bustling streets.

I pulled out my phone, pulling up the email from Alpha Maximilian Voss. “Resort’s a few miles from here. We’ll grab a cab.”

She smirked. “Leave it to me.” With effortless confidence, she strode to the curb, lifted a hand, and—like magic—a cab screeched to a halt in front of her. She shot me a grin over her shoulder. “City girl skills.”

I laughed, hauling my bags toward the cab. The driver hopped out to help, popping the trunk. Just as I was about to climb in, a flash of familiar blonde hair caught my eye.

Rosalind sat slumped on her suitcase, staring at her phone with red-rimmed eyes.

“Rosalind?” I called.

She startled, forcing a weak smile. “Oh—hi.”

“Everything okay?” I motioned for the driver to wait and hurried over. Beatrice stayed with our things, guarding the cab.

Rosalind sighed. “My boyfriend was supposed to pick me up, but he bailed last minute.”

“Need a ride?”

Her eyes widened. “Seriously?”


I gave a quick nod.

“I’m assuming he’s at the resort, right?” I asked. “You can ride with us. We’re heading there now.”

Her face lit up with relief.

“Yes, that would be perfect. Thank you!” she exhaled, her fingers tightening around the strap of her bag.

I helped her gather her things, and once the cab was packed with our belongings, we all climbed in. Beatrice, being the smallest among us, settled into the middle seat.

I relayed the address to the driver, who punched it into the GPS. Just as the car pulled away from the curb, something flickered at the edge of my vision. A swarm of paparazzi had encircled someone—though from this distance, I couldn’t make out who it was. Camera flashes erupted like fireworks, and shouted questions buzzed through the air. I craned my neck, trying to catch a glimpse, but the crowd was too thick, and we were already too far.

“Wonder what all that commotion’s about,” Beatrice murmured, following my line of sight.

I shrugged.

“Who knows,” I muttered. “Probably some entitled celebrity.”

She snorted in agreement, and the rest of the twenty-minute ride passed in comfortable silence—until the cab pulled up to the most breathtaking resort I’d ever laid eyes on.

###Chapter 268

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, painting the room in warm hues. Lillian stretched lazily beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming from the previous night’s passion. The scent of Sebastian—dark, intoxicating, and undeniably alpha—lingered on her skin, a reminder of the claim he had reaffirmed with possessive fervor.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Miss Lillian?" Giselle Beaumont’s voice filtered through the door. "Breakfast is ready whenever you are."

Lillian smiled. "Thank you, Giselle. I’ll be down shortly."

She slipped out of bed, her bare feet sinking into the plush carpet as she padded toward the ensuite bathroom. The reflection in the mirror showed a woman glowing with satisfaction, her lips slightly swollen, her neck adorned with faint marks. A flush crept up her cheeks at the memory of Sebastian’s hands on her, his whispered promises against her skin.

After a quick shower, she dressed in a simple yet elegant sundress—one of the many pieces Sebastian had insisted on adding to her wardrobe. The man had an uncanny ability to blend dominance with indulgence, ensuring she lacked for nothing.

Downstairs, the dining room was bathed in sunlight, the table set with an array of pastries, fresh fruit, and steaming coffee. Sebastian sat at the head, impeccably dressed in a tailored suit, his dark eyes lifting the moment she entered.

"Good morning, little wolf," he murmured, his voice rough with unspoken desire.

Lillian’s pulse quickened. "Morning."

He gestured to the seat beside him, and she took it, her fingers brushing his as she reached for her coffee. The contact sent a jolt of electricity through her, and Sebastian’s lips curved in a knowing smirk.

"Sleep well?" he asked, though the glint in his eyes said he already knew the answer.

She took a sip of coffee to hide her smile. "Like a dream."

Before he could respond, his phone buzzed. A frown flickered across his face as he read the message.

"What is it?" Lillian asked.

"Trouble," he said simply, setting the phone down. "Alpha Harrison is making moves again. He’s been spotted near pack borders."

Lillian’s grip tightened around her cup. Harrison had been a thorn in their side for months, his obsession with her bordering on dangerous.

Sebastian’s expression darkened. "I won’t let him near you."

She believed him. But as she glanced out the window, a shadow of unease settled over her.

Because trouble never came alone.

And this time, it wasn’t just Harrison they had to worry about.

Sebastian's POV

"Alpha Sebastian, any thoughts on this year's Gamma competitors? Do you have a favorite?"

"Has anyone from your pack made the cut?"

"Are you sponsoring any part of the competition this year?"

"Alpha Sebastian, over here!"

The relentless flashes of the paparazzi cameras nearly blinded me, but I kept my expression unreadable, my gaze steady as I scanned the crowd. I wasn’t about to indulge their questions—not now, not when I’d just stepped off the plane and exhaustion weighed heavily on my shoulders. All I wanted was to retreat to my suite and unwind. I hadn’t even glanced at the list of Gamma competitors sent to me.

"Give the Lycan Chairman some space," Julian, my head Gamma and a former champion of the competition himself, commanded, shoving the reporters aside to clear a path for me.

A sleek black car idled by the curb, and I wasted no time slipping inside, eager to leave the chaos of the airport behind. My wolf stirred restlessly, impatient to reach the resort. I chalked it up to fatigue—and the looming inevitability of dealing with Maximilian Voss. He’d be arriving soon enough.

As the car pulled away, the noise of the paparazzi faded into the distance. I exhaled sharply, loosening my tie, which felt more like a noose than an accessory.

"The competitors are hosting a meet-and-greet dinner tonight," Julian mentioned, glancing at me through the rearview mirror. "Alpha Maximilian will be there. Should I RSVP on your behalf?"

I shot him a look that should have been answer enough. He visibly shrank in his seat.

"No," I muttered. "The last thing I need tonight is to deal with Maximilian. I’ll meet the competitors tomorrow."

"Have you at least looked over the competitor list?" Julian pressed.

"No."

He sighed but wisely dropped the subject.

Lillian's POV

"Holy hell," Beatrice gasped as our cab approached the resort. "This place makes Carter’s Resort look like a motel."

I’d never seen palm trees before, but here they towered everywhere, their fronds swaying like elegant parasols, casting dappled shadows over the pristine grounds. The pathways were paved with smooth cobblestones, gleaming under the sunlight, while the air carried the faint, salty tang of the ocean. Crowds of people streamed through the grand glass doors of the lobby, dragging luggage behind them.

I craned my neck to take in the sheer scale of the resort—endless floors of floor-to-ceiling windows, some veiled by sheer curtains, others left open to the view. According to the map, the ocean sprawled just beyond the far side of the building, though we couldn’t see it from here.

"This is insane," Beatrice murmured, her eyes wide as she took in the opulence around us.

"I’m going to find my boyfriend," Rosalind said with a small smile. "Thanks for letting me ride with you."

"Of course," I replied, returning her smile. "Hope to see you around."

With a wave, she disappeared into the crowd. I nudged Beatrice, and together we grabbed our suitcases, tipped the cab driver generously, and stepped inside.

The lobby was even more breathtaking up close. Rose-gold marble floors stretched beneath our feet, matching the towering pillars that framed the space. A grand fountain bubbled at the center, surrounded by a whirl of people. Shops lined the perimeter, their displays glittering under the soft lighting. Spiral staircases curled upward on either side, flanked by glass elevators that ascended to each floor. Balconies overlooked the lobby from every level, offering glimpses of the resort’s sprawling interior—and beyond, the endless ocean view.

Beatrice whistled low under her breath. "We are not in Kansas anymore."

I couldn’t help but grin. "No. No, we are not."
###Chapter 269

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, painting the marble floors in warm hues. Lillian stretched lazily in the oversized bed, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her. Sebastian had already left for an early meeting, leaving only the faint scent of his cologne lingering on the silk sheets.

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, pulling the duvet higher.

The door creaked open, revealing Beatrice, her best friend, balancing a tray of breakfast in one hand and a stack of glossy magazines in the other. "Morning, sleepyhead. Thought you might need some fuel before the big day."

Lillian groaned, rubbing her eyes. "Ugh, don’t remind me. The press conference is in three hours, and I still don’t know what to wear."

Beatrice plopped onto the bed, flipping open the top magazine. "Relax. You’re the Luna of the most powerful pack in the country. You could show up in pajamas, and they’d still call it ‘effortlessly chic.’"

Lillian snorted, grabbing a croissant from the tray. "Tell that to the fashion critics. Last time, they said my dress made me look like I ‘borrowed it from my grandmother’s closet.’"

Beatrice rolled her eyes. "Ignore them. Besides, today isn’t about fashion. It’s about announcing the new alliance with the Blackwood Pack. Everyone’s going to be too busy gawking at Sebastian to notice what you’re wearing."

Lillian’s stomach twisted at the mention of the alliance. The Blackwood Pack had been rivals for decades, and now, they were merging under Sebastian’s leadership. The press would have a field day.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A text from Donovan.

"Heard about the press conference. Don’t forget who you really belong to."

Her fingers tightened around the phone. Even now, after everything, he couldn’t let go.

Beatrice frowned. "What’s wrong?"

Lillian forced a smile. "Nothing. Just spam." She tossed the phone aside. "Help me pick an outfit before I change my mind and hide under the covers forever."

Beatrice grinned, flipping through the magazines. "Oh, I have the perfect dress. It’s red—bold, powerful, and guaranteed to make Sebastian’s jaw drop."

Lillian laughed, some of the tension easing from her shoulders. "Fine. But if the critics compare me to a stop sign, I’m blaming you."

As Beatrice rummaged through the closet, Lillian’s gaze drifted to the window. The city sprawled below, alive and bustling. Today would change everything.

And she wasn’t sure if she was ready.

The line at the reception desk snaked across the lobby, packed with guests checking in.

"We're going to be stuck here for ages," Beatrice groaned, shifting her weight impatiently.

I checked the time—only 1 PM.

"We have plenty of time," I reassured her. "The welcome dinner doesn't start until six."

According to the itinerary Alpha Maximilian had sent me, tonight's event was a competitors' dinner, a chance to meet the other participants and judges. My stomach twisted at the thought. Who would I be facing?

Surprisingly, the line moved faster than expected. Within twenty minutes, we reached the front. A resort employee—Felicity, according to her name tag—waved us forward.

"Checking in?" she asked with a polite smile.

"Yes, under Lillian Dumont," I answered.

She typed something into the system, then glanced up. "Ah, you're here for the Gamma competition?"

I nodded. It shouldn’t have surprised me that this was a shifter-owned resort. The air was thick with dominance, and nearly everyone wore Gamma-branded gear. Intimidating, to say the least.

Felicity continued typing before pausing abruptly. Her gaze flicked between me and Beatrice. "The reservation is for one. Is she staying with you?"

Heat rushed to my cheeks. I hadn’t thought to inform the hotel—or Alpha Maximilian—that Beatrice was coming. Stupid oversight.

"Uh, yes. She can share my bed," I said quickly, hoping that would suffice.

Felicity hesitated, clearly debating whether to allow it.

Then a familiar presence materialized beside me, sending a shiver down my spine. I turned to see a towering figure—one I'd only glimpsed before.

"How about we upgrade her room instead?" Benedict Grayson, Alpha Maximilian’s Beta, suggested, his sharp gaze assessing us.

Felicity stiffened. "I'm afraid we're fully booked..."

"It's really not necessary—" I began.

Benedict cut me off, pulling out his phone with deliberate slowness. "Then I suppose I’ll have to inform Alpha Maximilian that his guests are being inconvenienced."

Felicity paled. "That won’t be needed! We do have one suite available—a queen’s suite on the top floor. Two beds, a half kitchen."

"Perfect," Benedict said, tucking his phone away.

"You really didn’t have to go through all this trouble," I protested.

"Nonsense," Benedict countered, his tone leaving no room for argument. "You’re our guest. Enjoy your stay, Lillian Dumont."

With that abrupt dismissal, he pivoted on his heel and strode away without another word.

Felicity's fingers trembled slightly as she typed on the keyboard, deliberately avoiding eye contact. After several tense minutes, she finally clicked the last button with a decisive tap. Gathering the materials, she handed me two keycards, a glossy resort map, and a neatly printed itinerary.

"Your suite is in the Sapphire Tower, room 606," she informed me with forced professionalism. "We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us."

I offered a polite nod. "Thank you."

As I reached for my luggage, Felicity quickly intervened. "Please, allow our bell staff to handle that," she insisted, gesturing toward a uniformed attendant waiting nearby. "At Moonstone Resort, our guests shouldn't lift a single finger."

"Are you certain?" I hesitated, glancing at the expensive-looking bags. "I don't want to impose."

Her smile tightened. "It's our pleasure, truly."

With a shared look of amazement, Beatrice and I turned toward the breathtaking glass elevator. The moment the doors closed and we began ascending, the entire resort unfolded beneath us like a glittering jewel box. The panoramic view stole our breath away—infinity pools shimmering like liquid sapphire, lush tropical gardens, and the endless turquoise ocean stretching to the horizon.

Beatrice gripped my arm, her nails digging in slightly. "Would you look at that," she whispered, pressing her forehead against the glass. "I've never seen anything like this in my life."

Neither had I. The higher we rose, the more surreal it became, like floating into a dream. Somewhere between the 30th and 40th floor, a terrible thought struck me—this elevator was moving suspiciously fast. Too fast.

And then the lights flickered.

A sharp jolt sent us stumbling. The elevator groaned ominously as it...
###Chapter 270
The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the cobblestone path leading to Blackwood Manor. Her fingers tightened around the strap of her satchel, the weight of her textbooks a comforting reminder of the normalcy she desperately clung to.

Inside, the grand foyer was alive with activity. Servants bustled about, preparing for the evening's gathering. At the center of it all stood Sebastian Blackwood, his broad shoulders accentuated by the tailored navy suit he wore. His piercing gaze locked onto hers the moment she entered, sending an involuntary shiver down her spine.

"Lillian," he greeted, his voice deep and smooth like aged whiskey. "You're late."

She swallowed hard. "Professor Sinclair kept us after class."

Sebastian's lips twitched, as if he knew she was lying but chose not to call her out on it. Instead, he extended a hand. "Come. There's someone I want you to meet."

Her heart pounded as she followed him into the drawing room, where a striking woman with raven-black hair and emerald-green eyes sat elegantly on the velvet sofa.

"Lillian, this is Celeste Devereaux," Sebastian introduced. "She's here to discuss the upcoming charity gala."

Celeste's smile was polished, practiced. "Ah, the famous Lillian. Sebastian has told me so much about you."

Lillian forced a smile, though unease prickled at her skin. Something about Celeste's presence felt... calculated.

Before she could dwell on it, Oliver burst into the room, his cheeks flushed with excitement. "Lillian! You're back!"

The tension in her shoulders eased as she knelt to hug him. "Hey, little wolf. Did you finish your homework?"

Oliver nodded vigorously. "Marcus helped me!"

Sebastian's beta, Marcus Grayson, appeared in the doorway, his expression unreadable. "Alpha, we have a situation."

Sebastian's demeanor shifted instantly. "Excuse us," he murmured to Celeste before following Marcus out.

Left alone with the actress, Lillian fidgeted with the hem of her sweater.

Celeste tilted her head. "You're not what I expected."

Lillian met her gaze. "And what did you expect?"

"A timid little thing, easily intimidated." Celeste's smile turned razor-sharp. "But you're not, are you?"

The air between them crackled with unspoken challenge.

Just then, Beatrice's voice echoed from the hall. "Lil! You won't believe what just happened—" She skidded to a halt upon seeing Celeste. "Oh. You have company."

Celeste rose gracefully. "I should take my leave. Sebastian and I will continue our discussion later."

As she swept out of the room, Beatrice whistled low. "Wow. She's... intense."

Lillian exhaled shakily. "You have no idea."

Beatrice's eyes gleamed with mischief. "So, guess who just got asked out by Tyler?"

Lillian groaned. "Not this again."

Outside, thunder rumbled in the distance, a portent of the storm brewing on the horizon—both literal and figurative.

And Lillian couldn't shake the feeling that Celeste Devereaux was at the eye of it.

"This is absolutely incredible!" Beatrice gasped, her emerald eyes sparkling with excitement.

I smiled in silent agreement as we strolled down the grand marble corridor, our footsteps echoing beneath the glittering cascade of Swarovski chandeliers overhead. The golden keycard slipped effortlessly into our suite's door, revealing a paradise beyond imagination.

The master bedroom featured two canopy beds atop a raised dais, complete with velvet-lined steps. A fully equipped mini-bar and espresso station occupied one corner, while floor-to-ceiling windows framed a breathtaking ocean vista. Below, turquoise pools shimmered like scattered sapphires across the resort grounds.

"Oh, I could get used to this," Beatrice sighed, flopping onto the plush duvet with arms outstretched.

"Mmhmm," I murmured, already unpacking my combat gear with military precision. If we were staying for the Gamma trials, I needed everything battle-ready.

A discreet knock announced the bellhop with our luggage. After tipping him generously, Beatrice emerged from the walk-in closet wearing a daring crimson bikini.

"Exploration time!" she declared, twirling her keycard. "Coming?"

I shook my head. "Need to prep for tonight's orientation."

Her pout lasted precisely three seconds before mischief reclaimed her features. "Suit yourself, warrior girl. Don't wait up!"

The ensuite bathroom could've housed a small family. Multi-directional rainfall showerheads massaged away my tension as steam curled around imported Italian tiles. Emerging wrapped in fluffy terrycloth, I found Beatrice rifling through her makeup case with unusual intensity.

"Changed your mind?" I asked hopefully.

She bit her lip. "Actually... met some fellow cheer squad girls at the rooftop bar. They're doing a cocktail crawl during the competitors' dinner..."

My stomach dropped. "You're ditching me?"

"Don't say it like that!" She grabbed my hands. "I'll be front row for every match, swear on Mom's vintage Chanel. But tonight?" Her nose wrinkled. "Stuffy formal dinners aren't really my scene."

I exhaled through clenched teeth. "Go. Have fun."

Her squeal could've shattered crystal as she crushed me in a jasmine-scented hug. When the door clicked shut, my reflection in the gilded mirror seemed suddenly smaller.

Alone.

Just like always.

###Chapter 271

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the lavish bedroom as Lillian stirred beneath silk sheets. Her fingers brushed against the empty space beside her—Sebastian had already left for his early meeting. A faint trace of his sandalwood scent lingered on the pillow, making her lips curve unconsciously.

She stretched, her muscles pleasantly sore from last night's passionate encounter. The memory sent a flush creeping up her neck. Three months into their marriage, and the man still left her breathless.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. "Come in," she called, pulling the duvet higher.

The door creaked open, revealing Giselle, the head maid, balancing a silver tray. "Good morning, Luna. I brought your breakfast—fresh berries, avocado toast, and that lavender honey tea you adore."

Lillian sat up, tucking a loose curl behind her ear. "Thank you, but you didn’t have to—"

"Nonsense." Giselle set the tray across her lap with practiced ease. "Alpha Blackwood’s orders. He said you barely ate dinner last night."

Heat flooded Lillian’s cheeks. They’d been... preoccupied.

Giselle smirked knowingly before straightening. "Oh, and this arrived for you." She produced a velvet box from her apron pocket.

Lillian’s pulse jumped. Another gift? Sebastian had been showering her with jewels lately—emerald earrings after the pack ball, a diamond bracelet following their lakeside picnic. She lifted the lid, gasping at the pendant nestled inside: a crescent moon carved from moonstone, threaded on a delicate platinum chain.

Just like the one from his mother’s portrait.

Her throat tightened. This wasn’t just jewelry—it was an heirloom. A symbol of acceptance.

"Tell him—" She swallowed past the lump in her throat. "Tell him I’ll wear it tonight at the gala."

Giselle nodded, but her smile faltered. "There’s... one more thing. A messenger came from the Winslow estate." She handed over a cream-colored envelope sealed with crimson wax.

Lillian’s stomach dropped. The Winslow crest. Eleanor.

She broke the seal with trembling fingers, scanning the elegant script:

"Dearest Sister-in-law,
I’d be delighted if you joined me for tea this afternoon. There’s a matter concerning Donovan that requires your attention."

The paper crumpled in her grip. After everything—the betrayal, the public humiliation—how dare she?

Giselle cleared her throat. "Shall I inform Alpha Blackwood?"

Lillian exhaled sharply. "No." She wouldn’t drag Sebastian into this mess. Not when tensions with the Winslow pack were already volatile. "But have Marcus prepare the car. I’ll leave at two."

As the maid retreated, Lillian stared at the pendant’s ethereal glow. Tonight, she’d stand beside Sebastian as his equal. But first, she had a snake to face.

And this time, she wouldn’t come unarmed.

Lillian's POV

I probably shouldn’t have been drinking this much. But the nerves were eating at me, and the atmosphere at this dinner was suffocating. The room was dominated by towering, muscular competitors—mostly men, with only a handful of women. I was petite in comparison, though I knew my strength was nothing to scoff at. Still, doubt gnawed at me. Would I really stand a chance?

The buffet was extravagant, overflowing with dishes that made my stomach growl. I piled my plate high, trying to distract myself. Then I spotted him—a hulking competitor flexing his biceps while boasting loudly. Beside him stood Rosalind, cheeks flushed as she listened. When she noticed me, her face brightened, but she only offered a quick, discreet wave before turning away.

Ah. That must be her boyfriend. She probably didn’t want him knowing she was friendly with the competition.

At the head of the hall sat a long table with four chairs—two occupied by Lycan Chairmen. Their presence alone was overwhelming. Power rolled off them in waves, their expressions unreadable, their auras almost blinding. I’d heard Alpha Maximilian wouldn’t arrive until tomorrow, which explained one empty seat. But the other…

Was Sebastian coming?

Gavin—no, Sebastian—hadn’t mentioned attending. My stomach twisted at the thought. I scanned the room but found no sign of him.

Speeches and toasts followed, delivered by Alphas and one of the Chairmen. Excitement buzzed through the crowd, though the competition wouldn’t start for a few more days. Tomorrow, they planned group training in the courtyard. Maybe I should join—if I could drag myself out of bed.

For now, I retreated to the bar, drowning my nerves in alcohol until my cheeks burned and the room spun. Definitely too much. I needed to leave before I embarrassed myself.

I staggered toward the exit, praying no one noticed my unsteady steps. The hallway blurred as I fumbled for the elevator. Then—damn it. My key was still in the room.

Beatrice was probably still out with her new friends. I wasn’t about to interrupt her night. Instead, I stumbled to the front desk, grateful the lobby was empty. The night staff were strangers, their expressions politely neutral as I slurred, "I, uh… locked myself out. Room 909, I think?"

The clerk nodded, typing swiftly before handing me a new key card.

Just get to bed, Lillian. Before you do something really stupid.

Lillian's POV

"There you go," Sebastian murmured, his deep voice sending shivers down my spine.

I managed a small smile, clutching the keycard he'd handed me. "Thank you."

The elevator ride up felt longer than usual, my head swimming with the effects of the alcohol. The moment I stepped into the suite, exhaustion crashed over me like a tidal wave.


All I wanted was to collapse into bed. Changing into pajamas? Too much effort. Instead, I kicked off my shoes, letting my dress pool around my ankles as I stumbled toward the bed. Beatrice still wasn’t back—thank the Moon Goddess. The last thing I needed was her seeing me like this, half-drunk and completely disheveled.

The room smelled different—cleaner, fresher. Had Beatrice sprayed perfume before she left? Or maybe the resort staff had come in to tidy up. Either way, the scent was soothing, wrapping around me like a warm embrace.

I left a trail of discarded clothes behind me, not caring where they landed. The distance to the bed seemed to stretch impossibly far, but I chalked it up to the alcohol messing with my perception.

Finally, I tumbled beneath the covers, naked and boneless. The sheets were cool against my flushed skin. With a sigh, I let my heavy eyelids fall shut, surrendering to sleep.

Sebastian's POV

The scalding water did nothing to clear my head.

Rare for a Lycan to get this drunk, but I’d spiked my drink with something potent enough to knock out an entire pack. Right now, I needed the numbness—needed to silence the storm in my mind.

The competitors’ dinner was in full swing downstairs. As the Lycan chairman, I should’ve been there, making appearances, exchanging pleasantlies. But tonight? Impossible.

Let them talk.

I’d attend tomorrow’s event. Tonight, I just needed to be alone. To forget.

The steam curled around me, thick and suffocating. I braced my hands against the tiled wall, head bowed.

Just a few hours of oblivion.

That’s all I asked for.

###Chapter 272

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, painting the room in warm hues. Lillian stretched beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming from the intensity of last night. The scent of Sebastian—dark, intoxicating, and undeniably alpha—lingered on her skin, a reminder of their passionate reunion.

She turned her head, expecting to find him beside her, but the bed was empty. A note rested on his pillow, written in his bold, elegant script:

"Emergency pack meeting. Don’t wait for me for breakfast. —S"

Lillian sighed, running her fingers over the crisp paper. Even now, duty called him away. But she understood. As the Lycan Chairman, Sebastian’s responsibilities were endless.

The door creaked open, and little Oliver peeked in, his silver-blue eyes—so much like his father’s—bright with mischief. "Aunt Lillian! You’re finally awake!"

She chuckled, pulling the covers higher. "Good morning, trouble. What’s the plan today?"

Oliver bounced onto the bed, nearly toppling her. "Papa said we could go to the amusement park if you said yes!"

Lillian arched a brow. "Did he now?"

Oliver nodded eagerly. "He said you’d love it!"

She laughed, ruffling his hair. "Well, if your papa insists, who am I to argue?"

Just then, her phone buzzed. A message from Beatrice:

"Emergency girls’ night. My sister Isabella is in town, and she’s bringing gossip. Meet at The Velvet Lounge at 8. No excuses!"

Lillian bit her lip. She hadn’t seen Isabella in months, and the model always had the juiciest stories. But Sebastian had mentioned wanting to spend the evening together…

Oliver tugged her sleeve. "Aunt Lillian? Are we going?"

She exhaled, making a decision. "Of course we are. But first, breakfast."

Downstairs, the mansion was alive with activity. Giselle, the head maid, directed staff with quiet efficiency, while Lucien, the flirtatious head chef, winked at her from the kitchen. "Morning, gorgeous. Pancakes or waffles?"

"Surprise me," she said, sliding onto a stool.

Oliver chattered excitedly about roller coasters, but Lillian’s mind wandered. Last night, Sebastian had whispered something about a "surprise" for her. What could it be?

Her phone buzzed again—an unknown number.

"You think you’ve won, little wolf? The game has only just begun."

Her blood ran cold. The message was unsigned, but she didn’t need a name to know who it was from.

Donovan.

Her ex-fated mate wasn’t done with her.

And worse—he knew where she was.

I didn't bother dressing after my shower. The steam still clung to my skin as I stepped out in nothing but my boxers, padding barefoot across the plush carpet toward the bed. Then I froze.

The sheets moved.

My wolf surged forward before I could stop him, nostrils flaring at the unmistakable scent that wrapped around me like silk. Jasmine. Vanilla. And something uniquely...her.

I gripped the edge of the duvet, peeling it back with deliberate slowness.

Lillian lay curled on her side, naked as the day she was born, golden hair fanned across my pillows. Moonlight painted her curves in silver, highlighting the dip of her waist, the swell of her hips. My mouth went dry.

"Sebastian..." Her voice was sleep-rough, sending heat straight to my groin.

Had she come for me? The thought sent something primal roaring through my veins. My fingers traced the delicate line of her jaw, and she turned into my touch like a flower seeking sunlight. When I brushed my thumb across her lower lip, she parted them with a soft sigh.

That was all the invitation I needed.

In one motion, I hauled her up against me, her legs locking around my waist as I sat on the mattress. The feel of her bare skin against mine was electric. She writhed, pupils blown wide with need, the sweet musk of her arousal thick in the air.

The growl tore from my throat before I could stop it.

Her mouth crashed into mine, hungry and desperate. I could taste the champagne on her tongue as she rocked against me, my boxers growing damp from her heat. Her hands mapped every ridge of my abdomen, nails scraping lightly as she moaned into my mouth.

Questions evaporated. There was only this. Only her.

I fisted my hand in her hair, tilting her head back to plunder her mouth deeper. She opened for me without hesitation, taking everything I gave. When her small hand wrapped around my length, I nearly saw stars.

"Inside," I gritted out. "Now."

She didn't make me ask twice.

The moment I sheathed myself in her wet heat, we both groaned. Her walls fluttered around me as she began to move, riding me with increasing desperation. I gripped her hips hard enough to leave bruises, guiding her pace until her thighs trembled and she shattered with my name on her lips.

I followed her over the edge, spilling into her with a roar.

We didn't sleep for hours.

The crash jolted me awake.

I was on my feet before my eyes fully opened, wolf scanning for threats. The bed was empty. Cold.

Then I heard it—a whimper.

Lillian crouched on the floor, clutching a fallen lamp, her eyes wide with horror. "Sebastian?" Her voice shook. "What...what are you doing in my suite?"

The scent of her fear was unmistakable.

And it didn't match last night's memories at all.

###Chapter 273
Lillian's POV
What the hell just happened?

Why was Sebastian Blackwood in my hotel room?

My pulse hammered in my ears as I scrambled for the scattered remains of my clothes, fingers shaking so badly I could barely fasten the buttons. The cold realization settled in—I was completely naked. Which meant something had definitely happened last night. How had everything spiraled so out of control?

The last thing I remembered was drowning my sorrows at the banquet. The loneliness had been suffocating, and alcohol seemed like the only escape. At least, that’s what I’d told myself—anything to numb the ache of him. Except now, here he was, standing over me like a storm cloud, his expression unreadable.

Sebastian had already pulled on his clothes with that infuriating ease of his, while I was still struggling with the aftermath. His gaze burned into me, dark and assessing, as he circled the bed. It took him a moment to notice—

###Chapter 274

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s mansion. The golden hues of twilight painted the sky, casting long shadows across the sprawling estate. She exhaled slowly, her breath forming a faint mist in the cooling evening.

Inside, the grand hall buzzed with activity. The pack was preparing for the upcoming alliance meeting with Alpha Maximilian Voss, a rival Lycan chairman whose intentions remained shrouded in mystery. Lillian could hear the low murmur of voices—Sebastian’s deep, commanding tone, Marcus Grayson’s sharp responses, and the occasional laughter of Oliver, Sebastian’s seven-year-old son, who had somehow managed to sneak into the discussions.

A rustle of fabric drew her attention. Evelyn, Donovan’s new mate, stood at the doorway, her expression unreadable. The tension between them was palpable, a silent battle of wills neither was willing to concede.

"You look troubled," Evelyn remarked, stepping forward.

Lillian arched a brow. "Shouldn’t you be with Donovan?"

Evelyn smirked. "He’s busy. And I thought I’d check on you. After all, we’re going to be seeing a lot of each other now."

Lillian clenched her fists, resisting the urge to snap back. She knew Evelyn was baiting her, but she refused to give her the satisfaction.

Before she could respond, Beatrice burst onto the balcony, her cheeks flushed. "Lillian! You won’t believe what just happened!"

Lillian turned, grateful for the distraction. "What is it?"

Beatrice’s eyes sparkled with excitement. "Victoria just announced her engagement is off! She broke things off with Donovan!"

Lillian’s breath hitched. That changed everything.

Sebastian’s voice cut through the moment, sharp and commanding. "Lillian. My office. Now."

She exchanged a glance with Beatrice before following him inside, her mind racing. What did this mean for the alliance? For Donovan? For her?

As she stepped into Sebastian’s study, the weight of his gaze pinned her in place. "Sit," he ordered.

She did, her pulse quickening.

Sebastian leaned against his desk, arms crossed. "Victoria’s decision complicates things. Donovan won’t take this lightly."

Lillian swallowed. "What do you want me to do?"

His lips curved into a dangerous smile. "Exactly what you’ve been doing. Stay close. Watch him. And when the time comes—"

A knock interrupted him. Marcus entered, his expression grim. "Alpha, we have a problem."

Sebastian’s eyes darkened. "What now?"

Marcus hesitated, then spoke. "Donovan just left the estate. And he wasn’t alone."

Lillian’s stomach twisted. Who was with him?

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "Find him. Now."

As Marcus hurried out, Lillian met Sebastian’s gaze. The unspoken question hung between them—was this the beginning of the end, or just another twist in their dangerous game?

And more importantly—whose side would she be on when it all came crashing down?

My gaze darted across the email until the room number jumped out at me.

My heart stopped.

Room 906.

I was in the wrong room.

Of all the cursed luck!

Heat flooded my cheeks as I glared at the door number. I was in Sebastian Blackwood’s suite. The realization hit me like a punch to the gut, and for a second, I thought I might actually faint from sheer humiliation.

I couldn’t bring myself to look at him, though I could feel his piercing stare, his lips pressed into a disapproving line.

He thought I was here to stalk him. He had no idea I was even in the competition—and honestly, I wasn’t sure if it was worth telling him.

These past few weeks, he hadn’t spared me a single thought. Why would that change now?

“Well?” His voice was sharp, impatient. “Are you going to explain yourself, or just stand there like a statue?”

Words failed me.

If I’d spent the whole night here, that meant Beatrice had been alone in our room.

Goddess above. She must have been frantic with worry. All this time, I’d assumed she was the one missing, when in reality—

“I—” My voice cracked. “I have to go.”

I spun on my heel and bolted before he could stop me.

Our actual room was only a few doors down, but I didn’t want him following me—or worse, finding me later. So instead of heading there, I made a sharp turn toward the elevators.

I didn’t know where I was going. I just knew I couldn’t stay.

Sebastian’s POV

I wasn’t completely blackout drunk last night—just drunk enough to make choices I’d normally regret.

But waking up to find Lillian sprawled on my suite floor? That was a shock I hadn’t seen coming.

She was the last person I expected to see here.

And the way my body reacted to her—even disheveled, half-dressed, and clearly mortified—was infuriating. She was still breathtaking.

This was dangerous. If Alpha Maximilian caught wind of my connection to her, he’d use her against me without hesitation.

###Chapter 275

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the Blackwood estate, painting the marble floors in warm hues. Lillian stretched lazily in bed, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her. Sebastian had already left for an early meeting, but the lingering scent of his cologne still clung to the sheets.

She sighed, rolling onto her back. The events of the past few days weighed heavily on her mind—Donovan’s sudden reappearance, Evelyn’s smug taunts, and the whispers circulating through the pack about their fractured bond. But none of that mattered now. Not when she had Sebastian.

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, sitting up.

The door creaked open, revealing Oliver’s small frame. His dark curls were tousled from sleep, and he clutched a stuffed wolf tightly under one arm. "Lillian," he mumbled, rubbing his eyes. "Did you see my dad?"

She smiled, patting the space beside her. "He had an early meeting, sweetheart. But he’ll be back soon."

Oliver climbed onto the bed, nestling against her side. "Are you gonna stay with us forever?"

The question caught her off guard. Her heart clenched. Forever. Such a simple word, yet it carried the weight of promises and uncertainties.

Before she could answer, another knock echoed through the room. This time, it was Theodore, Sebastian’s ever-composed butler.

"Miss Lillian," he said, bowing slightly. "Alpha Sebastian requests your presence in his office. It’s urgent."

Lillian frowned. Sebastian never summoned her like this unless something was wrong.

"Of course," she said, gently disentangling herself from Oliver. "I’ll be right there."

As she followed Theodore down the grand hallway, her pulse quickened. The air felt charged, thick with unspoken tension.

When she stepped into Sebastian’s office, the sight before her made her blood run cold.

Donovan stood there, his expression unreadable, flanked by two unfamiliar warriors. And beside him—Victoria, Sebastian’s daughter, her face pale but resolute.

Sebastian’s jaw was clenched, his golden eyes burning with restrained fury. "Lillian," he said, his voice dangerously calm. "It seems we have a situation."

Donovan smirked, crossing his arms. "Hello, Lillian. Miss me?"

Her stomach twisted. This wasn’t just a visit.

This was a declaration of war.

Lillian's POV

Too much time had slipped away, and I finally dragged myself back to my hotel suite. I desperately needed to change before heading to the resort’s gym to start my day. Training with the others was on my agenda, but first—I had to tame this monstrous hangover.

Relief washed over me when I didn’t spot Sebastian in the hallway as I returned to our floor. His room was right next to mine, so I tiptoed past, praying he wouldn’t sense my presence.

Then again, he was a Lycan. He probably knew the second I stepped off the elevator.

When I reached my door, my stomach dropped—I didn’t have my key. My only hope was Beatrice being inside. I knocked, balancing between loud enough for her to hear and quiet enough to avoid alerting Sebastian. Not that it mattered. He knew I was there. The real question was—would he confront me?

I shouldn’t have bolted like that. I should’ve stayed, explained. But the mortification of waking up in his bed last night had sent me into full flight mode.

The door swung open, and I spun around—only to realize I’d been staring at Sebastian’s door like a deer in headlights. Beatrice stood there, arms crossed, a smirk playing on her lips.

"Well, well. Look who finally decided to grace us with her presence," she drawled, her gaze sweeping over my disheveled state. I was still in last night’s banquet dress. I hadn’t dared look in a mirror yet, but I could only imagine the disaster—wild hair, smudged makeup, and probably the lingering scent of poor decisions.

I slipped inside, and she shut the door behind me. The weight of her stare burned into my back.

"Enjoy your night with Sebastian?" she asked, voice dripping with amusement.

I gasped, whirling to face her, eyes wide.

"H-how did you—?" My voice came out barely a whisper.

She studied me, her expression unreadable—until the corner of her lip twitched. The crack in her composure.

"Let’s just say... I’m observant," she said, her gaze flicking pointedly to my wrinkled dress.

Heat flooded my cheeks under her scrutiny. Before I could defend myself, she burst into laughter, clutching the bedpost to keep from collapsing.

"Oh, Goddess," she wheezed. "Your face—priceless."

I pressed my lips into a tight line.

"This isn’t funny, Beatrice," I muttered, fighting the urge to cry while she cackled.

"Oh, trust me. It’s hilarious," she managed between giggles. "I saw him checking in earlier. Then, when I was heading back last night, I watched you stumble into the wrong suite. Recognized the number because the front desk gave it to him. I tried to stop you, but—"

She dissolved into laughter again, and I groaned, burying my face in my hands.

This was going to be a long day.

"Remember?"

I struggled to piece together the fragments of last night, and a hazy image of Beatrice surfaced in my mind. I recalled her looking frantic about something, but I had been too far gone to care—all I wanted was to collapse into bed. I must have assumed Beatrice was right behind me, heading to her own bed. That would explain why she had been so insistent about me being in the wrong room, even though I had been utterly convinced otherwise.

"You shut the door, and I couldn’t get in," she said, crossing her arms. "I knocked, but it was useless. Once I realized which room you’d stumbled into, I figured you’d be fine. Maybe mortified once you sobered up... but I knew he wouldn’t let anything happen to you." She shrugged. "So, I went back to our room."

"I really wish you’d tried harder, Beatrice," I muttered, squeezing my eyes shut as the events of last night replayed in vivid, excruciating detail.

I had slept with Sebastian Blackwood.

"Did you have a bad night?" she asked, her brow furrowing with concern. "He didn’t... go too far, did he?"

I knew exactly what she was asking, and the truth was, I couldn’t fault Sebastian for anything—not after how he’d treated me these past few weeks. And last night? He’d been just as drunk as I was. The scent of whiskey had clung to his breath, and his usual controlled demeanor had slipped, just like mine. We’d both been reckless, letting emotions override reason.

It had been a choice between two intoxicated adults—no one was to blame. But that didn’t stop the humiliation from clawing at me. I had barged into his room uninvited. How could I ever explain myself? How would I face him again?

###Chapter 276

The crisp morning air carried the scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s sprawling estate. The sun had barely risen, casting a golden hue over the dense forest that bordered the property. She tightened the silk robe around her, her fingers brushing against the delicate fabric—another extravagant gift from Sebastian.

Inside, the mansion buzzed with activity. Servants moved with practiced efficiency, preparing for the day ahead. Giselle Beaumont, the head maid, directed them with quiet authority, her sharp eyes missing nothing.

Lillian’s thoughts drifted to the previous night—the way Sebastian’s fingers had traced the curve of her spine, the heat of his breath against her neck. A shiver ran through her, despite the warmth of the morning sun.

Then, the sound of footsteps pulled her from her reverie.

"Good morning, Lillian," a smooth voice greeted.

She turned to find Donovan leaning against the doorframe, his dark eyes glinting with amusement. He looked unfairly handsome in his tailored suit, his tie slightly loosened, as if he couldn’t be bothered with formalities.

Lillian stiffened. "What are you doing here?"

Donovan smirked. "Is that any way to greet your ex-fated mate?"

Her jaw clenched. "We were never fated. You made sure of that."

His smirk faltered, just for a second, before he recovered. "Still holding onto that grudge, I see."

Before she could retort, another voice cut in.

"Donovan."

Sebastian stood at the top of the staircase, his presence commanding the room. His silver eyes were cold, his broad shoulders tense.

Donovan straightened, his smirk fading. "Sebastian. I was just leaving."

Sebastian didn’t move, didn’t blink. "See that you do."

The tension between them was palpable, thick enough to choke on. Lillian held her breath, her heart pounding.

Then, with a final glance at Lillian, Donovan turned and strode toward the exit.

Sebastian’s gaze shifted to her, softening slightly. "Are you alright?"

Lillian exhaled. "I’m fine."

But she wasn’t.

Because Donovan’s sudden appearance could only mean one thing—trouble was coming. And this time, she wasn’t sure she could outrun it.

"No..." I confessed, my voice barely above a whisper, hating the admission as soon as it left my lips. "It was... incredible. But it shouldn't have happened. I'm mortified."

Beatrice pouted, her dark eyes shimmering with mischief and regret.

"I'm sorry, Lillian. You're right. I should've resisted harder. That was totally irresponsible of me," she murmured, her usual playful tone laced with genuine remorse.

I exhaled sharply and closed the distance between us, wrapping my arms around her in a tight embrace.

"I'm not angry with you," I assured her, my voice softening. "You're not my keeper. I shouldn't have put you in that position. That's on me."

We held each other for a long moment before she finally pulled away, her expression shifting back to its usual teasing glint.

"Alright, go shower. You reek," she joked, wrinkling her nose dramatically.

I smirked and yanked open one of the dresser drawers, fishing out my training gear.

"Just gonna freshen up at the sink. No point showering now—I've got combat drills in an hour," I called over my shoulder as I disappeared into the bathroom.

I slipped into a sleek yoga bra and high-waisted leggings that clung to every curve, the fabric designed for maximum flexibility. Perfect for the grueling session ahead. Tying my hair into a high ponytail, I made sure every strand was secured before turning on the faucet. Grabbing a washcloth, I scrubbed my face, neck, and underarms with brisk efficiency.

A few minutes later, I patted myself dry with a towel and rummaged through my toiletry bag. Deodorant, toothbrush, toothpaste—all accounted for. After a quick swipe of minty freshness across my teeth, I was ready.

Beatrice announced she was meeting her new friends for breakfast and suggested we reconvene for lunch. With a nod, I slung my gym bag over my shoulder and headed out, determined to find the resort’s infamous training facility.

The map they'd provided might as well have been written in hieroglyphics. After several wrong turns and backtracking through the labyrinthine halls, I finally stumbled upon the gym.

And wow.

The place was a monstrosity—three sprawling floors of cutting-edge equipment, floor-to-ceiling windows offering panoramic ocean views, and even an Olympic-sized lap pool reserved exclusively for aquatic training. Through one of the glass walls, I could just make out the glittering lights of the resort’s casino in the distance.

Despite the sheer size, the gym was packed. Every machine, every bench, every free weight was occupied by competitors prepping for the tournament. Their focused expressions and high-performance gear made it clear—this wasn’t some casual workout spot.

I scanned the space, debating where to begin, before deciding to stash my bag first. My backpack held my essentials—phone, wallet, spare wraps—and I wasn’t about to lug it around all morning.

Navigating through the crowd, I offered polite nods to unfamiliar faces as I made my way to the locker room. Inside, a trio of girls clustered around a mirror, snapping selfies with pouted lips and angled chins. I suppressed an eye roll. Gym rats? More like Instagram posers.

The locker room was massive, rows upon rows of sleek metal compartments lining the walls. But as I walked down the aisles, every single one glowed red—occupied.


"Oops, my bad. I took the last one," one of the girls said with a smirk, her tone dripping with false sympathy. "Maybe you should've been quicker."

I pressed my lips into a tight line, refusing to give her the satisfaction of a reaction. Adjusting the strap of my bag, I moved to walk past her.

"Wait—you're here for the Gamma trials too?" she called out, halting me mid-step.

"Too?" I turned, arching a brow. "You're competing?"

A smug grin curled her lips as she examined her manicured nails. "Obviously. My father is the main sponsor. Didn't you know?"

My eyes widened slightly.

"You're Alpha Maximilian's daughter?" I blurted, stunned. I knew next to nothing about the rival Lycan Alpha, except that he was Sebastian's sworn enemy.

"Don't we look alike?" She fluttered her lashes dramatically.

Now that she mentioned it, there was an unsettling resemblance—the same sharp cheekbones, the same cold, calculating glint in her eyes.

"But don't worry," she continued, flashing a saccharine smile. "When I win, it'll be completely fair. I've been trained by the best, after all. Victory is inevitable."

With a flick of her golden hair, she tossed me a condescending wink that sent heat rushing to my cheeks. The other girls in the bathroom tittered behind their hands, clearly enjoying the exchange. Their laughter only stoked the fire inside me, sharpening my resolve.

If she wanted a fight, I’d give her one.

I spun on my heel and stormed out—only to collide with someone hard enough to send my bag tumbling to the floor. Strong hands caught me before I could fall, their warmth searing through my clothes.

I looked up—and my breath caught.

Sebastian.

###Chapter 277

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, painting the marble floors in warm hues. Lillian stretched lazily in the silk sheets, the scent of sandalwood and musk lingering in the air—Sebastian’s scent.

A soft knock interrupted the quiet.

"Miss Lillian?" Sophia Delacroix’s voice carried through the door. "Breakfast is ready. Mr. Blackwood asked me to inform you."

Lillian sat up, running a hand through her tousled hair. "Thank you, Sophia. I’ll be down in a minute."

She slipped out of bed, her bare feet touching the cool marble. The events of last night replayed in her mind—Sebastian’s possessive grip, the way his lips had traced the mark on her neck, the whispered promise that still sent shivers down her spine.

"You’re mine, Lillian. In every way."

A blush crept up her cheeks.

Downstairs, the dining room was bathed in sunlight. Sebastian sat at the head of the table, impeccably dressed in a tailored black suit, his silver eyes flickering with amusement as she entered.

"Sleep well?" His voice was low, teasing.

Lillian shot him a glare, though the effect was ruined by the way her pulse jumped at his smirk. "Like a rock."

Oliver, Sebastian’s seven-year-old son, giggled into his pancakes. "Dad said you were tired because—"

"Oliver," Sebastian cut in smoothly, though his lips twitched. "Eat your breakfast."

Lillian groaned, sinking into her seat. "You’re terrible."

Sebastian leaned in, his breath warm against her ear. "You love it."

Before she could retort, Theodore Whitmore, the butler, cleared his throat. "Mr. Blackwood, your ten o’clock meeting has been moved up. Alpha Harrison is waiting in your office."

Sebastian’s expression darkened. "Tell him I’ll be there shortly."

Lillian frowned. "Trouble?"

"Nothing I can’t handle." He pressed a kiss to her temple before standing. "Stay out of trouble, little wolf."

She rolled her eyes. "No promises."

As Sebastian left, Oliver grinned. "Dad’s so whipped."

Lillian choked on her orange juice.

Meanwhile, across town, Donovan Winslow paced his penthouse, his phone pressed to his ear.

"She’s still with him?" His voice was tight with barely restrained fury.

Evelyn, his new mate, lounged on the couch, filing her nails. "Obviously. You really thought she’d come crawling back after you dumped her?"

Donovan’s grip on the phone tightened. "This isn’t over."

Evelyn smirked. "Oh, it is. You lost, Donovan. Accept it."

His phone buzzed—a message from an unknown number.

"Meet me. We have a deal to discuss."

Donovan’s lips curled.

Maybe it wasn’t over after all.

Back at the Blackwood estate, Beatrice barged into the dining room, her arms full of shopping bags. "Lillian! You have to see what I got!"

Lillian blinked. "Did you rob a boutique?"

Beatrice grinned. "Close. Sebastian’s credit card has no limits."

Lillian groaned. "He’s going to kill you."

"Nah." Beatrice winked. "He’s too busy being obsessed with you."

As if on cue, Lillian’s phone buzzed—a text from Sebastian.

"Tell Beatrice if she maxes out another card, I’m cutting her off."

Lillian burst out laughing.

Beatrice pouted. "What? What did he say?"

Lillian smirked. "Nothing important."

The day was just beginning—and trouble was definitely brewing.

Lillian's POV

Sebastian stood before me, shirtless, wearing nothing but a pair of sweatpants. My breath hitched as my gaze raked over his sculpted torso, his abs glistening under the gym lights—damp with sweat, proof he had been here for a while. A towel draped over his broad shoulders caught the beads of perspiration rolling down his neck. When our eyes met, I saw the flicker of irritation in his stormy gaze, a silent warning simmering beneath the surface.

"What are you doing in here?" His voice was low, dangerous.

I wasn’t afraid of him—nothing he did could ever truly make me fear him—but the sharp edge in his tone stung. It was me who had put that anger there. The realization twisted something inside me.

"I... I was going to work out," I muttered, suddenly unable to hold his stare. The weight of the last few weeks—the loneliness, the ache of rejection—pressed down on me, making me feel smaller than I had in a long time.

What the hell is wrong with me?

His jaw tightened as he studied me, skepticism darkening his expression. His gaze dropped to my gym bag abandoned on the floor, and his lips thinned.

"Why isn’t that in a locker?" he demanded. "It could get stolen."

"Uh..." I glanced toward the women’s locker room. "There weren’t any lockers left."

A scowl twisted his features before he snatched my bag off the floor and stalked toward the men’s locker room.

"W-wait! What are you doing?" I called after him.

"Putting it in my locker," he tossed over his shoulder before disappearing inside.

He wasn’t gone long. I hovered outside, arms crossed, until he returned moments later.

"There. Now it won’t get stolen," he said, his glare sharp enough to cut glass. "You shouldn’t have come here."

"I just wanted to get a workout in," I shot back, gesturing to the equipment.

For a heartbeat, he just stared at me, his expression unreadable. Then, with a barely perceptible exhale, he stepped aside, letting me pass.

I kept my head down as I maneuvered through the gym, ignoring the curious glances from a few familiar gammas. The second floor was quieter, lined with treadmills and stationary bikes. I chose one near the railing, giving me a clear view of the gym below. If they could see me, then good—I wanted them to. I needed them to remember I wasn’t someone to underestimate.

I started with a light jog, my muscles warming up quickly.

I didn’t notice the person stepping onto the treadmill beside me—not until the machine beeped to life and they launched into a full sprint. My head snapped to the side, and my stomach flipped when I saw Sebastian there, already pushing himself to a punishing pace.

Had he followed me?

Annoyance flared in my chest. His dark eyes flicked to mine, challenging, daring me to keep up.

Oh, hell no.

I cranked up my speed, matching his effortlessly before nudging it higher, forcing myself into a faster sprint. If he wanted a competition, I’d give him one.

A smirk curled his lips as we ran side by side. Then, another beep—his treadmill whirred louder as he surged ahead.

My scowl deepened. Not a chance.

I slammed my finger against the speed button, pushing myself harder.

This wasn’t just about running anymore.

It was about proving I wouldn’t back down.
###Chapter 278

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, painting the room in warm hues. Lillian stretched beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming from the intensity of last night’s mating bond. The scent of cedar and musk clung to her skin—Sebastian’s scent—a reminder of the passion that had consumed them both.

She turned her head, expecting to find him beside her, but the space was empty. Only the faint indentation on the pillow and the lingering warmth of his body remained.

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Miss Lillian?" Sophia Delacroix, the head maid, peeked in, holding a silver tray with a steaming cup of coffee and a folded note. "Mr. Blackwood left early for a meeting. He asked me to give you this."

Lillian sat up, the sheets pooling around her waist as she took the note. Unfolding it, she recognized Sebastian’s bold, precise handwriting:

"Had urgent pack business. Meet me at the Blackwood Tower at noon. Wear the red dress."

Her lips curved into a smirk. Even in his absence, he was commanding.

Sophia set the tray on the bedside table. "Shall I draw you a bath, miss?"

Lillian shook her head. "No, thank you. I’ll take a shower."

As the maid left, Lillian reached for her phone, where a dozen missed calls and texts from Beatrice lit up the screen.

"Where the hell are you?! You disappeared last night!"
"Cassandra is spreading rumors that you got drunk and hooked up with some random guy!"
"CALL ME BACK!"

Lillian groaned. Of course Cassandra would twist things. She quickly typed back:

"I’m fine. At Sebastian’s. Long story. Meet me at the café in an hour."

She tossed the phone aside and stepped into the shower, letting the hot water wash away the remnants of last night’s intensity.

The Blackwood Tower loomed over the city, its sleek glass exterior reflecting the midday sun. Lillian adjusted the crimson dress Sebastian had chosen—a fitted, off-the-shoulder number that hugged her curves and made her feel both powerful and exposed.

The elevator doors opened directly into his office, where Sebastian stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, his back to her, phone pressed to his ear. His tailored suit emphasized the broad lines of his shoulders, and even from behind, his presence was magnetic.

He turned, his golden eyes locking onto hers, and ended the call. "You’re late."

"Traffic," she lied, crossing the room.

Sebastian closed the distance between them in two strides, his fingers brushing the bare skin of her shoulder. "This dress suits you."

Lillian arched a brow. "Is that why you picked it?"

His smirk was predatory. "Partly."

Before she could retort, his phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, his expression darkening. "We have a problem."

"What kind of problem?"

"Donovan."

Lillian stiffened. Her ex-fated mate had been quiet since their bond shattered, but she knew better than to assume he’d given up. "What did he do?"

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "He’s challenging my authority. Publicly."

A chill ran down her spine. "When?"

"Tonight." His fingers traced her collarbone, his touch at odds with the steel in his voice. "And he’s bringing Evelyn."

Lillian’s stomach twisted. Evelyn—Donovan’s new mate—was a calculated insult, a reminder of what he’d lost.

Sebastian’s grip tightened slightly. "You don’t have to face them."

She met his gaze. "Yes, I do."

His lips curved, approving. "Then we’ll make sure they regret it."

The promise in his voice sent a thrill through her. Whatever Donovan planned, he had no idea what was coming.

And neither did she.

Perspiration trickled down my spine as we maintained our relentless pace. My muscles burned, but surrender wasn't in my vocabulary. Morning jogs before lectures had conditioned me for this—my stamina could outlast most. Sebastian would soon discover my endurance matched his own. Retreat? Not when it came to physical training.

His piercing gaze locked onto mine as he increased the treadmill speed again. Within moments, our legs became indistinguishable blurs against the machine's whirring surface. My lungs screamed for respite, each breath searing like fire. Yet Sebastian appeared unaffected—predictable, given the grueling trials he'd undoubtedly endured.

Pride prevented me from showing weakness. I needed to demonstrate my worth, to prove I belonged in this world of Lycan elite. The thought fueled my determination even as my body protested.

The world tilted abruptly. Before I could process the misstep, I catapulted off the treadmill, skidding across the polished floor. Sebastian halted both machines instantly, his frame appearing beside me before the pain registered.

White-hot agony lanced through my ankle, bringing involuntary tears to my eyes.

"Let me see." His voice held unexpected concern as he reached for my injury.

I batted his hand away, jaw clenched. This setback couldn't derail my preparations—not with the competition looming. He captured my wrist effortlessly, his other hand already probing the swelling joint.

"Sprained," he pronounced with a frown. "What possessed you to challenge me? Recklessness serves no one."

I blinked away moisture, studying the angry discoloration. Lycan healing would mend it overnight, but tonight's training plans evaporated before my eyes. Arms it would have to be—assuming I could reach the weights.

"You're seeing a physician." His arms shifted as if to carry me.

Instinct took over. I twisted free, biting back a whimper as weight settled on the injured limb. Using the wall for support, I straightened with deliberate calm. "I'll manage. My workout isn't finished."

Each hobbled step sent fresh jolts of pain radiating up my leg. Sebastian's shadow fell across me before his hand closed around my bicep.

"You're incapacitated," he ground out, golden eyes flashing with barely restrained frustration.

With surprising strength, I wrenched free. "You may command my tutoring hours, Sebastian Blackwood, but not my training regimen." My chin lifted. "I know my limits. The ankle can wait—my preparation cannot."

His expression darkened as I turned away. The grip that halted me this time brooked no argument.

###Chapter 279

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s estate. The golden hues of twilight painted the sky, casting long shadows across the sprawling gardens below. She exhaled slowly, her breath forming a faint mist in the cool evening.

Inside, the grand hall buzzed with activity. The annual Lycan Council gathering was in full swing, and the mansion was filled with powerful werewolves from across the region. Lillian could hear the low hum of conversations, the clinking of crystal glasses, and the occasional burst of laughter.

She had been avoiding the crowd, needing a moment to herself. The weight of recent events pressed heavily on her shoulders—Donovan’s betrayal, Evelyn’s smug glares, and the ever-present tension between her and Sebastian.

A familiar presence approached from behind.

“Hiding?” Sebastian’s deep voice sent a shiver down her spine.

Lillian didn’t turn. “Just needed some air.”

He stepped beside her, his towering frame casting a shadow over her. The scent of sandalwood and something distinctly him enveloped her senses.

“You’ve been avoiding me,” he remarked, his tone unreadable.

She finally looked up at him. His piercing silver eyes held an intensity that made her pulse quicken. “I’ve been busy.”

A smirk tugged at his lips. “Liar.”

Before she could retort, the doors to the balcony burst open. Beatrice rushed out, her cheeks flushed. “Lillian! You need to see this.”

Lillian frowned. “What’s wrong?”

Beatrice grabbed her wrist, dragging her back inside. “Evelyn just announced something insane.”

Sebastian followed, his expression darkening. The crowd in the hall had gone eerily silent, all eyes fixed on Evelyn, who stood at the center of the room with Donovan at her side.

Evelyn’s voice rang out, dripping with triumph. “Donovan and I are expecting a child.”

A collective gasp rippled through the room.

Lillian’s stomach dropped.

Donovan met her gaze, his expression unreadable.

And then—

The chandelier above them shattered.

Glass rained down as screams erupted.

Sebastian yanked Lillian against him, shielding her with his body.

When the chaos settled, Lillian’s eyes locked onto the figure standing in the doorway.

A woman—tall, regal, with eyes like molten gold.

“Hello, little sister,” she purred.

Lillian’s blood ran cold.

Isabella Fontaine.

Her long-lost sister had returned.

And she wasn’t alone.

Behind her stood a dozen armed warriors, their weapons drawn.

Sebastian’s grip on Lillian tightened.

“Well,” Isabella said, her lips curling into a wicked smile. “This just got interesting.”

"That's none of your concern," I nearly snarled, my patience wearing thin. "Just let me do this without you hovering over me like some overbearing shadow."

I turned away, gritting my teeth as I limped toward the weightlifting area. At least here, I could sit down and still get a decent workout without putting too much strain on my injured ankle.

Starting with the lighter weights, I settled onto the bench and picked up a 30-pound dumbbell. After a few sets, I moved up to something heavier, my muscles burning with exertion. Glancing around, I noticed the gym was filled with towering, muscular men and a few equally intimidating women lifting weights that looked like they could crush me without effort.

It was enough to make me feel small, but I refused to let it shake me. I focused on my own routine, pushing through the growing ache in my ankle.

"You competing?"

The voice came from a woman on the bench next to mine. She was loading up a barbell with plates, her arms corded with muscle. Her sharp gaze flicked toward me, waiting for an answer.

Realizing she was speaking to me, I nodded.

"Yeah," I said.

"What pack?"

"Redmoon."

Her eyes swept over me, assessing. Then, without hesitation, she commanded, "Spot me."

The demand was so abrupt I nearly flinched. She wasn’t asking—she was telling. I wanted to protest, to say I could barely stand, let alone catch a falling barbell. But pride kept my mouth shut. I wouldn’t let her see weakness.

Biting back a wince, I forced myself to stand and moved behind her, positioning my hands just beneath the bar.

She lay back, gripping the barbell with ease, her muscles flexing as she lifted it effortlessly.

"You competing too?" I asked, trying to distract myself from the throbbing in my ankle.

"Yep," she grunted between reps. "Name’s Genevieve. Most call me Gen."

The weight descended faster than she intended, and her breath hitched. Instinct kicked in—I lunged forward, grabbing the bar just before it could slam into her chest. The sudden movement sent a sharp crack through my ankle, pain shooting up my leg like lightning. Tears pricked my eyes, but I blinked them away, forcing the barbell back onto the rack.

Genevieve sat up, panting, her hand pressed to her chest.

"Damn," she muttered, eyeing me with newfound respect. "You’re quick. Thanks."

I swallowed hard, my lower lip stinging where I’d bitten it. "No problem," I managed, my voice tight. "I should go. Nice meeting you."

I turned to leave, each step sending fresh agony through my leg. The damage was worse now—I wasn’t sure I could even walk properly, let alone compete.

I was halfway to the exit when warmth draped over my shoulders. Before I could react, strong arms lifted me off the ground, and suddenly, I was airborne.
###Chapter 280

The morning sun cast golden rays through the sheer curtains of Lillian's bedroom, stirring her awake. She stretched lazily, her muscles still sore from yesterday's intense training session with Professor Montclair. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted up from the kitchen, signaling that Giselle had already begun her morning duties.

Lillian's phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Beatrice lit up the screen: "Emergency brunch. Meet me at The Velvet Bean in 30. Wear something cute."

She groaned, rubbing her eyes. Beatrice's "emergencies" usually involved some new scandal or another disastrous date. Still, Lillian couldn't resist her best friend's dramatics.

Downstairs, the mansion was already alive with activity. Lucien was humming a French tune while flipping pancakes, his usual flirtatious grin in place as he winked at one of the maids. Sebastian sat at the head of the dining table, engrossed in a stack of documents, his sharp features softened only slightly by the presence of Oliver, who was enthusiastically recounting his latest school project.

"Morning," Lillian murmured, pouring herself a cup of coffee.

Sebastian glanced up, his piercing gaze locking onto hers. "Sleep well?"

"Like a log," she lied, ignoring the way her pulse quickened under his scrutiny.

Oliver tugged at her sleeve. "Lillian! You have to see the robot I built! It can walk and everything!"

She ruffled his hair. "After brunch, promise."

Thirty minutes later, Lillian slid into the booth across from Beatrice at The Velvet Bean, their favorite café. Gabrielle, the barista, shot her a knowing smile before bringing over her usual—a caramel macchiato with an extra shot of espresso.

Beatrice leaned forward, eyes gleaming. "Okay, spill. What's going on with you and Sebastian?"

Lillian nearly choked on her coffee. "What? Nothing!"

"Uh-huh. That's why you've been sneaking glances at him like a lovesick puppy?"

Lillian groaned, burying her face in her hands. "It's complicated."

Beatrice smirked. "Isn't it always?"

Before Lillian could retort, her phone buzzed again. This time, it was a message from Donovan: "We need to talk. Alone."

Her stomach twisted. After everything—his betrayal, his engagement to Evelyn—what could he possibly want now?

Beatrice frowned at her expression. "What's wrong?"

Lillian exhaled sharply. "Donovan just texted me."

Beatrice's eyes widened. "Oh hell no. What does that snake want?"

Lillian shook her head. "I don't know, but I have a bad feeling about this."

The café door chimed, and Lillian's blood ran cold as Evelyn walked in, her arm linked possessively with Donovan's. His gaze immediately found Lillian's, dark and unreadable.

Beatrice hissed under her breath. "Speak of the devil."

Donovan approached their table, his voice low. "Lillian. We need to talk. Now."

Lillian clenched her fists under the table. "Whatever you have to say, say it here."

Evelyn smirked, her nails digging into Donovan's arm. "Oh, this should be good."

Donovan ignored her, his eyes never leaving Lillian's. "It's about Sebastian. You don't know what he's capable of."

Lillian's heart pounded. "And you do?"

A shadow crossed Donovan's face. "More than you think."

The air between them crackled with tension. Beatrice grabbed Lillian's hand under the table, a silent show of support.

Lillian lifted her chin. "If you have something to say, say it. Otherwise, leave."

Donovan's jaw tightened. "Fine. But don't say I didn't warn you."

As he turned to leave, Evelyn shot Lillian a venomous glare. "You'll regret this."

The moment they were gone, Beatrice exhaled sharply. "What the hell was that about?"

Lillian's mind raced. What did Donovan know about Sebastian? And why was he so determined to warn her?

She took a shaky sip of her coffee. "I don't know. But I intend to find out."

Beatrice squeezed her hand. "Whatever it is, we'll figure it out together."

Lillian nodded, but unease settled deep in her chest. Something was coming—something dark. And she had a feeling it would change everything.

Sebastian's POV


She was utterly reckless. Every fiber of my being screamed to snatch her up, toss her over my shoulder, and haul her out of there. But I couldn’t—not with so many eyes watching. If word got back to Maximilian, it would complicate everything. Keeping her hidden meant staying under the radar. Yet, how could I focus on my own training when she was out there, worsening her injury with every stubborn step?

I ducked into the locker room, grabbing my gear and Lillian’s backpack, which I’d stashed in my locker earlier. The moment her ridiculous defiance crumbled, I was dragging her straight to the resort’s medical wing.

Exiting the locker room, I scanned the gym until I spotted her near the weights. At least she was favoring her uninjured ankle—small mercies. Maybe she wasn’t completely hopeless.

Then, of course, she proved me wrong.

A competitor—some girl with a smug smirk—started chatting with her. The gym’s noise drowned out their words, but I didn’t need to hear them to know trouble was brewing.

Then it happened.

A dumbbell slipped, plummeting toward the girl’s foot. Lillian moved like lightning, catching it midair before impact. The sharp crack of her ankle giving way was unmistakable. Her face twisted in agony, but she schooled her features instantly, forcing a tight-lipped smile.

Why?

Who was this girl to her?

As Lillian limped away and the competitor wandered off, I intercepted her before she could collapse. Not that she was getting far—her ankle was clearly shattered. She swayed, nearly buckling, until I draped my coat over her shoulders and swept her into my arms.

For a heartbeat, she glared up at me, dark eyes flashing defiance. Then pain won. Her resolve shattered like her bones. A shaky exhale escaped her as she sagged against my chest, forehead creased in torment.

I tightened my hold, storming toward the exit. A few paparazzi lurked near the doors, cameras poised. I snarled at them, shielding Lillian’s face with the coat. Not today.

Thankfully, I knew this resort well—it belonged to an old friend’s family. The medical wing was just around the corner.

“Alpha Blackwood?” The receptionist gasped as I barged in. Her gaze darted to Lillian, and she bolted upright.

“Her ankle. Now,” I gritted out, depositing Lillian onto a gurney. The swelling was grotesque—her skin stretched taut, flushed an angry red. Sweat beaded her pallid face; she was barely conscious, lost in a haze of pain.

“We’ll take care of her, Alpha,” Dr. Whitmore assured, rushing in. The receptionist must’ve alerted him the second we arrived.

Good. Because if anyone failed her now, they’d answer to me.

hands

Dr. Alistair Whitmore was an exceptional physician, and I knew Lillian would receive the best care under his supervision. She was here now, surrounded by medical professionals who would ensure her recovery. I watched as they wheeled her into the emergency room, a flurry of doctors and nurses moving with practiced efficiency around her... She would be fine.

I could leave at any moment now...

I should leave...

Lillian’s POV

When consciousness returned, I found myself in an unfamiliar space. The sharp, sterile scent and the neatly arranged beds told me I was in some kind of infirmary. My gaze wandered the room until it settled on a figure slumped in a chair beside my bed, fast asleep.

“Sebastian?” My voice came out hoarse. I cleared my throat and tried again, louder this time, startling him awake.

His eyes snapped open, instantly locking onto mine. “You’re awake,” he murmured, relief softening his features. “How are you feeling?”

I shifted slightly, testing my body’s response. “Better, I think. What happened?”

His expression darkened. “Just as I feared—you aggravated your ankle injury further. The pain was so severe you lost consciousness when I brought you here. They had to perform surgery to realign the bone.”


###Chapter 281

My stomach twisted into knots as I stared at the thick cast encasing my leg. This couldn’t be happening. Frantically, I searched the room for a clock, praying there was still time for me to heal before the competition.

Sebastian’s voice cut through my panic. "It’s nearly dawn. We’ve been here for hours."

His words hit me like a punch to the gut. Dawn meant no time left. I was going to be disqualified—or worse, humiliate myself in front of everyone. This was my one chance to prove myself, and now it was slipping through my fingers.

Before I could spiral further, the doctor entered, his expression calm but firm.

"Miss Lillian, you must stay off this leg for the next 24 to 48 hours. Your wolf’s healing will kick in now that we’ve properly reset the bone," he said, offering a reassuring smile. "I’ve also given you something to speed up the process."

"Thank you," I murmured, though gratitude warred with frustration. The medicine wouldn’t work fast enough.

The doctor nodded, then bowed slightly to Sebastian before leaving.

Sebastian arched a brow. "Are you actually going to listen to him and rest?"

I pressed my lips together.

"Doesn’t seem like I have a choice," I muttered.

"No, you don’t," he said, his voice low, laced with quiet authority. "I have business to attend to today. I trust you’ll stay put."

He turned to leave, but I blurted out, "Did you stay with me all night?"

He paused, shoulders tensing. "What?"

"Did you stay?" I repeated, louder this time.

Silence stretched between us before he finally glanced over his shoulder, his dark eyes locking onto mine.

"Yes."

"Why?" My voice cracked, betraying the tears I was fighting to hold back. I didn’t want his pity—not now, not ever.

His answer was simple, yet it sent my heart racing.

"I didn’t want you to wake up alone."

With that, he walked out, leaving me staring at the door, wondering where he was going—and if it had anything to do with the competition.

Should I be involved?

A groan escaped me. Helpless. Weak. Stuck in this damn bed.

The door burst open, and Beatrice rushed in, throwing her arms around me. "I’m listed as your emergency contact, so they called me after your surgery."

"I think I just ruined everything," I whispered, tears finally spilling over.

"No, you didn’t," she insisted, squeezing me tighter. "There’s still a way."

"My leg is broken, Beatrice. The competition starts today."

"We’ll figure it out," she promised.

Exhaustion and pain meds pulled me under, and when I woke again, it was to an unexpected presence.

Beta Benedict stood at the foot of my bed, clipboard in hand. Beatrice followed, her grin wide enough to split her face.

"What’s going on?" I asked, glancing between them.

"She came to us and explained your situation," Benedict said, tapping his pen against the clipboard. "We’ve rescheduled you for tomorrow morning."

My breath caught. "Are you serious?"

He nodded. "You have her to thank. She was… persistent."

As soon as he left, Beatrice squealed and hugged me again.

I couldn’t believe it. I still had a chance.

"Thank you," I breathed.

She smirked. "Told you we’d figure it out."

And she was right.

We would.

###Chapter 282

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains, painting delicate patterns across the silk sheets. Lillian stirred, her body still humming with the lingering warmth of Donovan’s embrace. She stretched lazily, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her.

A soft knock at the door interrupted the quiet.

"Miss Lillian?" Harper’s voice, gentle yet firm, carried through the wood. "Breakfast is ready. Mr. Blackwood is waiting for you downstairs."

Lillian sighed, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. "I’ll be down in a minute."

She swung her legs over the edge of the bed, her bare feet sinking into the plush carpet. The events of last night replayed in her mind—Donovan’s whispered promises, the way his hands had traced her skin, the heat of his lips against hers. A shiver ran down her spine.

But reality crashed in quickly.

Sebastian Blackwood was waiting.

She dressed swiftly, choosing a simple yet elegant dress that hugged her curves. A quick glance in the mirror confirmed she looked presentable—though the faint blush on her cheeks betrayed her thoughts.

Downstairs, the dining room was bathed in soft morning light. Sebastian sat at the head of the table, impeccably dressed as always, his sharp gaze flickering up as she entered.

"Good morning," he said, his voice smooth.

"Morning," Lillian replied, sliding into her seat.

The table was laden with an array of dishes—fluffy pancakes, fresh fruit, and steaming coffee. But despite the spread, tension hung thick in the air.

Sebastian set down his newspaper. "We need to talk."

Lillian’s fingers tightened around her fork. "About?"

"Donovan."

Her breath hitched.

Sebastian leaned forward, his eyes darkening. "I know he was here last night."

Lillian’s pulse spiked. "How—?"

"Because this is my house," he cut in, his tone icy. "Nothing happens here without me knowing."

She swallowed hard. "It wasn’t what you think."

"Then enlighten me."

The challenge in his voice was unmistakable. Lillian hesitated, her mind racing. She couldn’t deny it—Donovan had come to her, seeking forgiveness, seeking her. But she also couldn’t ignore the way Sebastian’s jaw clenched, the barely restrained fury simmering beneath his composed exterior.

Before she could respond, the front door burst open.

"Father!" Oliver’s voice echoed through the hall, followed by the patter of small feet.

Sebastian’s expression shifted instantly, his stern mask softening as his son barreled into the room.

Lillian exhaled in relief—but it was short-lived.

Because behind Oliver stood Evelyn, Donovan’s new mate, her eyes burning with accusation.

And in that moment, Lillian knew—

The storm was just beginning.

Lillian's POV

"Are you absolutely certain your foot is alright?" Beatrice asked, trailing after me around our lavish suite. It was late in the evening, the first round of the competition having just concluded. I'd managed to catch the last hour of it after being discharged from the resort's urgent care. Beatrice and I had found seats in the audience, cheering on the competitors with the rest of the crowd.

Sebastian had already been eliminated, and watching his defeat had been brutal. I deliberately avoided looking at him where he sat among the other Lycans in the front row. It infuriated me how effortlessly handsome he looked, how badly I still wanted to tear that tailored suit off his body. Just the memory of his touch sent shivers down my spine.

"Did you hear a single word I just said?" Beatrice waved a hand in front of my face, snapping me back to reality.

"Sorry," I muttered, turning toward the closet. I pulled out a sleek black dress I'd brought for the occasion and glanced at her. "What did you say?"

"I asked if your foot was really okay. You don’t have to go to this dinner, you know. You didn’t compete today."

"I know," I said, smoothing the fabric of the dress. "But I want to be there to support the others."

"You could always come with me instead," she offered.

"I already promised some of the girls I’d hit the bar with them tonight," Beatrice said with an apologetic shrug. "Sorry."

"Go have fun. Don’t worry about me," I told her, pulling her into a quick hug. "And yes, my foot is fine. The swelling’s already gone down, and it’s only been a few hours."

It still ached, but the pain was manageable. If I took it easy and didn’t push myself too hard, I’d be ready to compete tomorrow morning. I slipped into the dress while Beatrice helped me with my hair and makeup. I wanted to make a strong impression at this dinner. Every night this week, there would be a formal gathering for the competitors. Attendance wasn’t mandatory, but showing up left a mark.

After saying goodbye to Beatrice for the evening, I headed straight for the party room. Once again, I had to rely on the resort map—and more than once, I found myself hopelessly lost. Eventually, I stumbled upon the right place.

Sebastian's POV

"You’re seriously going to this dinner?" Julian asked, his brow furrowed as he studied me.

The elevator doors slid open, and I stepped out, Julian close behind. The paparazzi immediately swarmed, cameras flashing. I paused long enough to humor them with a few posed shots—I wasn’t completely heartless.

After a minute, Julian smoothly extracted me from the photographers, steering me toward the party room.

"I figured I should make an appearance at least once," I murmured.

We reached the grand hall, and I stepped inside. The room was alive with chatter, filled with eager fans and competitors dressed in their finest. The decor was impeccable, the atmosphere buzzing with energy. These events were always formal affairs.

"Alpha Blackwood, what a pleasant surprise," Alpha Voss greeted me, handing me a glass of wine.

I frowned at him. I didn’t trust him—especially not with Lillian staying in the same resort. There was no telling what he might do if he discovered what had happened between us.

"We missed you at last night’s banquet. It was meant to kick off the competition," Voss continued, taking a slow sip of his wine.

I barely suppressed a scoff. "Prior engagements," I replied coolly.

His smile didn’t reach his eyes. "Of course. Well, I’m glad you could join us tonight."

I scanned the room, my gaze instinctively searching for her. And then—there she was. Lillian, standing near the entrance, looking breathtaking in that dress.

My pulse spiked.

This was going to be a long night.


“I arrived quite late,” I lied smoothly, keeping my voice light. “Needed some rest.”

“Understandable,” Levi—no, Maximilian—replied, his glacial gaze piercing through me. “You’ve been occupied. I wouldn’t dare disturb you.”

The last thing I wanted was to linger here, exchanging hollow pleasantries under the scrutiny of the other Lycans. Their stares burned with the usual cocktail of envy and bitterness, so I made it a habit to avoid them whenever possible.

Then my breath hitched.

Lillian.

She stepped through the doorway, her dress clinging to her toned frame like liquid silk. It was almost surreal how effortlessly she could shift from looking like a warrior to a goddess. My gaze slid down her long, sculpted legs—and my stomach twisted.

No cast.

Her ankle was supposed to be injured.

She moved hesitantly, her fingers pressed against her stomach as if she might vomit at any second. Nervous. Too nervous.

What the hell was she doing here?

This wasn’t just reckless—it was suicidal. Coming to a gathering like this, where every pair of eyes was a potential threat? Did she want to get caught?

Or worse—did she want them to know?

###Chapter 283

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s mansion. The golden hues of twilight painted the sky, casting long shadows across the sprawling estate. She exhaled slowly, her breath forming a faint mist in the cool evening.

Inside, the grand hall buzzed with activity. The annual Lycan Summit was in full swing, and dignitaries from various packs mingled beneath the glittering chandeliers. Lillian’s fingers tightened around the railing as she caught sight of Donovan across the room, his arm draped possessively around Evelyn’s waist. A bitter taste filled her mouth, but she forced herself to look away.

“You shouldn’t let him get to you.”

The deep, velvety voice sent a shiver down her spine. Sebastian appeared beside her, his piercing emerald eyes studying her with quiet intensity. He leaned against the railing, his broad shoulders blocking out the noise from inside.

“I’m not,” Lillian lied, crossing her arms. “I just needed some air.”

Sebastian smirked, the dimple in his cheek making an appearance. “You’re a terrible liar, little wolf.”

She huffed, but before she could retort, a commotion erupted inside. The crowd parted as Alpha Harrison strode in, his entourage of betas trailing behind him. Lillian’s stomach twisted. The last time she’d seen him, he’d tried to take advantage of her at a party.

Sebastian’s posture stiffened, his aura darkening. “Stay here,” he ordered, his tone leaving no room for argument.

But Lillian wasn’t one to follow orders blindly. She followed a few steps behind as Sebastian approached Alpha Harrison, their exchange tense.

“Blackwood,” Harrison sneered, his gaze flicking to Lillian. “Still keeping strays, I see.”

Sebastian’s growl was low, dangerous. “Watch your tongue, Harrison. Or I’ll remove it for you.”

The threat hung heavy in the air. Lillian’s pulse quickened, her wolf stirring beneath her skin. She had no love for Harrison, but she didn’t want a scene—not here, not now.

Then, a familiar scent caught her attention.

Oliver.

The little boy darted through the crowd, his face flushed with excitement. “Lillian!” he called, skidding to a stop beside her. “You have to see this!”

Distracted, she let Oliver tug her toward the gardens, away from the brewing tension. The moment they stepped outside, Oliver pointed to the sky.

Fireworks exploded in brilliant bursts of color, illuminating the night. Lillian’s breath caught.

“Sebastian arranged it,” Oliver whispered, grinning. “For you.”

Her heart skipped a beat.

But before she could process it, a sharp scream tore through the celebration.

Lillian spun around just in time to see Evelyn collapse, her body convulsing violently. Donovan’s panicked shouts echoed as he cradled her.

And then—

The lights went out.

Darkness swallowed the estate.

A chilling howl pierced the night.

Lillian’s instincts screamed.

Danger.

Fury ignited within me, my wolf's growl vibrating low in my throat. If I didn't rein him in soon, everyone would witness my complete loss of control. The energy radiating from me was palpable—soon the entire resort would feel its intensity.

Excusing myself from Maximilian, I stalked toward Lillian. My glare burned into her oblivious back—until she turned. Shock flashed across her face the moment our eyes met. Without a word, I seized her arm and hauled her from the party into the deserted hallway. She stumbled, wincing as her injured ankle twisted. Guilt pricked at me—that fracture hadn't fully healed despite the cast being off.

Pinning her against the wall, I felt her tremble beneath me. Fear? Desire? The uncertainty only fueled my frustration.

"You don't belong here. Trying to humiliate me?" My voice came out harsher than intended, laced with a bitterness I couldn't suppress.

"How does my presence affect you?" Lillian shot back, shoving against my chest. I grudgingly admired her defiance—she never cowered, never held her tongue with me. That fearless spark... it intoxicated me.

"Stalking me affects me," I murmured, my gaze dropping to her lips. The way she worried her lower lip between her teeth was distracting—a nervous habit that made me crave a taste. "Who said anything about stalking you?" Her eyes flickered to my mouth before meeting mine again, challenging.

"Then why are you here?"

"Maybe you should pay better attention," she retorted, pushing harder against me. "Now let me return to the party. I'm starving and the food's disappearing."

I nearly argued that she shouldn't be eating competitors' meals—that I could take her to town instead. An irrational urge surged to whisk her away from this place, to shield her from... everything. "You shouldn't be walking on that ankle," I warned.

Voices from the party room interrupted us—Maximilian and his Beta speaking near the door.

"Has Lillian Dumont arrived yet?"

"Not yet, Alpha. I'll notify you immediately."

"See that you do."

My brows furrowed. "Why would Alpha Maximilian be asking about you?" I demanded, slamming her back against the wall.

"How should I know?" she hissed. "None of your business."

A smirk tugged at my lips. "Did you come here to seduce me?" My breath ghosted across her cheek, eliciting another tremble. I knew that telltale shiver—she was moments away from surrendering to this tension between us. When it came to this game, I always played to win.

###Chapter 284

"Tristan is among my finest students," Maximilian continued explaining. "He'll be a formidable opponent."

Tristan puffed up like a preening peacock—was this some pathetic intimidation tactic?

I forced a smile, masking my irritation. "Is that so?"

"I had an excellent teacher," he said smoothly before abruptly changing subjects. "Are you here alone?"

The question caught me off guard. Blinking, I nodded. "Yes. My friend went elsewhere for dinner."

"Just a friend?" His probing gaze felt invasive.

I studied him in return—his posture, microexpressions. He was transparent, and I wondered if that carried into combat. We'd likely face each other eventually; I needed to research his fighting style.

Before I could respond, servers began distributing meals. Turning back, I found Tristan watching me with an unreadable expression that set my nerves on edge.

"I should take my seat," I said, gesturing toward the tables. "Pleasure meeting you."

With a slight bow to Alpha Maximilian, I retreated. Most seats were occupied except one beside mine. Had someone decided against attending? I should've joined Beatrice—this dinner yielded no useful intel. Every competitor here guarded their weaknesses like treasure.

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, illuminating the sleek marble floors. Lillian stretched lazily in the king-sized bed, the silk sheets cool against her skin. The scent of freshly brewed coffee wafted in from the kitchen, mingling with the faint trace of Sebastian’s cedarwood cologne still lingering in the air.

She had barely opened her eyes when her phone buzzed violently on the nightstand. Beatrice’s name flashed across the screen, followed by a string of frantic texts.

"Lil, you need to check the news. NOW."

Frowning, Lillian swiped open the latest headlines—and her breath hitched.

"LYCAN CHAIRMAN SEBASTIAN BLACKWOOD SPOTTED WITH FORMER FATED MATE EVELYN AT LUXURY RESORT—IS LILLIAN OUT OF THE PICTURE?"

A grainy paparazzi photo accompanied the article, showing Sebastian and Evelyn standing close together near a private cabana, their expressions unreadable. The caption beneath it was even worse: "Sources claim the Lycan Alpha has rekindled his bond with his ex-fated mate, leaving college student Lillian heartbroken."

Lillian’s fingers trembled as she scrolled through the comments.

"Knew she was just a rebound."
"Evelyn is way more suited for a man like Sebastian."
"Poor girl. She never stood a chance."

Her wolf stirred restlessly inside her, a low growl rumbling in her chest. This isn’t true, she told herself. Sebastian wouldn’t—

The bedroom door creaked open, and Sebastian strode in, his tailored suit immaculate, his dark hair slightly tousled from the morning breeze. His golden eyes flickered with concern the moment he saw her expression.

"Lillian?" His deep voice was laced with worry. "What’s wrong?"

She wordlessly turned the screen toward him.

His jaw tightened as he scanned the article, his grip on his coffee cup turning white-knuckled. "This is bullshit."

Lillian swallowed hard. "Then explain it."

Sebastian exhaled sharply, setting the cup down before sitting beside her. "Evelyn showed up unannounced at the resort. She wanted to discuss Victoria’s engagement—nothing more. The press twisted it."

Lillian wanted to believe him. But doubt slithered in, cold and insidious. "Why didn’t you tell me?"

"I didn’t think it was worth mentioning." His hand reached for hers, but she pulled back slightly.

A flicker of hurt crossed his face before his expression hardened. "You don’t trust me."

The accusation stung. "It’s not about trust," she whispered. "It’s about transparency."

Before he could respond, his phone rang—Theodore Whitmore’s name flashing on the screen. Sebastian answered tersely, his voice clipped. "What?"

Theodore’s urgent voice carried through the speaker. "Sir, Alpha Harrison is here. He’s demanding an audience regarding the article."

Sebastian’s eyes darkened. "Tell him I’ll be down in five."

He ended the call and stood, his gaze lingering on Lillian. "We’ll finish this conversation later."

As he strode out, the door clicking shut behind him, Lillian’s phone buzzed again—this time, a message from an unknown number.

"You really think a nobody like you can keep a man like Sebastian? Stay in your lane, sweetheart. Or I’ll make sure you regret it."

Her blood ran cold.

Because beneath the text was another attachment—a photo of her sleeping in Sebastian’s bed.

Taken last night.

Lillian's POV

"Oh, Lillian. There you are," Alpha Maximilian said as I approached. I forced a smile, still feeling flustered from my earlier conversation with Sebastian. My cheeks burned, and I discreetly touched them, hoping they weren’t as flushed as they felt.

If Maximilian noticed, he didn’t comment—or stare.

"You wanted to speak with me?" I asked.

He nodded, his gaze dropping briefly to my ankle.

"How’s the injury?" he inquired.

"Healing," I assured him. "By morning, it’ll be fine."

"Good," he said thoughtfully. "Ice it tonight and stay off it as much as possible." He gestured toward a nearby table. "Your seat is over there."

A small nameplate marked my place: Lillian Montague.

"Thank you, Alpha," I said, turning to leave—but he stopped me.

"Actually," he said, halting me mid-step, "I’d like to introduce you to someone."

I turned back, pasting on a polite smile. All I wanted was to sit down and get this dinner over with.

"Of course," I agreed.

He motioned for me to follow, and I did, ignoring Sebastian’s piercing stare from across the room. His dark eyes tracked me, lips pressed into a thin line. If he was annoyed that I was talking to his rival, this might be more entertaining than I thought. A smirk tugged at my lips, but I disguised it with a cough as I passed him.

We stopped in front of a young man—no older than me—engaged in conversation with a small group. His back was turned, but he was tall, with sleek black hair that fell to his shoulders. The kind of hair that made you want to run your fingers through it—or yank it in a fight.

Alpha Maximilian placed a firm hand on the small of my back, his grip tightening slightly on my hip. The possessive touch made me tense, but I stayed still.

"Tristan," Maximilian called.

The man turned, revealing forest-green eyes and a dimpled smile. He had the kind of pretty-boy face that probably charmed women effortlessly. Keeping them, though? That was another story. The way his grin widened when he saw me told me he’d be trouble for the next few weeks.

"Alpha Maximilian," Tristan said, dipping his head slightly. "What can I do for you?"

"I’d like you to meet Lillian Montague. She’s from the Redmoon Pack," Maximilian introduced. "Lillian, this is Tristan Whitlock of the Darkmoon Pack—my pack."

Tristan took my hand, pressing a kiss to my knuckles. The gesture felt overly familiar, but I kept my expression neutral.

"An honor, Miss Lillian," he said smoothly.

"Likewise," I replied.

I wasn’t sure why Maximilian had introduced us, but I had a feeling I’d find out soon enough.

###Chapter 285

"Tristan is one of my top students," Maximilian continued. "He’ll be a difficult opponent to beat."

Tristan looked smug. Was this some kind of intimidation tactic?

I forced another smile. "Is that so?"

"I had an excellent teacher," he said, then abruptly changed the subject. "Are you here alone?"

The question caught me off guard. I blinked. "Uh, yes. My friend had other plans."

"Just a friend?" he pressed.

"Yes," I said, studying him. His expressions were easy to read—confident, flirtatious, a little too self-assured. If he fought the way he talked, he’d be predictable. Still, I’d need to research his techniques before we inevitably faced off.

Before I could respond, servers began bringing out the food. Tristan watched me with an unreadable expression that set me on edge.

"I should take my seat," I said, gesturing toward my table. "It was nice meeting you."

I nodded politely to Alpha Maximilian before walking away.

Most guests were already seated, but one chair beside mine remained empty. Had someone decided not to come? Maybe I should’ve gone with Beatrice after all.

So far, this dinner wasn’t giving me any useful intel. Everyone was too careful, too guarded—hiding their weaknesses.

But I’d find them.

The crisp morning air carried the faint scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s estate. The sun had barely risen, casting a golden hue over the sprawling gardens below. She tightened the silk robe around her, the fabric whispering against her skin.

Last night had been a blur—heated arguments, whispered confessions, and the weight of Donovan’s betrayal still fresh in her mind. But today was different. Today, she had made a decision.

A soft knock at the door pulled her from her thoughts.

"Lillian?" Beatrice’s voice was gentle, laced with concern. "Are you alright?"

Lillian turned, forcing a small smile. "Just thinking."

Beatrice stepped inside, her dark curls bouncing as she crossed the room. "You’ve been quiet since last night. What’s going on?"

Lillian hesitated, then exhaled sharply. "I can’t keep pretending, Bea. Donovan chose Evelyn. And I—I need to move on."

Beatrice’s eyes softened. "You deserve better than him."

"I know." Lillian’s fingers curled around the balcony railing. "But it’s not just about Donovan anymore. It’s about me. What I want."

A flicker of understanding passed between them. Beatrice grinned. "So, what’s the plan?"

Lillian smirked. "First, I’m going to that gala tonight. Alone."

Beatrice’s brows shot up. "Sebastian’s annual charity event? The one where half the Lycan elite will be watching your every move?"

"Exactly." Lillian’s voice was steady, her resolve unshaken. "Let them watch."

Meanwhile, in the study downstairs, Sebastian Blackwood sifted through a stack of documents, his expression unreadable. Theodore Whitmore stood by the window, arms crossed.

"You’re sure about this?" Theodore asked.

Sebastian didn’t look up. "She’s stronger than she thinks."

Theodore sighed. "And if Donovan shows up?"

A shadow crossed Sebastian’s face. "Then he’ll regret it."

The air between them grew heavy. Theodore nodded once before turning to leave. Just as he reached the door, Sebastian spoke again.

"Tell Marcus to double security tonight. I won’t take any chances."

Theodore paused. "You think there’ll be trouble?"

Sebastian’s lips curled into a cold smile. "I’m counting on it."

As evening fell, the grand ballroom glittered under crystal chandeliers. Lillian descended the staircase in a sleek emerald gown, the fabric hugging her curves before cascading to the floor in delicate waves. Every head turned.

Whispers followed her like shadows.

"Is that Donovan’s ex?"
"I heard she’s staying with Sebastian now."
"Poor thing—abandoned by her fated mate."

Lillian ignored them, her chin lifted.

Then, across the room, her gaze locked onto a familiar figure.

Donovan.

And beside him, Evelyn, her hand possessively wrapped around his arm.

Lillian’s pulse spiked, but she didn’t falter. Instead, she strode forward—straight toward them.

Donovan’s eyes widened. "Lillian—"

She didn’t let him finish. With a smile that didn’t reach her eyes, she raised her glass. "To new beginnings."

And then she walked right past him.

Straight into Sebastian’s waiting arms.

The room erupted in murmurs.

Sebastian’s fingers brushed her waist, his voice low. "Bold move."

Lillian met his gaze, her own burning with defiance. "You haven’t seen anything yet."

The low hum of conversation filled the dining hall, but my attention was drawn to the two girls at the table beside mine. I studied them discreetly—the way one nervously bounced her knee, the other drumming her fingers against the tablecloth. Every detail mattered. The competition didn’t begin in the arena; it started the moment we stepped off the plane.

Every second was a test. Every interaction, a potential advantage—or a fatal misstep.

Then I felt it—an unmistakable presence sliding into the seat beside me. My breath hitched as I turned, and my stomach twisted.

Tristan Whitlock.

His lips curled into that infuriating smirk as his gaze raked over me. Of course, he’d be seated right next to me. Just my luck.

“What are you doing?” I hissed under my breath.

He plucked the nameplate from the table and dangled it in front of me. My eyes widened. His seat. Naturally.

“So,” he murmured, leaning in so close his breath tickled my ear, “are you seeing anyone?”

I jerked back, glaring. “None of your business.”

His grin only widened. “What if I wanted to take you out?”

Arrogant bastard.

“I don’t date the competition,” I snapped, finally meeting his gaze. He was too close, too smug—too everything.

Then—CRASH.

The sound of shattering porcelain ripped through the room. Every head whipped toward the source. My heart lurched as I turned to see Sebastian Blackwood standing rigid, his plate shattered across the table. Food splattered everywhere. His eyes—those piercing, wolf-bright eyes—burned with barely restrained fury.

The entire room froze. Even the other Lycans gaped, stunned.

Only Alpha Maximilian Voss remained unbothered, sipping his wine with a smirk. Had he provoked this? The silence was so thick I could hear my own pulse thundering in my ears.

“What the hell was that?” Tristan muttered.

“No idea,” I breathed, my throat tight. Sebastian wasn’t looking at me—he was glaring at the room like it had personally offended him. His lips moved, but the words were too low for even my enhanced hearing to catch.

Then, without another word, he turned on his heel and stormed out.

My chest constricted. A strange, urgent pull tugged at me—follow him. Make sure he’s okay. Whatever had set him off, it had been explosive. And dangerous.

Servants scurried to clean the mess while murmurs rose among the Lycans. The scent of freshly served food wafted through the air, but my appetite was gone.

“Excuse me,” I said abruptly, standing. “I need the restroom.”

No one questioned it. The second I was out of sight, I quickened my pace, slipping into the hallway. The silence here was eerie—deliberate.

Where had he gone?

I moved swiftly, my pulse racing. Something was wrong. And I needed to find out what.

My entire body went rigid—was someone watching me?

Before I could utter a word, strong fingers closed around my wrist. I whirled around, my pulse skyrocketing as I was yanked into a nearby supply closet and pinned against the cold wall. That familiar sandalwood-and-iron scent, the muscular frame pressing against me—there was no mistaking who it was.

"S...Sebastian?" I gasped.

His low chuckle vibrated against my ear as his teeth grazed my lobe. "How sweet—you remembered." I squirmed beneath him, but his grip only tightened, his body molding against mine like a second skin.

"Let me go!" I demanded, my voice trembling despite my anger.

"Why? So you can run back to your precious Tristan?" His words dripped venom, the barely restrained fury making my blood run cold.

Was this jealousy? The realization hit me like a physical blow. Sebastian Blackwood, the untouchable Lycan chairman, was jealous over me?

"I should've torn his throat out when I had the chance," he growled, the predatory edge in his voice raising goosebumps along my arms.

His lips traced the sensitive curve of my neck, and I swear my heart threatened to break free from my ribcage. The contrast between his gentle touch and lethal words sent my senses into overdrive.

"Next time I see his hands on you..." His mouth hovered millimeters from mine, our breaths mingling. "I'll make sure he never touches anything again."

###Chapter 286

"I'm fine," I assured Rosalind, pulling my gaze away from Sebastian to look at her as she fussed over me. It was true—I could feel my wounds knitting together as my wolf channeled her healing energy through me. "I'll be completely healed by tomorrow. My wolf is taking care of it."

"Thank the Moon Goddess for that," Rosalind sighed, pulling me into a quick hug before stepping back. "I saw Genevieve outside. She's just getting checked by the nurses, but she’ll be in to see you soon." I nodded, not wanting them to make a big deal out of my injuries.

"I'm fine, really," I repeated, offering them a reassuring smile. "Don't worry about me."

Rosalind grinned, her eyes lighting up with mischief. "I was thinking we should have a girls' night. After everything that happened, we could all use some relaxation and good old-fashioned gossip."

"That sounds amazing," I admitted, "but I'm kind of stuck here." I lifted my arm, showing her the IV still attached.

Just then, the doctor stepped in, his expression calm. "Actually, you're cleared to leave whenever you're ready," he said, carefully removing the IV and disconnecting me from the monitors. "Your wolf will have you fully healed by morning. There’s no need to keep you here overnight."

Sebastian didn’t linger—he excused himself abruptly and left without so much as a glance in my direction. I frowned at his retreating figure, irritation prickling under my skin. What the hell was his problem?

Once we were settled in the hotel suite, Rosalind plopped onto the couch with a contented sigh. "I'm so glad you're feeling better," she said, grabbing a handful of popcorn from the bowl on the side table.

Genevieve sat beside her, her own injuries minimal—just a few scratches and bruises, nothing serious. She had already been cleared for next week’s events.

Beatrice and I took the loveseat, and while she scrolled through movie options, my eyes caught on the dark bruises marring her wrist. The moment we’d returned to the suite, I’d noticed them, but every time I tried to ask, she brushed me off and changed the subject.

I didn’t need her to tell me who had done it. I already knew.

And Dominic Whitaker was going to regret it.

"I still can’t believe Alpha Sebastian stormed into the arena like that," Genevieve laughed, shaking her head. "Did you see his face? I thought he was going to rip someone apart."

"I wish I’d been there to see it," Beatrice sighed, leaning back against the cushions. She finally settled on a rom-com, her finger hovering over the play button, but she waited as we kept talking.

"Ugh, can’t we watch something with action?" Genevieve groaned, wrinkling her nose. "Romance movies are so cheesy."

"I love them," Rosalind countered, grinning.

"Of course you do," Genevieve muttered, rolling her eyes.

Ignoring their bickering, I turned to Beatrice. "Are you okay?" I asked quietly. "I mean, with you and Dominic."

Her expression darkened. "Why do you ask?"

I nodded pointedly at her wrist. "Because I’m not blind," I said, meeting her gaze. "Did you really think I wouldn’t notice?"

"Like I told Sebastian, I have it handled," she insisted, frustration edging her voice. "It’s fine. I’m fine."

My brows shot up. "Sebastian?" I echoed.

"All I’m saying is romance movies are ridiculous," Genevieve cut in, pulling my attention away. "And predictable."

"Says the girl who secretly cries at them," Rosalind shot back, crossing her arms.

Beatrice rolled her eyes. "I’m picking the movie, and I don’t want to hear another word about it," she declared, effectively ending the argument. She was clearly trying to avoid our earlier conversation.

She grabbed the remote and pressed play, giving them both a pointed look.

Just then, my phone buzzed on the coffee table. I snatched it up immediately, my pulse skipping when I saw the name on the screen.

Sebastian's kiss was featherlight at first, as if his ironclad self-control was beginning to fracture. A traitorous part of me didn't want him to stop - I adored this raw, possessive side of him... The way his jealousy over me made his carefully constructed composure unravel.

My fingers crept beneath his tailored shirt, tracing the sculpted ridges of his abdomen. His sharp inhale parted those sinful lips mere inches from mine as we danced on the precipice between desire and restraint.

With deliberate slowness, my hands mapped every defined muscle up his torso until they reached the broad expanse of his chest. Wrapping my arms around his neck, I pulled him down into a searing kiss.

That single touch shattered his restraint.

I felt the exact moment his Lycan instincts shifted from fury to all-consuming need.

Buttons scattered across the floor as he tore open his shirt, pinning me against the wall with his knee while his clever fingers made quick work of my dress zipper. His tongue traced my lower lip in a silent demand I eagerly granted, moaning as he explored my mouth with devastating precision.

The whisper of silk sliding down my body left me in nothing but black lace - the matching set I'd chosen specifically because it made me feel powerful. His darkened gaze raked over me with primal appreciation.

"Who are you trying to tempt, little wolf?" His voice was rough velvet.

"Maybe I just enjoy feeling desirable," I countered, arching into him.

A possessive growl vibrated against my throat as he reclaimed my lips in a kiss that bordered on painful. His teeth grazed my pulse point while his fingers slipped beneath delicate lace, finding me already slick with want. The deep rumble of approval against my skin sent fresh heat pooling low in my belly.

When he brought those glistening fingers to my lips, I tasted myself without hesitation - the intimate act only stoking the fire between us. My nails scored down his abdomen as he finally shed the last barriers between us, his impressive length pressing against my core.

The first slow thrust stole my breath. Every nerve ending came alive as he filled me completely, hitting that perfect angle with each deliberate movement. My gasps formed his name like a prayer - Sebastian, Sebastian, Sebastian - until the syllables blurred together in desperate worship.

In that moment, I needed him to understand - no other man could compare. My body, my soul, they answered to him alone. The possessive way his hands gripped my hips as he drove into me erased every other touch, every other claim.

Only Sebastian Blackwood could make me burn like this.

Time ceased to exist in the confines of the closet. There was only Sebastian and me, the heat between us unbearable, electric. Every movement sent shivers racing down my spine, his touch igniting a fire I couldn’t control. His thrusts grew deeper, more deliberate, each one drawing a gasp from my lips that he swiftly swallowed with a searing kiss.

His mouth trailed down my neck, teeth grazing my skin, leaving behind a trail of possessive marks. When his fingers found the sensitive bundle of nerves between us, teasing until I was trembling, I nearly cried out—only for his lips to silence me again.

"Sebastian—" My voice was a breathless plea, my nails digging into his shoulders as pleasure coiled tighter inside me.

He growled against my ear, the sound primal, sending another wave of heat through me. Then, with a final, devastating thrust, he pushed me over the edge, my body shuddering as pleasure crashed over me. Moments later, his own release followed, his breath hot against my skin as he buried himself deep.

In the darkness of the closet, there was nothing but the sound of our ragged breathing—and the knowledge that we were far from done.
###Chapter 287

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, illuminating the scattered papers on his desk. Lillian stirred in the plush armchair where she had fallen asleep, her fingers still loosely curled around a half-empty coffee mug.

She blinked away the remnants of sleep, her gaze landing on Sebastian’s broad back as he stood by the window, his phone pressed to his ear. His voice was low, controlled, but the tension in his shoulders betrayed his frustration.

"Understood," he said curtly before ending the call.

Lillian straightened, rubbing the stiffness from her neck. "Trouble?"

Sebastian turned, his piercing blue eyes locking onto hers. "Donovan’s making moves again."

A chill ran down her spine. She had hoped—foolishly—that after the last confrontation, Donovan would retreat. But he had always been relentless.

"What now?" she asked, rising to her feet.

"He’s trying to sway the council," Sebastian said, his jaw tightening. "Claiming I’m unfit to lead after the incident at the gala."

Lillian scoffed. "Because he’s such a paragon of leadership."

Sebastian’s lips twitched, but the amusement didn’t reach his eyes. "He’s using Evelyn to push the narrative. She’s been seen with several high-ranking members, whispering in their ears."

Lillian’s stomach twisted. Evelyn had always been cunning, but this was a new level of manipulation. "We need to counter it. Publicly."

Sebastian studied her for a long moment before nodding. "There’s a charity event tonight. The entire council will be there."

She exhaled sharply. "Perfect. We’ll show them exactly why you’re the rightful chairman."

A knock at the door interrupted them. Beatrice poked her head in, her usual cheerful demeanor replaced with urgency. "You need to see this."

She handed Lillian her phone. The screen displayed a breaking news headline: Lycan Chairman’s Illegitimate Child Scandal?

Lillian’s blood ran cold. Below the headline was a grainy photo of Oliver—Sebastian’s son—leaving school with a woman who bore a striking resemblance to Lillian.

Sebastian snatched the phone, his grip tightening until the screen cracked. "This is Donovan’s doing."

Lillian’s mind raced. "We need to get ahead of this before it spirals."

Sebastian’s phone buzzed again. He glanced at the screen, his expression darkening further. "The council has called an emergency meeting."

Lillian met his gaze, determination settling in her chest. "Then let’s not keep them waiting."

As they strode toward the door, she couldn’t shake the feeling that Donovan had just upped the stakes—and this time, he wasn’t playing fair.

But neither was she.

The air between us was thick with unspoken words as we remained pressed against each other, our breaths mingling in the charged silence. My body still trembled from the aftershocks of pleasure, every nerve alight with sensation. Donovan slowly withdrew from me, and a soft whimper escaped my lips at the sudden emptiness. He unpinned me from the wall, and I slid down, my legs barely able to hold me up.

Without a word, he dressed quickly, tossing my clothes toward me. My hands shook as I reached for them—not from the lingering pleasure, but from the storm of emotions raging inside me. It was overwhelming, terrifying even. I bit my lip hard, fighting back the tears threatening to spill.

"Why didn’t you tell me you were competing?" His voice was rough, strained, as he struggled with the zipper of my dress. I kept my back to him, unwilling to let him see the tears welling in my eyes. I hated how vulnerable I felt, how easily he could unravel me.

My throat tightened. "I tried."

His hands stilled. "What?"

"You were always so busy," I whispered, my voice barely audible. "I never got the chance. And then... I thought you were done with me. So I decided not to tell you at all."

A sharp inhale. Then his hands gripped my arms, spinning me around to face him. His dark eyes burned with something I couldn’t name. "Why the hell would you think that?"

I swallowed hard, blinking rapidly to keep the tears at bay. "You’ve been ignoring me for weeks," I said, my voice breaking. "I barely see you anymore."

His jaw clenched. "I told you—I’ve been busy."

"I know," I murmured, looking away. "But I just... I don’t know."

The silence stretched between us, heavy and suffocating. I cleared my throat, desperate to escape before I completely fell apart. "I should go back—"

As I moved to step past him, his hand shot out, fingers wrapping around my wrist, stopping me in my tracks. His breath was warm against my ear, his voice a low, intoxicating command that sent shivers down my spine.

"Come to my room tonight."

Alpha Maximilian Voss watched the door through which Lillian had just disappeared. He knew she was going to check on Sebastian. And he also knew she would come up with some flimsy excuse—maybe claiming she needed fresh air or had forgotten something outside.

The look on Lillian’s face when Sebastian had that violent reaction upon seeing her with another man told Maximilian everything he needed to know. He hadn’t been willing to take Donovan’s word at face value—he preferred to uncover the truth himself. But now, the evidence was undeniable.

Sebastian Blackwood was involved with Lillian Montague.

Alpha Maximilian’s gaze swept across the room until it landed on his daughter, Arabella. He had high expectations for her, though he knew deep down she wouldn’t win the entire competition, no matter how much she believed otherwise. He had far more promising students under his command. But Arabella had her uses—she was excellent at gathering gossip, extracting information, and keeping him updated on Miss Montague’s movements.

Then there was his other secret weapon.

He had deliberately placed Tristan Whitlock’s name card beside Lillian’s seat. He wanted Tristan to make his move—to charm her, to earn her trust, maybe even coax her into revealing something useful. Or, at the very least, provoke Sebastian into a reaction.

Sebastian wasn’t the kind of man who showed many weaknesses. But now that Maximilian had uncovered the truth about his entanglement with Lillian Montague, he realized—perhaps the formidable Lycan chairman did have a vulnerability after all.

Tristan caught Maximilian’s eye and smirked, giving him a subtle nod.

Everything was going exactly as planned.

###Chapter 288

The morning sun cast golden rays through the towering windows of the Blackwood estate, painting the grand foyer in warm hues. Lillian stretched lazily in her silk sheets, the events of last night still fresh in her mind. The gala had been a whirlwind of glittering gowns and whispered conversations, but it was Donovan’s unexpected appearance that had sent her pulse racing.

She rolled onto her side, fingers tracing the faint scar on her wrist—the mark of their broken bond. A bitter reminder of what once was.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Miss Lillian?" Harper’s voice was gentle but firm. "Mr. Blackwood requests your presence in the study."

Lillian sighed, pushing back the covers. "Tell him I’ll be down shortly."

She dressed quickly, opting for a simple emerald-green dress that accentuated her curves. As she descended the grand staircase, the scent of freshly brewed coffee and warm pastries drifted from the dining hall.

Sebastian stood by the fireplace, his broad shoulders silhouetted against the flickering flames. He turned as she entered, his piercing gaze locking onto hers.

"You’re late," he remarked, though there was no real irritation in his tone.

Lillian arched a brow. "And yet, you waited."

A smirk tugged at his lips. "I had a feeling you’d make it worth my while."

She crossed her arms. "What’s this about?"

Sebastian’s expression sobered. "We have a problem. Donovan’s been spotted near the northern border. He’s not alone."

Lillian’s stomach twisted. "Evelyn?"

He nodded. "And a small contingent of rogues. They’re testing our defenses."

She exhaled sharply. "He’s trying to provoke you."

"Or you," Sebastian countered.

Silence stretched between them, heavy with unspoken tension.

Lillian clenched her fists. "What do you want me to do?"

Sebastian stepped closer, his voice dropping to a low growl. "Stay close. If he wants a fight, he’ll get one. But not on his terms."

Before she could respond, the door burst open. Oliver rushed in, his small face flushed with excitement.

"Dad! There’s a wolf in the garden! A big one!"

Sebastian’s eyes flashed with alarm. He grabbed Oliver’s shoulders. "Where?"

"By the roses! It was staring right at me!"

Lillian didn’t wait for permission. She bolted outside, her bare feet slapping against the cold stone path. The garden was eerily quiet, the morning dew glistening on the petals.

Then she saw it—a massive black wolf lurking in the shadows, its golden eyes burning with recognition.

Donovan.

Her breath hitched. He hadn’t shifted in front of her since their bond shattered.

The wolf took a step forward, lips peeling back in a silent snarl.

Lillian stood her ground, heart pounding. "What do you want?"

A rustle in the bushes behind her made her whirl around. Evelyn emerged, her crimson lips curled in a mocking smile.

"Oh, Lillian," she purred. "Did you really think you could escape your past?"

The air crackled with tension.

Then, from the manor, Sebastian’s furious roar split the silence.

Lillian didn’t look back.

She ran.

I didn’t return to the dinner. The thought of dealing with Maximilian and his bullshit made my blood boil. He had pushed me to lose control in front of everyone, and now they would see me as nothing more than a beast. That wasn’t an image I wanted to confront tonight.

During the event, I shot a quick text to Marcus, my Beta, demanding confirmation on whether Lillian was truly competing. Moments later, he sent me the digital roster—and there she was, listed among the participants. My fists clenched. How could she keep something this important from me? How had she even gotten here? Did she fly commercial? I had a private jet—I could’ve brought her myself.

And who was with her? Did she come alone? Was she reckless enough to travel internationally without backup? The questions gnawed at me, a relentless itch I couldn’t ignore. I needed answers, and I wouldn’t rest until I had them.

I took a long, aimless walk through the resort grounds, my Gamma, Julian, trailing discreetly behind. He was skilled at blending into the shadows, only revealing himself when necessary. Eventually, I retreated to my suite, stripping off my formal wear and pulling on a pair of sweatpants and a loose T-shirt. Julian retreated to his own room—I valued my privacy, so I had booked separate accommodations for us both. I dismissed him for the night, assuring him I could handle myself.

But my mind was still reeling from the dinner. The memory of that bastard Maximilian leaning too close to Lillian, whispering God-knows-what into her ear, made my vision blur with fury. What had he said to make her cheeks flush like that?

A soft knock at the door snapped me from my thoughts.

I glanced at the clock—just past nine. I hadn’t realized how much time had slipped away. Crossing the room, I yanked the door open to find Lillian already turning to leave, her head bowed, her face burning crimson. She hadn’t expected me to answer—her knock had been so faint, she probably assumed I hadn’t heard. But with my Lycan hearing, even the slightest sound was amplified.

Before she could take another step, I seized her wrist and hauled her inside, slamming the door shut behind us. She gasped, stumbling into me as I wrapped my arms around her, pulling her flush against my chest.

"Where the hell were you going?" I growled.

She relaxed slightly in my grip, her breath warm against my skin.

"I... thought you might be asleep," she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper.

"Don’t lie to me, Lillian," I murmured, my lips grazing the curve of her cheek.

She exhaled shakily before daring to meet my gaze through her lashes. Her lips parted—whether to protest or explain, I didn’t care. I crushed my mouth to hers, kissing her with a hunger that bordered on desperation. She melted against me, her body pliant as I deepened the kiss, my tongue sweeping into her mouth, claiming every inch of her.

Something about her made me feral.

Her fingers slid up my torso, dragging my shirt off in one fluid motion. I tossed it aside and pulled her closer, my hands gripping her hips as I ground against her, guiding us toward the bed. She still wore that damn black dress—the one that made me want to tear it from her body. But I resisted. These events mattered to her, and I wouldn’t ruin it.

Instead, I took my time, slowly lowering the zipper until the fabric pooled at her feet. Lifting her effortlessly, I laid her onto the mattress, never breaking our kiss. This time, it was different—slower, more deliberate, charged with an intimacy that made my chest ache.

I nipped at the straps of her bra, tugging them down with my teeth until her breasts spilled free. She shivered beneath my touch, her nipples pebbled and begging for attention. I traced the delicate curves of her body, teasing her until goosebumps prickled her skin.

The way she responded to me—every hitch of her breath, every tremble—sent a dark thrill through me.

I smirked against her lips, savoring the effect I had on her.

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the marble floors of Blackwood Manor as Lillian tiptoed past Donovan's guest suite. Her breath hitched when she heard rustling inside. Pressing against the wall, she caught fragments of whispered conversation between Donovan and Evelyn.

"...must be done before the full moon," Donovan's voice carried through the cracked door.

Evelyn's reply came in hushed tones. "But what about Sebastian? He's already suspicious."

Lillian's pulse quickened. She leaned closer, her fingers digging into the wall's ornate molding.

A floorboard creaked beneath her foot.

Silence.

Then - rapid footsteps approaching the door.

Heart pounding, Lillian darted down the hallway, slipping into the nearest room - Sebastian's private study. She pressed her back against the heavy oak door, listening as Donovan's footsteps passed by.

The study smelled of leather and bergamot, Sebastian's signature scent. Moonlight illuminated the framed photographs on his desk - Oliver's school portrait, Victoria's debutante photo, and... was that her own picture tucked behind the others?

Before she could investigate, the door handle turned.

Lillian dove behind the velvet drapes just as Sebastian entered with Marcus. Their conversation was clipped, urgent.

"The Winslows are making their move," Marcus said, dropping a file on the desk. "Reginald's been meeting with Alpha Maximilian."

Sebastian's growl vibrated through the room. "And my brother-in-law?"

"Still playing both sides. Eleanor's convinced him to delay the merger until after Victoria's engagement party."

Lillian's stomach twisted. The Winslows - Donovan's family - were conspiring with Sebastian's rivals? And what merger?

A sudden vibration in her pocket nearly made her yelp. Beatrice's text flashed on her screen: "URGENT. Meet me at the gazebo. Bring your combat gear."

The drapes shifted as Sebastian turned toward the window. Lillian held her breath, pressing deeper into the shadows.

"Sir?" Marcus hesitated. "Should we warn Lillian about-"

"Not yet." Sebastian's voice dropped. "She's safer not knowing."

As their footsteps receded, Lillian exhaled shakily. Safer not knowing what? And why would Beatrice need combat gear at midnight?

The grandfather clock chimed eleven. Lillian slipped out the French doors to the moonlit garden, her mind racing with fragmented clues. Whatever Donovan and the Winslows were planning, it involved her. And Sebastian was keeping secrets again.

Her phone buzzed once more - an unknown number with a single ominous message: "Run, little wolf. The hunt begins at dawn."

###Chapter 289
My lips traced a slow, deliberate path down her chest, savoring every inch of her skin before my tongue flicked over her perfect pink nipples. A sharp gasp escaped her, and I couldn’t resist—I nipped lightly, tugging one into my mouth until she whimpered. But it wasn’t pain in her voice. No, she was drowning in pleasure, and I intended to push her deeper.

A low growl rumbled in my chest as I lavished attention on her breasts before claiming her mouth again. She kissed me like she was starved for it, like I was the only thing keeping her alive. Her teeth caught my lower lip, sucking it between hers as if it were the sweetest candy.

Her fingers trailed down my back, nails scraping lightly before settling at the waistband of my sweatpants.

I knew exactly what she wanted.

In one swift motion, I shoved them down, freeing myself for her touch. Her small hands wrapped around me, stroking in time with our feverish kisses. Every pull of her fingers made me harder, my cock twitching in her palm.

This woman would be the death of me.

I devoured her lips, leaving them swollen and bruised, marking her as mine.

"Sebastian..." she whispered, her voice thick with need as she squirmed beneath me. Her grip tightened, trying to guide me where she wanted me most. "I need you."

A smirk curled my lips as I dragged my mouth along her neck, inhaling her scent—warm, intoxicating. "Tell me you won’t let him touch you," I growled against her skin. "Any of them."

She didn’t need to ask who I meant. I’d seen the way Tristan kissed her hand, the way Alpha Maximilian’s fingers lingered on the small of her back.

It had taken everything in me not to rip their throats out.

Her eyes flicked up to mine, dark with desire. "What?" she breathed, brows knitting together.

I kissed the crease between them, soothing it away.

"I’m the only one allowed to touch you," I murmured, my voice rough.

I lined myself up at her entrance, poised to push inside—but I needed to hear it. Needed her to say the words, to confirm that her body belonged to me and no one else. Not Tristan. Not Maximilian.

No one.

"Repeat it," I ordered, pinning her firmly beneath me.

She bit my lip playfully, a smirk of her own curling her mouth. "You’re the only one allowed to touch me, Sebastian," she whispered.

That was all I needed.

I thrust into her in one deep stroke, filling her completely. She gasped, arching beneath me, but then her body relaxed, melting into the pleasure. Her head fell back, my name spilling from her lips in a breathless moan.

God, I loved hearing her say it.

"Again," I demanded, gripping her hips as I moved. "Say my name."

"Sebastian..." Her voice was ragged, desperate. "Oh—yes, Sebastian. Don’t stop—"

I hauled her up, flipping her onto my lap as she straddled me. Her nails dug into my shoulders as I kissed her, rocking her against me. My lips found her neck, teeth grazing the sensitive spot beneath her ear until she trembled.

"Say it again," I growled.

"Sebastian..." Her voice was wrecked.

I kissed her deeply, my hands roaming her body, leaving marks I knew would fade by morning. She didn’t care—she only tightened around me, urging me deeper.

I felt my release building, her walls fluttering around me as she came undone. Her legs locked around my waist, her body shuddering as she fell over the edge. I followed right after, spilling into her with a groan.

We didn’t stop there.

By the time exhaustion claimed us, the sheets were tangled, and the room smelled of nothing but us.

When morning came, Lillian was gone.
###Chapter 290 - The Moon's Whisper

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the marble terrace of Blackwood Manor. Her fingers trembled slightly as she adjusted the emerald-green shawl around her shoulders - a gift from Sebastian that matched his piercing eyes.

Below in the courtyard, Donovan stood with Evelyn, their intertwined fingers glinting under the moonlight. A bitter taste rose in Lillian's throat. Just three months ago, those same hands had promised her forever. Now they belonged to another.

"Stop staring, darling." Beatrice appeared beside her, handing over a flute of champagne. The bubbles danced like Lillian's erratic heartbeat. "He's not worth another thought."

Lillian forced a smile. "I know. It's just...hard."

The grand clock tower struck midnight, its chimes vibrating through her bones. At the twelfth toll, Sebastian materialized from the shadows, his tailored tuxedo accentuating his powerful frame. Little Oliver clung to his hand, the boy's eyes wide with excitement.

"Ready?" Sebastian's deep voice sent shivers down her spine. His free hand extended toward her, palm up. An unspoken promise.

Before she could respond, Victoria's shrill voice cut through the night. "Father! You can't possibly mean to-"

"Enough." Sebastian's command silenced the crowd. His gaze never left Lillian's. "The Moon Ceremony begins."

A collective gasp rippled through the gathered pack members. Lillian's breath hitched. This wasn't part of the plan. The ceremony was sacred, binding. If Sebastian completed the ritual tonight...

Donovan's furious roar shattered the moment. "She's mine!"

Chaos erupted. Evelyn screamed as Donovan shifted mid-leap, his wolf form barreling toward the terrace. Sebastian moved with lethal grace, shoving Oliver into Theodore's arms as his own transformation began.

Lillian barely registered Beatrice pulling her backward as two massive wolves collided in a whirlwind of fangs and fury. The marble cracked beneath their weight. Crystal glasses shattered. Somewhere in the distance, a child was crying.

Then came the gunshot.

A single, deafening report that froze everyone in place. Lillian's ears rang as she turned toward the sound. There, at the edge of the garden, stood Alpha Harrison with a smoking revolver. His cruel smile made her blood run cold.

"Now," he purred, aiming the barrel directly at Oliver's small form, "let's discuss terms."

The world narrowed to that glinting muzzle. Lillian's vision tinged red. Heat flooded her veins as something primal awakened deep within. The last thing she heard before her bones began to break was Sebastian's desperate shout:

"Lillian, NO!"

But it was too late. The moon called, and this time, she answered.

"Are you seriously not going to tell me why you came back so late last night? There’s no way that dinner lasted until 2 AM," Beatrice said, crossing her arms as she watched me dig through my suitcase, searching for the athletic gear I needed for today’s competition.

"Nope," I replied with a smirk.

Honestly, I didn’t want to think about it right now. My mind kept drifting back to Sebastian—how he made me feel last night, the raw intensity of emotions that had felt so real in the moment but now seemed distant. The memory of his touch still lingered on my skin, sending a shiver down my spine.

Finally locating my outfit, I ducked into the bathroom to change. The competition was already making me nervous enough—I didn’t need to start overanalyzing whatever was happening with Sebastian.

"You’re no fun!" Beatrice called through the door.

I chuckled as I quickly pulled on my clothes and tied my hair into a high ponytail. When I stepped out, Beatrice was waiting for me, arms still crossed, an expectant look on her face.

"I’d tell you if anything happened between me and a guy," she declared, tilting her chin up.

Laughing, I gave her a playful shove as I walked past. "There’s not much to tell," I admitted. "I mean… we slept together. That’s it."

"Seriously? The same guy who made you so upset you fled the country without a word?" she reminded me. "We were supposed to be on a break from men, remember?"

She was right. I had promised her this would be a guy-free trip—she needed to get over Lucien, and I was supposed to be moving on from Sebastian. But now, he was all I could think about.

"You’re right," I sighed. "I’m sorry."

She shook her head, her expression softening. "No, I’m sorry," she murmured. "I’m being a terrible friend. You clearly have feelings for him, and I shouldn’t stand in your way."

"We’re just casual," I teased with a shrug. "At least, that’s what it seems like..."

"You haven’t talked about it?" she asked, frowning.

I shook my head.

"No, and I’m not sure I will," I admitted. "Things are messy right now. I think it’s better if I just focus on the competition."

She nodded thoughtfully before glancing at the clock. "Do you have time for breakfast?"

"I’ve got an hour. Let’s grab something quick," I said.

We ended up at the hotel’s breakfast buffet. The spread was impressive—fresh fruit, pastries, eggs—but my nerves had stolen my appetite. I settled for a glass of orange juice and a slice of toast while Beatrice piled her plate high.

As I picked at my food, my mind wandered back to last night. The way Sebastian’s hands had traced my skin, the heat in his gaze—it had felt like more than just casual. But then again, maybe I was reading too much into it.

"You’re overthinking again," Beatrice said, snapping me out of my thoughts.

I sighed. "Yeah, well, that’s what I do best."

She smirked. "Just focus on kicking ass today. Everything else can wait."

I nodded, forcing a smile. She was right. The competition was what mattered now. Whatever was happening with Sebastian… that could wait.

But deep down, I knew—no matter how hard I tried to push him from my thoughts, he wasn’t going anywhere.

We settled at an empty table while Beatrice devoured her breakfast, chattering nonstop about her day with her new friends. I was relieved she’d found people to keep her company while I focused on the competition.

The small plate I’d used for my toast vanished, and I frowned at the empty space. A heartbeat later, a new plate appeared before me—piled high with far more food than I could possibly eat. My gaze snapped up to meet Sebastian Blackwood’s stern expression, and my eyes widened.

"You need to eat," he stated flatly before turning away with my toast.

I gaped at the food, then back at him. He had already taken a seat at another table, listening intently to someone’s conversation, his posture radiating quiet authority. Heat rushed to my cheeks.

Had anyone noticed? I scanned the room, relieved to find no curious eyes on me.

Beatrice looked like she was about to burst into laughter as she nibbled on her own meal, deliberately avoiding my gaze. As much as Sebastian’s interference annoyed me, I couldn’t argue. He was right—I needed proper fuel if I wanted to survive today. That was why I’d been choking down dry toast in the first place.

With a sigh, I picked up my fork. Halfway through the plate, my stomach protested, and I pushed it aside.

A glance at the clock confirmed I only had twenty minutes before the competition began.

"I have to go," I told Beatrice.

She nodded, flashing me a double thumbs-up.

"I’ll be cheering for you," she said. "Good luck today!"

I gave a quick nod and hurried out of the dining hall. The arena was already packed—competitors and spectators alike filling the space. Alpha Maximilian Voss stood at the center, deep in conversation with several other Alphas and Lycans.

One of the Gammas overseeing the event directed me toward the other competitors. I’d never been surrounded by so many people at once, and my nerves crackled like live wires. At least my ankle no longer hurt—I just prayed I wouldn’t reinjure it during the fights.

"Oh, it’s you," a familiar voice said beside me.

I turned to see Genevieve, the girl I’d met in the gym.

"Competing today?" she asked.

I nodded. "Yes. You?"

"Absolutely," she said with a sharp grin. "Odds are we’ll face each other at some point. Good luck." She winked before sauntering off.

###Chapter 291

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the cobblestone path leading to the Blackwood estate. Her heart pounded against her ribs, a mixture of anticipation and unease coiling in her stomach. She hadn’t seen Donovan in weeks—not since he’d publicly rejected her as his fated mate in favor of Evelyn.

Beatrice, ever the supportive best friend, had insisted on accompanying her. "You’re stronger than you think," she murmured, squeezing Lillian’s hand. "And if he dares to say one wrong word, I’ll claw his eyes out."

Lillian managed a weak laugh, though her fingers trembled. She wasn’t here for Donovan. No, this was about Sebastian Blackwood—the Lycan chairman who had somehow become an unexpected anchor in her chaotic life.

The grand doors of the mansion swung open before she could knock, revealing Theodore Whitmore, Sebastian’s ever-composed butler. "Miss Lillian," he greeted with a slight bow. "Alpha Blackwood is expecting you."

Her breath hitched. Expecting her? She hadn’t called ahead.

The foyer was as opulent as she remembered, the chandelier casting golden light over the marble floors. But her attention snapped to the figure descending the staircase—Sebastian, his dark hair slightly tousled, his piercing gaze locked onto her.

"Lillian," he said, his voice a low rumble that sent shivers down her spine. "I was just about to send for you."

She swallowed hard. "Why?"

A shadow crossed his face. "Because Donovan is here."

The words struck her like a physical blow. Beatrice stiffened beside her, her grip tightening. "That bastard has some nerve," she hissed.

Sebastian’s jaw clenched. "He’s demanding to see you. Claims it’s urgent."

Lillian’s pulse roared in her ears. Urgent? After everything? She squared her shoulders. "Fine. Let’s get this over with."

But as she moved to follow Sebastian, a small voice piped up from the hallway. "Lily!"

Oliver, Sebastian’s seven-year-old son, barreled into her legs, his arms wrapping around her waist. The unexpected warmth of his embrace made her eyes sting.

Sebastian’s expression softened as he watched them. "Oliver, give her some space."

The boy pouted but obeyed, though he kept his tiny hand firmly in Lillian’s. "Don’t go yet," he pleaded. "I drew you a picture!"

Her heart ached. This child, so innocent and full of light, was a stark contrast to the storm brewing inside her.

Sebastian exhaled sharply. "We don’t have much time. Donovan isn’t alone—Evelyn is with him."

Lillian’s stomach twisted. Of course. She’d humiliate her further by flaunting their bond.

Beatrice growled under her breath. "Let me handle this. I’ve been itching for a fight."

Sebastian’s lips quirked, but his eyes remained serious. "No. This is between Lillian and them." He turned to her. "But I’ll be right beside you. Always."

The promise in his words steadied her.

Taking a deep breath, Lillian nodded. "Lead the way."

As they walked toward the study, Oliver still clinging to her hand, she braced herself for the confrontation ahead.

But nothing could have prepared her for what waited behind those doors.

Because Donovan wasn’t there to gloat.

He was there to beg.

And Evelyn?

She was crying.

The announcer's voice boomed through the arena, detailing the rules with crisp precision. My ears pricked up, absorbing every word. No killing—not yet, anyway. That privilege was reserved for the final showdown. Until then, one wrong move, one fatal strike, and we'd be out. Disqualified.

The first round was chaos incarnate—a free-for-all designed to test our raw skill, our instincts. Winning wasn't the objective. Survival was. We had to make it through without being so battered that even our wolves couldn’t patch us up in time. The goal? Thin the herd.

Fifty, maybe sixty fighters stood scattered across the arena floor. Shifting was forbidden in this round, so I remained in human form, muscles coiled, senses sharp.

A shrill alarm sliced through the air.

The fight erupted instantly—no order, no strategy, just pure, unfiltered violence. Bodies collided, fists flew. It was less a battle and more a frenzied mosh pit of desperation.

I wove through the madness, dodging wild swings, analyzing my opponents with every breath. I had spent the last few days observing them, memorizing their tells.

Like Eric—his right leg was a fraction shorter than his left. Barely noticeable unless you were looking for it. But I had seen it last night in the dining hall, the slight hitch in his step. Now, I used it against him, sweeping his bad leg out from under him. He crashed to the ground, and I was already moving before he could recover.

Sebastian was here. I didn’t need to look to know his gaze was locked onto me, burning like a brand. He sat in the front row with the other Lycans, a silent observer. I refused to glance his way. Focus was everything.

The arena was thinning. Medics rushed in as bones snapped, as fighters crumpled. One man’s leg bent at a grotesque angle, bone tearing through flesh. He was dragged away, howling.

Mayhem.

A whisper of movement at my back—instinct took over. I spun, fist flying. My knuckles connected with a sickening crunch. Blood gushed from his nose. Before he could react, I twisted his wrist until the snap echoed through the air. Clean break. His wolf might fix it before the next round, but for now, he was done.

I kicked him hard in the gut for good measure, sending him sprawling.

Fighting like this was a dance—a brutal, bloody waltz. Every move had to be precise, calculated. The goal wasn’t just to survive. It was to be seen. To make them remember me.

And it worked.

Two massive fighters lunged at me, underestimating the slender girl in their midst. Big mistake. Within seconds, both were on the ground, groaning.

That got their attention.

Suddenly, the tide shifted. The scattered brawls dissolved into a singular focus—me. They wanted a piece of the girl who had just taken down two of their strongest without breaking a sweat.

They came at me in waves.

But I was faster.

Dodging, striking, flipping one over my shoulder. The crowd roared, gasps and cheers blending into a thunderous cacophony. Every takedown, every perfectly placed hit, was another step toward proving myself.

Then—pain. A blow landed, sending me stumbling.

But I didn’t stay down.

I twisted, using their momentum against them, and in a heartbeat, I had them pinned beneath me, their breath ragged, their eyes wide with shock.

The fight wasn’t over yet.

But I had just made sure everyone knew—I wasn’t here to play.

I was here to win.

The arena pulsed with energy as I twisted away from the charging opponents, my body moving with practiced ease. In one fluid motion, I flipped over their heads, landing gracefully behind them. Their hesitation cost them—by the time they whirled around, fists raised, I had already swept their legs out from under them. The crowd erupted into deafening cheers, their voices blending into a thunderous roar that vibrated through my bones.

I spun on my heel, muscles coiled, scanning the field for the next challenger. The air was thick with tension, the scent of sweat and adrenaline sharp in my nose. They were coming at me now, more cautious, more calculated. I could feel their gazes locked onto me, their strategy shifting—I had become the primary target.

My wolf stirred beneath my skin, her agitation merging with mine, sharpening my instincts until my senses were razor-edged. The thrill of the fight sang in my veins, making me reckless.

Too reckless.

I didn’t see the attack coming.

One moment, I was poised for the next strike—the next, my face slammed into the dirt, a searing pain shooting up my spine. A feral growl tore from my throat as I struggled against the weight pinning me down.

Then, a voice—cold, familiar, dripping with venom—whispered against my ear, sending a chill down my already aching back.

"You won’t win this, bitch."

Evelyn.

My blood ran cold.
###Chapter 292

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood's penthouse, illuminating the spacious living area where Lillian sat curled up on the plush sofa. A steaming cup of coffee rested on the table in front of her, untouched. Her fingers absently traced the rim of the mug as her mind wandered back to last night's confrontation with Donovan.

She had expected anger, betrayal—anything but the cold indifference in his eyes when he declared Evelyn his new mate. The memory sent a sharp pang through her chest, but she refused to let it show.

The sound of footsteps pulled her from her thoughts. Sebastian strode into the room, his broad shoulders framed by the morning light. His dark eyes flickered with concern as he took in her tense posture.

"Did you sleep at all?" he asked, his deep voice laced with quiet authority.

Lillian forced a small smile. "Not really."

Sebastian exhaled sharply, his jaw tightening. "Donovan is a fool."

She let out a humorless laugh. "That makes two of us, then."

Before he could respond, Oliver bounded into the room, his small face alight with excitement. "Lillian! Are we still going to the amusement park today?"

The sudden shift in mood was almost jarring, but Lillian welcomed the distraction. She reached out to ruffle his hair. "Of course we are. I wouldn’t miss it."

Sebastian’s expression softened as he watched them. "I’ll have Marcus arrange security."

Lillian hesitated. "Do we really need that?"

His gaze darkened. "After what happened last night? Absolutely."

She bit her lip, remembering the way Donovan had sneered at her before walking away. The thought of facing him again—or worse, Evelyn—made her stomach twist. But she refused to let them ruin Oliver’s day.

"Fine," she conceded. "But let’s keep it low-key. I don’t want Oliver to feel like he’s being followed."

Sebastian gave a curt nod before turning to his son. "Go get ready. We leave in thirty minutes."

As Oliver dashed off, Lillian stood, smoothing the wrinkles from her dress. "I should change too."

Sebastian caught her wrist as she moved past him, his grip firm but gentle. "Lillian."

She met his gaze, her pulse quickening at the intensity in his eyes.

"Don’t let him get to you," he murmured. "You’re worth more than he could ever realize."

Her breath hitched. For a moment, she wanted to lean into him, to let his strength chase away the lingering ache in her chest. But she forced herself to pull away.

"Thanks," she whispered before retreating to her room.

The amusement park was bustling with families and couples when they arrived. Oliver tugged at Lillian’s hand, his excitement contagious as he pointed at the towering roller coasters.

"Can we go on that one first?" he begged.

Sebastian arched a brow. "You sure you can handle it?"

Oliver puffed out his chest. "Of course! I’m not scared!"

Lillian laughed, the sound lighter than she’d felt in days. "Then let’s go."

They spent the next few hours weaving through the crowds, riding attractions and indulging in cotton candy. For the first time in weeks, Lillian felt free—untethered from the weight of Donovan’s betrayal.

But as they rounded a corner near the Ferris wheel, her steps faltered.

There, standing in line with Evelyn draped over his arm, was Donovan.

His eyes locked onto hers, and for a heartbeat, the world seemed to stop.

Then Evelyn leaned up to whisper something in his ear, and his lips curled into a smirk.

Lillian’s stomach dropped.

Sebastian’s hand settled on the small of her back, his touch grounding. "Ignore them," he murmured.

She swallowed hard, forcing herself to look away. But the damage was done.

The rest of the day passed in a blur, the earlier joy now tainted. Even Oliver’s laughter couldn’t fully chase away the shadow that had settled over her.

That night, as she lay in bed, Lillian stared at the ceiling, her mind racing.

Donovan had moved on.

So why couldn’t she?

A soft knock at her door pulled her from her thoughts.

"Come in," she called.

The door creaked open, revealing Sebastian silhouetted in the dim light.

"Can’t sleep?" he asked.

She shook her head.

He hesitated before stepping inside, closing the door behind him. "Neither can I."

Silence stretched between them, thick with unspoken words.

Then, without warning, Sebastian crossed the room and pulled her into his arms.

Lillian stiffened in surprise before melting against him, her face buried in his chest. His warmth seeped into her, chasing away the lingering chill of Donovan’s betrayal.

"I won’t let him hurt you again," Sebastian vowed, his voice rough with emotion.

She didn’t respond. She didn’t need to.

For the first time in weeks, she felt safe.

And that was enough.

The sting of sharp nails raking across my cheek made me hiss in pain. Warm blood trickled down my face as I glared up at the girl looming over me—Arabella, Alpha Maximilian's daughter, her eyes burning with fury.

A low growl rumbled in my chest, my own anger flaring. She only laughed, delighted by my reaction, before lunging again. But this time, I wouldn’t let her catch me off guard. I swiped back, willing my nails to sharpen, though full shifting was forbidden in this round of the competition.

She dodged effortlessly, smirking like victory was already hers. My movements grew reckless, fueled by frustration—exactly what she wanted. I knew better. If I lost control now, I’d make a mistake that could cost me everything. I needed to prove I could stay composed, no matter the provocation.

Forcing a deep breath, I steadied myself, letting my wolf’s instincts guide me. Around us, others took cheap shots, but I dispatched them with ease. Arabella, though—she was skilled. No surprise, given her father’s training.

She swung again. This time, I caught her arm, twisting her weight against her before slamming her onto the ground like a wrestler. She shrieked, writhing beneath me, but I pinned her wrists behind her back, ignoring her furious demands to let her go.

The crowd erupted.

Other opponents still fought, but I took advantage of the chaos, slipping into the shadows—my specialty. If they saw me coming, they’d counter. But unseen? I was lethal.

One by one, I struck. A quick, brutal takedown. One man nearly threw me off, but I dug my nails deep into his flesh, relishing his pained gasp. Blood slicked my fingers, and the scent only sharpened my focus.

I couldn’t kill him. But I could make him regret underestimating me.

The first round ended with a buzzer. Those advancing—myself included—were ushered to the locker rooms to clean up and rest before the next bout.

"You were incredible," Genevieve said, grinning—until she saw my face. She whistled. "Damn, Arabella really marked you up, huh?"

"Arabella?" I arched a brow.

Genevieve smirked. "Oh, you didn’t know? That’s Alpha Maximilian’s little princess. And she hates losing."

I wiped the blood from my cheek, smiling faintly.

Good.

Because so did I.

Lillian gave a firm nod.

"Exactly—Alpha Maximilian's daughter," she clarified, her gaze drifting across the locker room before settling on Arabella. The girl was preening in front of the mirror, surrounded by the same clique of girls Lillian had seen at the gym earlier. As usual, they were whispering behind their hands, no doubt spreading some petty gossip. Lillian rolled her eyes, irritation prickling under her skin.

"She won't get under mine," Lillian muttered under her breath.

"That's what I like to hear," Genevieve said, giving her shoulder an encouraging pat. "Don't let her rattle you."

Lillian exhaled sharply, suddenly feeling the walls of the locker room closing in. "I need air," she announced, already moving toward the exit. Genevieve nodded, returning to her own preparations as Lillian pushed through the door.

Outside, the scene was chaotic. Paparazzi swarmed the area, cameras flashing as they jostled for the best shots of the competitors—especially the Lycans. One particularly smug Lycan was basking in the attention, answering questions with a smirk that made Lillian's lip curl.

She turned away, refusing to let the spectacle distract her. The real challenge was still ahead.
###Chapter 293

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s estate. The golden hues of sunset painted the sky, casting long shadows across the sprawling gardens below. She exhaled slowly, her breath forming a faint mist in the cool evening.

Inside, the grand hall buzzed with activity. The annual Lycan Council gathering was in full swing, and though Lillian had no official role in the proceedings, Sebastian had insisted she attend. His voice, deep and commanding, carried over the murmurs of the assembled Alphas and Betas.

“We cannot afford another conflict with the Darkmoon Pack,” Sebastian declared, his piercing gaze sweeping across the room. “Alpha Maximilian Voss has made his intentions clear. If we do not act now, we risk losing more than just territory.”

Lillian’s fingers tightened around the railing. The mention of Voss sent a chill down her spine. The last time their paths had crossed, she had barely escaped with her life.

A familiar presence brushed against her senses. Donovan.

She didn’t need to turn around to know he was there—his scent, a mix of cedar and something darker, was unmistakable.

“Enjoying the view?” His voice was smooth, laced with the same arrogance that had once drawn her in.

Lillian kept her eyes fixed on the horizon. “What do you want, Donovan?”

He stepped closer, his breath warm against her ear. “Just checking on my favorite little wolf.”

She stiffened. “We’re done. You made your choice.”

A low chuckle rumbled in his chest. “Did I? Because from where I’m standing, you’re still tangled up in my world.”

Before she could retort, the balcony doors swung open. Beatrice stormed out, her cheeks flushed with irritation. “There you are! I’ve been looking everywhere for you.” Her sharp eyes flicked to Donovan. “Oh. Him.”

Donovan smirked. “Always a pleasure, Beatrice.”

Beatrice ignored him, grabbing Lillian’s arm. “Sebastian’s looking for you. Something about a meeting with the council elders.”

Lillian nodded, grateful for the interruption. As she turned to leave, Donovan’s voice stopped her.

“This isn’t over, Lillian.”

She didn’t look back.

Inside, the atmosphere was tense. Sebastian stood at the head of the table, his expression unreadable. Marcus Grayson, his Beta, leaned in to whisper something in his ear.

Sebastian’s gaze locked onto Lillian as she approached. “Good. You’re here.” He gestured to an empty seat beside him. “Sit.”

As she took her place, the elders’ murmurs grew louder. One of them, an older Lycan with silver-streaked hair, cleared his throat.

“The Darkmoon Pack has already crossed our borders twice this month. If we don’t retaliate, we’ll appear weak.”

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. “And if we act rashly, we risk all-out war.”

Lillian’s pulse quickened. She knew what was coming next.

Sebastian turned to her, his voice low but firm. “Lillian, you’ve dealt with Voss before. I need your insight.”

Every eye in the room was suddenly on her.

She swallowed hard. “Voss doesn’t respond to brute force. He respects strategy. If we can outmaneuver him politically, we might avoid bloodshed.”

A murmur of agreement rippled through the council.

Sebastian nodded slowly. “Then we’ll play his game—for now.”

As the meeting adjourned, Lillian couldn’t shake the feeling that Donovan’s presence was no coincidence.

And that the real battle was only just beginning.

"Not bad for a girl," a voice drawled behind me, dripping with condescension.

I whirled around to find Tristan Whitlock sauntering toward me, his bare torso glistening with sweat, a towel draped lazily around his neck. Scratches marred his skin, but they were superficial—barely worth noting. His smirk was infuriating, dimples flashing like he thought they excused his arrogance.

"What’s that supposed to mean?" I snapped, crossing my arms and glaring up at him.

He leaned against the wall, amusement dancing in his eyes. "Just saying I’m impressed. You don’t look like much, but you’ve got fire in you."

My lips pressed into a thin line. "Afraid you’ll lose to a girl?" I taunted.

A low chuckle rumbled in his chest. "Not even a little. I just hope you don’t hold a grudge when I wipe the floor with you."

I rolled my eyes so hard I nearly saw my own brain. "Good luck with that, Tristan," I muttered, turning to leave.

His hand shot out to grab my arm, but I jerked away before he could touch me. If Sebastian saw him lay a finger on me, Tristan wouldn’t live long enough to regret it. His expression darkened at my rejection, lips thinning as his eyes narrowed.

"Don’t get cocky," he warned, stepping so close I could feel the heat radiating off him. My breath hitched as he brushed past me, his arm grazing mine deliberately before he strode away, leaving me standing there, stunned.

I needed air.

The crowd’s noise faded as I wandered toward the empty parking lot, craving silence. My head throbbed, adrenaline ebbing, leaving me chilled despite the warm evening. Wrapping my arms around myself, I exhaled shakily, trying to steady my racing heart.

Then—a touch.

Sebastian’s hand settled on my arm, his presence sudden and grounding. His dark eyes bore into mine, intense and unreadable. For a second, I thought he might be some divine intervention sent to save me from my own chaos.

His gaze flickered over the scratches on my cheek—courtesy of Arabella—and his nostrils flared. Without a word, he guided me toward a sleek black car I didn’t recognize. The doors unlocked with a quiet click, and he motioned for me to climb into the backseat.

I hesitated, scanning the deserted lot before slipping inside. Sebastian followed, shutting the door behind us with finality.

My pulse hammered so loudly I was certain he could hear it. He reached behind me, his face inches from mine—close enough that my breath caught. For one reckless moment, I thought he might kiss me.

He didn’t.

Instead, he pulled out a first aid kit from the seatback, and I blinked in surprise. When he produced an antiseptic wipe, I opened my mouth to protest, but one sharp look silenced me.

The sting made me wince as he cleaned the marks on my cheek, his touch meticulous, his focus absolute.

"Thank you," I murmured, unsure what else to say.

His eyes met mine briefly before returning to his task. "You should’ve protected your face," he finally said, voice low.

"We can shift next round," I replied. "I’ll make her pay for this."

"Don’t be reckless."

I held his gaze, unflinching. "I’ve only made one reckless mistake so far."

His eyes darkened, a growl vibrating in his chest.

And I’m about to make another one, I thought—just before his lips crashed into mine.

###Chapter 294

The morning sun cast golden rays through the curtains of Lillian's bedroom, stirring her awake. She stretched lazily, her muscles still sore from yesterday's training session with Professor Montclair. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted up from the kitchen, signaling that Giselle, the head maid, was already at work.

Lillian rolled out of bed and padded barefoot to the window, pushing the curtains aside. The estate grounds were alive with activity—gardens being tended, warriors training in the distance, and Sebastian's sleek black car idling near the front steps.

A knock at her door interrupted her thoughts. "Come in," she called.

The door creaked open, revealing Beatrice, her best friend, holding two steaming mugs. "Morning, sleepyhead. Thought you might need this." She handed Lillian one of the mugs, the rich aroma of caramel and espresso filling the air.

Lillian took a grateful sip. "You're an angel."

Beatrice smirked. "I know." She perched on the edge of the bed, her expression turning serious. "So, have you decided what you're going to do about Donovan?"

Lillian's grip tightened around the mug. The mention of her ex-fated mate still sent a sharp pang through her chest. "I don't know," she admitted. "He's still engaged to Victoria, and yet he keeps showing up like he expects me to just... forget everything."

Beatrice snorted. "Typical Donovan. Always thinking the world revolves around him."

Lillian sighed, running a hand through her tangled hair. "I just wish I could move on without him constantly dragging me back into his mess."

Before Beatrice could respond, another knock sounded—this one sharper, more urgent.

"Enter," Lillian called.

The door swung open to reveal Marcus Grayson, Sebastian's beta, his expression grim. "Lillian, you're needed downstairs. Now."

Lillian exchanged a glance with Beatrice. "What's going on?"

Marcus hesitated, then said, "It's Alpha Harrison. He's here."

Lillian's blood ran cold. The last time she'd seen Alpha Harrison, he'd tried to take advantage of her when she was drunk. "Why is he here?"

Marcus shook his head. "I don't know, but Sebastian wants you present for the discussion."

Lillian set her mug down with a clatter. "Fine. Let's go."

As she followed Marcus out, Beatrice grabbed her wrist. "Be careful," she whispered.

Lillian nodded, squaring her shoulders. Whatever Alpha Harrison wanted, she wouldn't let him intimidate her—not again.

The tension in the grand hall was palpable when she arrived. Sebastian stood at the head of the room, his posture rigid, while Alpha Harrison lounged in a chair like he owned the place. His smirk widened when he saw Lillian.

"Ah, the little werewolf finally graces us with her presence," he drawled.

Sebastian's eyes flashed dangerously. "State your business, Harrison. You're not welcome here."

Alpha Harrison leaned forward, his grin turning predatory. "Oh, but I think you'll want to hear what I have to say." His gaze slid to Lillian. "Especially her."

Lillian clenched her fists. "Spit it out."

Alpha Harrison chuckled. "Fine. I have information about Donovan's plans—plans that involve you, little wolf."

Lillian's breath hitched. "What kind of plans?"

Alpha Harrison's smile turned vicious. "The kind that ends with you back in his arms—whether you like it or not."

The room erupted into chaos.

A quick rendezvous in the backseat of the rental car hadn’t been part of my plans for the day, yet here I was, slipping out with my clothes half-torn by the teeth of a very eager Lycan. I turned to see Sebastian still lounging in the backseat, his dark eyes gleaming with satisfaction as he lazily pulled on his shirt.

"Go ahead," he murmured, his voice rough. "I’ll follow in a minute. Less suspicious that way."

I swallowed hard, my pulse still racing as I adjusted my disheveled blouse. This entire situation was becoming more complicated by the second. Wrapping my arms around myself, I hurried toward the arena before the next round began.

We had one more match today, and the second portion of the competition was scheduled for the day after tomorrow. With so many competitors, we’d been split into two groups—Group A and Group B. If I hadn’t gotten injured and missed yesterday’s match, I would’ve been in Group A, whose second round was tomorrow.

Nervousness coiled in my stomach. It had been too long since I’d last shifted. During combat training, we were supposed to practice in our wolf forms, but ever since my breakup with Donovan, my wolf had been… distant. Lately, she’d been more vocal in my mind, stirring restlessly, but the idea of shifting still filled me with dread. What if she refused me again?

I should’ve practiced. I knew I should’ve. But something—fear, hesitation, pride—kept holding me back.

"Lillian!"

The familiar voice snapped me out of my thoughts. I turned to see Beatrice jogging toward me, her bright smile a stark contrast to my tangled emotions. She thrust a water bottle into my hands.

"Thought you might need this," she said, grinning.

I gulped down the water gratefully. "Thanks."

"You’re killing it out there, by the way," she added, pulling me into a quick, tight hug before stepping back and gesturing to the small group behind her. "Meet my friends. They’ve been keeping me company while you’ve been busy."

"You’re not alone, Bea," I reminded her, rolling my eyes.

"Yeah, but you’re always training or competing or—" She waved a hand vaguely. "Anyway, this is Genevieve, Sebastian, and Dominic."

I offered them a polite smile. "Nice to meet you."

Genevieve gave me a small nod, while Sebastian smirked—a look that reminded me a little too much of a certain Lycan chairman. Dominic, on the other hand, just stared, his expression unreadable.

Beatrice looped her arm through mine. "Come on, let’s get you ready for your next match."

I let her lead me away, but my mind was already drifting back to the car, to Sebastian’s heated gaze, to the way my wolf stirred inside me—restless, impatient, and far too aware of him.

This was going to be complicated.

###Chapter 295

The evening air was thick with tension as Lillian stood at the edge of the grand ballroom, her fingers nervously twisting the delicate fabric of her gown. The opulent chandeliers cast a golden glow over the sea of elegantly dressed guests, their laughter and chatter filling the space. But beneath the veneer of celebration, something darker simmered.

Donovan’s presence loomed like a shadow, his piercing gaze locked onto her from across the room. Beside him, Evelyn clung to his arm, her lips curled into a smug smile. Lillian’s stomach twisted. She had hoped to avoid them tonight, but fate had other plans.

A warm hand settled on the small of her back, sending a shiver down her spine. "You look stunning," Sebastian murmured, his voice low and intimate. His touch was grounding, a stark contrast to the storm of emotions swirling inside her.

She forced a smile. "Thank you."

His dark eyes flicked toward Donovan, narrowing slightly. "Ignore him. He’s not worth your thoughts."

Easier said than done. Every glance in Donovan’s direction was a reminder of the past—of promises broken and trust shattered.

Just then, Beatrice appeared at her side, her usual bubbly demeanor subdued. "You okay?" she whispered, squeezing Lillian’s hand.

Lillian exhaled. "I will be."

The music swelled, signaling the start of the first dance. Sebastian extended his hand. "May I?"

She hesitated only a moment before placing her palm in his. As they moved onto the dance floor, the world seemed to fade away—until a familiar voice cut through the melody.

"Mind if I cut in?"

Donovan stood before them, his smirk dripping with arrogance.

Sebastian’s grip on her waist tightened. "Actually, I do."

The air crackled with hostility. Guests nearby paused, sensing the brewing confrontation.

Lillian’s pulse raced. This wasn’t just about a dance. It was a challenge—one she refused to back down from.

She met Donovan’s gaze head-on. "You lost the right to ask me for anything a long time ago."

His expression darkened, but before he could respond, a sharp gasp echoed through the room.

All heads turned toward the grand entrance, where a figure stood silhouetted against the moonlight.

Victoria.

Her face was pale, her dress torn. And in her trembling hands—a bloodstained letter.

The room fell silent.

Sebastian released Lillian immediately, striding toward his daughter. "What happened?"

Victoria’s voice was barely a whisper, but the words carried like thunder.

"They’ve taken Oliver."

The world tilted. Lillian’s breath caught in her throat.

And just like that, the night’s fragile peace shattered.

"Beatrice, what's going on?" I asked, studying her face carefully.

She hesitated before answering, "Dominic has been helping me take my mind off Lucien... so we've been... involved. It's nothing serious—just a temporary thing while we're here. But it feels nice to be wanted, you know?"

I could sense there was more she wasn't telling me. Beatrice had always been careful with relationships, never the type to jump into intimacy with someone she barely knew. This reckless behavior was completely out of character for her. Something deeper was pushing her toward this.

"Is that really all?" I pressed, arching a brow.

When she stayed silent, I exhaled sharply. I was about to push further when the loudspeaker crackled to life, announcing the start of the second round.

"I have to go," I said, handing her my water bottle. "But Bea, I'm your best friend. If you can't talk to me about what's really going on, then who can you trust? I don’t like seeing you replace Lucien with Dominic. It hurts that you’re keeping things from me. The truth always comes out—so don’t hide it from me."

I brushed past her, our shoulders grazing. She stood frozen, speechless. Maybe silence was better than lies.

Joining the other competitors in the arena, I steadied my breathing. Like the first round, this challenge tested our combat skills and survival instincts. Killing was forbidden, but we could either incapacitate opponents so severely they couldn’t continue—effectively disqualifying them—or persuade them to surrender.

My wolf stirred restlessly inside me, her instincts sharpening. Something had her on high alert. I pressed a hand to my stomach, trying to soothe her with slow, measured breaths.

"We’ve got this," I whispered.

"Talking to yourself now?" Genevieve smirked from beside me, amusement glinting in her eyes.

"My wolf," I admitted. "Just reassuring her."

"You talk to your wolf?" She scoffed, incredulous. "They don’t understand words. They’re just animals. When we shift, we become them—instinct takes over. Hopefully, yours is well-trained."

I stared at her, stunned. She thought our wolves were mere beasts? Uncontrolled, wild creatures? That was absurd. My wolf and I had always been in sync—one mind, one will.

Was Genevieve saying she lost control when she shifted?

My gaze swept across the arena. Other competitors were already stripping down, preparing to shift. I wondered—how many of them saw their wolves as separate, untamed entities?

And how many, like me, knew the truth?

Our gazes locked—Genevieve studying me just as intently as I studied her. Her striking pale green eyes, flecked with sapphire around the pupils, were undeniably mesmerizing. Framed by thick, dark lashes, they burned with an intensity that mirrored the fire in her soul. The hunger to win radiated from her, a palpable force that sent a thrill down my spine.

"Welcome to round two!" The announcer's voice boomed through the stadium, echoing off the high walls.

I tilted my head up, spotting the drones hovering above, their lenses capturing every moment of this globally televised event. Though the announcer remained unseen, his vantage point was clear—somewhere high enough to oversee the entire arena.

"Same rules as before—no killing, or you're out," he continued. "This week is about proving yourselves to the judges and the Lycan elders who'll make the final call. They're evaluating everything—precision, technique, shifting control, adaptability. You'll fight in both forms today. May the best wolf win."

A charged silence settled over the arena as competitors took their positions. Genevieve met my eyes again, offering a sharp nod before she, like the others, began stripping off her clothes.

I didn’t move.

The countdown began, voices rising in unison.

"Three..."

My muscles coiled, ready.

"Two..."

Genevieve smirked, her fingers flexing.

"One."

A collective breath held.

"BEGIN!"

###Chapter 296

The morning sun filtered through the heavy velvet drapes of Sebastian Blackwood's private study, casting golden streaks across the antique mahogany desk where Lillian sat fidgeting. Her fingers traced the intricate carvings on the armrests of the leather chair - Sebastian's chair - that she'd been instructed to occupy.

"Relax," Sebastian murmured, his deep voice resonating through the sunlit room as he poured two cups of steaming Earl Grey. "You're not in trouble."

Lillian swallowed hard, watching the way his muscles flexed beneath his tailored shirt as he moved. Even after all this time, the Lycan chairman's effortless grace made her pulse quicken. "Then why the formal summons?" she asked, accepting the delicate china cup. "You usually just text when you want to see me."

Sebastian's lips quirked as he settled into the chair opposite her. "Because this isn't about us." He set down his cup with deliberate precision. "It's about Donovan."

The name hit Lillian like a physical blow. Her tea sloshed dangerously close to the rim as her hands jerked. "What about him?"

"Don't play coy, darling." Sebastian's golden eyes darkened to molten amber. "I know he's been sending you letters. My question is - why haven't you told me?"

A cold sweat broke out along Lillian's spine. She'd thought she'd been so careful, burning each handwritten note in the fireplace of her dorm room after reading. "How did you—"

"Nothing happens in my territory without my knowledge." Sebastian leaned forward, the predatory glint in his eyes making her wolf whimper in submission. "Especially when it concerns my mate."

Lillian's breath caught. They'd never actually used that word before, not in this context. The air between them crackled with unspoken tension as Sebastian reached across the desk, capturing her trembling hand in his.

"I need you to trust me," he said, his thumb stroking her knuckles in a gesture that was equal parts soothing and possessive. "Whatever game Donovan is playing ends today."

Outside, a sudden gust of wind rattled the windows, as if the universe itself was reacting to Sebastian's declaration. Lillian shivered, though the room was warm. She knew that tone - it was the same one he used before making business rivals disappear.

"What are you going to do?" she whispered.

Sebastian's smile didn't reach his eyes. "That depends entirely on you, little wolf. But first—" He released her hand to open a drawer, withdrawing a thick envelope stamped with the Winslow family crest. "Tell me what he's been promising you in these."

Lillian's blood ran cold. The envelope contained every single letter she thought she'd destroyed, perfectly preserved. As she met Sebastian's burning gaze, she realized two terrifying truths simultaneously:

First, she'd severely underestimated how closely she was being watched.

And second, the real game had only just begun.

The moment the first howl pierced the air, I bolted. My legs carried me faster than my thoughts could catch up—no strategy, no plan, just pure adrenaline. Staying in the center of that shifting, snarling chaos wasn’t an option. If Genevieve had lost control of her wolf, others might too, and I wasn’t about to become prey in a hunt I never signed up for.

The stadium roared around me, a cacophony of cheers and growls. I refused to glance toward the Lycan section, though I felt the weight of his gaze like a brand. Donovan was there. What was he thinking? That I was running from a fight?

No.

This wasn’t cowardice. This was survival.

The snapping of teeth behind me sent a jolt down my spine. I didn’t dare look back, but I could sense them—wolves with wild eyes, their auras pulsing with aggression. One in particular stood out: light brown fur streaked with green-gold eyes, too close for comfort. Not Genevieve. This one moved with a predator’s grace, and I wasn’t sticking around to find out if she was still human enough to reason with.

It had been so long since I’d shifted in front of others that I barely remembered what my wolf looked like. Beatrice had once described her as "adorable," with snowy fur, gray-tipped paws like mittens, and eyes that mirrored mine. Not exactly the most intimidating presence in a fight.

The wooded section of the battle zone loomed ahead—a tangled maze of trees meant for training exercises. Perfect. Wolves could climb, but not like humans. Not like me. I vaulted onto the lowest branch of the tallest oak I could find, scrambling upward until the world spread out beneath me.

From this height, the chaos below crystallized into something almost manageable. Wolves tore into each other in the arena’s center, some still human enough to scream insults at my retreating back. "Coward!" one spat, shifting mid-snarl. I ignored them. Let them think what they wanted. I’d rather be called a coward than end up as someone’s trophy.

Only a handful had followed me. One—pale blue eyes, snow-white fur dappled with brown—was already scaling the trunk, her claws digging into the bark with frustrating determination. The others circled below, snapping at each other like overgrown pups.

A plan formed in my mind, reckless and half-baked. Either it would work, or it would get me killed.

No time to second-guess.

I waited until the white wolf was just within reach, then dropped.

The impact knocked the air from both of us, but I rolled first, twisting to pin her beneath me. Her snarls were deafening, her teeth inches from my throat.

"Listen to me," I hissed, pressing my forearm against her windpipe. "You don’t want to do this."

Her pupils dilated—just for a second—and I saw it: the flicker of human awareness beneath the feral rage.

Then the others lunged.

This was a terrible idea. I was going to get myself killed. Sebastian would be furious, and I’d have to endure one of Beatrice’s infamous lectures. The only way this reckless plan would work was if my wolf cooperated—but right now, she was restless, her anxiety pulsing through me like a second heartbeat.

"We got this..." I murmured to her, my voice barely above a whisper. "I need you now. Trust me, so I can trust you." We had been partners for so long, bound by more than just instinct.

A wave of calm settled over me, and I felt the corner of my lips twitch into a faint smile. Taking a deep breath, I steadied myself, waiting for the perfect moment. The shifter below me snarled, its golden eyes locked onto my position.

I reached for the thick branch above me, gripping it tightly for support as I carefully shifted my weight onto the very edge of the one beneath my feet. The wood groaned under the pressure, bending dangerously low—so low that I was practically dangling myself right in front of the beast.

My pulse thundered in my ears.

One wrong move, and I’d be nothing more than prey.

But I wasn’t prey.

I was the hunter.

And this shifter had no idea what was coming.
###Chapter 297

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sebastian Blackwood’s penthouse, painting the room in warm hues. Lillian stretched beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming with the lingering pleasure of last night. The scent of Sebastian—dark, intoxicating, and undeniably possessive—clung to her skin, a reminder of the way he had claimed her over and over until dawn.

She turned her head, expecting to find him beside her, but the space was empty. Only the indentation on the pillow and the faint warmth of his body remained.

A note rested on the nightstand, written in his bold, elegant script:

"Emergency meeting. Don’t leave the penthouse. I’ll be back soon."

Lillian sighed, running her fingers through her tousled hair. The man was insufferable—always giving orders, always expecting obedience. And yet, the possessive command sent a thrill down her spine.

She reached for her phone, only to find a dozen missed calls and frantic messages from Beatrice.

"Lillian, where the hell are you?! Donovan is losing his mind—he’s convinced Sebastian kidnapped you!"

Lillian groaned. Of course he was. Donovan had never been able to accept that she had chosen Sebastian over him.

Before she could reply, the penthouse door swung open.

Sebastian strode in, his tailored suit immaculate, his expression unreadable. But the moment his eyes landed on her, something dark and possessive flickered in his gaze.

"You're awake," he murmured, his voice rough.

Lillian arched a brow. "No thanks to you. You wore me out."

A smirk tugged at his lips as he approached the bed. "Good." He leaned down, bracing his hands on either side of her, caging her in. "Because I’m not done with you yet."

Her breath hitched.

Then his phone rang.

Sebastian cursed under his breath, pulling back to glance at the screen. His jaw tightened.

Lillian didn’t need to ask who it was.

Donovan.

Again.

Sebastian’s grip on the phone turned white-knuckled. "This ends today," he growled before answering.

Lillian barely had time to process his words before he turned and stormed out of the room, leaving her with a sinking feeling in her stomach.

Something was about to go very, very wrong.

My throat tightened as the wolf prowled closer, her golden eyes locked onto me.

Just as her claws slashed toward the branch I clung to, I let go. The sudden release sent the limb snapping upward—straight into her snout with a sickening crack. The impact sent her tumbling backward, crashing through the foliage below.

The recoil launched me into the air like a shot from a cannon. For one surreal moment, I soared higher than the surveillance drones circling above, weightless and exposed. No wings. No safety net. Just the merciless pull of gravity waiting to claim me.

From this dizzying height, the arena sprawled beneath me—a chaotic sea of snarling wolves, their howls rising in a frenzied chorus. The crowd’s gasps were audible even from here, fingers pointing, mouths gaping. Beatrice’s scream pierced through the noise when she recognized me mid-flight.

I couldn’t bring myself to look for Sebastian. The thought of seeing his face—whether etched with fury or terror—was worse than the impending crash.

Then, the ground rushed up. Fast. Too fast.

I twisted midair, angling my body to land inside the boundary lines. But as the wind roared in my ears, something inside me woke.

Power surged through my veins, molten and wild. Fur erupted across my skin, my bones snapping and reshaping with brutal efficiency. The pain was sharp, familiar—like stretching a muscle long unused. My wolf’s voice, silent for so long, howled in triumph inside my skull.

Clothes shredded. The world blurred.

Then—impact.

I hit the dirt on all fours, the force reverberating through my paws. Silence fell like a guillotine.

I was smaller than the others—a runt among giants. But my wolf? She didn’t care. Her confidence bled into me, sharpening my instincts. I knew her now, more than ever.

The wolves recovered quickly. Snarls erupted. They lunged.

What followed wasn’t a fight—it was a dance.

I darted between them, a silver blur. Jaws snapped at empty air. Claws swiped at shadows. One by one, I took them down—disabling, not killing. When my wolf’s bloodlust flared too hot, I reeled her back.

Some refused to yield. Pride made them stupid. They paid for it in shattered limbs and whimpers.

An hour later, the buzzer screeched, freezing the battlefield.

"Round two concludes!" the announcer boomed. "Group B, shift back and report for debrief."

Most obeyed instantly. Others—like Tabitha—struggled, their wolves still dominant. Medics swarmed the worst injured, hauling them off on stretchers.

I stayed in fur. Nudity might be trivial for shifters, but I wasn’t stripping in front of an audience.

Then, through the chaos, I felt him.

Sebastian.

His gaze locked onto mine from the sidelines, unreadable. The world narrowed to that single point of contact—

And my wolf reacted.

###Chapter 298

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains of Lillian's bedroom, casting golden patterns across the rumpled sheets. She stretched languidly, her muscles still humming from last night's passionate encounter with Sebastian. A contented sigh escaped her lips as she recalled the way his strong hands had traced every curve of her body with possessive reverence.

Downstairs, the mansion buzzed with its usual morning energy. The scent of freshly brewed coffee and buttery croissants wafted through the halls, courtesy of Lucien's culinary magic. Giselle moved efficiently between rooms, directing the staff with quiet authority while Theodore oversaw the day's schedule with military precision.

Lillian padded barefoot to the walk-in closet, her fingers brushing against the silk robe Sebastian had gifted her last week. The deep emerald fabric matched her eyes perfectly - another example of his frightening attention to detail. As she tied the sash around her waist, her phone buzzed violently on the nightstand.

Beatrice's name flashed across the screen with three consecutive texts:
"Emergency brunch. NOW."
"Cassandra is spreading new rumors."
"Meet me at The Velvet Bean in 30."

Lillian's stomach dropped. Cassandra had been suspiciously quiet since the incident at the spring formal, which only meant she'd been plotting something particularly vile. The memory of that humiliating night still burned - the way Cassandra had "accidentally" spilled red wine down Lillian's white dress while whispering venomous lies about her relationship with Sebastian.

She dressed quickly in distressed jeans and an off-the-shoulder sweater, pulling her hair into a messy bun. Sebastian would be in meetings all morning with Marcus and the regional alphas, which meant she could handle this without worrying him. Just as she reached for the doorknob, a small voice stopped her.

"Are you leaving again?" Oliver stood in the hallway, his pajama shirt buttoned crookedly and a stuffed wolf clutched under one arm. The vulnerability in his big brown eyes mirrored Sebastian's so perfectly it made her chest ache.

Lillian crouched to his level. "Just for a little while, sweetheart. Aunt Beatrice needs me."

Oliver scuffed his socked foot against the hardwood. "Dad said we could have pancakes together. He's making them special because..." His voice dropped to a whisper. "Because it's Mom's birthday today."

The revelation hit Lillian like a physical blow. Of course - she'd seen the date on Sebastian's calendar weeks ago but hadn't connected the dots. The way he'd held her extra tightly last night, the shadows in his eyes this morning - it all made sense now.

She pulled Oliver into a hug, inhaling the little-boy scent of maple syrup and fabric softener. "How about this? I'll talk to your dad, and we'll all have pancakes together tonight. With extra chocolate chips, just for you."

Oliver's answering smile could have powered the entire city. As he scampered off to find Frederick for their morning drive to school, Lillian pulled out her phone with trembling fingers. Beatrice would have to wait. Some things were more important than petty school gossip.

The grandfather clock in the foyer chimed nine times as Lillian turned toward Sebastian's study, her bare feet silent on the Persian rug. Through the partially open door, she could see him standing by the floor-to-ceiling windows, his broad shoulders tense beneath the tailored suit jacket. In his hands gleamed a silver picture frame she'd never seen before - the edges worn smooth from years of handling.

Her breath caught. This was a side of the powerful Lycan chairman few ever witnessed - the grieving widower, the devoted father. The man behind the legend.

Lillian raised her hand to knock just as Sebastian's phone rang. The sharp tone shattered the moment, and by the time he answered with a clipped "Blackwood," his mask of cool authority was firmly back in place. She caught only snippets of the conversation - "security breach," "northern border," and "immediate threat" - before Sebastian's entire demeanor shifted into what the pack called his "war mode."

He turned suddenly, his golden eyes locking onto hers through the doorway. The raw pain she'd glimpsed moments earlier had been replaced by something far more dangerous - the primal intensity of an alpha protecting what was his.

"We need to talk," he said, hanging up without ceremony. The picture frame disappeared into his desk drawer with practiced ease. "There's been an incident at the resort."

Lillian's pulse spiked. "Oliver—"

"Is perfectly safe," Sebastian assured her, already striding toward the door. "But we have a situation with Alpha Maximilian's pack. It seems our... mutual friend Donovan has been making trouble again."

The name landed between them like a live grenade. Lillian's fingers curled into fists at her sides as the familiar cocktail of anger and betrayal surged through her veins. After everything Donovan had done - rejecting their bond, humiliating her publicly, nearly getting her killed during the challenge ceremony - the bastard still wasn't finished.

Sebastian's large hand engulfed hers, his thumb stroking calming circles against her racing pulse. "Breathe, little wolf. This time, we end it." The promise in his voice sent shivers down her spine. "But first, you should know—"

The study door burst open before he could finish. Marcus stood on the threshold, his usually impeccable appearance disheveled from what looked like a high-speed drive. "Sir, we have confirmation. They've taken Victoria."

The blood drained from Sebastian's face. In that moment, Lillian saw something she'd never witnessed before - the mighty Alpha Blackwood, truly shaken.

As Sebastian barked orders to mobilize the pack's elite forces, Lillian's phone buzzed again. Beatrice's latest message included a photo attachment that made her stomach twist - a grainy surveillance still of Donovan entering a seedy motel on the outskirts of town. And tucked under his arm, unmistakable even in the poor quality image, was a limp figure with familiar chestnut curls.

The game had just changed. And this time, the stakes were life and death.

My breath hitched as I watched Lillian soar through the air. No parachute. No safety net. One wrong move, and she could be gone forever. Then—in a flash—she shifted. Her wolf form was smaller than the others, but there was something mesmerizing about it. A grace, a fierceness that made my own wolf stir restlessly beneath my skin.

He never fought me for control. Not like this. Not in years.

Yet here he was, claws scraping against my ribs, demanding to be let loose.

Lillian wasn’t the strongest, but she was fast. Clever. She used her size to her advantage, darting between opponents like a shadow. Every strike was precise, every movement calculated. She didn’t just survive—she dominated.

And it terrified me.

Because if she fell, if something happened to her—

My chest ached just thinking about it.

"Who is that girl?" Alistair, one of the Lycan chairmen, murmured from his seat.

There were four of them in total—the strongest of our kind. The judges. The ones who decided who lived, who died, who proved themselves worthy.

Nathaniel, another Lycan, didn’t take his eyes off Lillian. "Lillian Montague. Her professors rave about her. Even Maximilian said she impressed him."

Alistair hummed thoughtfully. "We should keep an eye on her."

I didn’t hesitate. "She passes to the next round."

Alistair raised a brow. "You think she can handle it?"

"Without a doubt," Nathaniel said with a smirk. "If I had to bet on anyone surviving, it’d be her."

My blood turned to ice.

I turned slowly, my voice dangerously low. "Survive?"

Alistair barely glanced at me. "Death isn’t penalized after the first week."

My fingers curled into fists. "What?"

Nathaniel sighed, as if explaining something obvious. "Second and third rounds—if they don’t surrender, their opponent can kill them. No penalty."

"You’d know," Alistair added dryly, "if you bothered to attend the last competition."

A decade ago. When I was still new. When I hadn’t cared enough to learn the rules.

Now, I cared too much.

The buzzer blared, signaling the end of the fight. Shifters transformed back, naked and exhausted, stumbling toward the locker rooms.

All except one.

Lillian stood in the center of the arena, her wolf’s head tilted toward the sky. Like she was whispering to the Moon Goddess. Like she was waiting.

Then her gaze found mine.

Held.

A heartbeat passed. Two.

And then she ran—not toward the others, but away. Into the trees. Into the dark.

My wolf snarled, demanding I follow.

And for the first time in years, I didn’t try to stop him.
###Chapter 299

The crisp morning air carried the faint scent of pine as Lillian stepped onto the balcony of Sebastian Blackwood’s sprawling estate. The sun had barely risen, casting a golden hue over the dense forest that bordered the property. She tightened the silk robe around her, the fabric cool against her skin.

Last night’s events replayed in her mind—Donovan’s sudden reappearance, the venom in his words, the way his new mate, Evelyn, had smirked at her as if she’d already won. Lillian’s fingers curled into fists. She had thought she was past this, past the pain of betrayal, but seeing them together had reopened old wounds.

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, not turning around.

The door creaked open, and the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled the air. "Thought you might need this," came Sebastian’s deep, velvety voice.

Lillian turned to see him holding a steaming cup, his dark eyes studying her with an intensity that made her pulse quicken. He was dressed impeccably as always, his tailored shirt hugging his broad shoulders.

"Thanks," she murmured, accepting the cup. Their fingers brushed, sending a jolt of warmth through her.

Sebastian leaned against the railing beside her, his gaze fixed on the horizon. "You didn’t sleep."

It wasn’t a question.

Lillian sighed. "Not much."

Silence stretched between them, comfortable yet charged. She took a sip of the coffee, the bitterness grounding her.

"He doesn’t deserve another thought," Sebastian finally said, his voice low. "Not after what he did."

Lillian’s grip tightened on the cup. "I know. But it’s not that simple."

Sebastian turned to face her fully. "Make it simple."

There was something in his tone—a challenge, a promise. Lillian met his gaze, and for a moment, the world narrowed to just the two of them.

Then, a shrill ringtone shattered the moment.

Sebastian pulled his phone from his pocket, his expression darkening as he read the screen. "We have a problem."

Lillian frowned. "What is it?"

"Donovan’s pack. They’ve challenged our territory."

Her heart skipped a beat. "What?"

Sebastian’s jaw clenched. "They’re testing us. And if we don’t respond, they’ll take it as weakness."

Lillian set her cup down with a sharp clink. "Then we respond."

Sebastian’s lips curved into a dangerous smile. "Exactly what I wanted to hear."

As they strode back inside, Lillian felt the shift in the air—the calm before the storm. Donovan had made his move.

Now, it was their turn.

I glanced over my shoulder at Alistair and Nathaniel who were deep in conversation. The selected judges occupied the front row, murmuring amongst themselves. Most spectators had dispersed to congratulate their favored competitors. Beatrice stood frowning in the direction Lillian had disappeared, while some unfamiliar guy whispered in her ear with his hand resting possessively on her thigh. My eyebrows knitted together at the sight.

Beatrice never struck me as the type to get cozy with strangers. Yet judging by their proximity and his casual touch, they'd clearly been intimate.

"Excuse me," I murmured to the other Lycan leaders before striding toward the woods where Lillian had vanished.

I discovered her crouched behind an ancient oak, completely bare except for her arms wrapped around herself. My footsteps startled her as I rounded the tree trunk.

"Are you injured?" I asked, kneeling before her. Her pallid complexion contrasted sharply with the crimson on her split lip and the purple bruises blossoming across her skin. My chest constricted at the sight, a primal urge to hunt down whoever harmed her surging through my veins—an impulse I forcefully suppressed.

"I'll live," she breathed, attempting a weak chuckle that sounded oddly melodic. "You should see the other wolf."

"I did," I replied, pulling a spare shirt from my bag—one I always carried for emergencies. "You fought brilliantly."

Her cheeks flushed pink as her eyes brightened. "Really?"

Nodding, I handed her the garment. Her grateful smile as she pulled it over her head sent an unexpected warmth through me. The fabric fell to her knees, preserving her modesty.

Exhaustion overtook her as she slumped against the tree. "I could sleep for a week," she murmured.

Leaning against the opposite side of the trunk, I reminded her, "Medical checkups are mandatory post-match. No exceptions."

She groaned. "They mentioned that at the welcome banquet." A yawn interrupted her. "Can't I just rest here first? Shifting drained me completely."

An unfamiliar laugh escaped my lips—a sound so rare even I barely recognized it.

"I like that," Lillian whispered.

Curious, I shifted until our faces were inches apart. Her eyes flew open in surprise when she felt my breath against her cheek, her skin blooming with color. "Like what?" I asked.

"The sound of your laughter," she admitted, turning to meet my gaze. "It's... rare. Beautiful."

Our eyes locked as I reached to tuck a damp strand of hair behind her ear. She leaned into my touch like a flower toward sunlight. My thumb traced her swollen lower lip, feeling it part slightly beneath my caress.

No words passed between us. This intimacy felt different—no frenzied passion, just the quiet exchange of breath and energy. When my lips finally brushed hers, the kiss began gently, then deepened as my fingers tangled in her hair.

"Sebastian..." she gasped when I trailed kisses down her neck, her body trembling beneath my exploring hands.

The snap of a twig had us springing apart like scalded cats. A voice called through the trees: "Lillian? Are you still out here?"

The scent of pine and damp earth filled Lillian's senses as she stood at the edge of the clearing, her fingers trembling against the rough bark of an ancient oak. Moonlight filtered through the dense canopy above, casting silver patterns across Sebastian Blackwood's chiseled features as he stepped forward.

"You shouldn't have come alone," his deep voice rumbled, the vibration making her pulse quicken. The Lycan chairman's golden eyes glowed with barely restrained power, his massive frame tense with predatory grace.

Lillian swallowed hard, her werewolf instincts screaming at the proximity of her fated mate. "I had to warn you," she whispered, her breath forming mist in the chilly night air. "Donovan's planning something—"

A twig snapped behind them. Both whirled around to see Evelyn emerge from the shadows, her crimson lips curled in a smirk that didn't reach her cold blue eyes. "How touching," she purred, running manicured fingers through her platinum blonde hair. "The rejected mate still playing guardian angel."

Sebastian moved instinctively, positioning himself between the two women. "This doesn't concern you, Evelyn."

"Oh, but it does." Evelyn's laughter rang hollow through the trees. "Donovan sends his regards." With a flick of her wrist, a dozen armed warriors materialized from the surrounding forest, their weapons glinting under the moonlight.

Lillian's claws extended as she dropped into a defensive stance. The metallic scent of bloodlust filled the air, mingling with the sharp tang of betrayal. Beatrice's warning from earlier echoed in her mind—this had been a setup from the beginning.

Sebastian's growl reverberated through the clearing as his transformation began, muscles rippling beneath his tailored suit. "Last chance to walk away," he warned, his voice deepening with the change.

Evelyn's smile turned feral. "Oh darling, the fun's just beginning." She raised her hand, the signal for attack.

As the first arrow whizzed past Lillian's ear, she realized with chilling clarity—this wasn't just an ambush. It was a declaration of war. And somewhere in the darkness, Donovan was watching, waiting to claim what he believed was his.


###Chapter 300
Lillian's POV

Genevieve froze when she spotted Sebastian Blackwood leaning against the ancient oak tree. Her eyes widened, cheeks flushing crimson as she immediately dropped her gaze to the forest floor. Sebastian had moved just in time—Genevieve hadn’t actually seen anything incriminating, but the tension in the air was thick enough to slice with a claw. She knew she’d interrupted something... she just didn’t know what.

"Alpha..." she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper, her face burning even hotter. "I—I didn’t realize you were here..."

Sebastian rose to his full height, his dominant aura rolling off him in waves. There was no mistaking his rank. Genevieve’s breath hitched, her body trembling under the weight of his presence. Being this close to raw, untamed power was overwhelming—especially for someone who wasn’t accustomed to it.

"I was checking on one of the recruits," he said coolly, his piercing gaze narrowing.

The unspoken warning in his eyes was unmistakable. I didn’t want him scaring Genevieve—she’d been nothing but kind to me since day one, tough as steel beneath that quiet demeanor. I could already tell she’d be a fierce competitor. But right now, under Sebastian’s scrutiny, she looked like a startled fawn. Guilt twisted in my chest. I knew exactly how intimidating he could be.

"We should head to the medic," I blurted, stepping between them. "Before the line gets too long. First come, first served, right?"

Genevieve nodded quickly, still refusing to lift her eyes.

"There are plenty of medics," she said softly, "but they’re filling up fast. Everyone wants to get patched up and get out."

I hummed in agreement.

"Then let’s go," I said, turning toward the tree line.

A shiver ran down my spine as I felt Sebastian’s gaze burning into the back of my skull. I glanced over my shoulder and flashed him a polite smile, dipping into a mock bow. "Thank you for your assistance, Alpha Blackwood," I purred, letting a sly grin slip before lowering my head again.

He studied me for a long moment, jaw tight, as if carefully weighing his next words.

"I’ll be seeing you," he finally said, voice low.

I gave a single nod before following Genevieve out of the woods.

The moment we stepped into the clearing, Beatrice came barreling toward me, throwing her arms around my neck with a squeal.

"You were insane out there!" she gushed. "I seriously thought you were going to faceplant into the dirt!"

"Honestly? Same," I admitted with a laugh.

"Nice job," a deep voice chimed in.

I hadn’t even noticed Dominic standing there until he spoke. He rested a hand on Beatrice’s shoulder, stepping closer—too close. Tall, broad-shouldered, with the kind of physique that suggested he spent more time in the gym than anywhere else. I shot Beatrice a questioning look, but she avoided my gaze, her body stiffening under his touch.

It should bother her. She had a mate. Things might be rocky right now, but still...

Then again, who knew what—or who—Lucien was up to at this very moment?

"Thanks," I said, forcing a smile.

"The second I saw you flying through the air, I knew I didn’t stand a chance," Genevieve laughed, shaking her head. "Seriously. Anyone who can pull off a stunt like that and walk away? Not someone you mess with."


"Damn right, and now the whole damn resort will know it too," Beatrice declared, tossing her dark curls over her shoulder with a smirk. "You made your statement. Own it, Lillian!"

Dominic crossed his arms, his expression grim. "Might not be the smartest move."

Beatrice shot him a glare. "What’s that supposed to mean?"

His jaw tightened. "Now she’s got a bullseye painted on her back. The others will come at her twice as hard—either to knock her out of the competition... or worse."

"They can’t just kill her without consequences," I pointed out, though my voice lacked conviction.

Dominic shook his head, shadows flickering in his gaze. "Only for the first week. This week’s just the warm-up—proving you’ve got what it takes. Next week?" He exhaled sharply. "Next week, the gloves come off. There are only two ways to win now."

Beatrice’s fingers curled into fists. "And those are?"

His lips thinned. "Either they surrender... or they don’t walk away at all." He locked eyes with me. "It’s about to get bloody. Watch your back."

I wanted to snap at him—tell him he had no right to act like he knew anything about this world, about me. I wanted to demand Beatrice send him packing. But before I could speak, a familiar voice cut through the tension.

"There you are."

I turned to see Rosalind—the girl from the airport—striding toward us, her combat boots crunching against the gravel. A sly smile played on her lips, her dark hair pulled into a messy braid that revealed a row of silver piercings along her ear. She was petite, barely reaching my shoulder, but the way she held herself made it clear she wasn’t someone to underestimate.

Her gaze locked onto mine, sharp and assessing. "We need to talk."
