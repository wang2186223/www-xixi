Title:
Now, I Am My Ex's Mother-In-Law 

Intro:
When Lillian Dumont’s fiancé betrays her to seize power, she’s thrust into a world of ancient curses and political warfare. Rescued by Sebastian Blackwood—the ruthless Lycan Alpha who once rejected her—she must navigate a web of deceit where loyalty is currency and desire is a weapon. As her body heals from Donovan’s poison, her heart fractures between vengeance and a forbidden attraction to the man who now owns her soul. But when the council threatens to tear apart her new family, Lillian discovers the darkest truth: the bond that binds her to Sebastian may be the key… or the curse that destroys them all.
