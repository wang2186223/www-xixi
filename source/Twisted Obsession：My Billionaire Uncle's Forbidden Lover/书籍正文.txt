###Chapter 1

The black Porsche had barely come to a stop when Sophia's phone rang.

The name "Daniel Clementson" flashing on the screen made her fingers hesitate.

Before she could answer, a shadow fell across the hood of her car.

"Miss Lowell, Mr. Roscente is waiting for you."

Zachary Evans' perpetually expressionless face appeared outside her window.

Sophia gripped the steering wheel, her knuckles turning white.

"Tell Mr. Roscente I have plans."

She declined the call and started the engine.

Zachary yanked open her car door, his tone brooking no argument. "Mr. Roscente said you're not going anywhere today."

In the rearview mirror, Sophia saw her own pale reflection.

Two years, and she still hadn't learned how to refuse him.

A black Maybach sat silently a short distance away.

Zachary tapped on its tinted window, which lowered with mechanical smoothness.

Ethan Roscente's profile emerged from the shadows, a cigarette dangling between his elegant fingers.

Through the haze of smoke, his gaze locked onto hers.

That look alone made her knees weak.

"Come here."

His voice was low, edged with ice.

Sophia took a shaky breath and stepped out.

The scent of leather and sandalwood enveloped her as she slid into the backseat.

"Uncle Ethan." Her voice trembled.

Ethan stubbed out his cigarette with a cold laugh. "Now you remember I'm your uncle?"

In one brutal motion, he seized her wrist and dragged her onto his lap.

Sophia landed hard, her nose colliding with his unyielding chest.

"Let me go! Daniel is waiting—"

"Daniel?" Ethan's fingers dug into her chin. "How familiar."

His icy touch trailed down her collar.

Sophia went rigid.

"Explain last week's text."

He bit her earlobe, increasing the pressure until she gasped.

After sending that "We're over" message, Ethan had gone radio silent for seven days.

She'd thought he'd accepted it.

"I'm getting married." She met his glacial stare. "Aunt Emily introduced us. He's a good man."

Ethan's eyes darkened dangerously.

"Did I approve?"

He tore open her blouse and sank his teeth into her collarbone.

Tears sprang to her eyes at the sharp pain.

"You don't own me!" Her voice shook. "Aren't you engaged too?"

The air turned arctic.

Ethan's lips curled. "Well informed."

Abruptly, he released her waist and hit the window control.

"Look who's here."

Sophia followed his gaze—and her blood turned to ice.

Daniel Clementson was approaching, phone in hand.

"Tell me," Ethan murmured against her ear, "should he see how his fiancée looks right now?"

Sophia frantically grabbed his wandering hand.

"Please..."

Her plea ended in a sob.

Ethan only smiled.

The doors locked with a decisive click.

"Too late."

Daniel reached the car, peering curiously through the glass.

Sophia shut her eyes in despair as Ethan's hand slid beneath her skirt.

"Miss Lowell?" Daniel knocked. "Are you in there?"

Through the tinted window, Sophia saw his blurred silhouette.

She bit her lip until copper filled her mouth.

Ethan suddenly withdrew his hand and lowered the window.

"Mr. Clementson?"

His voice dripped with satisfied indolence.

Daniel froze.

The partially open window revealed Ethan's razor-sharp profile—and Sophia disheveled in his arms.

"Allow me to introduce," Ethan traced Sophia's tear-stained cheek, "my niece."

He emphasized the last word cruelly.

Daniel went sheet-white.

"Miss Lowell, this is—"

"My uncle." Sophia's throat felt scraped raw. "Mr. Ethan Roscente of Roscente Group."

Daniel's bouquet hit the pavement with a thud.

Ethan chuckled. "Still taking my niece to dinner, Mr. Clementson?"

His fingers drew slow circles on Sophia's thigh.

Daniel fled.

Sophia trembled violently.

"Happy now?" Her voice was wrecked.

Ethan raised the window and gripped her nape.

"Remember—I make the rules."

He crushed his mouth to hers, blood blooming between them.

"Run again..."

The threat dissolved into shared breath.

Staring at the car ceiling, Sophia let silent tears fall.

She knew—she'd never escape him.

###Chapter 2
The car windows were tightly shut as Daniel Clementson's figure lingered outside.

Sophia Lowell's heart pounded violently when her phone rang incessantly.

Ethan Roscente's iron grip immobilized her, and the sound of her phone clattering onto the pavement outside was unmistakable.

Footsteps drew closer...

"Let me go!" Sophia struggled desperately, her voice barely above a whisper.

Instead of releasing her, the man rolled the window down slightly, his scorching breath grazing her ear. "Still trying to run?"

"You're insane..." Her voice trembled.

"Seems like you haven't learned your lesson."

The window lowered another inch.

Daniel's footsteps halted beside the car. "Sophia? Are you nearby?"

Biting her lip hard, Sophia turned tear-filled eyes toward Ethan.

His cold expression remained unreadable.

"I won't cut ties..." she conceded silently.

Ethan chuckled darkly before suddenly seizing the back of her head and crushing his lips against hers.

The moment Daniel turned away, the window shot back up.

"You're despicable..." Sophia shook with fury.

"Despicable?" He smirked, tracing her collarbone. "This is just the beginning."

Regret flooded her—too late for second thoughts now.

......

Afterward, Ethan leisurely adjusted his cufflinks.

Sophia curled up on the seat, her skin marred with telltale marks.

Lighting a cigarette, he studied her through the haze. "Cut that blind date off for good."

A black card landed on her lap.

"Pathetic," he sneered. "This wouldn't even cover my gas."

Her entire savings—dismissed with contempt.

The car door slammed shut, leaving Sophia collapsing onto the pavement.

Her phone rang again—Emily Laurent's scolding erupted instantly. "How dare you stand up the Clementsons?"

"We're incompatible." She ended the call wearily.

At home, a new contact request flashed on her screen.

The attached document—The Clementson Code—made her blood run cold.

"Wives must rise at 4 AM..."

"Monthly allowance capped at $70..."

Sophia stared at her phone, speechless.

Had this family time-traveled from the Victorian era?
###Chapter 3

Sophia's fingertip lightly tapped the screen as she sent the edited message.

"Mrs. Clementson, there's been a misunderstanding. Your son and I are merely acquaintances. We're not compatible."

The moment the message showed "read," her phone began vibrating violently.

"Acquaintances? Don't play coy after going on a blind date!"
"My son is an executive at a listed company! You should feel honored he even considered you!"
"Don't think youth and beauty make you special. So what if he's divorced? Girls line up for him!"

Sophia's pupils constricted sharply.

Divorced?

Daniel had sworn he'd never been in a relationship.

A cold laugh escaped her lips. This family was beyond delusional.

Her fingers flew across the screen as she screenshot the voice-to-text transcript. She bundled it with that ridiculous "Clementson Code" and sent it all to Emily.

The phone rang almost instantly.

"Sophia... is this real?" Emily's voice trembled with disbelief.

"The chat history doesn't lie. Would you like to hear the original voice messages?"

Silence stretched across the line.

Finally, Emily spoke, guilt weighing her words. "I misjudged him. My friend said he was such a good catch, so I..."

"Aunt Emily," Sophia interrupted, "did you forget the gambling debt from two years ago?"

The mention made Emily's voice shake. "I... I understand now."

"By the way," Emily abruptly changed subjects, "you must come to dinner tonight. The Roscentes are hosting an important guest."

Sophia's finger froze mid-air. "I'd rather not."

"It's your uncle's fiancée!" Emily hissed. "The entire family is expected to attend."

CRASH—

A glass shattered across the floor.

Sophia stared at the scattered shards, her voice barely audible. "...Fiancée?"

"Yes, your uncle is finally settling down." Emily sounded relieved. "I thought we'd be celebrating your wedding first."

Sophia bit her lower lip until copper flooded her tongue. "I... have a project deadline tonight."

"What project could be more important?" Emily snapped. "The Third Branch will—"

"Fine." Sophia's reply was mechanical. "I'll be there."

The call ended. She slid down the wall, collapsing onto the floor.

The setting sun stretched her shadow into something long and distorted.

Time blurred.

Then her screen lit up with a new notification.

One glance turned her face deathly pale.
###Chapter 4

The phone screen lit up, revealing a shocking image.

In the photo, she stumbled out of Ethan Roscente's luxury car, her clothes disheveled. The faint red marks on her pale skin were unmistakable.

Sophia Lowell clutched her neck. The bite mark in the mirror matched the photo perfectly.

Her fingers trembled. A cold sweat trickled down her spine.

Who took this?

What did they want?

Ding—

Another message popped up. The phone slipped from her grasp, the screen shattering like a spiderweb.

"Stay away from Ethan Roscente, or this goes public."

The threat was aimed at Ethan.

Was it one of the Roscente elders? Or one of his admirers?

A chill crawled up from her feet.

The Roscentes prized their reputation above all. If this affair came to light...

Ethan, as the Roscente heir, would be untouchable. But she? She’d be crushed like an ant.

The February breeze brushed her face, yet she felt frozen to the bone.

Her hands shook as she tried to reply—only to find herself blocked.

She was trapped. Helpless.

"Meow—"

Her calico cat rubbed against her ankle. Sophia mechanically poured kibble into its bowl.

The fishy scent hit her nose. Her stomach lurched.

"Ghk—"

The retching sound startled the cat, its fur standing on end.

She rushed to the bathroom—and caught sight of an unopened condom box.

A memory flashed:

Ethan’s burning lips against her ear. "Birthday wish—no condom."

The morning-after pill... She’d forgotten to take it.

Her nails dug into her palms. Her period was a week late.

Night fell. The Roscente mansion blazed with light.

Emily Laurent paced anxiously at the entrance. "You’re late!" Her eyes narrowed. "Why are you so pale?"

"Fourth Young Madam, the patriarch awaits your tea." The butler appeared abruptly.

Emily hesitated, then dragged Sophia into the parlor.

Under the crystal chandelier, Ethan accepted a gilded Marriage Pledge. His black shirt accentuated his aristocratic bearing—yet the undone collar hinted at something wild.

"It’s time to finalize Ninth Young Master’s marriage." Mr. Roscente Sr.’s voice boomed.

Sophia shrank into the shadows, her nails biting into her palms.

"I heard Sophia Lowell accepted a million-dollar betrothal gift from the Clementsons?" Victoria Langley’s voice cut through the room. "Father, why not draft a pledge for her too?"

Emily’s teacup rattled in its saucer.

"The Clementsons?" The patriarch’s hawk-like gaze sharpened. "Come here."

Two pairs of eyes pinned her in place—

One, stern and assessing.

The other, icy enough to devour her alive.
###Chapter 5

Mr. Roscente Sr. slammed his teacup onto the table, his face dark with anger.

"You may not carry the Roscente blood, but you're still family." His sharp gaze swept over Sophia. "Getting married without consulting me? Did you forget who runs this household?"

The grand hall fell deathly silent.

Sophia clenched the fabric of her dress. She knew the old man didn't actually care about her marriage—he was furious his authority had been challenged.

"My apologies, Grandfather." She lowered her eyes in submission.

The stares around her felt like knives. Ethan Roscente sat at the head of the table, making her humiliation even more unbearable.

"No dinner tonight. Reflect on your actions in your room." The old man's voice was icy. "If we didn't have guests arriving, your punishment would be far worse."

Sophia bit her lip, her eyes burning.

Ethan suddenly chuckled, dipping his brush into ink.

"No need for such anger." His brush moved fluidly across the paper. "I'll draft the Marriage Pledge myself."

The characters "Heaven-Made Union" appeared in bold strokes.

The old man's expression softened slightly. "Aren't you going to thank your uncle?"

"Thank you, Uncle Ethan." As Sophia took the document, her fingertips brushed against his. A chill shot down her spine.

Ethan's voice held mocking amusement. "May my dear niece enjoy eternal happiness with her beloved."

......

Back in her quarters, Sophia still felt suffocated.

Ethan's words coiled around her like a venomous snake. During their brief eye contact, she'd seen dangerous flames flickering in his gaze.

She had to leave. Now.

She grabbed her handbag in haste, but it slipped from her grasp. A pregnancy test rolled out, stopping at the polished toe of a leather shoe.

"What is this?"

Ethan's voice turned her body to stone.

She scrambled to retrieve it, but he was faster. The test twirled between his long fingers, two clear pink lines visible.

The air froze.

"Explain." His voice could have iced over hell.

Sophia's fingers trembled. "It's not—"

"Lying again?" Ethan gripped her chin. "Have I not warned you about acting in front of me?"

Forced to meet his gaze, she saw fury swirling in those dark depths.

"It's mine," she finally admitted.

Ethan abruptly released her, tossing the test back at her.

"Pity." His smile was cruel. "I don't tolerate loose ends."

Sophia looked down. The second line had vanished—she'd imagined it.

"Relax." He turned to leave. "You'll never carry my child."

The door slammed. Sophia collapsed to the floor, unsure whether to feel relief or despair.

###Chapter 6

The dim glow of the bedside lamp cast shadows around Ethan Roscente's imposing figure. He lounged casually against the headboard, his tailored slacks accentuating the long legs bent at the knees. One hand rested idly on his thigh, exuding an aura of suffocating dominance.

This was a man who could make debutantes swoon across the city. With his chiseled jawline and obsidian-dark eyes, every movement radiated aristocratic refinement. No wonder even Isabella Valentine—that haughty Shanghai socialite—had fallen hopelessly for him.

Sophia Lowell's lips twisted into a bitter smile at the recent engagement rumors between the Roscentes and Valentines. Another wave of broken hearts was inevitable.

"Come here." Ethan's voice was glacial as he patted his thigh.

Sophia's breath hitched. This was about the dowry—the one she'd accepted from the Clementsons. Otherwise, why would the Roscente heir abandon his fiancée at the main reception to seek her out in the back quarters?

Steeling herself, she approached. His iron grip seized her waist instantly. Dark eyes raked over her, turning frostier by the second. "A million dollars buys you? Then my twenty million was clearly overpaying."

The words stabbed like daggers. Her nails dug into her palms. "Is that all I'm worth to you?"

"Prove me wrong." His mocking eyebrow lift said everything.

Acid rose in her throat. She'd brought this on herself—climbing into his bed drunk for money. Deserved every ounce of contempt.

Tears burned behind her eyelids as she lifted her chin defiantly. "If I repay the twenty million, are we square?"

Ethan suddenly gripped her jaw, fury swirling in his gaze. "Seems today's lesson wasn't harsh enough."

Pain unleashed the tears, scalding against his fingers. "What if I'm pregnant?" she whispered.

"There is no what if."

"But if—"

"Termination."

The clinical response turned her blood to ice.

"Because I'm unworthy?" Her laugh was hollow.

His eyes darkened. "If that's how you see it."

Her heart tore in two. Wiping her face, she forced a smile. "You're right—I'm desperate! Any man with money can have me!"

Meeting his thunderous glare, she spat, "Better to be someone's wife than your dirty secret. Twenty million? You'll have it with interest in thirty days. Now get out!"

A vein pulsed at Ethan's temple. He slammed her onto the mattress, voice dangerous. "Brave words, Sophia."

"We've already slept together. Drop the act." Her laugh was brittle.

"Good." His grip turned punishing, leaving angry red marks on her porcelain skin. She gasped at the sting.

"Think you can walk away?" He bit her earlobe hard. "Pay the interest first."

His mouth crashed down in a punitive kiss. Copper flooded her tongue as her lip split. She shoved against him. "Stop! Ethan, you—"

"Sophia?" Emily Laurent's worried knock interrupted. "Who are you talking to?"

Sophia froze. "It's Aunt Emily... please..."

He ignored her, branding her neck with fresh marks. Terror sent tremors through her body.

"Sophia!" The doorknob turned. The door burst open—

"Sophia!"
###Chapter 7

Sophia Lowell curled up on her bed, blasting deafening music through her headphones. Her knuckles turned white as she gripped her phone, staring at the screen with unblinking intensity.

The door burst open.

"Aunt Emily?" She pulled off her headphones, brows furrowing. "Is everything settled in the front hall?"

Emily Laurent stormed in and smacked her shoulder hard. "You brat! I've been shouting for ten minutes! Are you deaf?"

The slap landed directly on the bite mark Ethan Roscente had left.

Sophia sucked in a sharp breath, subtly rubbing her shoulder. "I was too focused on the movie."

"When will you ever stop worrying me?" Emily stamped her foot in frustration.

Sophia lifted her icy gaze. "Isn't this all thanks to you?"

Emily's face paled. She reached out to grab her. "Sophia, let me explain—"

The blanket flew up as Sophia burrowed underneath. "I'm tired."

Emily's hand hung frozen in midair. Sighing, she turned to leave but suddenly noticed the wide-open window.

"Leaving the window open in the middle of the night? Are you trying to freeze to death?"

She hurried toward the window.

Sophia jolted under the covers. "I'll close it myself! Just go!"

The sudden outburst startled Emily, who retreated awkwardly.

The moment the lock clicked, Sophia leaped from the bed and rushed to the window.

The night was pitch black. Ethan was long gone.

He had jumped from the third floor.

Her legs gave way, and she slid down the wall, collapsing onto the floor. The cold night wind seeped into her collar as she hugged her knees, trembling uncontrollably.

Before dawn, Sophia slipped out of the ancestral house.

She took a scalding shower, refilled her calico cat's food bowl, and left with a piece of toast between her teeth.

The morning at the executive office was uneventful.

"Sophia! Over here!"

During lunch, colleagues waved her over in the cafeteria. The moment she sat down, gossip bombarded her.

"Did you hear Mr. Roscente spent the night at a hotel?" someone whispered with a suggestive smirk.

"No way!" another gasped. "Isn't he famously frigid?"

A phone screen was shoved in her face. The tabloid headline showed Ethan escorting a socialite into a hotel.

"Isabella Valentine, the Socialite Princess. A perfect match."

"So the arranged marriage rumors are true."

Amid the chatter, Sophia stared at Ethan's cold profile in the photo. Suddenly, the food in her mouth turned tasteless.
###Chapter 8

"Look over there! That couple is absolutely perfect together!"

In the break room, several female coworkers huddled by the window, whispering and pointing toward the parking lot below.

Sophia Lowell's fingers tightened slightly around her coffee cup.

Through the glass, she immediately recognized that tall, straight-backed figure. Ethan Roscente was wearing the same black shirt from last night, and the woman clinging to his arm was none other than Isabella Valentine, the socialite princess of Shanghai's elite circle.

"Sophia, you're with Mr. Roscente every day. You must know the inside scoop, right?" Colleague Daisy Zhang leaned in with a suggestive look. "Rumor has it Miss Valentine is the Roscente family's chosen daughter-in-law."

Sophia took a sip of coffee, her expression unreadable behind the rising steam.

"I only handle work-related matters," she said calmly, setting the cup down. "Mr. Roscente's personal affairs are none of my concern."

"Really?" someone scoffed. "But you're his personal secretary."

The emphasis on the last word drew a round of knowing laughter.

Sophia's fingers paused briefly as she straightened a stack of files.

"Last week when Mr. Roscente went to Paris, he took Zachary Evans as his assistant." She lifted her head with a professional smile. "If you're so curious, why not ask him?"

The break room fell silent.

The women exchanged glances, but no one dared to respond.

Sophia picked up her folder and walked out. The moment the elevator doors closed, she finally dropped the act, leaning wearily against the wall.

Six months ago, she had been a top student in architecture school. An unexpected turn of events cost her the job offer from the design firm, yet somehow landed her the position as Ethan Roscente's secretary.

Ding—

A notification chimed from her phone. A text from an unknown number.

Her face paled as she read it.

The pregnancy test from last night was defective? The results might be inaccurate?

She rushed back to her office, grabbed her coat, and bolted out the door.

Twenty minutes later, Sophia stood in a pharmacy restroom, staring at the pregnancy test in her hand.

Two bright red lines burned her eyes.

Pregnant.

She was really pregnant.

A cold wind tangled her hair as she stood on the street, her fingers unconsciously drifting to her still-flat stomach.

This couldn't have come at a worse time.

Taking a deep breath, she pulled out her phone and dialed a number.

"Hello, is this the maternity hospital? I'd like to schedule an abortion."
###Chapter 9

The sharp scent of disinfectant in the hospital hallway made Sophia Lowell's temples throb.

"Congratulations, we can already see the fetal heartbeat." The doctor slid the ultrasound printout toward her, pointing at the blurry speck. "In a few weeks, you'll be able to hear it."

Sophia's fingers trembled as she lightly touched the paper.

"I want an abortion."

The doctor adjusted her glasses and flipped through the medical chart. "Your endometrial lining is very thin. If you terminate this pregnancy, it might—"

"I know." Sophia cut her off. "I've done my research."

A low rumble of thunder rolled outside as rain began pelting the windows.

With a sigh, the doctor handed her the consent form. "Come back tomorrow at nine. Don't eat anything beforehand."

Rain mixed with tears blurred her vision as she stepped out of the hospital. Sophia wiped her face and slid into her car.

Her phone buzzed in her purse. Emily Laurent.

"Sis, the Clementsons refused the refund. They said to consider it an apology gift—"

Sophia tucked the phone between her ear and shoulder, turning the steering wheel with one hand. "Then donate it to the orphanage."

The elevator doors parted slowly as she fumbled for her keys.

A familiar cedarwood scent enveloped her.

Ethan Roscente leaned against her doorframe, his suit jacket draped over his arm, tie hanging loose. Seven or eight cigarette butts littered the floor at his feet.

Sophia's breath hitched.

"Finally decided to come home?" He crushed the cigarette beneath his shoe, the ember flickering in the dim hallway.

Her keys jingled as she walked past him without a word.

His hand shot out, gripping her wrist with bruising force. "Who was that man on the phone?"

Pain shot through her arm, but Sophia laughed. "Mr. Roscente... are you jealous?"

He slammed her against the wall, knee pressing between her thighs. "Have I been too lenient with you?"

The scent of leather and tobacco overwhelmed her as she turned her face away. "Does your fiancée know you're this free?"

Ethan's eyes turned icy. His thumb dragged roughly across her pale lips. "Why do you look so sick?"

The elevator dinged.

"Ethan?" A sweet feminine voice called from behind them. "There you are."
###Chapter 10

The pungent scent of tobacco assaulted her senses.

Sophia Lowell immediately covered her mouth, coughing violently. "I can't stand smoke right now—" The words slipped out before she could stop them. She bit her lower lip in frustration.

"What are you doing here?" Her voice was icy.

Ethan Roscente leaned against the doorframe, the cigarette between his fingers glowing faintly. His gaze lingered on the flushed tips of her ears before he drawled, "Sophia."

When she frowned, he added with deliberate provocation, "Here to fuck you, Sophia."

"You—!" Her ears burned crimson.

This bastard!

She turned to slam the door, but a strong hand blocked it. Ethan braced himself against the frame, towering over her.

Those peach-blossom eyes, deep as a pool, always seemed to hold a hint of affection—no matter who they looked at. Once, she had been fooled by them, believing he truly cared for her.

Later, she learned all his tenderness was a lie. She was just a shield to protect the woman he truly loved, a plaything he could summon at will.

"State your business or leave." Sophia pressed against the door, her voice glacial.

Ethan scoffed and effortlessly pushed it open. He locked it behind him, then seized the back of her neck, slamming her against the entryway cabinet.

"Ah—" The hard edge dug into her spine, drawing a pained gasp from her.

Before she could react, his lips crashed down on hers. The taste of tobacco and cold cedar flooded her mouth. She struggled, but his strength overpowered her.

Slap!

A sharp crack echoed through the room.

Ethan turned his head slightly, tongue pressing against his stinging cheek. He narrowed his eyes, thumb brushing her bloodied lip. "You've grown bold."

"Had enough?" He gripped her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. "Even playing hard to get has its limits."

Sophia suddenly laughed.

Even now, he still thought this was some petty game.

"Ethan." She stared straight into his eyes, her voice feather-light. "I mean it. I'll pay you back. We're done."

"Pay me back?" His laugh was cold. "With what?" His gaze raked over her. "Asking that blind date for money? Sophia, are you really this cheap?"

Every word cut like a knife, leaving her bleeding inside.

Her nails dug into her palms, but her expression remained calm. "Whether I sell my body or my blood, it's none of your concern. You agreed yesterday—once the money's transferred, we're even."

Ethan lit another cigarette, the ember casting shadows across his sharp profile. "When did I ever agree?"
###Chapter 11

Sophia's pupils contracted sharply, her fingernails digging deep into her palms.

"What do you mean?" Her voice trembled.

Ethan Roscente leisurely adjusted his cuffs, a mocking curve playing at the corner of his lips.

"From start to finish, did I ever say I agreed to your terms?"

He suddenly leaned in, his cold fingers gripping her chin. "Miss Lowell, there's a limit to wishful thinking."

A chill ran down Sophia's spine.

He was right. Yesterday, he hadn't explicitly agreed. Blinded by anger, she had mistaken his silence for consent.

In this game, she would always be the loser.

Her legs weakened, and she staggered, catching herself on the coffee table behind her.

"Ethan..." Her voice was hoarse. "I surrender. I can't play this game anymore."

A shadow flickered in the man's eyes.

"Scared now?" He sneered. "Too bad. I make the rules."

He yanked her into his arms, his scorching breath grazing her ear.

"If you dare provoke me, you'll pay the price." Each word was like a poisoned blade. "You won't escape until I say it's over."

Sophia trembled violently, her nails scraping against the table with a shrill sound.

He was punishing her, after all...

This man's heart was even crueler than she'd imagined.

Ethan watched her pale face with satisfaction, lowering his head to claim her lips. Suddenly, a sharp ringtone shattered the moment.

The caller ID flashed: "Isabella."

Frowning, he released Sophia and strode to the window to answer. Within seconds, his expression darkened.

"I'll be right there."

Hanging up, he grabbed his coat and cast an icy glance at Sophia, who sat slumped on the floor.

"Move back to Riverside Heights by tomorrow." His voice was commanding. "Or I'll personally escort you there."

The door slammed shut behind him.

Sophia stared blankly at the name on his phone, her heart tearing in two.

So he could say someone else's name with such tenderness... So he could rush to someone else's side...

Unlike with her—where there was only cold orders and humiliation.

Tears blurred her vision, and a sharp pain suddenly shot through her abdomen. She curled into herself, her back drenched in cold sweat.

"Baby..." She pressed a trembling hand to her stomach. "I'm sorry..."

The doctor's warning echoed in her ears: Extreme emotional distress can harm the fetus...

She tried to steady her breathing, but the tears wouldn't stop.
###Chapter 12

The fluorescent lights in the operating room stung her eyes.

Sophia lay on the cold surgical table, her fingers unconsciously gripping the sheets beneath her. The moment the doctor picked up the instrument, she suddenly sat up.

"I'm not doing this."

Her voice was soft but firm.

Sunlight streamed through the hospital doors as she stepped outside. Sophia looked down at her flat stomach, where a tiny life was growing. The doctor had said her body was special—this pregnancy was nothing short of a miracle.

"Baby..." she murmured, a gentle smile touching her lips.

This child had nothing to do with Ethan Roscente. She would never let him know.

The next morning, Sophia arrived at HR right on time. The resignation process went smoothly—she didn’t give Ethan a single chance to interfere.

"Sophia, you're really leaving?" a colleague asked in surprise.

She only smiled, carrying a cardboard box as she walked away without looking back.

Inside were a few notebooks and a small potted plant. At the building’s entrance, she tossed them into the trash without hesitation.

Packing was quick. Standing in the empty apartment, she scooped up the calico cat curled on the sofa.

"Let's go."

As the plane took off, she cast one last glance at the city’s skyline. No longing—only relief.

The atmosphere in the boardroom turned icy.

Ethan stared at his phone, his knuckles whitening. The HR notification glared back at him: Sophia Lowell has resigned.

"Continue," he said coldly, flipping the phone face-down.

The meeting dragged on. Ethan checked his watch repeatedly, his attention slipping during presentations. The moment it ended, he stood and left without delay.

"Send Sophia to my office," he ordered, his voice low as he passed her vacant desk.

The new assistant trembled. "She resigned this morning..."

"Who approved it?" His gaze sharpened.

"Interns... can leave anytime..." The assistant’s voice faded.

The office air thickened. Ethan stared at Sophia’s spotless workstation—as if she had never existed.

It hit him then.

This wasn’t a game.

She was really gone.
###Chapter 13

Zachary Evans hurried into the conference room and whispered into Ethan Roscente's ear.

Ethan's face darkened instantly, radiating an icy chill that filled the air.

The executives lowered their heads, barely daring to breathe.

Ethan strode back to his office, his gaze landing on the credit card atop his desk.

The severance payment he'd given Sophia Lowell.

Now she'd returned it untouched.

A sharp snap echoed through the room.

Ethan snapped the card in half with his bare hands, the jagged edge drawing blood from his palm.

He took a sip of coffee, his brow furrowed.

"Contact Sophia immediately," Ethan's voice cut like frozen steel. "Tell her to get back here. Roscente Group isn't some place she can walk away from whenever she pleases."

Zachary handed him a tablet with trembling hands. "Sir, Ms. Lowell has already left New York..."

Crash!

The expensive bone china cup shattered against the floor.

Ethan's eyes turned stormy with fury.

Zachary felt cold sweat trickle down his back.

...

Seattle International Airport.

Sophia wheeled her luggage through the terminal, breathing deeply of her hometown air.

Her first stop was the cemetery to pay respects to her grandparents and mother.

Then she headed straight to the University of Washington.

A month ago, her mentor Theodore Orlando had offered her a teaching position.

She'd declined then because of Ethan.

Now free, she could finally pursue her dreams.

"I thought you weren't coming," Theodore said with a warm smile, waiting at the administration office doorway.

Sophia's eyes grew moist. "I couldn't disappoint my teacher."

Theodore had been her grandfather's prized student, her mother's classmate, and now her mentor.

This continuity filled her with warmth.

"All the paperwork is done. Classes start next week." Theodore patted her shoulder. "Your mother would be so proud."

Gazing at the familiar campus buildings, Sophia saw the promise of a new beginning.
###Chapter 14

Theodore Orlando gazed at Sophia Lowell, his eyes seeing traces of someone familiar in her features.

He sighed softly. "You're even more talented than your mother was. Completing a dual bachelor's-master's program in four years with a graduation project that stunned the industry—such achievements are rare."

Pausing, his voice tinged with regret. "When I heard you switched careers to become a secretary, I thought the architecture world had lost a rising star."

His broad hand rested on Sophia's shoulder as a relieved smile spread across his face. "Seeing you return puts my mind at ease."

Sophia lowered her lashes. "I'm sorry for worrying you, Professor."

"But..." Theodore suddenly frowned. "There's a three-month internship required at the Bayview campus first. Will that work for you?"

The mention of Bayview made Sophia's breath catch. She quickly composed herself. "That's fine. I lived there for two years before."

The city she thought she'd never set foot in again was now calling her back. At least switching industries meant no further ties to Ethan Roscente. In a metropolis that size, with them at opposite ends, the chances of crossing paths were negligible.

Theodore mused, "My son teaches graduate students there. I'll have him look out for you. It helps to know someone when you're new to a place."

He hid his matchmaking intentions. With his son nearing thirty and still single, what father wouldn't worry?

Sophia almost declined but relented under her mentor's concerned gaze. "Thank you. I appreciate that."

The next day, Sophia flew to Bayview. Though winter break wasn't over, the campus already buzzed with visitors. After a quick orientation, she rented an apartment near the university district.

The constant travel exhausted her pregnant body. Just as she settled to rest, the doorbell rang.

Peeling off her face mask, she opened the door to Vivian Ashcroft's dramatic embrace. "Darling, I've missed you to death!"

Sophia dodged her kiss and swatted away her ice-cold hands. "Keep your distance. Pregnant women can't afford colds."

"What?!" Vivian's eyes bulged. "You're serious?"

Sophia tossed her the ultrasound. "See for yourself. Your future godchild's debut appearance."

Vivian squinted at the grainy image. "This blob tells me nothing." Then she lowered her voice. "Who's the father? Don't tell me it's that bastard Ethan Roscente."

Sophia arched a brow. "Who else?"
###Chapter 15

"That bastard Ethan Roscente!" Vivian Ashcroft slammed the table, her chest heaving with rage. "He gets what he wants and disappears without a word, leaving you here alone! Calling him a dog would be an insult to dogs—at least they know how to protect their owners!"

Sophia Lowell blinked, startled by the sudden outburst.

She'd known Vivian's sharp tongue for years, but it still caught her off guard.

"Am I being too harsh?" Vivian side-eyed her. "Don't tell me you still care about him."

After all, Ethan had once been Sophia's everything.

Sophia reached for a soda, then remembered Vivian was cutting sugar and handed her water instead.

"It's over," she shrugged. "He goes his way, I go mine."

Vivian sulked as her soda was swapped, taking a reluctant sip. "Because of that Shanghai socialite princess, Isabella Valentine?"

"You know about her?"

"Everyone in our circle does." Vivian scoffed. "Thought it was just PR, but they actually got married."

She added through gritted teeth, "May they be infertile yet surrounded by grandchildren!"

Sophia's lips twitched.

That was one vicious curse.

They headed out for dinner at a private kitchen.

As they stepped out of the car, Daniel Clementson emerged from another vehicle with an elegant middle-aged woman.

"Sophia." Daniel's face lit up.

Sophia gave a stiff nod. Their blind date had been awkward, but he'd remained polite.

"Hmph!" Mrs. Clementson looked down her nose, scrutinizing Sophia. "Average looks, yet so picky. My son liking you is more luck than you deserve!"

"Want that 'luck' for yourself?" Vivian retorted as she parked.

Mrs. Clementson eyed Vivian's crop top and heavy makeup with disgust. "Shameless hussy! Sophia, keep trash like this away unless you want to catch something."

Sophia's expression darkened.

Mrs. Clementson prattled on, "Not enough dowry? We can add another million. After marriage, stay home and breed—don't embarrass us in public..."
###Chapter 16

"Enjoy your damn retirement, you old hag! Keep running that foul mouth and karma will bite you!"

Vivian Ashcroft lived by the motto "manners are overrated" and didn’t hold back.

"The Qing Dynasty fell centuries ago. How is a fossil like you still crawling around embarrassing yourself? Shouldn’t you be home serving your husband and kids instead of throwing a tantrum here? Watch out—someone might just knock you out in broad daylight."

Sophia Lowell: "..."

She suddenly realized she’d underestimated her best friend’s combat skills.

This was brutal.

Mrs. Clementson’s face had turned the color of liver, veins bulging in fury.

"Mrs. Clementson," Sophia said coldly, "civilized people don’t bark like rabid dogs. I’ve made myself clear—your family is the one harassing me. Not even an extra million would make me look twice at your son. From now on, let’s pretend we’re strangers."

"You—!"

The older woman trembled with rage.

Daniel Clementson, seeing his mother humiliated, adopted a wounded expression. "Sophia, I thought you were different from other women. Turns out you’re just as crude. No matter how harsh my mother’s words were, she’s still your elder. How could you let your friend insult her?"

Vivian nearly gagged.

Was this idiot binge-watching toxic family dramas?

She was ready to fire back when Sophia stopped her with an icy glare. "Sorry to disappoint, but this is exactly who I am. Disrespect my best friend again, and words won’t be the only thing flying." Her lips curled into a smirk. "I don’t exactly have a soft spot for elders."

Daniel’s face darkened.

Vivian mentally applauded.

If only Sophia had unleashed this side on that bastard Ethan Roscente sooner, she wouldn’t have suffered so much.

"Oh, Sophia! What a coincidence!"

An unwelcome voice cut in. Sophia turned to see Aunt Mei—her aunt’s friend who’d set her up with Daniel.

Sophia gave a curt nod and tried to steer Vivian away.

"Wait, dear!" Aunt Mei blocked their path. "I need to talk to you—"

Beep!

A black luxury car pulled up, blocking the restaurant entrance.

Sophia’s stomach dropped.

When Zachary Evans stepped out of the driver’s seat, her last shred of hope vanished.

She ducked her head, ready to bolt.

"Miss Lowell."

Zachary spotted her instantly.

The rear door swung open.

A pair of cold eyes locked onto her from the backseat.

Sophia’s breath hitched.

###Chapter 17

Twilight descended as city lights flickered to life.

Sophia Lowell gripped Vivian Ashcroft's wrist, about to leave when Daniel Clementson's obnoxious voice called out behind them.

"Mr. Roscente!"

He practically sprinted to Ethan Roscente's Maybach, his face plastered with sycophantic glee. Beside the black luxury car, the man adjusted his cufflinks with deliberate slowness. His tailored suit accentuated broad shoulders and a narrow waist, his silhouette striking against the dimming sky.

Sophia froze mid-step.

Ethan's gaze lifted and instantly locked onto her. A flicker of amusement passed through those depthless eyes as his lips curved slightly.

"And this is?"

Daniel moved forward, only to be blocked by Zachary Evans a yard away. Rubbing his hands, he simpered, "I'm Sophia's fiancé, Daniel Clementson of Clementson Group. I've been meaning to pay my respects."

Sophia's face drained of color.

She shot Daniel a warning glare, but he only leaned closer to Ethan. "By family ties, I should call you Uncle."

Ethan toyed with the ring on his finger, his eyes tracing Sophia's face.

"Fiancé?"

His low voice carried an icy edge. "I wasn't informed."

The ring glinted coldly under the lights. Sophia's breath hitched—was that his engagement ring with Isabella Valentine?

Her fists clenched, nails biting into her palms.

"With your busy schedule, it's no surprise you'd forget." She lifted her chin, her voice colder than the night breeze. "Didn't you send us a Marriage Pledge yourself?"

Daniel's eyes lit up. "So Uncle approves of us!" He gave Sophia a pointed look. "Why didn't you mention it?"

Her chest tightened.

She knew exactly what he was insinuating. Just this morning, she'd refused the Clementsons' marriage proposal with righteous indignation—only to accept the Roscentes' pledge hours later.

"Since we're all here—" Daniel rubbed his hands eagerly. "Why don't we—"

"Pass."

Ethan lit a cigarette, the ember glowing in the dark. He exhaled a smoke ring, his gaze skimming Sophia's tense profile.

"I have plans."

The words stabbed through her chest. Behind the haze, his piercing stare left her nowhere to hide.

Vivian felt her best friend's hand tremble.

Just then, a sweet voice shattered the tension.

"Ethan."
###Chapter 18

Sophia's heart lurched at the sound of that honeyed voice.

It felt hauntingly familiar.

Before she could recall where she'd heard it, Ethan Roscente was already striding forward, his tone uncharacteristically tender. "Isabella."

The woman stepping out of the car came into view.

Isabella Valentine wore a beige dress beneath a light trench coat, her swan-like neck glowing under the sunlight. She floated toward Ethan and casually linked her arm through his.

They stood together like a perfect matched set.

Sophia turned away, nails biting into her palms.

"And this is..." Isabella's gaze landed on Sophia, crimson lips curling. "Sophia Lowell?"

Ethan arched a brow. "You know each other?"

Isabella covered her mouth with a delicate laugh. "When I visited your father last time, he showed me your family portrait." Her eyes swept over Sophia with deliberate appraisal. "She was stunning in the photo, but even more breathtaking in person. If Mr. Roscente hadn't introduced her, I would've thought she was your girlfriend."

She turned to Ethan, lashes fluttering. "If I didn't know she was your niece, I might get jealous."

The amusement faded slightly from Ethan's lips. "Don't be ridiculous."

That indulgent tone made Sophia's chest constrict.

She kept her head down, eyelashes trembling violently.

Isabella's words were like a scalpel, slicing precisely into her most sensitive nerve.

The mysterious text message flashed through her mind.

"Sophia?" Vivian Ashcroft noticed her tension and whispered her name.

Sophia snapped back to reality, forcing a smile. "Excuse me." She grabbed Vivian's wrist and hurried away.

"Sophia!" Daniel Clementson called after her, frustration evident.

Isabella's attention shifted to him. "And you are?"

Daniel immediately brightened. "Daniel Clementson, Sophia's boyfriend. CEO of Clementson Enterprises. It's an honor to meet you, Ms. Valentine."

"Oh, we're practically family." Isabella extended a graceful hand. "Such a promising young executive. You and Sophia make a perfect pair."

She tilted her head toward Ethan. "Don't you think so, Ethan?"

The intimate nickname "Ethan" scraped against Sophia's ears. Her steps faltered, then quickened.

Ethan absently withdrew his arm, adjusting his cuff. "Perhaps."

Daniel beamed. "Marrying Sophia would be my greatest fortune. I promise I'll—"

A sudden chill cut through his words.

When he recovered, Ethan had already turned toward the restaurant. Daniel moved to follow, but Zachary Evans blocked his path.

Isabella admired her manicure, smirking. "Mr. Clementson, wouldn't marrying Sophia give you everything you want?"

With that loaded remark, she clicked away in her stilettos.
###Chapter 19

Daniel Clementson stood frozen in confusion.

Mrs. Clementson strode forward and slapped his back sharply. "Miss Valentine is right. Sophia is still technically a Roscente. If we secure this connection, the Clementsons will benefit tremendously."

Understanding dawned in Daniel's eyes. "You're absolutely right, Mother."

"Transfer ten million from the company account to Emily Laurent." Mrs. Clementson's lips curled into a cold smile. "The girl wants a dowry? She'll get it. Once she enters our family, I'll make sure she repays every cent with interest."

Sophia hurried away from the private dining club, only stopping when she turned the corner.

Vivian Ashcroft caught her arm worriedly. "Sophia, you look pale."

Sophia lowered her lashes to hide her emotions. "Vivian, what do you know about Isabella Valentine?"

"Isabella?" Vivian rolled her eyes. "A wannabe socialite who buys her way onto trending lists."

"How capable is she?"

"All money, no talent." Vivian scoffed. "She'd be nowhere without her tycoon father."

Sophia grew thoughtful. Isabella didn't seem to fit the mysterious figure's profile.

"Your father dotes on you too," Sophia changed the subject. "He just bought you that luxury penthouse."

Vivian pouted. "New money only knows how to throw real estate at problems. His illegitimate children keep flattering him - it's disgusting."

They entered a health-conscious hotpot restaurant.

"Damn Ethan Roscente!" Vivian stabbed the menu angrily. "Our reservation got ruined because of that jerk."

Sophia smiled reassuringly. "We'll go another time."

Later that night, Vivian dropped Sophia off at her apartment complex.

As Sophia collected her package and walked home, rustling came from nearby bushes.

The cold wind howled through the empty courtyard, her footsteps the only sound.

"Meow—"

A dark shadow pounced at her feet.

Sophia screamed, dropping the package.

It was just the neighborhood stray cat rubbing affectionately against her ankles.
###Chapter 20

Sophia crouched down and poked the fluffy head of the calico cat with her fingertip.

"Little troublemaker, following me in secret?" She widened her eyes in mock anger.

The cat tilted its head, amber eyes darting mischievously before suddenly pouncing toward her shopping bag with a loud "Meow!"

"Greedy thing!" Sophia laughed, tearing open a packet of cat treats.

The calico immediately raised its tail, pink tongue lapping eagerly as it happily devoured the snack.

After feeding the cat, Sophia hummed a tune on her way home. But the moment she inserted her key into the lock, her smile froze.

The light seeping through the door crack sent a chill down her spine.

She distinctly remembered turning it off before leaving.

Her fingers trembled as she pushed the door open. Rustling sounds came from the living room. Holding her breath, she reached for her phone to call the police.

"Had enough fun?"

A deep male voice startled her, sending her phone clattering to the floor.

Ethan Roscente stepped out of the shadows, his long fingers toying with a photo frame. Inside it, Sophia and Daniel Clementson smiled brightly—a sight that now felt painfully mocking.

"Breaking into someone's home is illegal," Sophia forced out, feigning composure.

He smirked coldly before the frame shattered in his palm.

"That programmer isn't worthy of you."

Shards of glass reflected a cold glint, mirroring the icy look in his eyes. Sophia instinctively stepped back, only to press against the unyielding wall.

"Stay away from him," Ethan gripped her chin, his voice low and dangerous. "Or I can't guarantee what I'll do."

The familiar scent of cedarwood wrapped around her, laced with unspoken threats. Her eyes burned, but she stubbornly lifted her chin.

"We're over."

"Over?" He chuckled darkly, his thumb brushing the reddened corner of her eye. "The moment you saved me that night, you should've known you could never escape."

Memories flooded back—the rainy night five years ago when she had inexplicably dragged a bloodied man into her home. Now, she realized that was when the nightmare truly began.

"Ethan, you're absolutely—"

"Deranged?" He finished for her before abruptly sweeping her into his arms. "Then behave."

As the bedroom door slammed open with a deafening crash, Sophia shut her eyes in despair.

She should've known—once you invite the devil in, there's no easy way out.
###Chapter 21

Sophia's chest tightened, her nails digging into her palms. The doctor had warned her to avoid emotional turmoil during pregnancy, so she forced herself to suppress the storm inside.

She lifted her gaze to meet Ethan Roscente's eyes. "The woman by your side tonight—that was Isabella Valentine, wasn't it?"

His expression remained indifferent. "You already know the answer."

"Yes, I do." She glanced at the intimate distance between them. "So what does that make me now? Your dirty little secret?"

Suddenly, she grabbed his hand. The silver ring on his finger gleamed coldly under the light. "Doesn't it disgust you to touch me while wearing this?"

Ethan pulled his hand back. "It's not a wedding ring."

Sophia froze. The plain band did look worn, nothing like an engagement piece. But if it wasn't a wedding ring, why did he never take it off?

She shoved him away and straightened her disheveled collar. "It's late. You should leave, Uncle."

She emphasized the last word.

Ethan let out a cold laugh. "You didn't seem to remember I was your uncle when you climbed into my bed."

"That's why I regret it."

Her reply was sharp.

His gaze turned piercing, as if trying to see through her facade. After a long pause, he scoffed. "You're ruthless, Sophia."

"Good. You finally understand."

"Fine." He suddenly relented, making her heart skip.

Amid the swirling smoke, his voice was lazy. "I was only after your body anyway. These past few days without you weren’t as unbearable as I thought."

Her fingers trembled, but she forced a cold smile. "I'm glad you've come to your senses."

From now on, they would go their separate ways.

She swallowed the inexplicable ache in her chest. "I'll avoid family gatherings at the estate."

"Good." He flicked his cigarette ash. "Since we're ending this, two million will be wired to your account tomorrow."

"Fine."

It would drain her savings, but it was better than prolonging this mess.

Ethan abruptly stubbed out his cigarette. "Quitting without notice looks bad. Return to the office tomorrow for the handover. These past days will be marked as unexcused absences."

"I already have a new job!"

"That kindergarten teacher gig?" He raised a mocking brow. "Better than serving tea?"

Her cheeks burned with anger. "At least I won't have to serve anyone!"

"Didn't I serve you enough?"

"..."

This bastard!

"Follow the proper resignation procedure." He gave her one last glance before turning away. "Wouldn’t want people saying I mistreated my niece."

The moment the door closed, Sophia's legs gave out, and she collapsed onto the sofa.
###Chapter 22

Sophia exhaled deeply.

Using the emergency exit during her hasty resignation had indeed violated protocol.

Ethan Roscente always valued efficiency and despised employees who disregarded rules.

"I understand," she murmured in response.

His dark gaze lingered on her face before he turned away. As the elevator doors closed, Sophia's legs gave out. She leaned against the cold wall, pressing a hand to her abdomen. A bitter smile touched her lips. "It's just us now, little one."

......

"Get out."

Ethan stood in the shadows below, his voice icy.

A scruffy orange tabby emerged from the bushes, tail wagging nervously.

"You were supposed to watch her, not scare her." His eyes narrowed. "One more mistake, and you'll join Calico."

"Meow~"

The cat trembled against the pavement.

His expression softened slightly. "Remember—any male who approaches her—" A long finger drew across his throat. "Claw them to death." A pause. "Extra treats for disfigurement."

The tabby rubbed against his polished shoes.

"Not me." Ethan kicked it away in disgust. "No males. Except me."

"Meow!"

Satisfied, he glanced up at the lit window before driving off.

......

Sophia tossed and turned.

Fragmented dreams haunted her—the bloodied boy from the rainy alley five years ago, and the man who walked away without looking back.

She'd first met Ethan during the summer after high school.

Deep in that alley, blood mixed with rainwater, forming crimson streams. When her mother reached for her phone, he'd gripped Sophia's wrist with surprising strength. Those blood-clouded eyes made her bring him home against all logic.

Blind and vulnerable, Ethan had been gentle. Two months of shared meals and quiet conversations made her young heart flutter. Until she returned from vacation and overheard him whispering sweet nothings to another woman.

Their reunion happened at the Roscente estate.

Only then did she learn the boy from the alley was the ruthless heir to a business empire. That "mugging" had been part of a power struggle—one where Ethan broke the wings of every surviving sibling.

The man who regained his sight bore no resemblance to her memories. Perhaps the gentle scholar had always been an act, designed to manipulate her family.

She wanted to ask if he remembered the girl who brewed his medicine.

But the indifference in his eyes answered clearly enough.
###Chapter 23

Sophia clenched her fists, her nails digging deep into her palms.

She refused to accept this. Refused to accept how Ethan Roscente had deceived her, how even her mother had been kept in the dark. All those false displays of concern, all that carefully crafted tenderness—every bit of it had been a lie.

That night, she should never have approached the drunken man.

Under the moonlight, his figure leaning against the car had been irresistibly alluring. Like a moth to a flame, she had walked toward him—and sealed her fate.

She had already planned to sell her mother’s house in Seattle to pay off her aunt’s twenty-million-dollar gambling debt. But that one reckless decision had changed everything.

To avoid showing weakness in front of him, she had lied, claiming she had only approached him to settle her debts.

That lie had snowballed into something far bigger.

For two years, she had wanted to ask him—just once—if he had ever felt even a flicker of affection for her. But every time she met those icy eyes, the words died in her throat.

The answer was obvious. All his tenderness belonged to the woman he had embraced so tightly that afternoon.

The look of raw emotion in Ethan’s eyes that day had become her recurring nightmare. The sleepless nights, the days when only medication could bring her rest—all of it was because of him.

It wasn’t until her mother took her to see a therapist that things began to improve.

But on the very night she cut ties with Ethan for good, that haunting gaze invaded her dreams again…

Sophia wiped away her tears, composed herself, and headed to Roscente Group.

Her colleagues in the executive office stared in surprise when she arrived. When they heard she was there to hand over her duties, their expressions turned knowing.

Before she could wonder why, the answer walked in.

Isabella Valentine, dressed in a white dress, entered arm-in-arm with Ethan.

"Hello, everyone. I’m Isabella Valentine, and from now on, I’ll be Mr. Roscente’s secretary," she announced with a sweet, practiced smile.

Sophia’s heart plummeted.

So that was why Ethan had agreed to her resignation so readily. He had already arranged for her replacement.

Why sneak around with her when he could openly flirt with his fiancée in the office? Thrilling, entertaining—why not?

The only thing she didn’t understand was why Isabella, a top-tier celebrity, would give up her career to become a secretary.

"Isabella is preparing for a role as a secretary in her next film. She’s here to shadow the job," Ethan explained coolly, his gaze sliding to Sophia. "Hand over your work to her."

"Understood, Mr. Roscente," Sophia replied, lowering her eyes.

"Miss Lowell, I appreciate your help," Isabella said in a sugary voice. "I’m a quick learner. I won’t delay your job search."

"You’re too kind, Miss Valentine," Sophia responded with a professional smile.

Ethan studied her face, searching for any trace of resentment or jealousy.

But she was as composed as if she were simply transferring a routine document.

The realization made his chest tighten.

"Isabella, you’re coming with me on a business trip," he ordered coldly.

"A trip on my first day?" Isabella pouted playfully. "My father was right—you really are a workaholic."

"No work, no money."

No money, no way to keep you…

As the elevator doors closed, Sophia silently finished the sentence in her mind.

So he was capable of sweet talk after all. It wasn’t that he didn’t know how to be tender—he just hadn’t wanted to be tender with her.

Some things aren’t about inability. They’re about unwillingness.

Some people aren’t incapable of love. They just don’t love you.
###Chapter 24

The nausea hit without warning.

Sophia gripped the bathroom sink, her reflection pale as paper in the mirror.

"Could you be pregnant?"

Isabella's voice dripped with implication behind her. She leaned against the doorframe, twirling that plain silver ring between her fingers, its surface catching the light.

Sophia splashed cold water on her face.

"You're overthinking, Ms. Valentine." She reached for a paper towel. "Just an upset stomach."

Isabella chuckled, spinning the ring again.

"Ethan told me he won this at an auction in Paris." She stepped closer suddenly. "Do you know why he chose this particular set?"

Sophia's fingers twitched.

"Because they have the most romantic name." Isabella's red lips nearly brushed her ear. "'Eternity.'"

The bathroom lights seemed to sharpen into needles.

Sophia clenched her fists, nails biting into her palms. The pain kept her grounded.

"Congratulations." Her own voice sounded distant.

Outside, female colleagues clustered around Isabella's social media feed.

"Mr. Roscente chartered a yacht! It's trending!"

"Oh my god, Ms. Valentine looks stunning in that gown!"

On the screen, Ethan stood impeccably suited while Isabella leaned against him in crimson silk. The yacht's lights haloed them like a fairy-tale ending.

Sophia turned toward the elevators, acid rising in her throat again.

"Ms. Lowell." Zachary stopped her. "Mr. Roscente's meeting just concluded."

The CEO's office door stood ajar.

Ethan stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, his profile sharp as a blade. Sunlight gilded him like some untouchable deity.

"...the wedding bands arrive next week?" His voice was low. "Use the measurements I provided."

Sophia froze in the doorway.

So when he'd said "not engagement rings," he meant "not yet."

Ethan turned and frowned at the sight of her. The caller was still speaking when he ended the call.

"Yes?"

She handed him a file. "The resignation handover checklist for your review."

His pen spun once between his fingers as he scanned it.

"Everything's in order?"

"Yes." Her tone stayed even. "Ms. Valentine can take over anytime."

He looked up abruptly, his gaze piercing.

"You look unwell."

Sophia instinctively stepped back. "Probably just tired."

Ethan set down the pen and moved toward her. His cedarwood scent enveloped her, stealing her breath.

"Ethan!" Isabella swept in carrying coffee. "I made this myself—"

She froze at seeing their proximity.

Ethan halted.

"Leave us." The order was for Sophia.

In the hallway, Isabella followed.

"Ms. Lowell." She waved her phone. "You must come to our engagement party next month."

The screen displayed a save-the-date design.

The very day Sophia's resignation took effect.

"Oh, and..." Isabella dropped her voice. "Since you've been vomiting so much, shall I recommend my gynecologist?"

Sophia's head snapped up.

Isabella's smile turned knowing. "Some... accidents are better handled early."
###Chapter 25

Sophia's heart clenched. She turned sharply, meeting Isabella Valentine's knowing gaze.

Her fingers trembled slightly as the anonymous text flashed through her mind.

Suppressing her racing pulse, she shook her head calmly. "Just stomach issues."

She reached into her bag, retrieving a pill bottle and swallowing one with practiced ease.

Thankfully, she'd had the foresight to swap her antacids for prenatal vitamins last night.

Isabella glanced at the label, concern flickering. "You should be resting. Let me inform Mr. Roscente—"

"Chronic condition." Sophia rattled the bottle. "From irregular meals in college. The pills help."

"You're so resilient." Isabella blinked. "I'd have called my boyfriend immediately. Daniel would be devastated seeing you like this."

Sophia's stomach churned.

That scum didn't deserve the title.

She checked her watch instead. "The project draft needs revisions."

As she turned, the diamond on Isabella's ring finger caught the light—harsh, blinding.

Back at her desk, she gulped half a glass of water to steady herself.

The rhythmic keyboard clicks gradually anchored her focus.

The lunch bell had barely sounded when commotion erupted at reception.

"Delivery for Ms. Lowell!"

A deliveryman stood grinning, holding a plastic bag. "Mr. Clementson sent drinks for you and your colleagues."

Sophia's pupils contracted.

How did Daniel know she worked at Roscente Group?

Stranger still—how had this courier bypassed security to reach the executive floor?

Her gaze dropped to the discount bubble tea, its "Buy One Get One" sticker glaring.

The office fell dead silent.

"Six-dollar drinks?" Lisa from Finance twirled a straw, smirking. "Your boyfriend's quite the economist, Sophia."

Maggie at the next workstation muttered, "Who serves sugar water in the executive suite?"

The deliveryman added cheerfully, "Mr. Clementson insisted on hot ones. Said it's gentler on your stomach."

Sophia studied the condensation beading on the cup. Then she laughed.

Daniel's performance was truly... meticulous.
###Chapter 26

"Six-dollar bubble tea? Is this even drinkable?" A colleague covered her mouth dramatically. "I wouldn't risk my health like this."

"Pathetic," another woman sneered. "How dare someone bring street vendor trash to the office? Sophia, is this your boyfriend's taste?"

"Birds of a feather, I suppose. She always wears those cheap online store clothes anyway."

"If my boyfriend sent me garbage like this, I'd dump him on the spot!"

Sophia clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms.

"Miss Lowell..." The delivery guy stood awkwardly. "What should I—"

"Oh, the tea's here!" Isabella Valentine emerged from the office with a saccharine smile. "Mr. Clementson works fast."

Sophia narrowed her eyes.

Isabella approached the delivery guy, feigning surprise. "So many cups! How thoughtful of Daniel to consider the whole office."

She turned to him with a gentle tone. "Just leave them in the break room."

"You... you're Isabella Valentine?" The delivery guy gaped.

Isabella pressed a finger to her lips and winked. "Keep it a secret, okay?"

After he left, she linked arms with Sophia. "Daniel treats you so well. I just mentioned your stomachache, and he ordered tea right away."

Sophia yanked her arm free.

"But this tea..." Isabella picked up a cup and wrinkled her nose. "The packaging looks so cheap. Some obscure brand?"

"Don't joke, Miss Valentine," someone chimed in. "This bargain-bin swill isn't even sold in supermarkets—only roadside stalls."

"Exactly. Who knows what toxic ingredients they used for six dollars a cup."

Isabella looked puzzled. "Daniel seems wealthy. Why would he—"

She suddenly covered her mouth, as if realizing her mistake. "Maybe the shop delivered the wrong order? You should ask him."

"Isabella." Sophia's voice was ice. "First, Daniel Clementson is not my boyfriend."

The office fell silent.

"Second, you have no right to make decisions for me." Each word was deliberate. "Third, this act of yours? Pathetic."

Isabella paled, her eyes instantly welling up. "I just... wanted to help..."

"Help?" Sophia scoffed. "You knew exactly what would happen if this tea arrived."

She strode to the break room, grabbed the bag of drinks, and hurled it into the trash.

The plastic cups clattered against the bin, the sound piercing the dead silence.
###Chapter 27

Sophia's words cut like a knife, mercilessly tearing through Isabella's facade.

If Vivian had been there, she would've slapped Isabella twice by now.

This woman was the epitome of a Green Tea Bitch—playing the innocent victim while scheming behind everyone's backs.

Right on cue, the performance began.

Isabella's eyes instantly welled up with tears, her voice trembling. "I was just worried about you... Why are you treating me like this?"

Her pitiful act immediately won over their coworkers.

"Sophia, you're going too far!"

"She was being kind, and this is how you repay her?"

"Ungrateful wretch..."

"Enough!"

Zachary's sharp command silenced the accusations.

Ethan Roscente emerged from his office, his expression stormy.

Isabella threw herself into his arms, tears streaming down her face. "Ethan, it's all my fault..."

He frowned at the crowd. "What's going on?"

Someone eagerly stepped forward to spin a twisted version of events.

Sophia opened her mouth to speak but swallowed her words when she met Ethan's icy glare.

"Who gave you permission to cause a scene in my company?" His voice was frigid.

Sophia's heart ached as if pierced by needles.

He wouldn't even let her explain.

The moment Isabella cried, he took her side without question.

How pathetic.

Sophia suppressed the turmoil inside and let out a cold laugh.

"Nothing to say?" Ethan's gaze turned even colder.

"Nothing."

"Good." His lips curled into a humorless smile. "Five-thousand-word self-criticism. Due by this afternoon. And your salary for this month is forfeited."

Only two hours remained before the afternoon shift.

Sophia clenched her fists. "Understood."

"One more thing." He glanced at the spilled milk tea with disgust. "Clean this up."

"...Understood."

Ethan turned to Zachary. "Make sure she does it."

Without another word, he walked away with Isabella still clinging to him.

The coworkers shot Sophia contemptuous looks.

Biting her lip, she returned to her desk, her face as pale as paper.
###Chapter 28

Zachary Evans glanced at his watch, his voice as stiff as a judge delivering a verdict. "Ms. Lowell, you have one hour and forty minutes left."

Sophia Lowell didn’t even lift her eyes. She opened her laptop, the rapid clicks of the keyboard sharp and urgent.

Zachary awkwardly rubbed the bridge of his nose and retreated to a corner.

At 5:55 PM, Sophia hit the final keystroke. The 5,000-word self-criticism landed in Ethan Roscente’s inbox right on time.

Her stomach twisted violently. She covered her mouth, suppressing two dry heaves. Whether it was hunger or morning sickness, she couldn’t tell. With trembling hands, she fished out a pill and swallowed it with water.

"Ms. Lowell, you should eat something."

Zachary had reappeared, setting down a steaming bento box.

Sophia ignored it, pulling out the stale bread left over from breakfast. Crumbs scattered as she chewed mechanically, each swallow like shards of glass.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Vivian Ashcroft popped up, but before she could reply, Isabella Valentine’s social media post forced its way into her view.

"Comfort from Mr. Roscente ❤️"

A grid of nine photos showed roses in full bloom, crystal chandeliers casting fractured light over champagne flutes.

Sophia stared at the screen, her breath growing ragged. An invisible hand seemed to squeeze her heart, the pain bending her double.

"Ms. Lowell?"

Jessica Piente’s concerned face loomed into focus. Only then did Sophia realize she had crushed the bread into dust.

"I’m fine," she forced a smile. "Just a stomachache."

Jessica frowned. "You’re pale as a ghost."

"Old problem." Sophia tightened the cap on her water bottle. "The medicine will help."

"The department’s throwing a welcome party for Ms. Valentine tonight. Will you come?"

"I have plans with a friend." Sophia hesitated. "Actually, can I submit the handover materials directly to you?"

Jessica shook her head. "Mr. Roscente gave specific instructions."

Sophia bit her lip. She’d rather face wild beasts than step into that office again.

Zachary’s bento still sat on the desk, its aroma taunting her. She grabbed it and slammed it into the trash.

Even his pity made her sick.

In the CEO’s office, Ethan Roscente flipped through the handover file before casually passing it to Isabella.

"I’d like to see this project through." Sophia held out the proposal, her fingertips trembling. "It just needs final approval."

This had been her three-month labor of love, originally her ticket to a permanent position. Though everything had changed, she still wanted to be the one to close the chapter.
###Chapter 29

Isabella Valentine bit her lower lip, her eyes reddening. "Sophia, why can you hand over all other projects except this key one?" Her voice trembled. "Are you afraid I'll outshine you?"

Sophia Lowell's fingers paused mid-motion. "The project is complex. I'm concerned you might struggle."

"But you were a rookie once too," Isabella's tears fell freely. "Or... do you think I'm not as capable as you?"

Sophia's temple throbbed.

This white lotus was really committed to her act.

Just as she opened her mouth to respond, Ethan Roscente's icy voice cut in. "Isabella will take over the project. You'll assist her."

"What if something goes wrong—"

"Then it's your failure."

Sophia's head snapped up.

"You left without hesitation before, yet now you cling to it." Ethan's gaze was mocking. "Don't you find that ridiculous, Sophia?"

Her heart clenched violently.

Had his favoritism blinded him to the company's interests?

Ethan handed the documents to Isabella. "Ask if you have any questions."

"Thank you, Ethan~" Isabella's voice dripped with sweetness, her eyes flirting shamelessly.

Sophia's stomach churned.

"I'll excuse myself."

"Wait." Ethan stopped her. "You're responsible for looking after Isabella at tonight's welcome party."

"I have plans—"

"A date, perhaps?" Isabella sighed dreamily. "How romantic."

Ethan's expression darkened. "Mandatory attendance. Unless..." He narrowed his eyes. "Do resigning employees get special privileges?"

Sophia's nails dug into her palms.

He was forcing her to be Isabella's drinking shield.

He knew alcohol made her ill.

"...Understood."

The moment the office door closed, Sophia leaned against the wall, breathing deeply.

He was still angry.

Ever since she ended things, this torment was inevitable.

Just a little longer.
###Chapter 30

Four days until resignation.

Sophia Lowell traced the red circle on her calendar with her fingertip. It was finally coming to an end. She exhaled slowly.

Her phone buzzed with a message from Vivian Ashcroft. Sophia replied briefly, politely declining the dinner invitation.

As expected, Vivian immediately sent an eight-hundred-word rant, every sentence dripping with venom for Ethan Roscente. Sophia's lips curved upward as angry emojis flooded her screen.

The office emptied early as colleagues hurried to the gathering. Sophia stayed behind to organize the final documents, asking Jessica Piente to keep an eye on Isabella Valentine.

When she pushed open the private room door, Sophia immediately spotted Isabella, cheeks flushed, reclining on the sofa with half a glass of red wine still in her hand.

"I couldn't stop her," Jessica apologized. "I just stepped out to the restroom, and when I came back, she was like this."

Sophia pressed her lips together. Isabella was the future Mrs. Roscente—who would dare interfere?

"Sophia!"

Isabella suddenly lifted her head, eyes hazy with intoxication, and beckoned. "I'm dizzy. Could you walk me out? My assistant is waiting."

Sophia considered suggesting the assistant come inside instead, but Isabella cut her off: "Won't you even do this small favor for me? Ethan specifically asked you to look after me."

Under everyone's gaze, Sophia had no choice but to step forward and support her. Isabella leaned into her shoulder with a sweet smile. "Thank you."

Under the hallway lights, Isabella abruptly straightened, all traces of drunkenness gone.

"You're in love with Ethan." It wasn't a question.

Sophia released her arm, maintaining a professional smile. "You've had too much to drink, Ms. Valentine."

"Stop pretending." Isabella's laugh was cold. "The way you look at him—it's obvious."

Sophia's fingers trembled slightly, but her smile didn't waver. "Someone like Mr. Roscente is far beyond my reach."

"Good. Remember your place." Isabella stepped closer, eyes sharp. "Ethan is mine. Always will be."

Sophia narrowed her eyes. In that moment, she was certain—Isabella wasn't the one who had sent those threatening messages.

"You think that face of yours can seduce a Roscente man?" Isabella circled her, voice dripping with disdain. "Do you really think Mr. Roscente Sr. would let history repeat itself? Just like what happened with your aunt."

Sophia's breath hitched. Her aunt Emily's story was her deepest wound.

"I heard your aunt stripped naked and climbed into old Mr. Roscente's fourth son's bed." Isabella smirked maliciously. "Is that how all you Lowell women operate? Your mother probably—"

A sharp slap echoed through the hallway.

Sophia stared at her stinging palm, momentarily dazed.

"Sophia!"

Ethan Roscente's icy voice cut through the air behind her.
###Chapter 31

Sophia's hand remained suspended in midair, her fingertips trembling slightly.

The sound of leather shoes striking pavement echoed behind her, each step like a hammer to her heart.

She turned slowly. Ethan Roscente stood a short distance away, his features obscured by neon lights, unreadable.

"Ethan..." Her throat tightened.

Isabella Valentine had already thrown herself into his arms, tears streaming down her face.

"Ethan, it hurts..." She tilted her head, revealing a swollen cheek.

The air around Ethan turned glacial, his gaze slicing across Sophia's face like a blade.

"Explain." His voice was ice.

Sophia clenched her fists. "She insulted my mother."

"I didn't!" Isabella sobbed harder. "I only mentioned her boyfriend—"

"Enough." Ethan cut her off, his eyes locked on Sophia. "Apologize."

Sophia's chest heaved.

She should have known—in this man's eyes, Isabella was always right.

"What if I refuse?" She lifted her chin.

Ethan's expression darkened. "Your aunt's check-up next week..."

Sophia's pupils constricted.

She stared at him in disbelief, her heart tearing open.

"Sorry." The word was wrenched from between her teeth.

Isabella, still sheltered in Ethan's embrace, flashed her a triumphant smile.

Sophia spun on her heel and walked away, the night wind stinging her face.

"Ms. Lowell!" Zachary Evans caught up to her. "Mr. Roscente asked me to—"

"Get lost!" She shoved him aside and plunged into traffic.

The screech of brakes pierced the street.

By the time Zachary regained his bearings, her slender figure had vanished into the darkness.

He hastily dialed a number. "Mr. Roscente, Ms. Lowell, she—"

Silence stretched for several seconds on the other end.

"Understood."

The call ended. Ethan glanced down at Isabella. "The driver is waiting downstairs."

"Aren't you taking me home?" She clutched his sleeve.

Ethan pulled his arm free, his gaze inscrutable. "I have business to attend to."
###Chapter 32

Ethan Roscente glanced at his wristwatch. The silver dial gleamed coldly under the lights.

"I have a dinner meeting." His tone was indifferent. "My assistant will take you home."

Isabella Valentine bit her lip, suppressing her frustration before nodding obediently.

"Ethan."

Just as she turned to leave, his voice stopped her.

Her eyes brightened as she spun around.

Ethan lit a cigarette, his expression obscured by the swirling smoke.

"Be careful on your way."

Her hope deflated. Clutching her bag strap, she strode toward the elevator without looking back.

Before the doors closed, she caught sight of him making a call—his attention never once drifting her way.

"Take me to Nightshade," she snapped at the assistant.

The assistant froze. Nightshade was the most exclusive nightclub in the city—where Isabella kept a few male escorts on retainer.

Sophia Lowell arrived at the office early.

She ignored the faint red marks peeking from beneath Isabella's silk scarf, focusing instead on organizing the handover files.

"See something interesting, Sophia?" Isabella suddenly tugged the scarf aside, revealing more marks.

Sophia didn’t look up. "Focus on your work, Ms. Valentine."

"Shouldn’t that be your line?" Isabella smirked. "You’re the one staring at my neck."

A file snapped shut with force.

"Every minute you waste is another minute I have to stay." Sophia met her gaze. "Shall we wrap this up?"

Isabella’s smile faltered before she finally fell silent.

As the workday neared its end, Sophia’s phone buzzed.

"Babe, plans tonight?" Vivian Ashcroft’s voice was bright with excitement.

Sophia glanced at Isabella, still dawdling, and stepped toward the window.

"Send me the address."

"Promise you won’t bail this time!" Vivian chirped. "Just landed a huge deal—dinner’s on me."

Sophia chuckled. "Guess I’ll cling to my sugar mama, then."

When the address came through, she nearly dropped her phone.

"Nightshade?" she hissed. "Are you insane?"

"The escorts there are top-tier!" Vivian scoffed. "Pregnant women deserve fun too, you know!"

Sophia deleted the message immediately.

"Watch your wording!" she typed furiously. "I’m at the office!"

"Fine, fine~ I’ll use code names next time~" Vivian replied with a devil emoji.

Sophia erased the chat history and looked up—straight into Isabella’s probing stare.
###Chapter 33

Vivian Ashcroft's red sports car pulled up outside the office building, drawing curious glances from colleagues.

Sophia Lowell had barely opened the passenger door when Vivian let out a loud whistle. "Hop in, babe!"

"I could've driven myself," Sophia said, buckling her seatbelt as her fingers brushed against the leather upholstery.

Vivian slammed the accelerator, the engine roaring to life. "No way. Those bitches who messed with you need to know who's got your back."

Sophia chuckled. "Thank you for your generosity, my benefactor."

Vivian suddenly reached over and tilted Sophia's chin up, her gaze suggestive. "Words aren't enough. Impress me tonight, and I'll reward you handsomely."

"As you wish, my queen." Sophia playfully batted her lashes.

Neon lights flickered at the entrance of the club. Sophia hesitated, slowing her steps.

"Scared?" Vivian arched a brow.

Sophia bit her lip. "I don’t usually go to places like this."

"Exactly why you need to broaden your horizons." Vivian slung an arm around her shoulders. "Tonight, we’re being bad. And as for that bastard Ethan Roscente? Screw him."

Sophia suddenly asked, "Do all men like this kind of thing?"

"Just for fun." Vivian scoffed. "But they still want a saint waiting at home. Hypocrites, aren’t they?"

Sophia glanced down at her flat stomach.

"Enjoy yourself while you can," Vivian lowered her voice. "Once you're showing, there’s no more wild nights."

In the dressing room, Sophia stared at the sheer black mini dress, her fingers trembling slightly.

"Relax, I checked—a little dancing won’t hurt." Vivian had already changed with practiced ease.

As the makeup brush glided over her face, Sophia watched her reflection transform. Smoky winged liner, bold red lips—her usual cool elegance replaced by striking allure.

Her entrance into the dance floor was like a stone dropped into water. Men’s gazes turned predatory, their advances relentless.

Up in the VIP section, Felix Roland held up his phone, zooming in on the dazzling figure below.

"Ethan, guess who I just spotted?" he said into the phone.

At the Roscente family dinner, Ethan half-listened as the elders debated wedding dates. Isabella Valentine dutifully served dishes, her smile sweet.

"Your mom again?" Ethan replied absently.

"Your mom!" Felix nearly dropped his phone.

Ethan paused. "Send her my regards."

Felix rolled his eyes. The bastard knew damn well his mother was long gone.

On the dance floor, Sophia swayed to the music. She didn’t notice the amused gaze from above—or that her every move was being watched through a phone screen by another man.
###Chapter 34

Ethan Roscente's fingers tightened around his phone as Felix Roland's teasing voice came through.

"Just spotted your little wife."

A deliberate pause.

"Dressed to kill, shaking it on the dance floor like she owns the place."

Ethan's knuckles turned white.

"Need me to gouge your eyes out?"

Felix's laugh grated on his nerves.

"Won't change the fact every man in there's staring. Better hurry unless you want a new brother-in-law tonight."

Ice formed in Ethan's gaze.

Felix wisely rattled off an address before hanging up.

Chairs scraped as Ethan stood abruptly.

"Felix's mother found him another stepfather," he deadpanned.

Mr. Roscente Sr. bristled.

"You're leaving over this? We're discussing your engagement!"

"At a nightclub," Ethan clarified.

The old man's expression shifted instantly.

"Go! Before that Roland fool causes another scandal."

Isabella Valentine reached out with a gentle touch.

"Let me come with you, Ethan."

His dismissive glance cut deep.

"Not your scene."

"Quite right," the patriarch agreed.

Isabella's smile faltered only briefly before resuming its practiced grace.

Sophia Lowell emerged from the dancing crowd, forehead glistening.

In the VIP booth, male escorts swarmed Vivian Ashcroft like bees to honey.

A million dollars vanished in fifteen minutes.

Sophia sipped milk in the corner.

This place devoured money faster than water down a drain.

While Vivian drank freely, pregnancy restricted Sophia to dairy.

She excused herself for air.

Leaning against the railing, she watched the crowd below.

"Sophia?"

Her body locked at the familiar voice.

Daniel Clementson's smarmy grin made her stomach turn.

Terrible luck.

She turned to leave but he blocked her path.

"Running away?" His voice oozed false charm.

"Move."

She sidestepped only to be blocked again.
###Chapter 35

Daniel Clementson finally cornered Sophia Lowell.

For days, he'd schemed to get close to her, only to be dodged at every turn. Ignored calls. Blocked messages. Not even staking out her office building had worked.

Then Isabella Valentine texted him—Sophia wasn't feeling well. He immediately ordered the most expensive bubble tea delivery, never expecting it to be accepted.

So she was playing hard to get.

Now, under the hallway lights, Sophia stood breathtaking in a crimson dress. Daniel swallowed hard, then curled his lip in disgust. Dressed like that? Shameless.

But his mother's plans demanded cooperation. He forced a smile.

"Accepting my gifts but avoiding me?" He seized her wrist. "Marry me. The dowry—ten million—transfers immediately."

Sophia wrenched free. "Isabella took that delivery. She's been singing your praises nonstop."

Daniel's eyes lit up. "She said that?"

"The whole office heard." Sophia's laugh was ice. "Go find your soulmate."

"An actress could never join the Clementsons." He sneered, gaze crawling over her collarbone. "You're the only worthy candidate."

Nausea rose in her throat.

The audacity of this mediocre narcissist.

"Harass me again, and I'm calling the police." She reached for her phone.

Daniel's expression darkened. He snatched it away. "You refuse the easy way?" Dragging her toward a private room, he hissed, "You're not leaving tonight."

Her stiletto caught. Stumbling, she felt his liquor-tainted breath at her ear. "Drop the act."

"Let go!" Her knee jerked up.

With a grunt, he released her, eyes venomous. "You'll regret this." His hand swung back—

"Enough."

A glacial male voice cut through the air.
###Chapter 36

Sophia gasped as Daniel Clementson's iron grip clamped around her wrist.

She instinctively cradled her abdomen, afraid to struggle too violently.

"Help!"

The hallway stood deserted, not even a server in sight. Daniel dragged her toward the private room, his calloused palm smothering her cries.

"Stop playing hard to get."

Her back slammed against the couch. She kicked out, but he easily pinned her down.

"Eth—"

Her pupils contracted at the tall silhouette in the doorway.

Daniel's collar was suddenly yanked backward. He crashed into the coffee table, sending glass shattering across the floor.

Amid the chaos, Ethan Roscente's fists rained down relentlessly.

Sophia curled into the corner, watching Daniel beg for mercy, his face bloodied. Ethan's suit sleeves were stained crimson, his knuckles bone-white.

The metallic tang of blood hung thick in the air.

"Ethan..." Her voice trembled.

When he turned, the violence in his gaze froze her in place. He loosened his tie, staring down at her with icy disdain.

"Desperate for attention?"

His cold fingers dug into her chin. The heavy scent of tobacco and faint ambergris enveloped her.

"It's not what you think—"

A humorless laugh cut her off. He wrenched her wrist against the couch, the silk of her dress tearing as he leaned in. His breath scorched her neck.

"Am I not good enough?"

Her struggles were useless against his strength. His teeth grazed her earlobe, voice rough. "You'd chase other men while carrying my child?"

The door burst open.

"Mr. Roscente, the surveillance shows—" Zachary's report died mid-sentence.

"Out." Ethan didn't glance back.

Sophia seized the moment to shove him away, clutching her torn collar as she bolted. His hand snagged her ankle, yanking her against his chest.

"Running?" His grip on her waist tightened, dark hunger swirling in his eyes. "I thought you liked playing with fire."
###Chapter 37

Sophia gasped as Ethan's calloused fingers dug into her wrist like iron shackles. She instinctively cradled her abdomen, the sharp pain radiating up her arm.

"Ethan Roscente!" Her voice trembled.

Dark fury swirled in his eyes as he pinned her against the wall. His warm breath scorched her ear. "Now you're scared?"

A cold sweat trickled down Sophia's spine.

His fingertips traced the frantic pulse at her throat, then he chuckled darkly. "You had plenty to say back in the private room."

Vivian staggered into view just as Ethan yanked Sophia against his chest. The drunken actress hefted a champagne bottle and swung at his skull.

"You bastard!"

Without turning, Ethan caught her wrist mid-air. Glass shattered across the marble floor in a glittering explosion.

"Vivian!" Sophia cried out.

Ethan's gaze turned predatory. "Your friend cares so much." His thumb stroked Sophia's collarbone. "Should we let her watch how I—"

"Shut up!" Sophia clamped a hand over his mouth.

Vivian hiccuped, then burst into drunken laughter. "Sophia, look! His ears are red! This asshole's actually blushing!"

Ethan's expression darkened to storm clouds.

Sophia twisted free, only to be hauled over his shoulder like a sack of grain. He strode toward the private elevator, voice glacial. "Tonight, I'll show you what a real bastard looks like."

"Put me down!" Her kicks faltered when she met his bloodshot glare.

As the elevator doors slid shut, Vivian's shrieks echoed through the lobby. "Ethan Roscente! I'll hire a hitman by morning!"

Inside the mirrored enclosure, Ethan slammed Sophia against the cold surface. Her back met icy reflection while his scorching body trapped her.

"A hitman?" He nipped her earlobe. "Worry about yourself first."

Sophia trembled violently until the ding of arrival pierced the tension.

When the penthouse suite door crashed open, her tears finally broke free. "Ethan... I'm pregnant."

Every muscle in his body locked.
###Chapter 38

Sophia struggled violently in Ethan's arms, her nails leaving red marks on his forearms.

"Let me go!"

Her voice trembled as her back pressed against the cold elevator wall.

Ethan pinned both her wrists with one hand and pressed the penthouse button with the other.

"Scared now?"

He leaned close, his breath hot against her ear. "You were quite the flirt earlier."

As the elevator doors closed, Sophia caught sight of Vivian slumped drunkenly over the bar.

"Vivian's still there—"

Her eyes reddened, voice thick with tears.

Ethan smirked. "Felix will handle it."

The elevator ascended, the confined space filled only with their ragged breathing.

Sophia went still.

She knew this man too well.

Resistance only made him more relentless.

"Ethan."

She tilted her face up, her voice feather-soft. "We ended this long ago."

His eyes darkened. He slammed her against the mirrored wall.

"Ended?"

His fingers traced her collarbone. "Who gave you permission?"

——

In the underground parking lot, Daniel barely stood before Felix kicked him down again.

"E-Ethan's woman?"

Snot and tears streaked his terrified face.

Vivian staggered over, smashing a bottle over his head.

"You bastard! How dare you touch my Sophia!"

The sound of shattering glass echoed through the garage.

——

In the backseat of the black Maybach, Sophia scrambled toward the opposite door the moment Ethan threw her inside.

He yanked her back by the ankle.

"Running?"

His grip on her chin turned vicious. "Weren't you eager to seduce men earlier?"

Sophia winced but glared defiantly.

"Who I'm with is none of your business."

A sharp pain exploded in her shoulder.

Ethan had bitten her.

She arched off the seat, fingers clawing the leather.

When he pulled back, his gaze burned into the reddened teeth marks.

"Say that again."

His hand slid under her shirt, voice dangerous.

Sophia shuddered—then suddenly clutched her stomach.

"I... I'm pregnant."

The air turned to ice.

Ethan froze. A storm raged in his eyes.

"Whose?"

The word tore from his clenched teeth.

Sophia turned her face away.

"Not yours."

He slammed her onto the seat.

Ripping open her collar, he hissed,

"Then get rid of it."
###Chapter 39

The night was ink-black. Ethan Roscente lifted her chin with slender fingers, his dark eyes unreadable. "Bayview Residences?"

Sophia Lowell turned her face away from his touch, her voice icy. "Take me home."

His Adam's apple bobbed as he chuckled low. "Fine. A change of scenery could be... interesting."

The air in the car grew thick. Sophia clenched her skirt, her mind racing as neon lights flashed outside the window.

Fragments of self-defense training flickered through her thoughts. Ethan had offered to teach her once, but she'd refused, calling it exhausting. The irony wasn't lost on her now.

"Thinking of running?" His grip tightened around her wrist, sharp enough to hurt.

She bit her lip, silent.

"Still so untamed," he mocked, thumb tracing the reddening skin.

Sophia seethed internally. This man is insane.

"Calling me names again?" Ethan suddenly leaned in, breath hot against her ear. "Your eyes betray you, Sophia."

The car jerked to a stop outside her apartment. Zachary Evans opened the door with practiced deference.

Ethan scooped her up effortlessly. Sophia struggled, but his arms only tightened.

"You really think you can escape now?" Danger laced his words.

A bitter laugh escaped her. "When have I ever had a way out with you?"

"Clever girl."

The elevator numbers climbed. The moment they crossed the threshold, he tossed her onto the couch. The sound of tearing fabric sliced through the silence.

"Never wear this outside again." His fingers dug into her waist, eyes stormy. "If you do, it'll be for my eyes only."

The absurdity almost made her laugh. This man didn't love her—yet he demanded ownership.

Typical Ethan Roscente. What he couldn't have, no one else could touch.

"One last time." She met his gaze squarely. "Then we're done."

He paused, then smiled—slow, knowing. "That depends on your performance, Ms. Lowell."

The shower ran. A dull ache pulsed in Sophia's abdomen, her face pale.

But Ethan, insatiable, pressed wet kisses along her neck.

"I'm tired," she protested, turning away.

He ignored her, hands roaming lower. Just as despair gripped her, a shrill ringtone shattered the moment.

###Chapter 40 

The phone rang persistently, piercing the silence of the bedroom.

Ethan Roscente grabbed his phone irritably, but his expression changed the moment he saw the caller ID.

He abruptly pushed Sophia Lowell away and strode toward the balcony with the phone.

Sophia collapsed onto the tangled sheets, her chest heaving. She glanced at the wall clock—3:30 AM.

Who else could make him this tense at this hour except Isabella Valentine?

A wave of nausea hit her. She staggered into the bathroom, retching over the toilet.

Cold tap water splashed her face. The woman in the mirror looked deathly pale.

How ironic. The man who had been entangled with her moments ago could leave for another woman in an instant.

Clutching her aching abdomen, she stepped out of the bathroom to meet Ethan's scrutinizing gaze.

"Sophia." His voice was low. "You're not pregnant, are you?"

Her nails dug into the doorframe.

"Don't be ridiculous." She scoffed. "Do you really think that's possible?"

Ethan narrowed his eyes. "True. I'd never give you the chance to carry my child."

Her heart felt like it had been sliced by a dull blade. She straightened her spine. "You saw the pregnancy test last time. It's just stomach problems. Save your fake concern."

"Good."

He buttoned his shirt with cold efficiency, tying his Windsor knot with practiced elegance. "I'll have someone send you medicine."

Sophia burrowed under the covers, turning her back to him.

Suddenly, his warm lips brushed against her protruding shoulder blade. "I'll be back."

She whirled around, eyes blazing. "You said this was a one-time thing!"

His thumb traced her swollen lips. "But your performance... left much to be desired."

"Ethan!"

A sharp pain shot through her abdomen. Tears welled up.

He was already dressed and walking out, slamming the door behind him.

The pain made Sophia curl into a ball. By the time her trembling fingers dialed emergency services, her pajamas were drenched in sweat.

In the ER, an elderly doctor frowned at the test results.

"No intercourse during early pregnancy—don't you know basic常识?" His pen tapped sharply on the clipboard. "You're gambling with your child's life!"

Sophia bit her lip hard.

"Now you cry?" The doctor removed his glasses. "Where's the father? We need his signature for this."

"He... won't come." Her voice was feather-light.

The doctor sighed and signed the admission form. "Young people these days..."

When the nurse brought the wheelchair, Sophia finally broke down. She cradled her abdomen protectively, as if shielding the unwanted life inside.
###Chapter 41

The sharp scent of antiseptic made Sophia's temples throb. The cold IV fluid dripped into her veins, finally easing the cramps in her abdomen.

She pulled out her phone, her finger hovering over Vivian's contact before finally pressing call.

"Hello?" Vivian's groggy voice came through the line.

"Viv..." Sophia's voice caught, her throat tight. "I'm at the hospital."

A loud thud sounded on the other end, followed by Vivian's sharp tone. "What happened? I'm on my way!"

Forty minutes later, the hospital door slammed open. Vivian rushed in, her hair disheveled, her down jacket half-zipped. Her eyes reddened at the sight of Sophia's pale face.

"That bastard Ethan!" She stomped her foot, teeth clenched. "Only cares about his own pleasure, leaving you like this! I swear I'll—"

"Murder is illegal," Sophia weakly reminded her.

Vivian choked back her words, then growled, "Then I'll make sure he never has kids!"

"Not a bad idea," Sophia forced a faint smile.

"You're still joking?" Vivian poked her forehead in frustration. "The doctor said you almost had a miscarriage! Do you even realize?"

Sophia lowered her gaze. "Crying won't change anything. Life goes on."

"You..." Vivian sighed deeply, tucking the blanket around her.

With someone by her side, Sophia's tense nerves finally relaxed, and she soon fell into a deep sleep.

When she woke again, sunlight streamed through the window. Sophia glanced at the clock—7:30 AM—and threw off the covers.

"What are you doing?" Vivian barged in with breakfast, pushing her back down. "The doctor said bed rest! Unless..." She lowered her voice. "You really don’t want this baby?"

"But work—"

"I called in for you!" Vivian rolled her eyes. "Told them it's gastritis. You're quitting in two days anyway—no need to play model employee."

Sophia thought for a moment, then lay back down.

"Bed 28, time for your check-up."

The nurse wheeled in a cart just as Vivian left. When no one returned, Sophia grabbed her forms and shuffled slowly into the hallway.

The examination room was at the far end of the ward. Leaning against the wall, Sophia overheard two nurses whispering.

"That woman in Bed 3 looks so familiar..."

"You don’t recognize Isabella Valentine? The hottest star right now! And that’s her fiancé next to her—Ethan Roscente, the heir to the Roscente Group!"

Sophia froze.

"Oh my God! That’s Ethan Roscente? He’s even hotter in person than in the business magazines! No wonder every socialite in the city is after him."

"Don’t even dream. He’s so devoted to Isabella—he stayed with her through the whole exam, even draped her coat over her shoulders himself..."

Their voices faded, but Sophia’s nails dug into her palms. Trembling, she opened WeChat.

Isabella’s morning post glared back at her—a photo of an IV drip with the caption "So nice to have someone by my side."

In the corner, a man’s suit sleeve was visible, the cufflinks unmistakably the ones Sophia had gifted Ethan last year.
###Chapter 42

The minty scent of medicinal ointment invaded Sophia's nostrils, making her fingers twitch violently.

She knew this specialized balm all too well. Three years ago, Ethan Roscente would apply it to her bruises every time he lost control.

Her nails dug deep into her palms.

So after leaving her last night, he had gone to Isabella Valentine. All the pent-up desire he hadn't unleashed on her had been taken out on another woman.

"Watch out!"

Stumbling backward, she knocked over an IV stand. The metallic clatter alerted the figures at the end of the hallway.

Ethan was murmuring something to Isabella, who clung to his sleeve with a blissful expression despite her awkward gait.

Sophia spun around.

The world tilted violently. A sharp pain lanced through her abdomen, sending her collapsing forward like a broken marionette.

"Catch her!"

The expected impact never came. She fell into arms that smelled of antiseptic.

In her fading consciousness, she saw Ethan watching coldly, phone still pressed to his ear. His indifferent gaze might as well have been directed at a stranger.

"Mr. Roscente?" Zachary Evans detected the odd pause on the line.

Ethan stared toward the ER. The sight of that slumped figure being carried away inexplicably reminded him of Sophia doubling over in nausea.

"Send the family physician to the apartment," he said abruptly.

Zachary hesitated. "But Miss Valentine already—"

"Sophia." Ethan cut him off. "Tell them it's for a stomach exam."

Sophia jolted awake when the IV bag was still one-third full.

"The baby!" She grabbed Vivian Ashcroft's wrist.

"Easy there!" Vivian steadied her bandaged hand. "Your little bean's fine, but if you keep this up—"

Sophia studied the bruise around her needle mark.

Physical wounds had never been the real agony.

A hollow laugh escaped her. "Perfect. I'll just drink medicine like meals from now on."
###Chapter 43

"How can you still smile?" Vivian Ashcroft's eyes were red-rimmed, her fingers trembling. "I just went to get food, and when I came back, you were in the emergency room. You nearly scared me to death!"

Sophia Lowell weakly curled her lips and gently squeezed Vivian's palm.

Vivian suddenly gripped her hand tighter, her nails digging in. "Sophia, if anything happened to you, I'd tear that bastard who got you pregnant into pieces!"

Sophia knew her best friend was terrified.

She reached up and ruffled Vivian's short hair. "Silly girl, we're both going to live to ninety-nine."

Vivian sniffled.

If she weren't straight, she would've married Sophia long ago. How could someone so wonderful be treated so horribly by that scumbag Ethan Roscente?

"Here, have an orange." Vivian peeled it and handed it over, then suddenly lowered her voice mysteriously. "I got the number of that handsome guy who saved you. Want to thank him properly?"

She waggled her eyebrows. "The refined, gentlemanly type—perfect for you."

Sophia took the orange and nearly choked. "What are you thinking? A simple thank you is enough."

"What a waste!" Vivian dramatically clutched her chest. "That demeanor, that eloquence—he’s clearly the kind who’d treat you right."

Sophia couldn’t help but laugh. "If you like him so much, keep him for yourself."

"Only because you're my best friend..." Vivian suddenly turned serious. "By the way, the doctor said you had a shock. What did you see?"

Sophia's fingers twitched.

Images from before she lost consciousness flashed through her mind. She forced a smile. "Nothing. Just some unpleasant memories."

Vivian looked skeptical but suddenly brightened. "Let me cheer you up!"

"That bastard Daniel Clementson got what he deserved!"

Sophia's head snapped up.

Vivian waved her hands excitedly. "He was kidnapped last night and found this morning in an abandoned warehouse. Tsk tsk..." She made an exaggerated face. "It was brutal."

"Really?" Sophia clenched the bedsheet.

"Absolutely!" Vivian pulled out her phone. "It's all over the news. Apparently..." She dropped her voice. "He was castrated and drugged. Now he's completely out of his mind."

She leaned in. "Do you think... Ethan did this for you?"

Sophia's lashes fluttered.

Remembering Ethan embracing Isabella Valentine last night, she shook her head with a bitter smile. "He wouldn’t bother."

"Whoever did it!" Vivian clapped her hands gleefully. "Justice was served!"

Sophia stared blankly out the window.

Her phone suddenly vibrated.
###Chapter 44

The phone rang abruptly.

Sophia glanced at the caller ID—Zachary Evans.

She rejected the call without hesitation.

The screen had barely gone dark when the ringing started again.

"That phone hasn't stopped since you passed out," Vivian Ashcroft said, leaning closer and pointing at the device. "Hangs up and calls right back like a man possessed. Maybe you should answer?"

"Just Ethan Roscente's lapdog," Sophia scoffed.

"Fair point. Nothing good ever comes from them." Vivian pursed her lips. "Just turn it off—"

Before she could finish, the phone vibrated again.

Sophia moved to decline, but her finger slipped—and she accidentally answered.

"Ms. Lowell!" Zachary's voice was laced with urgency. "Where are you? Mr. Roscente specifically arranged for a doctor—"

Vivian raised an eyebrow at her.

"I'm fine," Sophia said coldly.

"But Mr. Roscente said you—"

"It's just a stomachache." She cut him off.

Suddenly, a familiar deep voice came through the line: "A minor illness is enough to skip work?"

Sophia's fingers trembled.

That blinding memory flashed through her mind.

She ended the call.

Ethan stared at the darkened screen, his expression stormy.

"Call again."

Zachary reluctantly redialed.

"The number you have reached is currently unavailable—"

Blocked.

Ethan narrowed his eyes and dialed himself.

The same automated message played.

"Interesting." His laugh was icy as he turned to the accompanying physician. "Use your phone."

This time, the call connected.

"Who is this?" Sophia's voice came through.

Ethan snatched the phone. "Sophia, how dare you—"

Beep.

The dial tone blared mockingly.

Another attempt—rejected immediately.

"Find her," Ethan ground out through clenched teeth.

The door across the hall suddenly opened.

"You're looking for Sophia?" A neighbor eyed them suspiciously.

Zachary quickly plastered on a smile. "We're her colleagues. Heard she was sick—"
###Chapter 45

Across the hallway lived a silver-haired old lady with a kind face.

Since Sophia moved in, the elderly woman noticed her solitary lifestyle and took pity on her, often gifting homegrown vegetables. Over time, the two grew familiar.

"Are you Sophia's friends?" The old woman squinted at the two men before her, then frowned. "That girl had sudden abdominal pain last night. An ambulance took her away. Why are you only coming now?"

Zachary's pupils constricted. From the corner of his eye, he saw Ethan's jawline tighten instantly.

"Do you know which hospital?" Zachary's voice was strained.

The moment the old woman named the hospital, Ethan had already turned and pressed the elevator button. The metal doors reflected his stormy profile.

The black sedan sped through the streets. Ethan's knuckles turned white, the window mirroring his bloodshot eyes.

So that fleeing figure from this morning really was her.

She'd rather collapse than see him?

A low, humorless laugh escaped him, his eyes icy.

Sophia, you're something else.

The rooftop wind howled, tangling Sophia's hair. She stared at her blacked-out phone, her lips twisting into a mocking curve.

"I knew it was you." Isabella limped closer, clutching her waist, her hospital gown billowing in the wind. "I thought you looked familiar in the hallway."

Sophia glanced at her awkward gait, then turned away indifferently to gaze at the city lights.

"What happens to me is none of your concern, Ms. Valentine."

"You seem to hate me." Isabella tilted her head, suddenly stepping closer. "Because of Ethan?"

Sophia turned to leave, but cold fingers clamped around her wrist.

"Did you sleep with him?" Isabella's nails dug into her skin.

Sophia yanked free, smoothing the wrinkles from her sleeve with deliberate calm. "Ms. Valentine, we're not close enough for this conversation."

"You're guilty." Isabella suddenly laughed. "Just like your aunt, preying on wealthy men. Shameless."

Sophia's gaze turned glacial.

"Seems my last slap didn't teach you a lesson."

Isabella instinctively retreated half a step before straightening. "And who ended up apologizing? Ethan always takes my side. What are you to him?"

She would never forget the humiliation on Sophia's face when she was forced to back down.

"Oh?" Sophia smiled faintly. "How many times do you think he can stomach that plastic face of yours before he gags?"

Isabella paled instantly.

"Honestly, if you're born defective, you should know your place." Sophia's gaze swept over her stiff cheek implants. "Save yourself the embarrassment of being discarded."

The wind lifted Isabella's gown, revealing her clenched fists.
###Chapter 46

She stood before the mirror, studying her reflection. Her face was delicate and pleasant by ordinary standards, but in the entertainment industry, it barely scraped by as average. Every time online polls ranked "mediocre beauties in showbiz," her name inevitably made the list.

The "high-fashion face" persona her PR team crafted might fool fans, but it couldn’t fool her.

A man like Ethan Roscente would never have agreed to this engagement if not for her family’s influence. The thought festered in her heart like a thorn.

She loved Ethan with a desperate intensity, but to him, she was merely a calculated choice. So when she saw Sophia Lowell standing beside him, the venomous serpent of jealousy nearly tore her heart apart.

Watching Isabella Valentine’s sour expression, the frustration that had weighed on Sophia’s chest all morning finally eased. Suddenly, she understood the psychology of those villainous female characters in novels.

Hate them. Understand them. Become them.

The wind on the rooftop was fierce, tangling Sophia’s long hair. She had come here for fresh air, but with Isabella present, the mood was ruined.

As she turned to leave, the rooftop door swung open again.

Ethan’s tall figure appeared in the doorway.

There was no need to guess who he was here for. Sure enough, Isabella’s delighted voice rang out behind her. "Ethan! How did you know I was here?"

The wind drowned out his reply. Sophia had no interest in playing the third wheel. She quickened her steps toward the opposite exit.

Her phone buzzed.

A text from an unknown number contained just two words: "Come here."

Frowning, Sophia scanned her surroundings—and met Ethan’s icy gaze.

With a cold laugh, she deleted the message, blocked the number, and walked away without looking back.

Ethan watched her retreating figure, his eyes darkening. A chilling smirk curled his lips.

"What’s wrong?" Isabella asked cautiously.

"Nothing." He averted his gaze.

Descending from the rooftop, Sophia passed the psychiatric ward. A nurse pushed a hospital bed down the corridor toward her.

The man on the bed was pale, his hair disheveled, his vacant eyes fixed on the ceiling. As Sophia stepped aside to let them pass, their eyes accidentally met.

Daniel Clementson’s dull gaze suddenly twisted with rage.

In a flash, he seized her wrist, lunged from the bed, and clamped his hands around her throat.

"You bitch! This is all your fault! Die! Die!"

Caught off guard, Sophia was slammed against the wall, his grip crushing her windpipe. She clawed at his arms, drawing blood, but couldn’t break free.

Her breath grew ragged. Darkness crept into her vision.

The nurse’s screams echoed through the hallway.
###Chapter 47

Daniel Clementson's eyes burned crimson, veins bulging as his iron grip tightened around Sophia Lowell's slender throat.

"Help..." Sophia's face turned ashen, her fingers weakly clawing at his arms.

A nurse shrieked and rushed forward to pull Daniel away. Medical staff flooded the hallway, chaos erupting in seconds.

"Sedative! Now!" the attending physician barked.

Just as the needle grazed Daniel's skin, a shadow darted past.

Thunk—

Ethan Roscente snatched the syringe and plunged it into Daniel's carotid without hesitation.

"Ahhh!" Daniel released Sophia, howling as blood gushed from his neck.

Darkness encroached Sophia's vision. Her knees buckled, sending her collapsing backward.

Instead of meeting cold tile, she landed against a solid chest. The familiar scent of bergamot and sandalwood enveloped her.

"Useless." Ethan's voice could freeze hell itself.

The staff finally sprang into action, restraining the thrashing Daniel.

"You?" Sophia forced her eyes open.

Ethan's gaze locked onto the brutal fingerprints marring her throat. His expression darkened. When his thumb brushed the bruising, the contact sent tremors through her.

"Who else were you expecting?" His laugh held no warmth. "Your deranged boyfriend?"

Sophia trembled with rage but lacked strength to push him away.

Ethan swept her into his arms. "Stop fighting."

Vivian Ashcroft paced the hospital room like a caged tiger. The moment she saw them, she exploded. "Ethan Roscente! What did you do to Sophia?"

She grabbed an IV pole, then froze at the sight of Sophia's injuries.

"What...happened?"
###Chapter 48

Vivian Ashcroft rolled up her sleeves, ready to charge forward, but Sophia Lowell grabbed her arm.

"It wasn't him," Sophia whispered weakly, shaking her head. "It was Daniel Clementson."

"Daniel Clementson?" Vivian's eyes widened.

Sophia motioned for Ethan Roscente to set her down. The man’s brow furrowed, but his movements were gentle as he placed her on the hospital bed.

"I ran into Daniel on the way. He attacked me," Sophia rasped.

Vivian immediately rushed to examine her injuries, gasping. "Oh my god! Your neck—" She suddenly lowered her voice. "And you're still—"

"Vivian!" Sophia cut her off sharply.

Vivian clamped her mouth shut, shooting a guilty glance at Ethan.

The man noticed the odd exchange but didn’t press further, turning to call for a doctor.

The moment the door closed, Vivian leaned in. "So Ethan played the hero?"

"He stopped Daniel," Sophia confirmed.

Vivian scoffed. "Probably just worried about a death in his own hospital."

Sophia was about to agree when realization struck. "His hospital?"

"Yeah, I just looked it up," Vivian whispered. "This private hospital is his personal asset. Not connected to the Roscente family."

Sophia’s face paled. "This is bad. He’ll find out about the pregnancy easily."

"Oh no, oh no." Vivian wrung her hands. "If he finds out, he’ll force you to terminate it."

They locked eyes, fear mirrored in each other’s gazes.

"Thank god the maternity ward was full last night," Vivian said with a shudder. "If you’d been admitted there, we’d be screwed."

Sophia clenched the sheets, then suddenly beckoned Vivian closer.

Meanwhile, after summoning the doctor, Ethan headed straight for the psychiatric ward.

At the end of the hallway, Daniel’s hysterical screams echoed.

Inside the room, chaos reigned. Medical staff struggled to restrain the thrashing patient, but Daniel fought wildly, making it impossible to administer a second sedative.

"Let me."

Ethan’s voice brought everything to a halt.

He calmly pulled on gloves and took the syringe from a nurse. His long fingers depressed the plunger with elegant precision.

Only then did the staff remember the rumors about the Roscente heir—a medical doctorate at sixteen, the youngest surgeon at Massachusetts General. A man who’d walked away at his peak to become a business prodigy.

"Hold him down," Ethan ordered.

The staff snapped back to attention, restraining Daniel with renewed effort.

The needle pierced the vein smoothly. Daniel’s screams cut off mid-breath.
###Chapter 49

The needle glinted coldly under the light.

Ethan Roscente pressed the syringe against Daniel Clementson's face, his voice icy. "Move again, and I can't guarantee where this needle will go."

Daniel froze.

His pupils contracted sharply, his breathing turning ragged. The sight of that syringe instantly dragged him back to that nightmare of an evening.

In the dim warehouse, he'd been trussed up like a hog for slaughter.

Ethan had traced the tip of a scalpel over his face, his gaze frigid, his tone terrifyingly calm. "Sophia is mine."

The sound of fabric tearing had been unnervingly clear.

"Ah—!"

A bloodcurdling scream echoed through the empty space. Daniel curled on the ground, blood seeping between his fingers.

Ethan wiped his hands methodically before grinding his shoe into Daniel's fingers. "Remember this lesson."

......

The sound of running water in the bathroom continued for a long time.

Ethan stared at his reflection, violence churning in his eyes. He scrubbed his hands furiously, his knuckles turning white.

Just a little more.

A fraction more, and he would've lost control—plunging that syringe into Daniel's veins.

His phone suddenly rang.

"Sophia Lowell" flashed on the screen. Ethan's brow arched slightly—she'd finally unblocked him.

In the hospital room, Sophia looked paler than the sheets.

"Just a dead man," Ethan said from the bedside, his tone indifferent, as if discussing the weather. "Scared you that much?"

Sophia's fingers clenched the blanket.

She'd just witnessed Daniel being flung across the road. What chilled her more was the nurse mentioning Ethan had visited the psychiatric ward.

"Someone saw you—"

"Worried I killed him?" Ethan smirked, pulling out a cigarette case before tucking it away. "Or mourning your little boyfriend?"

Sophia pressed her cracked lips together.

"I just want the truth."

Ethan looked down at her, then suddenly laughed. "Pity. This has nothing to do with me."

Daniel had been subdued when he left. Who knew why the lunatic had bolted straight into traffic?

At his answer, the tension in Sophia's shoulders finally eased.

She didn't see the darkness flicker in Ethan's eyes as he turned away.
###Chapter 50

My phone vibrated with Vivian's reply. I stared at the "OK" emoji, inexplicably irritated.

"Why suddenly go to psychiatry?" I asked casually.

Ethan's gaze cut through me like a blade. "Too noisy. Needed him to shut up."

I let out a cold laugh.

How presumptuous.

Did he really think he was avenging me by confronting Daniel?

My fingers absently traced the bandage on my neck. "I'm fine now. You can leave, Uncle Ethan. Isabella was looking for you earlier."

The moment Ethan stepped out, Isabella stormed into the room. Finding him gone, she launched into another round of passive-aggressive jabs.

Suddenly, the man closed the distance, gripping my chin to force my gaze up. "Jealous?"

"You think that's possible?" I smirked mockingly.

He released me with a disdainful chuckle. "Right. I forgot—you're an ungrateful brat."

Use and discard.

Even a stray dog would call you its master.

After Ethan left, I drifted into a fitful sleep. My dreams twisted into grotesque shapes, finally freezing on an image of Daniel's mangled corpse. I jolted awake in a cold sweat.

"Maybe you should see a therapist?" Vivian asked worriedly.

Witnessing death firsthand—she feared it would break me.

I gulped water to steady myself. "No need. I'm not that fragile."

"At this rate, I'm afraid you won't be able to keep the baby."

The dual torment of body and mind was too dangerous for a pregnant woman.

I gently cradled my stomach. "I'll protect them with everything I have."

"Didn't expect you to care so much about the child." Vivian sounded surprised.

"I don't usually like kids," I admitted.

Growing up fatherless, most of the cruelty I endured came from peers' taunts. I never learned to connect with children.

Others coo over cute babies—I just watch from afar.

But this little life inside me is different. Just an embryo, yet I can already feel its quiet pulse.

The thought of having someone to share my life with suddenly made the future seem brighter.

Vivian studied my softened expression and reached out to touch my belly. "The father's a scumbag, but the genes are decent. Your kid's going to be ridiculously pretty."

"What are you scheming now?" I eyed her warily.

She took a bite of her apple, grinning. "Just securing my godmother privileges early."

If it's a boy, he'll have girls swooning—and they'll all cozy up to me for favors.

If it's a girl, suitors will line up—and I'll be drowning in gifts.

I shook my head. "The baby's not even born yet. You're getting ahead of yourself."
###Chapter 51

Sophia Lowell traced her fingers over her flat stomach, brows slightly furrowed. "Are you sure your hacker friend is reliable? Ethan Roscente isn’t someone you can easily fool."

Vivian Ashcroft thumped her chest confidently. "Relax. As long as he doesn’t personally escort you for a re-examination, there’s no way he’ll find out."

She had asked a friend to hack into the hospital’s system and replace all of Sophia’s pregnancy records with a diagnosis of gastroenteritis.

Only then did Sophia exhale in relief, the tension in her shoulders easing slightly.

Meanwhile, in the hospital corridor.

Zachary Evans handed a stack of medical reports to Ethan. "Ms. Lowell has been diagnosed with acute gastroenteritis. Irregular eating habits caused her stomach discomfort."

Ethan flipped through the reports quickly, his gaze lingering on one particular data point.

"Remove all the coffee machines from the office pantry," he said abruptly. "Replace them with herbal tea for stomach health."

Zachary blinked. "Understood. I’ll arrange it immediately."

Just then, the examination room door opened, and Isabella Valentine limped out, her ankle still wrapped in bandages.

"What did the doctor say?" Ethan tucked away the reports.

Isabella flashed a sweet smile. "Much better than this morning. Just can’t wear heels for a while."

"Then switch to flats," Ethan replied flatly.

Isabella pouted playfully, stomping her uninjured foot. "Ethan, shouldn’t you be complimenting me? Telling me I look just as good without heels?"

The corner of Ethan’s lips quirked slightly. "Should I?"

"Of course!" Her eyes sparkled with mischief. "Anyone can tell you’ve never had to sweet-talk a girl before."

A shadow flickered in his gaze. "No experience in that department."

Isabella’s heart leapt. Her fingers inched toward his palm—but just before contact, Ethan checked his wristwatch and deftly sidestepped her touch.

"I have a meeting," he said, withdrawing his arm. "Have your assistant take you home."

Her smile froze. "You’re not staying with me?"

"Be good," he said, tone brooking no argument.

Suppressing her frustration, she forced a nod. "Fine."

With her assistant’s support, Isabella left, glancing back every few steps. The moment they turned the corridor corner, she violently shook off the assistant’s hand and kicked their shin.

"Useless! Who told you to interfere?" Her face twisted with rage, all traces of injury gone. "You ruined everything!"

The assistant staggered back, their sleeve slipping to reveal a forearm covered in bruises.

Elsewhere, Ethan tossed his suit jacket into a trash bin. Accepting a disinfectant wipe from Zachary, he meticulously scrubbed the back of his hand where Isabella had touched him.

"What time is she being discharged?" he asked, lighting a cigarette.

Zachary checked his watch. "Five p.m. sharp."

Amid the curling smoke, Ethan’s expression darkened.
###Chapter 52

Vincent Lombardi sat grimly in his seat, his wrists shackled with reinforced handcuffs. He stared at the clouds outside the window, a flicker of resentment in his eyes.

This escape was meant to evade that mysterious master, yet he'd been outmaneuvered by an unexpected betrayal. If convicted of fraud, his carefully cultivated network would crumble.

As the plane touched down at the international airport, Vincent narrowed his eyes. Twelve hours in the air had given him clarity.

"Behave." One of Gabriel's men shoved him forward.

The terminal buzzed with activity. Vincent noticed a tall, impeccably dressed pilot nearby, drawing admiring glances from passersby.

"Captain Anderson. Fancy meeting you here." Gabriel greeted lazily.

Julian Anderson gave a slight nod, his gaze briefly landing on Vincent. In that instant, Vincent lunged.

A hidden talisman shot from his sleeve as he sprang toward Julian like an arrow.

"Look out!" Gabriel barked.

The talisman burst into ashes the moment it touched Julian's uniform. Before Vincent could reach him, a golden light repelled him, sending him crashing to the floor.

"Impossible..." Vincent gaped. Julian stood bathed in blinding golden radiance that seared his eyes.

Gabriel arched a brow and clapped Julian's shoulder. "Nice charm, brother-in-law."

Julian adjusted his tie with a sigh. "Just sunlight reflecting, Captain Macmillan."

Nearby flight attendants exchanged bewildered looks—the scene defied logic.

Restrained again, Vincent looked defeated. Decades of studying esoteric arts, yet he'd never seen such mastery of protective magic.

Then a porcelain-faced little girl came darting over.

"Daddy!"

Luna Fairsprene fluttered into Gabriel's arms like a butterfly, with Walter Deross shadowing her every step.

"Uncle Walter even guards the bathroom door!" Luna pouted. "He scared all my classmates!"

Gabriel ruffled her hair and frowned at Walter. "I told you to keep a reasonable distance."

Walter snapped to attention. "Priority one is the young miss's safety!"

Luna tugged Gabriel's sleeve. "Grandma threatened to break Uncle Walter's legs."

The boarding announcement echoed through the terminal. Julian nodded at Gabriel and left with his crew. As Vincent was hauled into a police van, his eyes burned into Julian's retreating figure.

"Wrap it up." Gabriel hoisted Luna onto one arm and pulled out his phone. "I need to call the kindergarten principal."

Walter followed closely, scanning their surroundings. Luna perched on her father's shoulder and stuck her tongue out at him.
###Chapter 53

"I should go with you." Sophia clutched her phone, her knuckles turning white. "Those online haters are getting out of control."

Vivian's carefree laughter crackled through the phone. "Relax, my dad's sending over a bodyguard. Ex-special forces. Could take down eight guys barehanded."

Sophia exhaled in relief. "Call me immediately if anything happens."

"Yeah, yeah. Stop worrying."

The call ended just as a cold voice cut through the air behind her. "Standing up your friend?"

She whirled around. Ethan Roscente leaned against his car door, spinning his keys around one long finger. Sunlight carved shadows across his sharp features, deepening the intensity of his gaze.

Sophia's pulse jumped. Was he... behind this?

She dismissed the thought instantly. A man like Ethan, with his sky-high arrogance, wouldn't stoop to such petty tactics.

"Get in." He yanked open the passenger door.

Sophia stood her ground. "I already ordered a ride."

Ethan's eyes narrowed, the air around him turning glacial. "Rejecting me?" A smirk twisted his lips. "Perfect timing. I was about to toss out that junk you left at my place."

"What junk?" Her throat tightened.

"That cracked jade pendant." His nose wrinkled in distaste. "Ugly eyesore."

Sophia's pupils dilated. Her mother's only keepsake—a fractured pixiu pendant. In her rushed departure from Bayview Residences, she'd forgotten it in the jewelry box.

"Give it back." Her voice trembled.

Ethan flicked open his lighter with practiced indifference. "I don't keep trash in my home."

"I'll send a courier to retrieve it now."

"No strangers in my penthouse."

Sophia gritted her teeth. "I'll come by tomorrow at noon."

"Denied." His tone brooked no argument. "That hideous thing pollutes the air by existing."

She snapped. "Ethan Roscente, how are you still alive?"

Suddenly he was in her space, the crisp scent of pine enveloping her. He bent close, his breath warm against her ear. "Because the person who could kill me..." His lips brushed her earlobe. "...hasn't been born yet."

Sophia stumbled back, her spine hitting a tree trunk. Ethan straightened effortlessly and jerked the car door open. "Get in, or say goodbye to your precious pendant forever."

Her fists clenched, nails biting into her palms. This man always knew which strings to pull.

In the end, Sophia slid into the black Maybach. As the door thudded shut, she missed the fleeting curve of Ethan's lips.
###Chapter 54

Ethan Roscente's slender fingers tapped against the steering wheel. His sharp gaze swept over her. "Who else would dare take photos of me except you?"

"..."

Sophia Lowell sensed hidden meaning in his words but couldn't pinpoint it.

He pressed the horn impatiently. "Get in. No parking here."

She scoffed. Since when did the mighty CEO of Roscente Group care about a traffic violation?

Her phone vibrated with a message from Vivian Ashcroft: "Did the car arrive?"

Before she could reply, a strong hand yanked her into the vehicle. Ethan gripped her wrist with one hand and slammed the door shut with the other.

"Too slow," he muttered coldly.

Rubbing her reddened wrist, Sophia texted Vivian: "Cancel the ride."

"What happened?"

"Ran into a rabid dog."

"Ethan?"

"Bingo."

Ethan's expression darkened as he glimpsed the screen. He snatched her phone, easily dodging her attempt to grab it back.

"Let's see how you gossip about me," he said icily.

Her heart skipped a beat. "That's invading my privacy!"

He smirked. "Slander is punishable by law. Need my lawyer to educate you?"

She bit her lip.

Cold sweat trickled down her back as he scrolled through the messages. Thank god she'd deleted all pregnancy-related content.

"What do these abbreviations mean?" He frowned.

"Fandom slang." She feigned calm.

"YQ?"

"Together." She lied smoothly—it actually stood for "pregnancy."

"HY?"

"Membership." In truth, it meant "pregnant."

His eyes narrowed. "YS means doctor?"

She gave a thumbs-up. "Impressive, Mr. Roscente."

From the driver's seat, Zachary Evans chimed in: "I know YYDS means 'eternal god,' but these are new to me."

Sophia rolled her eyes internally but maintained an innocent smile. "You should browse more, Zachary."

He kept his eyes on the road. "Too busy with work to keep up with trends."

Ethan tossed the phone back to her, his gaze threatening. "Next time, you'll face consequences."

Her fingers trembled as she took it. Watching the scenery blur past the window, she silently celebrated another narrow escape.
###Chapter 55

Sophia's eyes glimmered as she suddenly adopted a wounded expression. "Zachary, are you complaining that Mr. Roscente assigned you too much work? He's clearly grooming you for greater things. How could you misinterpret his intentions like this?"

Zachary Evans looked utterly baffled. When had he ever said such a thing?

He frantically waved his hands. "Mr. Roscente, I would never mean it that way!"

Sophia sighed dramatically. "So you're saying I'm falsely accusing you now?"

Zachary was speechless.

Her manipulation skills were truly masterful.

Since when did Mr. Roscente have a taste for this?

Ethan Roscente watched coldly, his long fingers swiftly navigating Sophia's phone before tossing it back to her. "Block me again, and I'll make sure you can't even log in."

Sophia glanced at the forcibly unblocked WeChat contact and scoffed.

As if she couldn't just create a new account.

Back at Bayview Residences, she stormed straight to her bedroom.

The man stared at her retreating figure, irritably loosening his tie and flinging it onto the counter. He poured himself a glass of whiskey and took a slow sip.

His fingers tapped rhythmically against the bar.

On the fifteenth tap, Sophia burst out, furious. "Give it back!"

"What?"

"My Pixiu pendant."

"Oh. That hideous thing."

He feigned realization.

Sophia's eye twitched as she suppressed her rage. "Yes, that hideous thing you mentioned. Now return it."

Ethan studied her flushed cheeks, his Adam's apple bobbing. He swirled his glass. "You want it that badly?"

"Yes."

He retrieved another glass, poured half the amber liquid into it, and slid it toward her. "If you want a favor, show some sincerity first."

Sophia stared at the drink.

The alcohol content was dangerously high—two sips would leave her dizzy. Worse, her stomach condition hadn't fully recovered. She couldn't risk drinking.

Now she understood. Tonight was a trap.

"That belongs to me."

"But you threw it away, didn't you?" His gaze burned. "If you discarded it, how can you claim ownership now?"

"I just forgot to take it." She gritted her teeth. "Ethan, stop being unreasonable."

"Prove it's yours. Is your name engraved on it?"

Sophia took a deep breath.

In a battle of wits, she'd never win against him.

"You're doing this on purpose." She smirked coldly. "Once wasn't enough? You need a second round?"

He suddenly closed the distance between them. "How am I bullying you? All I asked was for you to drink as a gesture. Since when is that mistreatment? Sophia, be reasonable."

She turned her face away. "My stomach is acting up. I can't drink."

"Fine. Another way, then." His tone softened unexpectedly.

"What way?"

"Ever heard of an indirect kiss?"
###Chapter 56

Sophia frowned.

She understood indirect kissing, but what fresh nonsense was indirect drinking?

Ethan smirked at her. "Same principle."

"What's the difference?"

Her instincts screamed this man was up to no good.

Sure enough, he leaned in. "Kiss me."

Her pupils constricted.

"You can't drink, so I'll do it for you." His voice was maddeningly calm. "The alcohol will pass to you. Consider it consumed."

"Ethan Roscente!" She turned her face away in disgust. "You're revolting."

"Last time I kissed you until your legs gave out," his thumb brushed her lower lip, "you didn't seem to mind."

Sophia's ears burned.

This bastard!

Always using his skills to manipulate her, and now dragging up the past.

"You just want to take advantage," she accused.

He nodded shamelessly. "I never do business at a loss." His fingers tilted her chin up. "Did you think I'd give you something for free?"

Of course not.

The Roscente heir never left a debt unpaid.

"Hurry up." His grip tightened on her wrist. "If you weren't just out of the hospital—" The unspoken threat hung between them.

She raised her hand to slap him, but he caught her wrist and pinned it against the counter. "Bold." His breath scorched her neck. "You don't even know how to beg properly."

"Does Isabella know how shameless you are?"

He chuckled darkly. "She doesn't." His hand suddenly gripped her waist. "But you do. And you enjoy it."

The words were poison-tipped needles.

Each syllable reminded her she was just a plaything.

"Little niece." He emphasized the title mockingly.

She stiffened, humiliation crashing over her.

As she struggled, he captured both her hands, trapping her against his chest. "Playing hard to get?" he taunted.

"You make me sick!"

His arms tightened abruptly, surrounding her with his familiar cedar scent. "When you used to cling to me," his lips grazed her ear, "you didn't seem to mind."

"Ethan!" Her voice trembled.

"That Clementson boy," his eyes turned icy, "is he your new sugar daddy?"

Tears welled instantly. "So this is how you see me..." Her voice broke. "How cheap you think I am."

His knuckles brushed her wet cheek, his tone unexpectedly softening. "Must you settle for such mediocrity?" He pulled her closer. "Wouldn't you rather stay with me?"
###Chapter 57

Sophia clenched her fists, her nails digging deep into her palms.

"I'm done with this secret affair."

Ethan Roscente chuckled, his long fingers idly toying with the loose strands of hair near her ear. "But you seemed to enjoy it."

His words cut through her like a blade. Sophia's eyes burned, but she bit her lower lip hard, refusing to let the tears fall.

"Think whatever you want," she said, her voice trembling. "If you don’t want to return the pendant, just throw it away."

Before she could finish, his fingers gripped her chin. His lips crashed against hers with bruising force.

She struggled, but he lifted her effortlessly and pinned her against the bar. The taste of tobacco filled her mouth as his punishing kiss stole her breath.

Crash!

The sound of a shattering glass finally made him pull away. His thumb brushed over her swollen lips, his dark eyes stormy.

"You think you can just walk away?" His voice was icy. "First the pendant, now me?"

Sophia turned her face away. "Forcing something that was never mine will only hurt us both."

"So you're saying it's no use?"

"Yes."

Ethan laughed, the sound devoid of warmth. "But I like forcing things." He leaned in, his breath hot against her ear. "Sophia, you can't escape me."

The intimate nickname sent a shiver down her spine. "What about Isabella? Have you ever considered her feelings?"

His expression darkened. He turned and walked away, only to return moments later with the repaired Pixiu pendant.

"Wear it," he ordered, fastening it roughly around her neck. "Take it off, and you'll regret it."

Sophia looked down. The broken chain had been meticulously repaired, the pendant reinforced. Her fingers trembled as conflicting emotions surged in her chest.

Ethan lifted her off the bar. "Wait here while I change."

The moment his back was turned, she bolted for the door.

Alone in the empty penthouse, Ethan stared at the door, his gaze venomous.

In the taxi, Sophia trembled with fury. That bastard was utterly impossible!
###Chapter 58

Sophia Lowell strode down the commercial street in her high heels when a young man handing out flyers approached her.

"Miss, interested in premium sperm donation?" He eagerly offered a pink leaflet.

She halted mid-step, casting a frosty glance at the flyer. Her already gloomy mood instantly ignited.

"Do I look like I need to donate?" Her voice dripped with venom.

The flustered young man scratched his head. "You could also purchase samples. Many independent women opt for artificial insemination these days..."

Sophia suddenly straightened, accentuating her visible baby bump.

The young man's face turned crimson. "My apologies! I'll leave immediately—"

"Wait." She stopped him, plucking a flyer from his stack. "A friend might find this useful."

Her eyes gleamed with mischief as she studied the website address printed on the paper.

......

Night enveloped the city's most exclusive club.

Felix Roland had his arm around a newly acquainted model, laughing over drinks when his phone rudely interrupted with incessant ringing.

"Who dares—" He angrily answered the call.

Ethan Roscente's icy voice came through. "Upstairs. Now."

Felix looked up through the glass dome, spotting the solitary figure in the VIP lounge above.

"To what do we owe this rare pleasure, Mr. Roscente—" He deliberately drawled.

"The North District land." Ethan cut him off.

The dial tone made Felix grit his teeth. He downed his drink and flashed an apologetic smile at his companion. "Ten minutes, darling."

In the private lounge, Ethan's whiskey glass stood nearly empty.

Felix entered with a low whistle at the sight. "What could possibly drive the great Ethan Roscente to drown his sorrows? Unless it's about—"

"Enough." Ethan's glacial gaze lifted.

The crystal tumbler emitted faint cracking sounds beneath his fingertips.
###Chapter 59

"It's obvious, isn't it?" Felix Roland swirled his wine glass, a teasing smirk playing on his lips. "The mighty Ethan Roscente, depressed over his little canary. Who would believe it?"

Ethan's gaze turned icy.

"I thought you had a thing for innocent college girls." Felix leaned in. "I know a few campus beauties—fresh as daisies. Want me to introduce you?"

"Get lost." Ethan slammed his glass onto the table.

Felix snorted. "Playing the saint now? You didn't hold back when you sent that guy she was dating to the hospital."

"Not my doing." Ethan's tone was flat.

Felix refilled his glass, raising a meaningful brow. "Tell me you never considered it."

Ethan looked down, silent.

"Tsk." Felix suddenly turned serious. "Catching feelings?"

"Ridiculous." Ethan scoffed.

"Denial." Felix shook his head. "Sophia's a good girl. If you like her, treat her right. Don't regret it when she's gone."

Ethan's lips curled. "She wouldn't dare."

"Overconfident, aren't we?" Felix drawled. "Those long legs of hers—"

A glass whizzed past his ear.

"You were staring at her legs?" Ethan's voice dripped danger.

Felix threw up his hands in mock surrender. "Can't appreciate beauty now? Not like some people with their collecting habits—" He paused. "Wait, that's not the point."

"One more look," Ethan said coldly, "and I'll gouge your eyes out."

Felix whistled. "Protective much? Still claiming it's nothing?"

Ethan downed his drink, shadows swirling in his eyes.

His phone buzzed. An unknown number flashed on the screen. He rejected the call immediately.

"Who was that?" Felix craned his neck.

Ethan's expression darkened. Another call came through. Felix snatched the phone and hit answer.

"Mr. Roscente, I'm the purchaser of your sperm—"

The call ended with a violent click.

Felix froze for two seconds before erupting into laughter. "Holy shit, Ethan! Selling sperm now? Is Roscente Group going bankrupt?"

"Shut up!" Ethan's temple throbbed.

Felix clutched his stomach, wheezing. "Who the hell has the balls to mess with you? This is brutal!" He wiped tears from his eyes. "But how did they get your private number?"

Ethan gritted his teeth. "Zachary's looking into it."

From the first harassing call, he'd known something was off. Now even men were sending suggestive texts. Someone was clearly targeting him.

Felix was still laughing. "When you find out who it is, let me know. I owe them a drink! This is genius!"

Ethan's knuckles turned white, his expression murderous.
###Chapter 60

The phone rang abruptly.

Ethan Roscente glanced at the caller ID, his eyes turning icy.

"Mr. Roscente, we've found it." Zachary Evans' voice carried hesitation.

The man's slender fingers tightened, knuckles whitening.

"Speak."

Silence stretched for several seconds.

"It's..." Zachary hesitated.

Ethan's gaze grew even colder. "Do I need to beg you to continue?"

"It's someone close." Zachary forced out the words. "Very close."

Felix Roland perked up nearby, curiosity written all over his face.

Ethan let out a cold laugh, already knowing the answer.

"Sophia Lowell?"

A sigh came through the phone.

Felix gasped, unable to contain himself. "Holy shit! Your little wildcat plays dirty!"

Ethan ended the call abruptly, dangerous glints flashing in his eyes.

"Perfect."

Felix rubbed his goosebumps, mentally lighting a candle for Sophia.

Meanwhile, Sophia was walking home with shopping bags.

A sudden cold wind made her shiver.

The apartment building loomed dark before her.

As she fumbled for her phone's flashlight, a powerful force slammed her against the wall.

"Who—"

"Having fun?" A deep male voice exploded by her ear.

Sophia froze.

Ethan's presence enveloped her completely.

"I don't know what you're talking about." She turned her face away, heart pounding.

His cold laugh brushed warm lips against her earlobe.

"Playing dumb?"

Sophia struggled to escape, but he pinned her wrists against the wall.

"Let go!" She raised her leg to kick.

Ethan easily restrained her, knee pressing between her thighs.

"Weren't you the one who wanted to be my dog?" He nipped her ear tauntingly. "The master isn't done playing yet."

Sophia trembled with rage.

"Ethan Roscente! Go find your fiancée!"

His eyes darkened as he gripped her chin, forcing her to look up.

"Jealous?"

"Ugh!" Sophia glared fiercely. "You disgust me!"

Instead of anger, Ethan smiled, thumb tracing her soft lips.

"Then why did you give my number to those women?"

Sophia's pupils contracted.

She was screwed.
###Chapter 61

"You!"

Sophia trembled with rage, her cheeks burning.

This man had actually held onto her teasing words all this time.

She finally understood—Ethan Roscente was here to settle the score.

In the darkness, she glared at his shadowy outline and let out a bitter laugh.

"That's right. I gave your number to those women. You deserved it after how you treated me this afternoon. Fight fire with fire."

"Fire?" Ethan's eyes narrowed dangerously. "You've got nerve, Sophia."

His gaze dropped to her parted lips, dark and unreadable.

She met his stare without flinching. "Learned from the best—you."

A vein throbbed at his temple. His lips curled into a cold smirk. "You weren't playing the virtuous saint this afternoon. Who melted in my arms? Who clung to my neck?"

Sophia's pupils shrank. Her eyes reddened instantly.

"You're vile, Ethan!"

"Vile?" He stepped closer. "I can be worse. Want a demonstration?"

Her blood ran cold. Her voice shook. "Does humiliating me make you happy?"

The broken question struck something in him.

Before he could respond, she continued, "Fine. You've made your point. We're even. Now leave."

"Even?" The word ignited his fury.

A sharp pain shot through her jaw. She gasped.

"Trying to dismiss me?" His voice was glacial. "Remember your place, Sophia. I bought you. You don't get to decide when this ends."

She lifted her chin defiantly. "I'll pay you back. Now get out!"

His grip tightened.

Cold sweat beaded on her skin, but she refused to make a sound.

After a long moment, he scoffed.

"Repay me?" He leaned in, his breath scorching her face. "Your body will do. It's what you're good for."

The words hit like a lightning strike. Shame flooded her veins.

Before she could react, her sweater was ripped away.

The cold air bit into her skin just as sharp teeth sank into her shoulder.

"Ah!"

His punishing kisses trailed down her neck, stopping at her lips.

"This mouth," he murmured, sending chills down her spine, "should only scream in pain."

The assault grew rougher.

Tears welled up. Suddenly, Sophia realized—

She was done being his plaything.

Crack!

The sharp slap shattered the night.
###Chapter 62

The motion-sensor light flickered erratically before dying with a sharp electrical buzz.

The slap echoed through the stairwell.

Ethan Roscente turned his head slightly, tongue probing his numb cheek. His thumb came away smeared with blood when he wiped his lip.

A low chuckle escaped him, his eyes glacial. "Sophia, you've got nerve."

Her entire body trembled, palm stinging from the impact.

The air grew thick with tension.

"You crossed the line first." She forced herself to meet his gaze, voice shaking. "Next time, it won't just be a slap."

His grip tightened on her chin. "Planning to kill me now?"

Moonlight slanted through the window, illuminating her pale face.

Abruptly, he released her and stepped back, adjusting his cufflinks. "Leaking my private number, plus this little stunt." His lips curled into a cold smile. "My lawyer will contact you tomorrow."

Sophia pressed against the wall, nails digging into her palms.

"As for those twenty million," he looked down at her with disdain, "every cent will be repaid with interest."

His footsteps faded down the stairs.

Her legs gave out, sliding down the wall until she sat crumpled on the floor.

A bottle of prenatal vitamins rolled from her spilled shopping bag, glinting faintly in the moonlight.

Inside the black Maybach, Ethan lit a cigarette.

"Mr. Roscente?" His assistant's puzzled voice came through the phone.

"Run a financial audit tomorrow." He exhaled smoke, watching a window light up above them. "An old debt."

At 5 AM, her phone rang sharply.

"Ms. Lowell, I'm Mr. Roscente's attorney." The polite male voice continued, "Regarding compensation, we should meet today."

Sophia jerked upright, startling the calico cat at her feet.

"If I repay everything," she clutched the sheets, "he'll leave me alone?"

A pause.

"Mr. Roscente only said to settle accounts properly."
###Chapter 63

Sophia stared at her phone screen, fingertips trembling slightly.

"Mr. Roscente requests a noon meeting." The voice on the other end was polite.

She scoffed. "Him again?"

"Yes, Miss Lowell."

"Fine." She hung up and tossed the phone onto the bed.

Dawn light filtered through the windows as Sophia threw off the covers. She refilled her calico cat's bowl, toasted two slices of bread, and stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, chewing slowly.

After today, she'd be free of Ethan Roscente forever.

"You seem cheerful." Jessica walked into the office carrying coffee.

Sophia looked up from typing her resignation letter and smiled. "Finally breaking free."

"Really leaving?" Jessica lowered her voice. "What about Mr. Roscente—"

"I never should've come here." Sophia cut her off. "My degree is in architecture."

"Oh, who are you trying to fool?" A shrill voice rang from the doorway. "You didn't care about 'mismatched qualifications' when you were climbing into his bed."

Three female coworkers strutted in, led by Isabella's lackey, Daisy.

"Now that Miss Valentine's here, certain people have lost their chance and suddenly play the victim." Daisy raised her voice deliberately. "Such a delicate little saint."

Sophia saved her document leisurely. "You seem well-versed in the trade. Need me to introduce you to some sponsors?"

"You—!" Daisy flushed crimson. "I heard your ex died in a car crash. Did your bad luck kill him?"

The office fell silent.

Sophia rose slowly. "Missing him? Should I send you to keep him company?"

"Are you insane?!"

"Compared to certain simps, I'm perfectly sane." Sophia smiled coolly. "Not everyone gets turned on by Ethan's expressionless face."

Daisy trembled with rage. "You think a man like Mr. Roscente would want trash like you?"

"Correction." Sophia grabbed her bag. "I don't want him."

She turned toward the elevators as furious curses followed her.

When the doors closed, Sophia exhaled deeply. Her phone buzzed—a meeting address from her lawyer.

After today, everything would finally be over.
###Chapter 64

Ahem.

A deliberate cough cut through the office chatter.

Everyone turned toward the sound, their expressions instantly shifting.

"E-Ethan..."

Ethan Roscente stood at the entrance, his face stormy. He had clearly overheard their conversation.

Zachary Evans stood beside him, his sharp gaze sweeping over the room. "You're paid to work, not gossip. Since you have so much free time, you can re-audit last year's financial reports."

The office fell dead silent.

Ethan's cold eyes scanned the room before landing on Sophia Lowell. His deep, unreadable gaze pinned her in place.

Sophia kept her head down, acutely aware of his piercing stare. She expected an outburst, but instead, he turned and strode into his office without a word.

Sophia exhaled shakily.

His unusual reaction unsettled her.

Inside the CEO's office, Ethan drummed his fingers against the desk, his expression dark. After a long silence, he spoke. "Pull up their performance reviews."

Zachary nodded. "Understood."

The entire morning passed without Ethan emerging. Sophia only saw Zachary moving in and out of his office, his expression grim.

She clutched her freshly printed resignation letter, her knuckles white.

HR had already processed most of the paperwork. Only Ethan's signature remained. But after this morning, she wasn't sure anymore.

"Having second thoughts?"

Isabella Valentine's mocking voice came from behind her, accompanied by the tap of her cane.

Sophia ignored her and marched straight to Ethan's office.

"Come in."

His icy tone made her inhale sharply before pushing the door open.

"Ethan, my resignation."

She placed the document on his desk and stood stiffly.

Ethan didn’t look up. "I wouldn’t want my greasiness to stain your resignation."

Sophia’s lips pressed into a thin line.

Of course he remembered.

She cleared her throat. "About this morning—that was out of line. I apologize."

Ethan finally lifted his gaze, his eyes sharp. "You insult me daily, and it's always unintentional?"
###Chapter 65

Sophia lowered her lashes, the long shadows of her eyelashes falling across her cheeks. Her voice was barely audible. "Not every day... just occasionally."

"Occasionally?" Ethan's lips curled into a mocking smirk.

She suddenly remembered yesterday—when he had caught her and Vivian badmouthing him over WeChat. Her fingertips trembled with guilt. She quickly amended, "Frequently occasionally."

Ethan: "..."

Was there even a difference?

The derision in his eyes deepened.

Surprisingly, he didn’t press further and accepted her resignation letter.

Just as Sophia began to relax, his low voice cut through the silence again. "Has the lawyer contacted you?"

"We’re meeting at noon." Her grip tightened on her bag strap.

Ethan waved a dismissive hand. "Hope you won’t regret it."

"Never." Her voice was steel.

He scoffed and returned to his paperwork.

At noon, the café was thick with the rich aroma of coffee.

Sophia arrived to find Simon Sherwood, impeccably dressed in a suit, already waiting. After brief pleasantries, he slid a document across the table.

"Miss Lowell, please review the compensation terms."

Her smile froze the moment she looked down. The figure—three million—made her pupils constrict. "This is extortion!"

Simon remained impassive. "You unlawfully published Mr. Roscente’s personal information on SpermDonorConnect.com, constituting a criminal offense. Given your relationship, he’s only demanding financial compensation."

"I should be grateful for his mercy?" Her fingers turned ice-cold with rage.

"Mr. Roscente said the money will suffice."

She nearly ground her teeth to dust.

Simon flipped to the next page. "This one million is for facial damages. Mr. Roscente’s face is insured for 1.2 million. You’re getting a discount."

"Is he insane?" A vein throbbed at her temple. "What grown man insures his face?"

"Mr. Roscente said it was your idea."

The memory crashed over her like a wave.

Years ago, on campus, he had shielded her from a thrown chair, leaving a bloody gash on his cheek. She had tenderly traced the wound. "A face this perfect deserves a high-value policy."

He’d pulled her close, his breath hot against her neck. "Does my Sophia care that much?"

"Of course." She’d tilted her face up, brushing her lips against his. "Do it?"

His eyes darkened as his hand slid under her shirt. "That depends on your performance..."

The memory shattered.

Sophia’s knuckles whitened around the document. Every sweet word from the past had become a blade aimed at her heart.
###Chapter 66
The office air conditioning was blasting, yet Sophia Lowell felt feverish all over.

Her nails dug half-moon marks into her palms as she stared at her phone screen. Isabella Valentine's suggestive "He's busy" voice message pierced her heart like a thorn.

"Put him on the phone." Sophia's voice turned glacial.

Rustling sounds came through the receiver, mingled with a man's labored breathing. Isabella giggled. "Ethan is...indisposed at the moment."

Sophia slammed the phone onto the sofa. As she turned to leave, a familiar document on the desk caught her eye—the loan agreement Simon Sherwood had shown her earlier.

Compelled by some unseen force, she flipped to the last page. Beside Ethan Roscente's flamboyant signature sat Isabella's elegant handwriting—"Guarantor."

"So that's it." Sophia's lips curled into a bitter smile. No wonder the interest rates were astronomical—someone had been pulling strings behind the scenes.

She snapped several photos of the contract with her phone. Just as she turned to leave, the office door swung open.

Ethan stood framed in the doorway, his tailored suit impeccable but his tie hanging loose. His gaze darkened when it landed on the document in her hand.

"Who gave you permission to touch my things?"

Sophia lifted her chin. "A sixty-million loan shark deal. How resourceful of you, Mr. Roscente."

He strode forward and seized her wrist. "About Isabella—I can explain."

"Don't bother." She wrenched free. "I'll repay every cent."

As she turned to leave, Ethan yanked her back and pinned her against the wall. His breath carried a hint of alcohol as his thumb brushed her reddened eyelid.

"Jealous?"

Sophia averted her face. "You flatter yourself."

Ethan chuckled darkly before sweeping her into his arms. "Then let me show you what I've really been busy with."

The lounge door crashed open as he tossed her onto the plush bed. Before she could rise, his weight pressed her down, his tie binding her wrists.

"Isabella just brought hangover soup." His teeth grazed her earlobe. "Now it's time to collect interest."

Sophia's eyes widened as he retrieved an insurance policy from the drawer. Ethan flipped it open deliberately, tapping a specific clause.

"Read carefully. See who's listed as beneficiary."

Black ink spelled out "Sophia Lowell" in bold letters.

Her breath hitched as realization dawned. Ethan brushed his lips against hers. "Sixty million to own you forever? Worth every penny."
###Chapter 67

The phone call crackled with intimate gasps. Sophia's fingers trembled.

She abruptly ended the call. The screen reflected her pale face.

"What's wrong?" Jessica returned with coffee, noticing her distress.

Sophia forced a smile. "Nothing."

She swallowed a bitter pill, the acrid taste spreading across her tongue.

Jessica handed her water. "Stomach acting up again?"

Sophia didn't explain. She just clutched the glass.

So he already had someone else. And here she was, foolishly thinking of confronting him.

A self-deprecating laugh escaped her lips as she dialed Vivian's number.

"Viv, can you lend me three million?"

Meanwhile, at an upscale restaurant.

Isabella deleted the call log and returned the phone to its place.

"Ethan." She cooed.

Ethan emerged from the restroom, frowning. "Why are you here?"

"Just passing by." She looped her arm through his. "Mind if I join you?"

He withdrew his arm and checked his phone.

"Business emergency."

He left without touching his napkin.

Isabella stared at his retreating figure. Suddenly, she hurled her wine glass to the floor.

"Ah!" A server screamed.

Red wine splattered the uniform like bloodstains.

"Shut up!" Isabella snapped.

She grabbed the bottle and poured the remaining contents over the server's head.

Shards of glass scattered.

The server knelt, apologizing profusely.

Isabella's chest heaved. That glaring contact name burned in her vision—

Sweetheart.
###Chapter 68

The words "Precious Darling" burned my eyes.

What an intimate pet name.

I stared at my phone screen, nails digging deep into my palms.

Ethan Roscente had given Sophia Lowell such an affectionate contact name.

My instincts had been right all along.

They'd been carrying on behind my back.

It wasn't just that shameless bitch Sophia throwing herself at him—Ethan had feelings for her too.

The thought of him refusing to even touch me while rolling in bed with Sophia made me tremble with rage.

Sophia Lowell!

You shameless whore!

I'll make sure you pay for this!

Inside the black Maybach, Ethan casually tossed his suit jacket to Zachary Evans.

"Dispose of it."

His long fingers loosened his tie, revealing his Adam's apple.

Zachary winced at the sight of the expensive custom-made suit. The boss's wardrobe attrition rate had skyrocketed lately.

He made a mental note to destroy the garment before reporting, "Mr. Roland said the blueprints were sent to Luming Architectural Studio. They'll send the draft for your review."

During dinner, Felix Roland had left abruptly after a phone call.

Ethan gave a distracted hum, his gaze dropping to his phone.

"Mr. Roscente."

Simon Sherwood's voice came through the line.

Ethan lounged against the leather seat, crossing his long legs.

"Her reaction?"

"Miss Lowell is furious."

The man's lips curved into a faint smile.

"Good."

If she dared to claim they were even, she'd face the consequences.

Either repay the money obediently or stay by his side.

Knowing Sophia, she couldn't possibly produce six million.

He spun the phone between his fingers, waiting for her pleading call.

But by afternoon, all he received was a bank notification.

Six million.

Not a cent less.

Ethan's face darkened instantly.

"Sir..." Zachary ventured nervously, "Miss Lowell texted me."

The man's eyes turned icy. "Read it."

Zachary swallowed hard and forced out the words. "Debt cleared. Hope Mr. Roscente keeps his word and stops clinging like a desperate leech..."

The air in the car froze.

"And?"

Zachary skimmed the string of expletives that followed and wisely skipped them.

"N-nothing else..."

Ethan let out a cold laugh, undoing his top button.

"How impressive."
###Chapter 69

Zachary Evans studied Ethan Roscente's shifting expression before speaking cautiously. "How should we handle this now?"

Ethan's long fingers tapped rhythmically against the desk, a dangerous glint flashing in his eyes. "Follow protocol."

Understanding immediately, Zachary turned to make arrangements.

Outside the CEO's office, Jessica Piente paced with a stack of files. "Where is Mr. Roscente? These documents need his signature."

Sophia Lowell glanced at the empty office, her lips curling into a cold smile. "He's busy accompanying Miss Valentine. No time for company matters."

"How do you know?" Jessica asked, puzzled.

Sophia pointed to Isabella Valentine's vacant seat. "Isn't it obvious?"

She had anticipated Ethan would prioritize Isabella, which was why she'd sent that final message directly to Zachary.

Jessica sighed. "Miss Valentine is so fortunate, born into such a prominent family."

"What do you mean?"

"With her looks, she'd never become the future Mrs. Roscente without that pedigree." Jessica gave Sophia an appraising look. "But you—standing next to Mr. Roscente, you two look like a match made in heaven."

Lowering her voice, she added, "I've always shipped you two."

Sophia's eye twitched. "Some ships can be niche, but this one is just wrong."

"No, no," Jessica said mysteriously. "Shipping everyone keeps my life balanced."

Sophia: "..."

As the workday neared its end, Ethan strode into the office, his presence icy.

He stopped abruptly at Sophia's workstation, his gaze sharp as a blade. "Secretary Lowell. Inside. Now."

From his stormy expression, Sophia knew trouble was coming.

But she was prepared. Calmly, she followed him into the office.

Ethan was flipping through a document, his face dark with fury.

Sophia recognized it as the project proposal Isabella had taken.

"Mr. Roscente." She stood composed before his desk.

He looked up, his piercing stare cutting into her. "Did you prepare this tender proposal?"

"Yes," she admitted without hesitation.

Ethan let out a cold laugh and slammed the file down in front of her. "Leaking company secrets—do you understand the consequences?"

Sophia paled. "I don't know what you're talking about."

To her, his accusation was utterly baffling.

He seized her chin, his grip painfully tight. "Still pretending?"

Sophia tried to pull away, but he only tightened his hold.

"I truly don't understand," she said through gritted teeth.
###Chapter 70

Ethan Roscente's cold laugh cut through the air like a blade.

The hostility radiating from him threatened to tear her apart.

"I underestimated you," he said in a low voice, each word dripping with icy venom. "The Oscars owe you a golden statue."

Sophia Lowell's pupils constricted.

She had no idea what this sudden accusation meant.

Was he trying to back out of their deal?

Just as she opened her mouth to retort, the man abruptly released his grip and turned to Zachary Evans in the corner.

"Tell her," he said, leisurely adjusting his cufflinks, a mocking smirk playing on his lips. "So she can't claim I'm framing an innocent."

Zachary cleared his throat awkwardly.

"Horizon Tech won the bid at 190 million—60 million higher than our offer."

"Impossible!" Sophia blurted. "They're always conservative unless—"

She froze mid-sentence, meeting Ethan's glacial stare.

"You think I leaked the details?"

"Where's your proof?" Her voice trembled.

Ethan lit a cigarette, his sharp gaze piercing through the haze of smoke.

"A 60-million-dollar difference," he exhaled a slow ring. "The exact amount that appeared in your account."

Sophia felt as if she'd been struck by lightning.

Fury and despair churned in her chest before solidifying into cold numbness.

"Isabella Valentine was the last one to handle the proposal," she said, nails digging into her palms. "Why isn't she the suspect?"

"She doesn't need to." Ethan's tone was absolute.

Those words shattered her last shred of hope.

"So poverty is the original sin in your eyes," she laughed bitterly. "You'd rather frame me than question your precious fiancée."

The air turned to ice.

Zachary held his breath, wishing he could melt into the walls.

"Five million yesterday. Ten million today." Ethan stubbed out his cigarette. "Explain."

Sophia's entire body went cold.

"So you believe..." Her voice was feather-light. "I betrayed the company just to cut ties with you?"

The silence was the cruelest answer.
###Chapter 71

Sophia clenched her fists, her nails digging deep into her palms.

"What if I told you this money was mine? Would you believe me?" Her voice trembled.

Ethan Roscente's lips curled into a mocking smirk. "I know exactly what you're worth."

The words stabbed through her heart like a blade.

She swallowed the lump in her throat, straightening her spine. She wouldn't cry—tears would only make her humiliation worse.

A dull ache pulsed in her abdomen. She took a deep breath, forcing down the storm of emotions.

"If you've already decided I'm guilty, then there's nothing left to say."

"Or nothing left to lie about," he countered coldly.

Sophia turned to leave. His icy voice followed her: "Sophia, you were fired for leaking company secrets. This wasn't a resignation."

She paused mid-step, then pushed through the door without looking back.

Outside, colleagues watched with scornful smirks. She kept her expression blank as she returned to her desk and began packing.

Jessica hesitated nearby, but Sophia shook her head subtly.

When the last item was boxed, she lifted the container and walked toward the elevator, her back rigid with resolve.

As the elevator doors closed, Zachary Evans spoke up: "Sir, why didn't you tell Miss Lowell that the family discipline was meant for her? You took the punishment to protect—"

Ethan suddenly doubled over, sweat beading on his forehead.

"Mr. Roscente!"

Zachary caught him, only then noticing the dark stain spreading across the back of his suit jacket. Underneath, his white dress shirt was soaked with blood.

"She'll never know you shielded her from the family discipline," Zachary sighed, tending to the wound.

Ethan pressed his bloodless lips together. "What difference would it make?"

"At least—"

"That heartless woman," Ethan cut him off with a bitter laugh, "would only see it as another excuse to accuse me of harassing her."

The bandage bloomed crimson, mirroring the ruin of his heart.
###Chapter 72

Sophia had just stepped out of the company building when her phone began buzzing violently.

"Sweetheart! Tell me you slammed that stack of cash right in that bastard's face! Did his eyeballs almost pop out?" Vivian's voice exploded through the receiver.

Sophia's tears spilled over instantly, her voice trembling uncontrollably. "Viv..."

A loud clatter came from the other end of the line—a chair toppling over. "Wait, that doesn't sound like happy crying. What's wrong?"

"I got fired..." Sophia clutched her phone so tightly her knuckles turned white.

Vivian's lollipop clattered to the floor. "Send me your location. I'm coming right now!"

Half an hour later, Vivian found Sophia curled up on a bench in the city park.

Her face was as pale as paper, her gaze vacant. Without a word, Vivian bundled her into a taxi.

"Meow~"

The calico cat sauntered over gracefully, rubbing against Sophia's leg.

"Scram!" Vivian grabbed the cat by the scruff and tossed her onto the cat tree before shoving a cup of hot water into Sophia's hands. "What the hell happened? Weren't you supposed to be serving karma today?"

Slumped on the couch, Sophia recounted everything.

"Jesus Christ! Did Ethan Roscente get hit in the head with a door?" Vivian shot to her feet. "He'd rather protect that green-tea bitch than his own dignity? Throwing you under the bus was way too easy for him!"

Sophia gave a bitter laugh. She finally saw the truth—in Ethan's heart, Isabella Valentine would always come first. He didn’t even need proof to sacrifice her without hesitation.

At least she was free now.

"You're just going to take this?" Vivian stomped her foot in frustration.

"What else can I do? Ethan's already made his verdict." Sophia's voice was feather-light.

"That bitch set you up!" Vivian gritted her teeth. "She framed you on purpose!"

Sophia shook her head. "The truth doesn’t matter. What matters is that he chose to believe Isabella."

"This is beyond unfair!" Vivian's eyes reddened as she pulled Sophia into a hug. "You sold your house to pay off debts, and now they're smearing your name? If it were me, I'd drag them down with me!"

"I brought this on myself by getting involved with him in the first place." Sophia buried her face in her hands. "I deserve this."

Vivian rubbed her back soothingly. "Good riddance. There are better men out there. That toxic circle isn’t worth it—we’ll live our best lives without them."

"Yeah. I'll teach, he'll run his empire, and we'll never cross paths again."

"Exactly! We'll raise your kid to be a powerhouse in their field—just to screw with his dad!" Vivian's eyes suddenly lit up. "Then when he's on his deathbed, we'll drop the bomb that it's his biological child. Guaranteed to finish him off!"

Sophia instinctively touched her flat stomach. As satisfying as the revenge fantasy was, all she wanted was for her child to be safe and happy.

"Right now, the priority is making money." She wiped her tears. "I still owe you, and there's the baby's expenses..."

"Don’t even start! Pay me back whenever." Vivian suddenly stared at her belly in concern. "But in your condition... Is working even safe?"
###Chapter 73

Sophia's fingers traced the flat plane of her abdomen, a soft smile curving her lips.

"My college schedule isn't heavy. I'm thinking of finding a part-time job." She glanced up at Vivian. "This stipend won't be enough to raise a child."

"Don't worry!" Vivian thumped her chest. "Your godmother's got you!"

She knew Sophia too well. This stubborn girl would never sit around waiting for handouts.

"Any ideas what you want to do?" Vivian frowned. "You can't overexert yourself now."

"What else am I qualified for besides design?" Sophia chuckled. "I could take on drafting projects. Work from home."

The idea had lingered in her mind for two days.

A way to earn money without letting her skills rust.

"I'll keep an eye out for opportunities," Vivian promised immediately.

After dinner, Vivian insisted on staying overnight. As the sound of running water came from the bathroom, Sophia picked up her phone and posted a status update.

The response came faster than expected.

Theodore Orlando called directly. "Looking for work?" Concern colored her professor's voice.

"Yes, funds are tight," Sophia admitted quietly.

"Are you in trouble?" Theodore's tone sharpened.

"I just want to stay productive." She didn't want her mentor worrying.

A hearty laugh came through the receiver. "That's the spirit of youth!"

"Luming Studio happens to be short-handed," Theodore continued smoothly. "Interested? Market rate compensation."

Sophia's breath caught.

Luming Architectural Studio. The industry benchmark.

"You and Luming...?"

"Co-founded it with friends." Theodore's voice held quiet pride. "When I convinced you to stay at Qing University, I intended to guide you into the field gradually."

Sophia's pulse quickened.

"But I..." She bit her lip. "I have no portfolio..."

"I've seen your thesis project." Theodore's tone brooked no argument. "More than qualified."

Water droplets slid from her hair. Sophia's grip tightened around the phone.
###Chapter 74

"Alright, I'll take on some small projects first." Sophia's fingers tightened slightly around her phone.

Theodore's hearty laughter came through the receiver. "Perfect timing. There's a Republic-era resort design project that would be great practice for you."

"Send the materials to my email. I'll try to finish the first draft before the semester starts."

"Don't rush. You have a week."

Sophia smiled faintly. "I want to prove myself sooner. I can't let your recommendation go to waste."

Theodore sighed. "That stubbornness is exactly like your mother when she was young."

The moment she hung up, an email notification chimed. Sophia opened her laptop—the materials were far more detailed than she'd expected.

Was this really just a small project? Frowning, she called Theodore back.

"It's genuinely the smallest case our firm has right now," he explained. "The overconfident kids turned it down, so I thought of you first."

The blue glow of the screen illuminated Sophia's face as she replied solemnly, "Don't worry, Professor. I'll deliver something you'll be proud of."

After hanging up, she studied the materials three times over. When she reached the third page of reference sketches, inspiration shot down her spine like lightning.

Her pencil flew across the sketchpad as the outlines of Republic-era architecture took shape. Sophia became so absorbed in her work that she didn't even notice Vivian pushing the door open.

"Soph—" Vivian froze in the doorway, towel wrapped around her.

The sweeping eaves and upturned corners on the drafting board made her hold her breath. She tiptoed out and gently closed the door.

At dawn, Vivian reached for the other side of the bed. The cold sheets made her bolt upright—Sophia, who hadn't returned all night, was still bent over her desk in the study.
###Chapter 75

Quill Jagger lay on the cold altar, her gaze unfocused as she watched the man dancing wildly before her.

Seven days and seven nights.

She had witnessed this man battle death itself.

Blair Nash's bloodshot eyes were sunken deep into their sockets, yet his unshaven face glowed with triumph. He pranced around like a child, muttering words no one could understand.

Quill Jagger suddenly remembered the time she had a fever as a child. Her father had kept vigil by her bedside for three days and nights just like this.

"Hey! Say something!" Blair Nash waved a hand in front of her dazed eyes. "Am I amazing or what?"

A weak smile tugged at Quill Jagger's lips. "The great Physician Nash works miracles. Even the King of Hell would flee at the sight of you."

"That mouth of yours..." Blair Nash glared but couldn't suppress a chuckle.

He turned and called toward the cave entrance, "Han Jiang!"

Footsteps approached. Han Jiang arrived with  Maya Bryth and Jade Orchard in tow.

 Maya Bryth wore a beige camisole today, her long legs bare beneath denim shorts. Her eyes darted around before settling on Quill Jagger's flat stomach.

"This can't be..."  Maya Bryth gasped.

There should have been a fatal wound there.

"Stop overreacting." Blair Nash waved her off. "Get her to the Seeress now."

 Maya Bryth studied Blair Nash for a long moment before saying, "Chief Cabinet minister wants to see you."

"Later." He didn't look up. "After I repair the spiritual meridians."

Jade Orchard stepped forward silently, tucking the blankets around Quill Jagger with practiced ease. The girl had been delivering meals these past days, handling her as gently as fragile porcelain.

Quill Jagger suddenly grabbed Blair Nash's wrist.

"What?" He frowned.

"Thank you." Her voice was soft but clear.

Blair Nash blinked, then grinned. "Just remember to pay the bill."

As the stretcher lifted her, Quill Jagger took one last look at the man who had saved her life. Sunlight streamed through cracks in the cave ceiling, gilding him in gold.

For the first time, she truly felt how good it was to be alive.
###Chapter 76
Vivian tucked the blanket around Sophia with a slight frown. "I'm running late for the commercial shoot. Rest well, and call me if you need anything."

Sophia kept her eyes closed, her voice feather-light. "Go ahead. Be careful on the road."

"Leaving now."

"Mmm..."

Before the last syllable faded, Sophia had already drifted into sleep.

Vivian's lips curved upward as the doorbell chimed. Her assistant had arrived to take her to the set. She grabbed her bag and hurried out.

The bedroom returned to silence. A breeze lifted the sheer curtains, making sunlight dance across the floor. The figure on the bed breathed evenly, as if detached from the world.

Sophia didn't wake until sunset. She sat on the edge of the bed, disoriented between dawn and dusk. Splashing cold water on her face brought some clarity.

After a simple bowl of egg noodles, she stretched her stiff neck and returned to her computer. Her workaholic nature couldn't tolerate unfinished design drafts.

By the time she made the final stroke, city lights glittered outside. She hesitated over sending the file to her mentor when her phone vibrated.

"Sophia! Why did Ethan Roscente fire you?" Emily's shrill voice pierced her eardrum. "What did you do wrong at the company?"

Fresh from her overseas trip, Emily had walked straight into sarcastic remarks from the third branch. Those words cut like knives, leaving her restless.

Old wounds reopened. Sophia's fingers trembled, but her voice remained eerily calm. "Getting fired doesn't matter. I never wanted to stay."

"Are you insane?" Emily's pitch rose. "Throwing away a golden opportunity to chase some designer dream like your mother? How much can that even pay?"

Tears welled up as Sophia clenched her phone. "Don't talk about Mom like that! This is our dream!"

"Foolish child..." Emily's tone softened. "I just don't want history repeating itself. Over one design draft back then... You're the last of the Lowells."

"Every day at Roscente Group felt like prison." Sophia gave a bitter smile. "Now I'm finally free."

"With Ethan protecting you, who would dare bully you?" Emily refused to believe it. "This is just your stubbornness!"

Sophia never shared the covert battles in the executive office with her aunt. Now she only felt the irony. "Think what you want. I've already found a new job."

Silence stretched before Emily sighed. "That obstinacy... exactly like your mother."
###Chapter 77

"What kind of job?" Emily's voice suddenly rose.

"Seattle University offered me a teaching position."

Silence lingered for two seconds before Emily gasped. "Professor Theodore's offer?"

Sophia gave a quiet "Mm." Theodore had indeed mentioned it last month.

"You're going back to Seattle?" Emily's tone turned tense.

"I'll intern at the branch campus for three months first." Sophia's fingers absently traced the edge of the table. "I'll decide after that."

"Wait!" Emily suddenly perked up. "If you marry and settle down in New York, you could stay, right?"

Sophia's temple throbbed. Here we go again.

"Stop fantasizing," she cut in firmly. "This is temporary. My goal is further studies."

A scoff came through the line. "Still dreaming of being a designer?"

Sophia pressed her lips together.

"Fine, you've grown wings." Emily sighed. "Come to the manor tonight to try on new clothes. I brought the latest collection."

Warmth flickered in Sophia's chest. "I haven't even opened the last batch you bought."

"I don't care!" Emily huffed. "Dressing you up increases your chances of landing a wealthy husband. I'd benefit too."

"Rich men are rarely decent."

"Your uncle is wonderful."

Sophia snorted but ultimately gave in to Emily's relentless pestering.

Night draped the sky in ink.

By the time Sophia entered the manor, it was nearly ten. Laughter spilled from the main hall, reminding her it was the Roscentes' monthly family gathering.

Since the patriarch had explicitly banned her attendance, no one bothered to inform her.

At least it was peaceful.

She detoured through the back garden but froze mid-step near the peace lilies.

"A billion-dollar loss, and all they got was termination?" The patriarch's voice was stern.

"The investigation proved Isabella leaked the data." Ethan's tone remained steady. "Sophia took the blame."

"Isabella?" The patriarch sounded startled.

"Horizon's people manipulated her into handing over the files."

After a pause, the patriarch sighed. "Youth makes one careless. Let it rest, then."

His tone shifted. "Still, Sophia bears responsibility for entrusting such a critical project to a novice."

"I understand," Ethan replied.

The night wind swept through, chilling Sophia to the bone.

So he knew everything.

To protect Isabella, he'd let her shoulder the disgrace.

How ironic. That project had been forcibly taken by Isabella—with his explicit approval.
###Chapter 78

Sophia clenched her fists, her nails digging deep into her palms.

She should have known.

Yet hearing Ethan Roscente admit it still felt like a dull knife slicing through her heart.

"Miss Lowell."

A servant's voice snapped her out of her thoughts.

She turned abruptly, meeting Ethan's icy gaze.

The teacup hit the stone table with a sharp clink.

Mr. Roscente Sr. narrowed his eyes. "Does your back still hurt?"

Ethan's knuckles turned white. "It's nothing."

"You're protective as ever." The old man scoffed. "Taking lashes for some girl. Pathetic."

Ethan's throat moved. "With Fourth Brother gone, someone has to look after her."

He paused. "Increase Fourth Sister-in-law's monthly allowance by a hundred thousand."

The old man waved a dismissive hand, his eyes lingering on Ethan's finger. "That ring..."

The plain band gleamed coldly under the sunlight.

"It's comfortable." Ethan twisted it absently.

"Ridiculous!" Mr. Roscente slammed the table. "With your wedding approaching, how dare you wear that!"

Ethan stood, his shadow swallowing half the table. "I have business at the company."

As his tall figure disappeared, the old man stared into his tea, lost in thought.

"Are you worried about the Ninth Young Master?" the butler asked, pouring more tea.

"The wolf cub has grown." The teacup reflected his clouded eyes. "I can't read him anymore."

The butler chuckled. "As long as he can steer the Roscente family, that's enough."

Sophia burst into the annex to find Emily Laurent frowning at her tablet.

"Where's the Marriage Pledge your uncle gave you?" Emily suddenly asked.

"Upstairs, probably." Sophia popped a cherry into her mouth. "I threw it away ages ago."

A servant soon returned with the gilded document.

Emily's fingertip hovered over a line—then her pupils constricted.

"So this is why Daniel Clementson died."

Sophia knocked over the fruit bowl with a crash.

"What?!"
###Chapter 79

"Read it yourself." Emily Laurent shoved her phone forward. "The 'Perfect Match' legend—the young lover died tragically. Your uncle wrote this Marriage Pledge for you and Daniel Clementson, then Daniel had his accident soon after. The parallels are uncanny."

Sophia Lowell rolled her eyes. "As if Uncle could predict the future."

"Even if he couldn't, he clearly didn't approve of your relationship." Emily's tone was final.

Sophia's fingers stilled. The cold smile returned as she recalled the conversation she'd overheard earlier. "He wouldn't waste time on such trivial matters."

"Trivial?" Emily snatched back the parchment. "This is bad luck. Burn it and rewrite it."

"Stop bothering him." Sophia frowned.

"I'm his sister-in-law. Why would it be a bother?" Emily waved her off, then paused, eyeing the fruit platter. "Wait—you love lychees. Why only cherries today?"

Sophia looked down. Over half the cherries were gone.

She'd researched it weeks ago—lychees were unsafe during pregnancy.

"Too much heat lately," she lied.

"I'll ask Margaret to make hasma soup."

"No need. We're leaving after the fitting."

Emily huffed and led her to the bedroom.

Sophia gasped at the designer pieces strewn across the bed. "How did you afford all this?"

"Found a lucrative opportunity." Emily twirled her diamond ring smugly.

"What business earns two million in two days?" Sophia paled. "This isn't some scam, is it?"

"Ridiculous!" Emily snapped. "Plenty of society wives invested. What could go wrong?"

"Money doesn't fall from the sky."

"I put in my emergency funds—of course I did my research." Emily shoved past her. "I buy you gifts, and this is the thanks I get?"

Sophia grabbed her wrist. "Aunt Emily, I just don't want you cheated."

"Cheated how?" Emily wrenched free. "Worst case, I lose a few million. I can handle that."
###Chapter 80

Sophia's brow relaxed slightly as her fingertips tapped lightly on the book cover. "There's no such thing as a free lunch. You should be more cautious."

"Ugh, you're so annoying!" Emily flung the new dress onto the bed. "You ruined what should've been a happy occasion. I never should've invited you back!"

Sophia closed the book, her gaze sweeping over the luxury shopping bags strewn across the bed. She stood to leave, pausing briefly to glance at the six-figure dress.

The night was deep, the Roscente estate garden alive with the hum of insects. As Sophia turned the corner, a strong hand yanked her into the rose bushes. She instinctively raised her elbow to strike—then froze at the familiar scent of cedarwood.

"Three days of avoiding me." Ethan's thumb traced the pulse at her wrist. "Finally decided to show yourself?"

Sophia jerked her hand back, only for him to lock an arm around her waist, crushing her against him. Rose thorns scraped her bare calves, sending shivers down her spine.

"Let go!" she hissed. "If the old man sees—"

Ethan chuckled, warm breath grazing the shell of her ear. "Scared?" He nipped at her flushed earlobe. "Isn't sneaking around more exciting?"

Moonlight filtered through the blossoms, casting dappled shadows across his sharp features. Sophia caught the dangerous glint in his eyes—her heart skipped a beat.

"Disgusting," she muttered, turning her face away.

Ethan gripped her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. His thumb dragged roughly over her lips. "This mouth..." His eyes darkened. "Needs to be silenced."

Before she could retort, his lips sealed over hers. The heady mix of roses and his commanding presence overwhelmed her. Her fingers twisted in his shirt, nails nearly piercing the fabric.

Footsteps approached in the distance.

Ethan didn't pull away. Instead, he cradled the back of her head, deepening the kiss. Only when the steps halted five meters away did he finally release her.

"Go on," he taunted, licking his lips. "Keep scolding me."

Trembling with rage, Sophia aimed a kick at his knee. He anticipated it, pinning her against the ivy-covered wall.

"Twelve million," he murmured, lips brushing her ear. "Plus yesterday's six..."

She went rigid. Under the moonlight, she watched him leisurely undo his cufflinks, his gaze simmering with a threat she knew too well.

"Care to test me?" His low laugh sent a chill down her spine. "How much is this one worth?"
###Chapter 81

Sophia gasped as Ethan pinned her against the stone wall, the impact sending a sharp pain through her lower back.

Her eyes widened as his scorching lips claimed hers. This madman—how dare he ambush her at the Roscente estate!

She clenched her fists, pounding against his chest, but he effortlessly trapped her wrists above her head with one hand. His other hand gripped her waist with bruising force.

"Mmph—!"

Sophia twisted her face away, only for him to seize her chin and force her back. His hot breath fanned her skin as his tongue invaded her mouth.

Footsteps approached in the distance.

"Where did Ethan go?" Isabella's saccharine voice drew nearer.

Sophia froze, her nails digging into Ethan's arm. But he only tightened his hold, lifting her fully against the rough stone.

"Grandfather, watch your step." Isabella's voice chirped as she guided Mr. Roscente Sr. around the corner.

Terror shot through Sophia, but Ethan held her immobile. He nipped her earlobe, his voice a dark rasp. "Scared?"

The footsteps were almost upon them.

Sophia squeezed her eyes shut—until Isabella shrieked, "Snake!"

"Where?" Mr. Roscente's voice sharpened.

"It—it slithered away!" Isabella stammered. "Let's head back, Grandfather."

The footsteps receded.

Sophia's back was drenched in cold sweat. She shoved Ethan away, her legs buckling beneath her.

He caught her waist, thumb brushing her swollen lips. "That nervous?"

"You're insane!" Her voice shook. "If your grandfather had seen—"

"So what?" Ethan's eyes darkened as he wiped her damp lower lip. "Who dares question what belongs to me?"

Sophia trembled with rage. "Isabella definitely saw us!"

"And?" He laughed coldly, suddenly hoisting her up. "Would she dare breathe a word?"

Sophia's arms instinctively circled his neck, her feet dangling. The position made her ears burn with humiliation. "Put me down!"

Instead, Ethan bit her throat. "You weren't complaining earlier."

"You—" Sophia stiffened mid-sentence.

Hidden behind nearby bushes, Isabella clenched her fists until her nails drew blood. She watched Ethan press Sophia against the tree, his muscular frame engulfing her smaller body.

The untouchable Ethan Roscente—reduced to a reckless youth in this woman's arms.

Isabella's teeth sank into her lip, copper flooding her mouth. She retreated silently, venom flashing in her eyes.

Enjoy this while it lasts, Sophia.

"Focus." Ethan pinched Sophia's waist in warning.

She startled, realizing her blouse had ridden up to her chest. She grabbed his wandering hand. "Ethan!"

He chuckled darkly. "Calling for an audience?"

Sophia immediately fell silent, glaring at him with red-rimmed eyes.

Ethan's gaze turned predatory—then he abruptly released her. "Get out."

Sophia stumbled, bewildered, as he shoved her away. Adjusting his cuffs, he resumed his usual icy demeanor—as if the man who'd ravaged her mouth moments ago never existed.

"Need an invitation to leave?" His mocking tone cut deep.

Clutching her crumpled clothes, Sophia fled without looking back.

Ethan watched her retreat, his expression unreadable. He swiped his thumb across his lips, still tasting her sweetness.

From the shadows, Isabella lowered her phone, having captured everything. She dialed a number, her voice venomous. "Move the timeline up. I want Sophia Lowell ruined."
###Chapter 82

The night deepened. Ethan Roscente pinned Sophia Lowell against the wall, his heated breath grazing her neck.

He inhaled the delicate fragrance of her hair, his Adam's apple bobbing. "Don't move," he murmured. "Let me hold you for a while."

Sophia's spine stiffened.

This man knew exactly how to unravel her.

Under the moonlight, their entwined shadows stretched long across the ground. Only after what felt like an eternity did Ethan reluctantly release her.

His fingers traced her flushed cheek. A low chuckle escaped him. "If only you'd been this obedient sooner."

Slap.

Sophia swatted his hand away. Adjusting her disheveled collar, her voice turned glacial. "Do this again, Mr. Roscente, and I'll call the police."

Ethan took half a step back. Moonlight carved his sharp features into something predatory. "Throw me away after using me?" His lips curled. "You really do change moods faster than flipping a page."

Sophia lifted her gaze, frost crystallizing in her eyes. "What do you think would happen if your grandfather saw us like this?"

"I can—"

"You can what?" she cut in sharply. "Like when you made me take the fall for Isabella Valentine? Toss me out as the scapegoat again?"

A sudden gust of wind scattered the loose strands of hair across her forehead.

"To you, I'm just a plaything. Something to amuse yourself with when you're bored, then discard when you're done." Her voice trembled. "Why drag me into this? Because I'm an easy target?"

Ethan's eyes darkened.

"You heard?" His tone dropped dangerously.

Sophia laughed bitterly. "Should I keep pretending? Who is Isabella Valentine? Not even the Valentine family's illegitimate children could dethrone her. Do you really think she'd be stupid enough to leak confidential information?"

"Proof?" Ethan's expression remained unreadable.

"Proof?" Her laugh was hollow. "The evidence you demand only ever applies to me."

She retreated two steps. The moonlight washed her face pale.

"But this time is different." Each word fell like a blade. "If Isabella ever falls into my hands, I won't show mercy."

As she turned, her tears finally hit the pavement.

Ethan reached out—but caught nothing but the night wind.

Frustrated, he yanked at his tie and dialed a number.

Outside the estate, Sophia stared up at the moon.

Her ride was late.

"Miss Lowell." A black Maybach pulled up. Zachary Evans rolled down the window. "Mr. Roscente asked me to take you home."

Sophia kept scrolling through her phone, as if she hadn't heard.
###Chapter 83

Sophia stood by the roadside, clutching her bag, refusing to even glance at the man beside her.

Zachary remained rooted in place like a wooden post.

"Stand there till the end of time, for all I care," she sneered.

The ride-hail car arrived punctually. Sophia yanked the door open and slammed it shut with a force that echoed through the quiet street.

Zachary rubbed his temples. Every time these two clashed, he was the one caught in the crossfire.

Watching the car disappear, he dialed Ethan Roscente's number.

"Mr. Roscente, Ms. Lowell has left."

A brief acknowledgment came through before the call ended.

Ethan pocketed his phone and turned to Isabella Valentine. "I'll arrange a driver for you."

"Aren't you coming with me?" Her eyes shimmered with unshed tears.

His expression remained indifferent. "I have a meeting."

She bit her lip, hesitating before probing further. "You and Sophia—"

Ethan lit a cigarette, his gaze sharp through the smoke. "Watch your tongue."

"This isn't fair!" Her voice trembled.

"Fair?" He scoffed. "Need I remind you how the Valentines secured this engagement? Touch Sophia again, and after what happened with Voyager Tech, your sister can take your place."

Isabella paled, tears spilling over. "Understood..."

Ethan exhaled a smoke ring. "Leave."

As her retreating figure vanished, he stubbed out his cigarette and headed home.

Passing a four-story building, he paused. Margaret was tossing something into a brazier—flames briefly illuminated the words "Marriage Pledge."

"A perfect match, a blessed union..." His lips curved slightly.

A masterstroke indeed.

Back in his study, Ethan called Sophia. The familiar automated voicemail greeted him—blocked again.

Gazing at the moon outside, his eyes darkened.

The next morning, Sophia jolted awake to her phone's shrill ringtone.

"Sophia! Check the trending hashtags!" Vivian's voice exploded through the speaker. "Isabella's image is crumbling!"

"What?" Sophia sat up groggily.

"A video of her bullying a waitress just went viral!" Vivian rushed on. "Dumping wine on someone's head, forcing them to kneel—it's all crystal clear! The internet's tearing her apart while her fans stay silent. Glorious!"
###Chapter 84

"Karma's a bitch!" Vivian Ashcroft's excited voice exploded through the phone. "Let's see how she wriggles out of this one. Hope she crashes and burns!"

Sophia Lowell shook her head softly.

She walked to the balcony and refilled Calico's food bowl. Her fingers brushed across the tablet screen—Isabella Valentine's scandal still dominated the trending topics.

"The Valentines will protect her."

"Because of the Roscentes?" Vivian caught on immediately.

"The Roscentes won't accept a disgraced daughter-in-law." Sophia's fingertip paused on a deleted headline. "No matter how much Old Mr. Roscente favors her, it's the Valentine name he values."

Vivian deflated. "But the video's everywhere. Can they really spin this?"

"Ethan Roscente has his ways." Sophia chuckled. "It's just a question of how much he's willing to spend."

A string of curses erupted from the other end. "Perfect match—a cheating bastard and a scheming bitch. May they rot together!"

Sophia laughed.

Background noise crackled through the line. She suddenly asked, "You're off today?"

"Up for a date, gorgeous?" Vivian's tone turned playful.

"I want to check out some baby stores."

Half an hour later, Vivian barged in carrying breakfast.

"Isn't it too early for shopping?" She eyed Sophia's flat stomach.

Sophia's hand drifted unconsciously to her abdomen. "Just... wanted to look."

Vivian clutched a pair of pink socks and suddenly clasped her hands together. "Please let this be a grateful child! If it's here to collect debts, send it to its father!"

Sophia laughed, picking up tiny shoes. "What about these?"

A shrill ringtone cut through the moment.

Vivian froze, staring at her screen.

"The police?" Sophia frowned. "Why would they call you?"

"Probably a scam." Vivian hovered her thumb over the answer button, hesitating.
###Chapter 85

Her fingers trembled as the call abruptly ended.

Sophia stood frozen in place.

Vivian Ashcroft might be the first person bold enough to hang up on the police.

Her phone vibrated again—same police station number flashing on the screen.

This time, Vivian answered.

The voice on the other end made her pupils constrict.

After hanging up, she shakily tapped Isabella Valentine’s name trending on the hot search list.

The screen’s glow cast shadows across her ashen face.

"What’s wrong?" Sophia steadied her swaying figure.

"I’ve been set up." Vivian clenched her phone, knuckles whitening. "That video of Isabella… I leaked it using a burner account."

She rushed to explain: "Someone anonymously sent me that bullying footage. I was furious and posted it without thinking."

"Now her team released behind-the-scenes clips claiming it was just acting. The waitress retracted her statement too."

"The entire internet is condemning the ‘rumormonger.’ The police have already traced my IP…"

Sophia sucked in a sharp breath.

Realization struck instantly: "Why would the tipster contact you?"

"It was a trap!" Vivian pulled up the burner account’s profile. "This page has zero followers. How could it possibly trend?"

Everything clicked into place.

From the anonymous tip to the public backlash—every step was meticulously orchestrated.

Isabella didn’t just clear her name; she gained public sympathy.

Meanwhile, Vivian faced legal consequences.

Sophia suddenly remembered the shadowy figure in the garden last night. A chill crawled up her spine.

This scheme’s real target was her.

Isabella had witnessed her intimacy with Ethan Roscente but chose to strike at Vivian instead.

"I’m so sorry…" Sophia’s voice shook.

Vivian slammed her fist on the table. "That bitch! Couldn’t touch you, so she came after me!"

She raked fingers through her tangled hair in frustration: "I should’ve gone to the restaurant to secure evidence first…"

Even now, she blamed herself for failing to protect her best friend.

Sophia’s eyes burned as she pulled Vivian into a fierce embrace. "I’m the one who should apologize."
###Chapter 86

"Stop crying! It's all that bitch's scheme!" Vivian Ashcroft wiped her tears angrily, her voice dripping with venom. "I lost this round, but next time I'll tear her mouth apart!"

The glass door burst open. Two uniformed officers strode into the maternity shop, their sharp gazes scanning the room.

"Which one of you is Vivian Ashcroft?" The lead officer flashed his badge. "You've been accused of spreading false information online, constituting defamation."

Sophia Lowell's heart lurched. Instinctively, she stepped in front of her friend. "Officer, there must be some misunderstanding—"

"Save it for the station." The cop brushed past her and snapped handcuffs onto Vivian's wrists.

"Sophia!" Vivian turned in panic.

"Interfere and you're coming too," the officer warned sharply.

Sophia could only watch as her best friend was led away, the whispers of onlookers buzzing in her ears. She grabbed her purse and chased after them, but reached the mall entrance just in time to see the police car speed off.

A taxi screeched to a halt outside the precinct. Sophia barely had time to exit before Isabella Valentine emerged gracefully from a luxury van.

The A-list actress had tears streaking her perfect makeup—yet the moment she turned the corner, she flashed Sophia a triumphant smirk. "How does it feel to steal Ethan Roscente? Enjoying my little gift?"

Sophia's nails dug into her palms. "Leave her out of this!"

"Impatient?" Isabella examined her manicure. "Your friend walked right into the trap. Heard she just landed a new role?" She leaned closer, her whisper venomous. "Imagine what a criminal record would do..."

"What do you want?" Sophia's voice trembled.

Isabella's red lips curved. "Either confess to her crimes and go to jail, or..." Her contemptuous gaze swept over Sophia. "Guess even plastic friendships have limits."

"Is Ms. Valentine here yet?" a voice called from inside the station.

Instantly, Isabella transformed back into a pitiable victim, strutting inside on stilettos. Over her shoulder, she drew a finger across her throat in a silent threat.

###Chapter 87

Commotion erupted at the police station entrance.

Isabella Valentine strutted in on stilettos, deliberately ramming her shoulder into Sophia Lowell as she passed.

Sophia staggered back, clutching her rounded belly to steady herself.

"Ms. Lowell?"

A gentle male voice came from behind.

Sebastian Valdemar, dressed in beige casual wear with an elite-looking lawyer in tow, hurried forward to steady her. "Careful."

"Thank you." Sophia recognized him as the man who'd saved her at the hospital. "Mr. Valdemar, what brings you here?"

"Handling a minor incident." His gaze swept over her pale complexion. "You don't look well."

She forced a smile. "A friend's in some trouble."

Inside the interrogation room, Vivian Ashcroft slammed the table. "This is a setup!"

Isabella's assistant sneered. "Officer, she's utterly unrepentant."

"We have new evidence." Sophia pushed the door open and slapped a file on the table. "The person who sent Vivian that video has been found."

Isabella's face drained of color.

Sebastian's lawyer stepped forward. "I'm the legal director of Valdemar Group. This case appears to have discrepancies."

The officer took the file, his brow furrowing as he read.

Vivian lifted her chin triumphantly. "Now you see who's lying?"

Isabella shot to her feet, nails digging into her palms. She hadn't anticipated this wildcard.

Sophia exchanged a glance with Sebastian.

Outside, the setting sun stretched their shadows long across the pavement.
###Chapter 88

Sophia had contacted Vivian's hacker friend on her way to the police station to trace the video's origin.

The person who provided the footage had already been located and was en route.

Once they arrived, Vivian's innocence would be proven.

Isabella hadn't expected Sophia to turn the tables. Her eyes darkened with fury.

"Even if she was used, the damage is done!" Isabella's voice trembled. "The cyberbullying, the insults—I couldn't sleep at night..."

Her face was pale, fingers clutching the hem of her shirt.

The officers exchanged sympathetic glances.

Sophia smirked.

If only this acting talent had been used on-screen, she'd have won an Oscar by now.

"Ms. Valentine claimed the video was from a film shoot," Sophia said coolly. "But your next project hasn't even started. You're still working at Roscente Holdings."

Isabella stiffened.

"If it was for a film, the production team would have the raw footage." Sophia pressed forward. "If not, then you were bullying that waitress at the restaurant."

She tilted her head. "Unless, of course, you plan to have your fiancé twist the truth again—just like last time."

"Mr. Roscente."

A voice sounded at the door.

Sophia turned. Ethan stood there, his gaze icy.

Her pulse jumped, but she steadied herself.

"Reinforcements have arrived," she said dryly. "Let the performance begin."

Ethan's lips curled. "Commissioner Chen, since when does this station allow criminals to argue their case?"

The commissioner wiped his brow. "We'll wrap this up immediately!"

The officers snapped to attention.

Sophia's stomach dropped.

Ethan's presence had shifted the momentum entirely.

Isabella rushed to his side. "Ethan, I was so scared..."

Vivian mimed gagging.

Ethan's eyes turned glacial. "Control her mouth."

"She's just expressing an opinion." Sophia didn't back down. "Feeling sensitive, Mr. Roscente?"

Their locked stares turned the air frigid.

An officer checked his watch. "When is that witness arriving?"
###Chapter 89

Sophia's fingers trembled as she pulled out her phone. "I'll contact the witness right now."

The call went through, but no one answered.

She redialed stubbornly. The endless busy tone hammered against her chest like a series of brutal blows.

"What's going on?" The officer frowned.

Sophia's face turned deathly pale. "The witness... suddenly disappeared..."

"Are you playing games with us?" The officer's expression darkened instantly.

Sophia's eyes reddened with desperation. "There really is a witness! I—" She suddenly looked up, her gaze sharp as a blade as it pierced Ethan. "You did this!"

No one else could have cut off her escape route so quickly.

Ethan remained indifferent, his entire being radiating icy detachment. He turned to Chief Chen. "Handle this according to the law. Those who do wrong must pay the price."

His words were a dagger, plunging straight into Sophia's heart.

"Understood, understood." Chief Chen nodded repeatedly. "We'll enforce the law impartially."

Isabella tugged at Ethan's sleeve with feigned concern. "Ethan, maybe we should just let this go..."

"No need." Ethan's cold gaze swept over Sophia's defiant face. "Some people don't deserve sympathy." He signaled to his assistant. "Escort Miss Valentine out."

Isabella lingered reluctantly. "Don't take too long."

Ethan gave a noncommittal hum before locking eyes with Sophia's furious glare. "Not satisfied?"

"You're protecting her at the cost of justice?" Sophia clenched her fists.

"Since when have you ever believed I cared about justice?" His lips curled in mockery.

Sophia took a step forward. "This was all Isabella's scheme!"

"Using a necklace worth millions as bait?" Ethan scoffed. "Do you think she's a fool? Or—" His eyes hardened. "Is this your way of getting back at her?"

"That's absurd!" Sophia trembled with rage. "Why would I do that?"

"Why?" He advanced on her step by step. "Who was it that swore last night to make her pay? Now that your plan has backfired, you want to shift the blame?"
###Chapter 90

Sophia's chest heaved violently, her nails digging deep into her palms.

She never imagined this man could twist the truth so shamelessly.

"We're talking about Vivian," she forced out through gritted teeth, voice trembling. "Don't try to pin this on me."

Ethan's dark eyes took in her shaking form. The gaze that once held affection now burned with hatred.

"And if I do?" His lips curled into a cold smile. "Keep causing trouble, and I'll have you locked up too."

Sophia raised her hand to slap him.

He caught her wrist roughly, his hot breath scorching her ear. "Fighting me won't help. You'd better think about how to beg. Crushing your friend is easier than stepping on an ant."

The blatant threat made her eyes redden.

"Ethan Roscente, you're despicable."

He released her and sat down leisurely. The click of his lighter echoed as smoke curled around his dangerously handsome face.

"Your friend's life is in your hands now." He exhaled a smoke ring. "Sophia, you know what choice to make."

"Don't beg him, Soph!" Vivian struggled against her chair restraints. "I'd rather rot in jail than see you humiliated by these bastards!"

She spat at Ethan, "Come at me if you dare, Roscente! Hurt one hair on Sophia's head, and I'll chop you into dog food!"

Ethan laughed instead of getting angry.

"Spunky." He stood, his chair scraping loudly against the floor. "Let's see how long that lasts."

As he turned to leave, Sophia rushed after him.

"Sophia!" Vivian shouted desperately. "I'd serve a life sentence before watching you bow to him!"

Sophia froze mid-step, brows furrowed. "But I can't just watch you—"

Before finishing, she bolted out the door.

The black Maybach sped off, leaving only acrid exhaust fumes behind.

Sophia stood rooted, nails drawing blood from her palms.

"Miss Lowell?"

A gentle male voice came from behind. She turned, forcing a smile. "Mr. Valdemar."

Sebastian's gaze flickered over her red-rimmed eyes before scanning the empty police station hallway. "Trouble with your friend?"

"She might go to prison." Her voice cracked.

Sebastian exchanged a look with the lawyer beside him.

"Would you share the details?" he asked kindly. "Perhaps we can help."

Spotting the attorney's badge, hope flickered in Sophia's eyes as she explained the situation.

The lawyer frowned. "It's complicated unless the plaintiff withdraws charges."

Withdraw? That would mean begging Ethan again.

"Can she be bailed out first?" Sebastian asked.

Sophia looked at the lawyer expectantly.

"Theoretically, yes." He nodded.

But the police's response shattered that hope—no bail allowed.

There was no doubt who pulled the strings behind this.

Ethan was determined to force her surrender.
###Chapter 91

Sebastian Valdemar's expression darkened. "I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help."

"Don't blame yourself." Sophia Lowell clenched her fists. "This is all their underhanded tactics."

She took a deep breath. "Still, thank you. At least Vivian is safer inside now."

The only option left was to beg Ethan Roscente.

Sophia left the police station and immediately called Vivian's hacker friend.

"Any leads?"

"Gone without a trace." The hacker's voice was grim. "Like they vanished into thin air."

Sophia's fingers turned cold.

Only Ethan had the power to make someone disappear like this in New York.

He knew exactly how much Vivian meant to her.

Her phone burned in her palm as she shakily unblocked his number.

Ring—

No answer.

She tried again. Still nothing.

Sophia scoffed. So he wanted to make her sweat.

She dialed Zachary Evans instead.

"Ms. Lowell?" Zachary sounded surprised.

"Where's Ethan?"

In the office, Ethan slammed a file onto his desk.

Zachary swallowed hard. "Mr. Roscente is... in a meeting."

"It's urgent."

Through the glass, Zachary saw Ethan's stormy expression.

"Perhaps you could come to the office?"

A humorless laugh. "I'd rather not be framed again."

Zachary's forehead beaded with sweat.

So she hadn't forgotten last time.

"Then... would you wait at Bayview Residences?"

Silence stretched for several seconds.

"Fine."

Hanging up, Sophia gripped the steering wheel.

Bayview Residences.

The home they'd once shared.

"Mr. Roscente, Ms. Lowell said—"

The office door swung open, nearly hitting Zachary.

"Get in."

The last department manager stumbled out, pale-faced.

"Assistant Zhou..." His voice trembled. "What's wrong with Mr. Roscente today?"

Zachary forced a smile. "Project complications, perhaps?"

The manager wiped his brow and fled.

"Zachary!"

The roar from inside sent pitying looks from colleagues.

Steeling himself, Zachary pushed the door open. "You called, sir?"
###Chapter 92

Ethan Roscente tapped his slender fingers twice on the document. A dark glint flashed in his eyes as he looked up.

"Flight tickets booked?"

Zachary Evans' nerves tightened again. "Not yet..."

"Do it now." Ethan closed the folder. "Departure in two hours."

Zachary fumbled for his phone, fingers flying across the screen. He stole a glance at his boss's cold profile, his Adam's apple bobbing.

"Mr. Roscente, what about Miss Sophia..."

Ethan stood, adjusting his cufflinks. The metal gleamed cold under the light. "Let her wait."

Zachary's heart skipped a beat.

Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, dusk deepened. Ethan stood before the glass, his tense jawline reflected in the pane.

"Bring all the project reports," he said abruptly.

Zachary hurried to comply but paused when he heard an almost imperceptible sigh behind him.

"Tell her..." Ethan hesitated. "I'll be back tonight."

Zachary brightened, ready to respond, only to be cut off by an icy addendum: "If I make it in time."

As the black sedan sped toward the airport, Zachary caught Ethan checking his watch for the third time in the rearview mirror. The ticking of the second hand echoed sharply in the silent car.

"Faster," Ethan snapped.

The driver accelerated. Zachary gripped his seatbelt. He glimpsed his boss's phone lighting up before going dark—the caller ID clearly displayed "Sophia."

Ethan stared at the blackened screen, his knuckles whitening.

"Mr. Roscente, should we—"

"Focus on driving," Ethan interrupted, but his grip on the phone tightened.

When the boarding announcement echoed through the terminal, Zachary noticed Ethan lingering at security.

"Mr. Roscente?"

Ethan suddenly turned. "Change the flight."

Zachary's eyes widened. "But the Denver project—"

"Let Liu Ming handle it." Ethan strode back toward the exit. "Get the car."

Rain poured in sheets on the return trip. The windshield wipers thrashed wildly, failing to clear Ethan's increasingly stormy expression.

Bayview Residences blazed with light. Rain dripped from Ethan's hair as he stepped out of the car.

The living room was empty when he pushed open the door.

"Miss Sophia waited four hours," the butler murmured. "She just left."

Ethan loosened his tie. Water droplets splattered against the marble floor. His gaze fixed on the cold teacup on the coffee table before he snatched up his keys.

"Mr. Roscente! There's a typhoon—"

Before the warning could finish, the black sedan vanished into the downpour.

At the intersection, a red light glared. Ethan slammed the brakes. Through the rain-streaked windshield, a familiar figure crossed the street under an umbrella.

He threw open the door and charged into the storm.

"Sophia!"

The figure whirled around. Rain streamed down Ethan's brow as he seized her icy wrist.

"We need to talk."
###Chapter 93

Ethan Roscente's fingers hovered over the keyboard. He slowly lifted his gaze.

"Did she bribe you?"

Zachary Evans swallowed hard, sweat beading on his back.

"Mr. Roscente, I wouldn't dare—"

"Then why are you speaking for her?" The pen twirled between his fingers. "Who signs your paycheck?"

Zachary pressed his forehead against the file folder, his voice shrinking. "I'm just worried about your health... You've been losing your temper too often lately..."

The office plunged into silence.

Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, dusk settled, casting a dark gold hue over the man's sharp轮廓.

"Noted."

Ethan abruptly stood, draping his suit jacket over his arm. Before Zachary could react, the private elevator's down button lit up.

The entire executive floor fell deathly quiet.

Secretaries exchanged glances—had the sun risen from the west today? The workaholic was leaving on time?

Zachary stared blankly at the descending elevator numbers.

This calm was unnerving.

By all accounts, angering the devil should've warranted at least a scolding. Yet now, the entire staff was dismissed early?

The black Maybach crawled through rush-hour traffic.

Ethan loosened his tie.

The passcode for Bayview Residences was still six digits. Sophia Lowell's finger hovered over the keypad before she let out a self-deprecating laugh.

Why would he bother keeping the old code?

Dust swirled in the foyer light as she pushed the door open. The living room remained frozen in time from three months ago—even the hair tie she'd left on the coffee table sat untouched.

The refrigerator was empty.

A thin layer of frost coated the frozen dumpling packaging. Sophia clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms.

Her phone vibrated.

"Miss Lowell," Zachary whispered urgently, "Mr. Roscente is heading to Bayview."

Water gushed from the faucet.

Her knife hovered above the ripe tomato on the cutting board. The electronic lock beeped.

###Chapter 94

The setting sun cast long shadows as Sophia Lowell stepped out of the supermarket, grocery bags in hand. Each carefully selected ingredient matched Ethan Roscente's remembered preferences.

She hadn't cooked properly in ages. Since the divorce, meals had been haphazard affairs. But today, the apron came out of retirement.

When Ethan's car pulled up, the western sky burned crimson. He leaned against the door, smoking two cigarettes before heading inside.

The elevator numbers climbed. His pulse quickened. Fingers drummed the railing unconsciously. Even his breathing grew uneven without his notice.

The empty foyer greeted him. No shoes by the door.

"She didn't come." Loosening his tie, he stalked toward the living room.

Then—the clatter of a spatula.

Ethan whirled. Through frosted glass, he saw her.

Sophia turned with a dish, colliding with his gaze. Her grip tightened, nearly toppling the plate.

"You're back?" Her voice strained for calm.

His eyes traveled from her face to the table, then back. "Why are you here?" Deliberate provocation.

The plate met the table with a thud. "Isn't this what you wanted?"

"This is how you beg favors?" His lids lowered. "More like a debt collector."

He circled the table, scrutinizing each dish. "Your skills have slipped."

Sophia snatched up a plate toward the trash. Ethan caught her wrist. "Who said you could throw out my food?"

"It's mine!"

"My pans. My stove. Now my trash too?" He reclaimed the dish. "A teacher wasting food? Shameful."

She inhaled sharply. "What will it take to leave Vivian alone?"

"Not now." He sat, expression glacial. "Push me, and your friend suffers more."

Sophia's fists clenched. The bastard was toying with her.
###Chapter 95

Sophia's chest heaved violently, her nails digging deep into her palms.

She glared at Ethan Roscente's infuriating face, swallowing back the venomous words on her tongue—terrified he might actually make a move against Vivian Ashcroft.

The dining table was laden with exquisitely prepared dishes, all tailored to Ethan's tastes. His critical gaze swept over the spread, the storm in his expression easing slightly.

"Where's the main course?" His voice was ice.

Sophia smirked. "Aren't you afraid I poisoned it?"

Ethan didn't even lift his eyelids. "Then I'd strangle you first."

"..."

Her temples throbbed with rage. This man would drag her down with him even in death—utterly shameless.

She stormed into the kitchen and slammed a bowl of rice onto the table. "Enjoy your meal, Mr. Roscente. We'll talk business afterward."

Ethan frowned at the lone set of cutlery. "You're not eating?"

"I wouldn't dare share a table with you," she sneered.

He set down his chopsticks and tilted his chin. "Taste test."

Sophia's face drained of color.

Clenching her teeth, she sampled every dish before slamming her chopsticks down. "Satisfied now?"

Ethan picked up a bite with refined grace, chewing slowly. "Barely edible."

She barely resisted smashing the plate over his head.

When she returned from cleaning up, Ethan was lounging on the sofa, eyes closed. Sophia loomed over him. "You've eaten. I've washed the dishes. Time to honor your promise."

He didn't open his eyes, lazily humming in acknowledgment.

Sophia exhaled in relief and sat across from him. "About Vivian—"

"Didn't catch that," Ethan interrupted.

Her forced smile froze. She inhaled sharply, nails carving half-moons into her palms to stop herself from lunging at him.

"I said," she enunciated each word, "can we discuss Vivian Ashcroft now?"
###Chapter 96

Ethan Roscente finally opened his eyes and lazily glanced at her.

"Come closer." His voice was hoarse, laced with an unyielding command. "I can't hear you from that far away."

Sophia Lowell clenched her fists.

This man’s ability to lie through his teeth had reached new heights. Two meters apart, and he claimed he couldn’t hear her?

She was absolutely certain Ethan was deliberately making things difficult.

But for Vivian Ashcroft’s sake, she had to swallow her pride. Just as she stepped forward to move to the opposite sofa, his hand suddenly shot out, gripping her wrist and yanking her toward him.

"Ah!"

The world spun as she tumbled straight into his lap.

"Ethan Roscente!"

She struggled to push herself up, but a large, warm hand pressed firmly against the small of her back, holding her in place.

"Move again," his voice rumbled above her, "and the deal’s off."

Sophia trembled with fury. "You’re doing this on purpose!"

Ethan looked down at her, his lips curling into a wicked smirk. "So what if I am?"

His long fingers traced the flushed heat of her cheeks. "If you want to save your best friend, behave."

Sophia bit her lower lip hard.

This bastard knew exactly where to press.

His arms tightened around her as he buried his face in the crook of her neck. Warm breath fanned across her skin, sending shivers down her spine.

"Let me hold you for a while," he murmured, voice muffled. "If I’m in a good mood, I might consider letting her go."

"Disgusting!" she spat through gritted teeth.

Ethan chuckled darkly. "Only realizing that now?"

Sophia was too furious to speak.

Silence stretched between them. Stiff in his embrace, she could hear the steady rhythm of their heartbeats.

"Had enough?" She shoved against his unyielding chest. "Don’t push your luck."

His breathing grew heavier. The faint scent of gardenias clinging to her was strangely lulling.

What had started as a fleeting impulse now made him reluctant to let go. His arms tightened, pulling her even closer.

"You’re as thin as a twig," he muttered, brows furrowing in displeasure. "You’re practically poking me."

Sophia pried at his fingers. "Then why are you still holding me?"

Ethan cracked one eye open lazily. "Being my personal pillow is an honor you should be grateful for."

She scoffed. "Want me to pass this honor to you instead?"

"Gladly." His lips curved into a rare, genuine smile, softening his sharp features under the warm glow of the lamplight. "I’ll take anything you give me."

Sophia’s heart skipped a beat.

She hastily turned her face away, ears burning. "You’re insane!"

Ethan adjusted his position, eyes closed, missing the blush staining her cheeks. "Quiet," he murmured, voice growing drowsy. "Or tonight’s efforts will be wasted."

Sophia gritted her teeth.

This man kept redefining shamelessness.

The soft lighting and the steady tick of the clock filled the quiet room. Drowsiness crept over her, eyelids growing heavier by the second.

The exhaustion from days of nonstop design work, compounded by pregnancy-induced sleepiness, finally overwhelmed her in the stillness of his embrace.
###Chapter 97

Sophia Lowell fought against her heavy eyelids, struggling to stay awake. The man beside her breathed steadily, but she didn’t dare relax for even a second.

Time ticked by.

Exhaustion eventually overpowered her will. Her head tilted uncontrollably to the side, her cheek lightly brushing against Ethan Roscente’s forehead.

In the darkness, the man slowly opened his eyes.

His gaze was sharp and alert, devoid of any drowsiness. His long fingers grazed the tip of her delicate nose as he murmured in a low voice, "You heartless little thing. Always finding ways to provoke me."

In her sleep, Sophia wrinkled her nose and unconsciously nuzzled against his shoulder, mumbling incoherently, "Ethan Roscente... bastard..."

The man chuckled silently.

Even in her dreams, she was cursing him.

He rose carefully, lifting her into his arms. In the bedroom, he tucked her in gently, pressing a kiss to the corner of her lips before leaving with his phone.

"Mr. Roscente."

A respectful male voice answered the call.

"Any leads?" Ethan swirled his glass of red wine, watching the crimson liquid swirl.

"Not yet. The target was last seen near the police station before vanishing without a trace." The voice hesitated. "It’s likely... they’re already dead."

"Expected." Ethan stood before the floor-to-ceiling window, his lips curling into a cold smile as he gazed into the night. "William Valentine’s methods are no less ruthless than the old man’s."

The history between the Valentines and the Roscentes was something he knew all too well.

Once mere underlings clinging to the Roscentes, the Valentines had climbed their way into high society solely through the old man’s patronage. That was precisely why the old man insisted on his engagement to Isabella Valentine—loyalty mattered more than power.

"Keep searching." Ethan’s voice was icy. "I want them found, dead or alive."

"Understood."

"Any movement from Daniel Clementson?"

"After Miss Valentine’s visit to the hospital, he completely lost it."

Ethan smirked disdainfully. "Then I suppose I should thank her."

Silence filled the other end of the line.

He downed the remaining wine in one gulp, his Adam’s apple bobbing. "Release Vivian Ashcroft first thing tomorrow."

"Will do."

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains.

Sophia jolted awake to the shrill ring of her phone. The moment she heard Vivian had been released, she leaped out of bed and rushed to the police station.

At the entrance, Attorney Lin was finalizing the paperwork. Vivian stepped out, her face pale, dark circles heavy under her eyes.

"Vivian!" Sophia sprinted forward, gripping her friend’s shoulders. "Did they hurt you?"

She frantically inspected every inch of Vivian’s skin, terrified of finding any signs of abuse. With a madman like Ethan, who knew what underhanded tricks he might have pulled?
###Chapter 98
Vivian Ashcroft winked at her, a roguish smile playing on her lips.

"Relax, that bastard Ethan Roscente can't touch me. Attorney Lin isn't some pushover. If he dares lay a finger on me, I'll make sure he loses it."

Sophia Lowell's tense shoulders finally relaxed.

"But you..." Vivian suddenly leaned in, her gaze sharp. "Ethan let me go this easily? Don't tell me you made another deal with him?"

She tapped Sophia's forehead lightly.

"You just escaped that hellhole. Don't be stupid enough to jump back in."

Sophia turned her face away, avoiding Vivian's probing stare.

"I just cooked him a meal, that's all."

She deliberately left out the part where Ethan had held her in his arms all night, though the tips of her ears burned traitorously.

"Bullshit!" Vivian scoffed. "Ethan looked like a man who'd be satisfied with just a meal yesterday?"

She narrowed her eyes like a cat catching the scent of prey.

"Spill it. Did that bastard take advantage of you again?"

Sophia squirmed under her scrutiny and quickly changed the subject.

"It's over. More importantly, did they treat you badly in there?"

Vivian snorted and pulled out a small notebook from her bag, scribbling furiously.

"That green-tea bitch Isabella Valentine and that bastard Ethan—mark my words!"

She snapped the notebook shut, teeth clenched.

"Just wait till I get my chance. I'll show them what it means to kick someone when they're down!"

Sophia couldn't help but laugh, gently pinching Vivian's cheek.

"Come on, let's go home. I'll cook you something good."

"I want spicy fish!" Vivian's eyes lit up instantly. "The spicier, the better!"

......

The days that followed were uneventful.

Sophia never saw Ethan again, as if the man had never existed.

She shuttled between the university and her studio, her life full and peaceful.

Until that afternoon.

The moment she stepped out of the lecture hall, Sophia sensed something was wrong.

The usually bustling hallway had gone eerily quiet. Students huddled in small groups, whispering and pointing at her.

She smiled and greeted them, only to be met with averted eyes and awkward silence.

Her phone vibrated abruptly.

A colleague's message flashed on the screen: Check the campus forum!

Her heart lurched as she tapped the link.

A pinned post glared back at her with a damning title: Beauty Professor Scams Fiancé Out of Fortune, Causes His Death.

Her fingers trembled as she opened it.

The post twisted her past with Daniel Clementson into something grotesque, painting her as a gold-digger who took his family's dowry and drove him to his death.

The worst part was the comments section, already exploding with vitriol.

How can someone like her teach?

I heard she dumped him for a rich guy.

The university needs to take action!

Sophia bit her lip until it hurt, her vision swimming.

The venomous words coiled around her like serpents, choking the air from her lungs.
###Chapter 99

The post on the campus forum exploded like a bomb, instantly igniting a firestorm across Seattle University.

"Sophia Lowell? That new beauty in the Architecture Department?"

"Putting on such a prim act, but she's actually shameless behind the scenes!"

"Two million in dowry still wasn't enough? How greedy can you get?"

"A woman like her doesn't deserve to be a professor!"

Comments scrolled endlessly across my phone screen, each one sharp as a blade. Standing in the hallway of the academic building, I felt a chill crawl down my spine.

"I heard she killed someone!"

"Why hasn't she been arrested yet?"

"The university needs to fire her immediately!"

My fingers clenched around my phone, knuckles turning white. Unknown numbers kept flooding in with hateful messages, each word cutting deeper.

"Professor Lowell?"

A gentle voice suddenly spoke behind me.

I spun around, nearly colliding with the person standing there. Sebastian Valdemar stood half a step away, his brow slightly furrowed.

"Mr. Valdemar?" I instinctively took a step back. "What are you doing here?"

He lifted the teaching materials in his hand. "I'm a guest lecturer for the Business School."

I forced a weak smile. "So we're colleagues."

His gaze dropped to my trembling fingers. "What's wrong?"

Before I could answer, a commotion erupted at the end of the hallway.

"That's her!"

"The professor who scammed the dowry!"

A group of students pointed their phones in our direction, camera flashes flickering nonstop.

Sebastian subtly shifted to shield me.

"Do you need help?" he murmured.

I took a deep breath. "Thank you, but this is my problem."

Just then, my phone buzzed again. The screen displayed the university president's caller ID.

"Professor Lowell, come to my office immediately."

Hanging up, my palms were slick with sweat.

Sebastian handed me a tissue. "Should I go with you?"

I shook my head and straightened my back.

"No."

As I turned away, whispers trailed after me.

"Who does she think she is?"
"I heard she only goes after rich men..."

I paused mid-step but didn't look back.

Inside the president's office, the university board sat around the conference table with grim expressions.

"Professor Lowell, this online scandal is severely damaging our institution's reputation."

"We've received numerous complaints from parents."

"This matter must be resolved immediately."

I tightened my fists. "Those are all lies."

The president slid a document across the table. "The Clementsons provided bank transfer records."

Staring at the so-called "evidence," my vision blurred.

"That money was—"

The door suddenly swung open before I could finish.

"Excuse me."

Sebastian stood in the doorway, holding a file.

"I believe everyone should see this."
###Chapter 100

Sophia Lowell pressed her lips together. She wanted to refuse, but still asked, "How do I get to the dean's office?"

She had been on the job for less than a week, and the sprawling campus still felt unfamiliar. This matter had to be explained to the dean in person.

Sebastian Valdemar's gaze flickered, as if he saw right through her. "I'll take you."

Sophia murmured her thanks and followed him to his car.

Ten minutes later, they stood outside the dean's office.

Sebastian raised his hand and knocked.

"Come in," a deep voice called from inside.

The door opened to reveal Arthur Ellison hunched over his desk, reviewing documents with a furrowed brow—clearly grappling with a difficult issue.

"Dean, busy?" Sebastian asked gently.

Arthur didn’t look up. "One of the faculty members caused trouble. It’s a mess. Trying to figure out how to handle it—"

He abruptly lifted his head, his expression brightening when he recognized the visitor. "Ah, Professor Valdemar! What brings you here? No students hounding you for thesis revisions?"

Sebastian stood before the desk, a faint smile on his lips. "Heard you had a problem. Thought I’d come help."

"Oh?" Arthur arched a brow. "How so?"

Sebastian turned toward the door. "Professor Lowell, please come in."

Sophia stepped inside.

Arthur’s frown deepened at the sight of her. "You know Professor Lowell, Sebastian?"

"Third time meeting her," Sebastian replied frankly.

Arthur chuckled meaningfully. "She was recommended by your father."

Sophia’s heart skipped a beat.

So this was the eldest son her mentor often mentioned—the one teaching in New York. She inwardly scolded herself for not realizing sooner.

Sebastian remained unruffled. "She was indeed my father’s student, but we’ve only met three times. When I heard about her situation, I happened to run into her and brought her to see you."

His tone was sincere. "For the sake of your long-standing friendship with my father, give Professor Lowell a chance to explain. Even criminals get to defend themselves—let alone someone innocent?"

"Innocent?" Arthur smirked. "Seems you trust her quite a bit, Sebastian."

"I’ve never doubted my father’s judgment," Sebastian said calmly. "Neither have you, right?"

If Arthur had wanted an easy solution, he could’ve just fired her outright. Why bother weighing the matter now?

Arthur suddenly laughed, shaking his head at Sebastian. "You and your father—both too sharp for your own good. This old man doesn’t stand a chance against you."
###Chapter 101

Dean Arthur Ellison rose from behind his desk and gestured for them to sit.

Sebastian Valdemar and Sophia Lowell settled onto the black leather sofa.

An assistant brought two glasses of water.

Sophia took a sip, steadying her racing thoughts.

She hadn't expected Sebastian to be her mentor's son—let alone that the dean would know him personally.

"Dean Ellison, I take full responsibility for the negative impact this incident has caused the university." She set down her glass, spine straight. "I'll give the administration and everyone involved a proper explanation."

The dean raised an eyebrow. "Oh? You have a plan?"

He'd heard much about his old friend's star pupil. He just hadn't imagined their first meeting would be under such circumstances.

"Two hours." Sophia held up two fingers. "I'll resolve this completely without damaging the school's reputation."

Dean Ellison considered this. "Very well. Two hours. If you can't produce evidence, even being Theodore's student won't save you."

"Thank you, Dean." Her gaze never wavered.

She'd come here to make one thing clear—she would handle her own problems.

Outside the administration building, Sophia clenched her fists.

The Clementsons were like vengeful ghosts. First the son's attempted assault, now the mother trying to ruin her career.

Her phone vibrated.

"That witch is targeting you again?" Vivian Ashcroft's voice exploded through the speaker. "I just heard student extras gossiping about it!"

Sophia froze. "How did you—"

"Is that woman insane? Her son's already six feet under and she's still causing trouble!" Vivian sounded ready to combust. "You must've dug up her ancestors' graves in a past life!"

Sophia choked back a laugh.

"Something's off." Her tone turned serious. "Daniel's incident was ages ago."

Vivian caught on immediately. "Someone's pulling strings behind the scenes?"

"Mm." Sophia narrowed her eyes. "Very few people know where I work. For her to infiltrate the campus network and post that, she must have inside help."

A cold wind scattered dead leaves at her feet.

Sophia looked up at the leaden sky.

This battle needed to be won—decisively.
###Chapter 102

"What a vicious mastermind." Vivian Ashcroft sneered, her fingers drumming on the table. "Hiding in the shadows, using others as pawns."

Her eyes suddenly narrowed. "This tactic feels eerily familiar—just like Isabella Valentine's underhanded moves. Weaponizing public opinion. Your university hates scandals. She's trying to ruin you."

"Most likely her." Sophia Lowell's voice remained calm.

Vivian frowned. "We couldn't pin it on her last time. This will be even harder."

"Right now, damage control is priority." Sophia checked her watch. "I have two hours."

"Got a plan?"

Sophia nodded, opening her laptop. "Good thing I always back things up. The Clementson Code is still here."

Vivian's eyes lit up. "This will go viral for sure!"

She suddenly slammed the table. "Wait! I have an audio recording—that conversation with Daniel's family at the private dining club last time. My phone accidentally recorded it in my pocket."

"Send it." Sophia's fingers flew across the keyboard. "I'll compile everything."

Thirty minutes later, a new post appeared on the university forum. Sophia tagged Mrs. Clementson: "The truth speaks for itself. These slanderous rumors have caused significant harm. Police report filed. See you in court if you disagree."

The post included four pieces of evidence:

The original Clementson Code sent by Mrs. Clementson
The complete audio from the private dining club
The police report confirming Daniel's fatal car accident
Bank records showing the returned dowry
The final transaction showed the system automatically refunding subsequent payments from the Clementsons.

"Perfect!" Vivian cheered over the phone. "Now let's see how that old witch wriggles out of this! Her son died in a crash, the dowry was fully returned—ironclad proof she fabricated everything!"

Public opinion flipped instantly. The comments section exploded:

"Knew there'd be a twist! Is the Clementson Code some relic? The Qing Dynasty ended ages ago!"
"Her son clearly died in an accident, yet she blames Professor Lowell? Harassment much?"
"Someone needs to investigate who's behind this smear campaign. Disgusting behavior!"

Sophia closed the browser as her phone lit up—a text from an unknown number: "You think this is over?"
###Chapter 103

"This blogger really knows how to manipulate the narrative. They only mention the dowry issue but conveniently leave out the part about returning it. If not for the evidence, Professor Lowell would've been wrongfully accused."

"I'm such an idiot for jumping on the hate bandwagon. My apologies, Professor Lowell!"

The comments section was instantly flooded with apologies.

The perfectly aligned responses stood out conspicuously.

Vivian Ashcroft screenshotted the thread and sent it to Sophia Lowell, who chuckled. "These students are so easily swayed. We clearly need better education on critical thinking."

"Students?" Vivian scoffed. "You're barely older than them. Naivety isn't an excuse for cyberbullying. They deserve to fail their exams as a wake-up call."

"Dean Ellison is keeping tabs. Every single one who participated in the online bashing will face consequences. Written apologies are mandatory."

The campus forum was meant for academic discussions, but it had devolved into a battleground of insults.

As dean, Arthur Ellison had to restore order. The offending students became prime targets for disciplinary action.

Mid-conversation, Vivian suddenly gasped. "Look! Someone just leaked the Tech Grad Courtship Rules!"

"What?"

Sophia froze.

"It's that ridiculous Clementson Code you posted. A student shared it online, and now it's gone viral. Someone exposed the absurd dating requirements set by engineering grad students. Netizens are calling it feudalistic trash."

Sophia shook her head. "I didn't realize there were so many weirdos out there."

"You think that's bad? Check out this gem from my feed."

Vivian sent a screenshot.

Four vacation photos of Isabella Valentine.

The geotag showed Denver.

Just days ago, financial news reported Ethan Roscente attending a summit there.

Did they go on a business trip together?

Sophia laughed at herself. Why did she even care? They were over.

Setting her phone aside, she picked up her sketchbook to work on a design draft.

Normally, inspiration flowed effortlessly. Today, nothing came. After hours of erasing and redrawing, she'd made little progress.

Giving up, she switched to preparing tomorrow's lecture slides.

Work kept her busy until late at night.

After showering, she lay in bed exhausted but unable to sleep.

Her phone suddenly buzzed with multiple notifications in quick succession.
###Chapter 104

Sophia frowned at her phone screen. The constant ping of notifications shattered the midnight silence.

She opened the alerts and discovered someone was furiously liking her old social media posts. From her most recent update all the way back to photos from two years ago—almost nothing was spared.

"Who has this much free time?" she muttered under her breath.

Clicking on the profile, she found an unfamiliar account. No name, just a solid black avatar. Among her recent friend additions, only a few students came to mind.

"Could it be one of those bored students...?"

The likes kept coming. Sophia had enough. She quickly changed her privacy settings to show posts from only the last three days.

Finally, her phone fell silent.

Then, a new message popped up.

Momo: "???"

Sophia replied with a question mark, typing rapidly. "Who is this?"

Momo: "Your man!"

She nearly dropped her phone. Gritting her teeth, she typed back. "Ethan Roscente?"

A video call request flashed on the screen. The ringtone pierced the quiet of her bedroom.

Flustered, she hit accept. Ethan’s sharp, chiseled face instantly filled the display.

"Ah!" Sophia gasped, reflexively flipping the phone face-down onto the sheets.

"Sophia." His deep voice rumbled through the speaker. "Are you avoiding me?"

"No," she lied. "I’m going to sleep."

"Pick up the phone." His tone was commanding. "Let me see you."

"Not happening."

"Why not?" Ethan chuckled. "There’s nothing on you I haven’t seen before."

Sophia inhaled sharply. "Ethan."

"Hmm?"

"Do you know what you sound like right now?"

"What?"

"A creepy stalker." She enunciated each word. "Digging through years of my posts in the middle of the night."

Silence stretched on the other end.

"I missed you," he said suddenly, his voice so low it seemed to vibrate from his chest. "Wanted to see what you looked like back then."

Her heartbeat stuttered.

"You—" She opened her mouth but couldn’t find the right words.

"Pick up the phone," he repeated, softer this time. "Just one look."

Hesitating, she slowly lifted the phone to face level.

Ethan’s image reappeared—wearing a robe, collar slightly open to reveal his collarbone. His gaze burned, as if it could sear through the screen.

"Happy now?" She averted her eyes.

He studied her for a long moment before suddenly smiling. "You’re blushing."

"I am not!" she snapped, though her cheeks grew hotter.

"Get some rest." His voice gentled. "See you tomorrow."

The call ended abruptly. Sophia stared at the darkened screen, her pulse refusing to calm.
###Chapter 105

Sophia's lips curled into a mocking smile as she jabbed at her phone screen. "Some middle-aged creeps just love harassing young women at midnight, demanding photos and videos. Disgusting. Should I call the police right now?"

Silence fell on the other end.

Ethan's breathing grew heavier, his voice gritted through clenched teeth. "Sophia, are you trying to die?"

"Hit a nerve?" She let out a cold laugh. "Listen to yourself. How are you any different from those perverts?"

"I just wanted to see your face!" he nearly shouted.

"Yeah, right." She rolled her eyes. "I'm hanging up."

"Wait!" Ethan's voice turned urgent. "Why did you block me on social media?"

Her fingers paused. A smirk played on her lips. "That's for humans to see. You don't qualify."

The call ended abruptly.

She swiftly dragged the number into her block list and sank into the soft bedding. The frustration from earlier tonight had finally been vented.

Meanwhile, a loud crash echoed through a luxury hotel suite.

Ethan stared at the blocked number before slamming his phone onto the coffee table. The crystal ashtray jumped from the impact.

"Who dared to piss off the great Ethan Roscente?" Felix strolled in, swirling a half-filled glass of whiskey.

Taking one look at Ethan's stormy expression, Felix wisely circled to the opposite sofa. "Let me guess... Sophia Lowell again?"

Ethan massaged his temples, his knuckles turning white.

"Honestly, you had it coming." Felix crossed his legs. "She got dragged on the university forum today. She’s already fuming."

Ethan’s eyes snapped open.

"You really didn’t know?" Felix feigned shock. "Daniel Clementson’s mother caused a scene at the campus today. Almost cost Sophia her job."

He pulled out his phone and scrolled. "Here, the forum’s blowing up."

Ethan took the phone, the cold screen light reflecting his increasingly dark expression. With each swipe, the air around him grew heavier.

Felix subtly inched away.

"Daniel. Clementson." Ethan bit out each syllable, his grip making the phone creak in protest.
###Chapter 106

Ethan Roscente's slender fingers traced the phone screen absently as the coldness in his eyes gradually faded. He tilted his head back, draining the glass of whiskey in one swift motion. His Adam's apple bobbed as he murmured in a low voice, "Perhaps you're right. Connections do matter."

"What?" Felix Roland leaned closer, not catching the words.

The man shook his head and set the empty glass on the table, deftly changing the subject. "Has Luming Architectural Studio submitted the design drafts? How do they look?"

Felix's face instantly lit up. "Absolutely stunning! The design is brilliant—full of creativity and soul. It's exactly what I envisioned!"

Ethan arched an eyebrow, skepticism flickering in his gaze. "Really?"

"Why would I lie?" Felix thumped his chest confidently. "Wait till you see it for yourself. It’ll blow you away!"

"I only trust your taste about thirty percent of the time." Ethan chuckled, tapping the rim of his glass lightly.

"This time is different!" Felix insisted, frustration creeping into his voice. "The designer may not be well-known, but the concept is perfect!"

Ethan merely smirked, offering no further comment.

"Fine. Just wait till you see the designs!" Felix huffed, turning away indignantly.

Sunlight streamed through the classroom windows as Sophia Lowell packed up her art supplies. Her phone buzzed.

"Sophia!" Theodore Orlando's excited voice came through. "Your design passed the initial review! The client loves it and wants to discuss long-term collaboration!"

Her exhaustion vanished instantly. "Really?"

"Absolutely!" Theodore laughed. "There’s still a final review by his associate, but I have full confidence in your work."

"Thank you, Professor." Her voice softened. "If it weren’t for your encouragement—"

"Don’t be silly. You earned this yourself," he interrupted. "By the way, there’s an architecture industry gathering this weekend. Come with me."

Sophia twisted her fingers together nervously. "I—"

"I know social events aren’t your thing," Theodore said gently, "but networking is crucial in this field."

She took a deep breath. "Alright. I’ll go."

Hanging up, she gazed out at the sunlight, a faint smile touching her lips. Maybe it was time to step out of her comfort zone.
###Chapter 107

"Understood, Professor. I'll pick you up on time." Sophia held her phone gently, her voice soft.

"Don't trouble yourself. Let your senior handle it." Theodore Orlando's tone was affectionate. "It's not safe for a young woman to go to the airport alone at night."

Warmth bloomed in Sophia's chest. She knew the "senior" her professor referred to was Sebastian Valdemar.

"By the way, have you met your senior since the semester started?" Theodore suddenly asked. "I specifically told him to look after you. That boy better not have slacked off."

Remembering Sebastian's thoughtfulness yesterday, Sophia's lips curled unconsciously. "He's been very attentive."

"Good. At least my arrangement wasn't in vain—"

A truck roared past, drowning out the rest of his words. By the time the noise faded, Sophia had already reached her apartment complex's entrance.

"Professor, what were you saying?"

"Oh, nothing important." Theodore quickly changed the subject. "Your aunt is calling me. I'll talk to you later."

Just as Sophia put away her phone, it rang again. Seeing "Zachary Evans" flashing on the screen, she frowned.

She'd only unblocked him recently to inquire about Ethan Roscente. She hadn't expected him to call so soon.

"Hello?"

But it was Ethan's deep voice that answered. "I'm outside your place."

Sophia froze mid-step. "What do you want?"

"Someone's in a bad mood." His chuckle was infuriating. "Who upset you?"

"None of your business." She moved to hang up.

"My stomach hurts." The words came abruptly.

Sophia paused, then scoffed. "Go find your fiancée. I'm not a doctor."

"Still your uncle, aren't I?" Ethan's voice was weak but teasing. "Shouldn't you show some filial piety when your elder is unwell?"

"I might 'piety' you to death."

"Dying by my niece's hand would be a romantic way to go."

"..." Her teeth ground together. "Just suffer then!"

Despite her words, her footsteps quickened.

A familiar van was parked downstairs. Sophia felt she'd seen it somewhere before, but before she could recall, two giggling girls stepped out of the elevator.
###Chapter 108

Sophia stepped aside as two young women passed by her.

"Oh my god! That was really Isabella Valentine and Ethan Roscente!" The short-haired girl whispered excitedly. "They look so perfect together!"

"I never knew Isabella could be this sweet in person," the long-haired girl added. "Totally different from her on-screen persona."

Sophia's fingers tightened unconsciously around her bag strap.

"Rumor has it Mr. Roscente bought her an apartment nearby," the short-haired girl continued gossiping. "Because her new drama is filming at the university."

"That's beyond romantic!" The other girl sighed enviously.

Their voices faded into the distance. Sophia stood frozen, feeling her blood turn to ice.

Now she understood why that black van had appeared here.

The elevator doors reflected her pale face. The smile on her lips had long disappeared.

Ding—

The elevator reached her floor.

The doors slid open to reveal an empty hallway.

Sophia pulled out her phone, her fingertips trembling slightly.

The call connected instantly.

"Where are you?" Her voice came out strained.

"At your doorstep." Ethan's reply was crisp.

Sophia stared at the deserted corridor and let out a bitter laugh. "Liar!"

She hung up without hesitation and blocked the number immediately.

As the elevator doors closed again, she pressed the button for the underground parking garage.

Meanwhile, upstairs, Ethan glared at his disconnected phone, his expression thunderous.

"Mr. Roscente?" Zachary Evans ventured cautiously.

"Stay here." Ethan tossed his phone to his assistant and strode toward the emergency stairs.

He took the steps two at a time, only to find Sophia's floor completely empty.

The elevator display showed it had already descended to B2.

Ethan slammed his fist against the wall, his knuckles turning white.

Down in the parking garage, Sophia started her car.

She caught sight of her reflection in the rearview mirror—her eyes slightly red.

"How stupid of me," she muttered with a self-deprecating twist of her lips.

The engine roared as the black sedan sped out of the garage.

###Chapter 109 

The elevator doors slid shut as Sophia Lowell stood motionless.

She didn't want to go back. Nor did she want to leave.

Ethan Roscente emerged from the stairwell just as the elevator closed. His brow furrowed as he knocked on Sophia's door.

No answer.

The elderly neighbor across the hall peeked out. "Young man, Sophia isn't home yet."

Ethan froze.

She'd clearly said she was already back when they spoke on the phone.

The elevator ascended to the penthouse. When the doors opened, Isabella Valentine stood outside.

"Sophia?" She feigned surprise. "You live here too?"

Sophia shot her a cold glance. "Coming up?"

Isabella's assistant immediately curled her lip in disdain. "Our Ms. Valentine would never squeeze into this kind of elevator."

"Then keep waiting." Sophia pressed the close button, watching Isabella's stiff expression with quiet satisfaction.

Vivian Ashcroft texted to invite her for dinner. Sophia agreed without hesitation.

At the restaurant, Vivian instantly read her mood.

"Did that bastard Ethan upset you again?"

Sophia recounted the elevator incident.

Vivian slammed the table. "That two-timing dog!"

"Even time-management gurus would bow to his skills." Sophia laughed bitterly.

"And you're laughing?" Vivian glared. "I'd have thrown boiling water in his face!"

Remembering her last stint in detention, she quickly shrank back.

"But if that green-tea bitch really lives in your building..." Vivian suddenly lowered her voice. "Did you hear about Daniel Clementson's mother?"

Sophia's fingers twitched. "What happened?"

"Someone threw her off the Bay Bridge last night." Vivian whispered dramatically. "When they fished her out, her stomach was swollen like a balloon."

"Who did it?" Sophia's voice tightened.
###Chapter 110

"Rumor has it he owed money to the factory owner, and they sent people for revenge."

"Revenge?" Her lashes fluttered slightly, a flicker of doubt in her eyes. "It's just debt collection. Why take a life?"

"The owner staked everything he had. Probably had no way out."

Sophia Lowell felt there was more to the story. A faint crease appeared between her brows.

"This has nothing to do with you. Don't overthink it."

A gentle voice came from behind.

She turned to see Sebastian Valdemar approaching in a light blue suit.

The man met her surprised gaze, the corners of his eyes curving slightly.

"Mr. Valdemar." She composed herself and stood to greet him.

"No need to be so formal." His smile was warm. "Since you're my father's prized student, you can call me 'senior.'"

Sophia obliged. "Senior."

"Junior." He responded with amusement.

Vivian Ashcroft's eyes darted between them. Spotting the queue number in Sebastian's hand, she eagerly tugged Sophia's sleeve. "Professor Valdemar hasn't eaten yet, right? Join us!"

Sophia caught the hint. Remembering the favors she owed him, she extended the invitation. "You've helped me so much, Senior. It's only right I treat you to a meal."

Sebastian had originally planned to meet a friend, but they'd canceled last minute. Just as he was about to leave, he spotted Sophia and found himself walking over.

"Then I'll gladly accept," he replied softly.

Vivian immediately scooted closer to Sophia, leaving the seat across from them open for Sebastian.

The restaurant was slow with service. Vivian excused herself to the restroom, giving the two some privacy.

Sophia seized the chance to ask about teaching methods. Sebastian patiently answered, and their conversation flowed effortlessly.

Outside the floor-to-ceiling window, a black Maybach glided past.

From the backseat, Ethan Roscente's dark gaze fixed on the pair laughing inside.

"Mr. Roscente, this afternoon we're scheduled to visit the hospital—"

Zachary Evans abruptly fell silent, sensing the sudden drop in temperature inside the car.

Following Ethan's line of sight—

Sunlight streamed through the glass, illuminating the two figures. A handsome man and a beautiful woman seated across from each other, looking every bit the perfect couple.

###Chapter 111

Zachary Evans felt a chill run down his spine and immediately fawned, "Miss Sophia looked at that man with nothing but pure friendliness. But when she looks at you, Mr. Roscente, her gaze practically melts—anyone can see there's something more between you. If you were sitting there, the scene would be even more captivating."

The flattery hit just the right note.

Ethan Roscente's stern expression softened slightly as he withdrew his gaze, though his voice remained icy. "Find out everything about that man."

"Understood."

As the traffic light turned green, the black sedan rounded the corner and disappeared. Sophia Lowell suddenly felt a cold prickle on the back of her neck and glanced out the window in confusion.

Had someone been watching her just now?

"Is everything alright?" Sebastian Valdemar asked with concern.

Sophia scanned the surroundings but found nothing unusual. "It's nothing."

Lunch ended on a pleasant note.

"Do you have classes this afternoon? I can drive you back to campus," Sebastian said, dabbing his lips with a napkin.

"Thank you, but I don't have any classes this afternoon," Sophia replied, noticing him checking his watch repeatedly. "If you have somewhere to be, don't let me keep you. I'll meet up with some friends."

"I do need to pick someone up from the airport," he admitted after a pause. "My sister is returning home."

"Vivian Valdemar?" Sophia's eyes lit up. "She's back?"

Sebastian blinked in realization. "So you're the 'Little Pear' she always talks about?"

The nickname made Sophia smile. Back when she studied under Professor Valdemar, Vivian had treated her like a younger sister. After Vivian went abroad for further studies, they kept in touch sporadically, but Sophia hadn't heard from her in half a year.

"How has she been?" Sophia asked eagerly.

Sebastian checked his watch again. "Why don't you come to the airport with me? She'll be thrilled to see you."

Thinking of the sisterly bond they shared, Sophia happily agreed.

The arrivals area was packed with people.

Sebastian subtly positioned himself beside Sophia, shielding her from the bustling crowd. She stood on tiptoe, searching for a familiar face among the throng.

"Vivian!" Sophia suddenly called out, waving.

The next second, both of them froze.

Vivian Valdemar emerged, pulling her luggage behind her. Her loose dress couldn't hide the slight swell of her abdomen.

Sebastian's face darkened instantly. He strode forward. "Vivian, what's going on?"

The moment Vivian saw her brother, her cheerful expression crumbled. Tears welled up in her eyes as she threw herself into his arms, sobbing. "Brother... I missed you so much..."
###Chapter 112

Sebastian Valdemar stiffened as his younger sister suddenly embraced him, his hands hovering awkwardly in midair to avoid touching her swollen belly.

"Bro..." Vivian Valdemar's muffled sob vibrated against his chest.

His brow furrowed as he grabbed her collar and pulled her away. "Tears won't help. Explain yourself first."

Who could understand his shock? The sister he'd sent abroad as an innocent girl now returned heavily pregnant.

Sophia Lowell stepped forward, scanning Vivian with concern. "Are you alright, Senior?"

Vivian peeked out from Sebastian's arms, her face lighting up at the sight of Sophia. "Little Pear!" Her sly gaze darted between them. "You two..."

"We're just colleagues," Sophia quickly clarified. "He teaches at the university. I'm a substitute lecturer."

Vivian pouted in disappointment. "I thought you were together."

Sophia focused on Vivian's situation instead. She glanced between Sebastian's stormy expression and Vivian's guilty demeanor.

"It's just a pregnancy." Vivian shrugged with forced nonchalance. "As for that scoundrel, forget him. This baby will be mine alone."

Sebastian scoffed. "You think raising a child is child's play?"

"What would you have me do?" Vivian protectively cradled her stomach. "I barely escaped. I'm never going back."

Sophia's chest tightened. Clearly her senior had endured something terrible overseas.

"Sebastian," she said softly, "let her rest first. She just got off the plane."

Sebastian studied his sister's exhausted face and relented. Grabbing the luggage, he strode ahead.

Vivian linked arms with Sophia and whispered, "Little Pear, since when does my brother listen to you? Don't tell me there's nothing between you."

"Today was literally our fourth meeting." Sophia sighed. "I invited him to dinner, then we came together when we heard you were returning."

Vivian's eyes reddened with emotion. "You're the best." She hugged Sophia tightly. "Having you here makes me feel safe."

Sophia frowned, recalling their six-month silence. "Where were you?"

"It's a long story..."

"Give me the short version."

Vivian glanced at Sebastian's retreating back and whispered in Sophia's ear, "A madman kept me captive for half a year. If not for help, you'd be visiting my urn now."

"Senior!" Sophia gasped.

Vivian forced a smile, but the shadows in her eyes betrayed her. Sophia's heart ached as she embraced Vivian's thin shoulders. "It's over now."

Airport announcements faded into the crowd. Each lost in thought, the trio moved toward the exit. Vivian's hand absently stroked her belly, her gaze drifting to the distance—toward nightmares she couldn't forget and a future she must face.
###Chapter 113

Sophia rested her head gently against Vivian Valdemar's shoulder, breathing in the familiar scent of jasmine. "Senior, promise me you'll take care of yourself."

Vivian's fingers combed through Sophia's soft hair, her eyes shimmering with tenderness. "Silly girl, I promise. But you're the one who keeps worrying everyone."

The long-missed intimacy made Sophia's eyes burn. Behind Vivian's forced smile, she saw the same fragile brokenness that mirrored her own.

After settling Vivian at Sebastian Valdemar's apartment, Sophia checked her watch. The night had grown late, and she rose to leave.

Sebastian grabbed his keys and followed her out.

At the building entrance, Sophia hesitated before speaking. "Senior, about Vivian—"

"I know," Sebastian interrupted. "I'll stay with her these next few days. Once our father arrives, we'll take her back to Seattle to recuperate."

Sophia nodded. The night wind lifted the strands of hair at her forehead, revealing her reddened eyes.

Sebastian didn't turn away until the elevator doors closed behind her.

......

The sharp antiseptic smell in the hospital hallway made Ethan Roscente's temples throb. For the third time, he unlocked his phone. The stolen photo of Sophia smiling up at the camera pierced his heart like a thorn.

"Mr. Roscente?" Zachary Evans reminded him quietly. "The Madam is waiting."

A familiar voice suddenly echoed from around the corner. Ethan froze mid-step.

Outside the obstetrics clinic, Sebastian was carefully adjusting a pregnant woman's scarf. The gentle care in his actions was a stark contrast to the man at the restaurant earlier.

Ethan let out a cold laugh, his knuckles cracking under the force of his grip.

"Report."

Zachary's back broke out in a cold sweat. "Sebastian Valdemar, 32, associate professor at the School of Architecture. Yesterday, Ms. Lowell—"

"The highlights."

"He and Ms. Lowell studied under the same mentor. He also recommended the lawyer for Ms. Ashcroft's case." Zachary forced himself to add, "Rumors say... Ms. Lowell plans to teach at the university after resigning."

Ice formed in Ethan's eyes. The hallway lights cast ominous shadows across his sharp features.

So that was it.

The little wildcat who always bared her claws at him had sheathed them for someone else.
###Chapter 114

Sophia Lowell finally finished her work as city lights began twinkling outside her window.

She massaged her stiff neck, realizing she'd missed dinner. Her empty stomach growled in protest.

Her fingers brushed over her flat abdomen. "Hungry, little one? Mommy's sorry," she murmured.

The refrigerator stood empty when she opened it.

A glance at her watch confirmed the supermarket was still open.

She grabbed her coat and keys, rushing toward the door.

The moment she yanked it open, she nearly collided with a solid chest.

"Jesus!" She stumbled back.

Ethan Roscente barely avoided the swinging door, his expression stormy. "Sophia."

Recognition sparked instant irritation. "Are you insane? Lurking outside my door at this hour!"

She pressed a protective hand to her stomach, silently reassuring her baby.

Ethan's gaze zeroed in on the gesture. "You're pregnant?"

Her pulse jumped. "You wish! Maybe your entire family is!"

A vein throbbed at his temple.

Even her insults were self-destructive.

Noticing her purse, his eyes darkened. "Where are you going?"

She slammed the door without answering, striding toward the elevator.

Ethan seized her wrist, pinning her against the elevator wall. "I asked you a question."

"Are you human?" She glared up at him.

The air around him turned glacial. "Apparently I've been too lenient."

"Back off." She wrinkled her nose. "You reek of perfume."

He stepped closer instead. "Last chance. Where?"

"None of your damn business."

He leaned in until his breath warmed her lips. "Tell me or I'll kiss you."

"You—" Her ears burned. "Disgusting!"

"Just realizing that?" He arched a brow.

The elevator dinged at the ground floor.

"Grocery shopping!" she spat through clenched teeth.

Some tension left his shoulders, but his tone remained cutting. "Professor Orlando didn't feed you?"

She shook off his grip. "Stop barking."

His face turned murderous.
###Chapter 115

Ethan Roscente's mocking words fell on deaf ears.

Sophia Lowell completely missed the hidden meaning in his remark.

The elevator doors opened on the first floor. Without a word, Ethan grabbed her wrist and pulled her out.

"What are you doing?" Sophia struggled to break free.

Ignoring her protests, he shoved her into the passenger seat.

"Let me out!" She reached for the door handle.

A sharp click—the doors locked.

Ethan leaned in, his breath warm against her ear. "Keep resisting, and we'll spend the night right here."

His gaze lingered on her. "Not that you'd mind, would you?"

"..."

Sophia's ears burned.

This man is utterly shameless.

One hand on the steering wheel, Ethan rolled up his sleeves, revealing the defined muscles of his forearms. Sophia couldn’t help remembering how those same hands had gripped her waist.

She quickly looked away, pretending to focus on the passing city lights.

Neon reflections danced across the window, outlining Ethan’s sharp profile.

That face was unfairly perfect.

No wonder she kept getting drawn in.

Her gaze, as if with a will of its own, traced the lines of his brows and lashes. When she reached his deep-set eyes, she froze—he was watching her through the window’s reflection.

Caught red-handed, humiliation flooded her.

"Done staring?" Ethan’s voice cut through the silence.

Sophia jerked her head away.

"I wasn’t looking at you!" she snapped.

A low chuckle. "I never said you were."

"..."

Played again. She glared at him.

Ethan’s eyes darkened. Suddenly, he unbuckled his seatbelt and closed the distance between them.

His lips captured hers without warning.

Sophia stiffened, caught off guard.

By the time she regained her senses, she was pinned against the seat, drowning in his kiss. Ethan was a master—alternating between tender coaxing and ruthless dominance.

Her body melted under his touch.

Fingers clenched and unclenched as reason warred with desire.

"Open up for me," he murmured huskily.

Then—

Grrrrr.

An embarrassingly loud stomach growl shattered the moment.

Sophia wished the seat would swallow her whole.

Ethan laughed, nuzzling her nose. "Hungry?"

Blushing, she nodded.

Reluctantly, he released her. A starving kitten had claws, after all.
###Chapter 116

Ethan Roscente's slender fingers retrieved something from the storage compartment.

Sophia Lowell felt her stray strands being gently gathered as he swiftly tied up her loose hair.

"Don't move." He pressed down on her hand when she reached up to touch it.

Before she could speak, he pushed the car door open and stepped out. His polished black shoes crossed the asphalt as he rounded to the passenger side.

"Get out." He pulled the door open, his tone brooking no argument.

Sophia hesitated briefly when the restaurant's interior came into view.

It was the same place she'd visited at noon—even the seating arrangement was identical.

Ethan pulled out a chair, his gaze heavy as it settled on her.

When the menu was handed to her, Sophia ordered seven or eight dishes in one breath. She deliberately avoided anything unsuitable for pregnancy, checking off everything else.

"That hungry?" Ethan tapped the table lightly with his fingertips.

Sophia hummed in response without looking up, passing the menu to the waiter. "Please hurry."

The moment the waiter left, Ethan chuckled lowly. "I should've fed you something in the car."

She shot him a glare.

"What are you thinking?" He raised a brow. "I meant the snacks in the trunk."

Sophia didn't bother responding. They both knew exactly who those snacks were for.

She used to keep biscuits and candies in his car too. Every time, he'd toss them out with disdain, complaining they ruined his image. Now he kept them stocked for Isabella Valentine.

The line between love and indifference couldn't be clearer.

The food arrived quickly. Sophia pulled the plates closer to herself. "We'll eat separately."

Ethan frowned. "You can finish all that?"

"I'll take the leftovers." She picked up a spare rib. "Dutch treat. No freeloading."

The memory of him tricking her into paying last time was still fresh.

Ethan leaned back, amused. "Do I look like I can't afford a meal?"

"Not my problem." She focused on her food.

His expression darkened. Flipping open the wine list, he ordered a bottle of Petrus.

The sound of red wine pouring into the crystal glass made Sophia's throat tighten. It was her favorite brand.

Too bad she couldn't drink it now.

Ethan sipped leisurely, his eyes never leaving her face. By the time he finished his glass, she still hadn't reacted.

This wasn't like her. Normally, she'd be leaning over eagerly by now.

Swirling his wine, his gaze deepened.
###Chapter 117

Ethan Roscente set down his wine glass, brows furrowed. Something felt off, but he couldn't pinpoint what.

"Sophia." His piercing gaze locked onto her. "You're hiding something from me."

Her heart skipped a beat. She forced a careless eye roll. "You're delusional."

"You always loved this vintage." His slender fingers tapped the crystal rim. "Yet tonight, you haven't touched it."

Her knuckles whitened around the napkin. "I'm on antibiotics. Not suicidal."

Ethan's eyes narrowed, unconvinced. But her calm facade gave him no opening—for now.

When the bill came, Sophia insisted on splitting it. Ethan's expression darkened instantly. He seized her wrist. "Do you do this with Sebastian Valdemar too?"

"You've been investigating me?" Her head jerked up, panic flashing in her eyes.

The reaction confirmed his suspicions. A cold smirk twisted his lips. "Afraid I'll discover your little secret?"

Sophia's hand flew to her abdomen—a telltale movement he didn't miss.

"So it's true." His voice turned glacial. "You and Sebastian—"

"None of your business!" Her voice rose sharply. "Even if we get married tomorrow, it's not your concern!"

Rage simmered in Ethan's gaze. Before he could retaliate, his phone rang abruptly.

The caller ID glared up at them: Isabella Valentine.

Sophia's lips curled in bitter amusement. Watch how his precious first love could instantly divert his attention.

Ethan frowned at the screen. After a beat, he answered.
###Chapter 118

Ethan Roscente hung up the phone, his brow furrowed.

"Isabella's in trouble." He turned to Sophia Lowell. "I'll have someone take you home."

Sophia spun on her heel and walked away, the hem of her dress slicing a sharp arc through the air.

"Don't bother."

She left without hesitation, not even sparing him a glance.

The restaurant was only a ten-minute walk from her apartment. The cool night breeze helped dispel the lingering frustration in her chest.

The roar of an engine came from behind. A black Maybach sped past, the tense profile in the backseat flashing by in an instant.

Sophia scoffed.

If he was in such a hurry, why had he bothered seeking her out?

......

Two peaceful days later, the architecture industry gala Theodore Orlando had mentioned arrived.

Sophia applied the final stroke of eyeliner before the mirror.

Her jasmine-embroidered gown shimmered with a pearlescent sheen under the light, the off-shoulder design accentuating her delicate collarbones like butterfly wings. After a moment's hesitation, she took out the jade hairpin from her jewelry box.

The moment her hair was pinned up, the reflection in the mirror suddenly came alive.

The jasmine motif dangling from the hairpin complemented the embroidery on her dress perfectly, as if they had always belonged together.

The doorbell rang just as she was lost in thought over the hairpin.

"Sophia?" Sebastian Valdemar's voice came through the intercom. "I'm downstairs."

When the black Cayenne pulled into the hotel plaza, Sebastian's phone lit up.

"Go ahead inside," he told the valet opening the passenger door. "I need to take this call."

Under the glow of crystal chandeliers, Sophia had just stepped onto the staircase when an uncertain voice called out from behind.

"Sophia?"

The voice was like a blunt knife, slicing open the sealed memories without warning.
###Chapter 119

Sophia's pupils contracted the moment she turned around.

What terrible luck.

Tiffany Roscente approached in stilettos, her dress swaying with aggressive confidence. The prized daughter of the Roscente family's third branch now glared at her with venomous eyes.

Two years ago when Sophia first arrived at the Roscente estate, Tiffany had made it her mission to compete with her at every turn. Despite being the same age and studying the same major, Sophia had entered graduate school a year earlier, graduated ahead of schedule, and left Tiffany's academic achievements in the dust.

Tiffany's red-lacquered nails tightened around her champagne flute, her knuckles turning white.

"Well, if it isn't my uncle's former secretary?" She emphasized the word "former" with deliberate malice. "Didn't expect to see you crashing architecture events after getting kicked out of Roscente Enterprises."

Sophia adjusted her silk sleeve cuff, the fabric shimmering like pearls under the lights. Her misty blue gown accentuated her snow-pale complexion, a stark contrast to Tiffany's garish canary-yellow dress.

"Tiffany." Sophia met her gaze, her tone as casual as discussing the weather. "Your study abroad trip gave you quite the healthy tan."

Tiffany's face instantly darkened. She hated any mention of inheriting her father's olive skin.

"Sophia!" she shrieked. "Who do you think you are to judge me? I could ruin your career in this industry with one word!"

The crystal chandeliers trembled.

Theodore Orlando strolled over with a champagne flute, his eyes narrowing behind his glasses. "Miss, keep your voice down." His polite tone dripped with sarcasm. "People might mistake a Roscente heiress for a fishwife."

Tiffany's chest heaved, strands of her carefully styled curls springing loose. "And who the hell are you?" she snarled. "Do you have any idea what happens to those who cross the Roscentes?"

Theodore took a leisurely sip. "Funny you should ask." His expression brightened with mock realization. "I just rejected a billion-dollar Roscente project last week. Does that count?"

Sophia nearly laughed. Her mentor had a gift for delivering lethal insults with impeccable grace.

Tiffany's lips trembled, her eyeliner smudging. Just as she prepared to retaliate, a crisp clink of glass echoed through the ballroom.

"Ladies and gentlemen," the host announced from the podium. "Please welcome our keynote speaker for tonight's Young Architects Competition—Professor Sophia Lowell from Seattle University's School of Architecture."

Spotlights suddenly illuminated Sophia.

Tiffany froze, her foundation unable to mask her ashen pallor.
###Chapter 120

Tiffany Roscente lifted her chin, sweeping a disdainful gaze across the crowd. "This is Roscente territory. Anyone who offends me can get out!"

What a spoiled brat.

Theodore Orlando was about to speak when Sophia Lowell gently tugged his sleeve. She met Tiffany's eyes, her tone calm. "You know better than I do what position your father is in right now. He's always kept a low profile. Imagine his reaction if he found out his daughter was throwing the Roscente name around like this..."

Tiffany's father was the only politician in the Roscente family, currently serving as mayor during a critical promotion period. He was notoriously cautious, terrified of any scandal.

Tiffany's face paled, her fingers twisting nervously in her skirt.

Sophia pressed her advantage, speaking deliberately. "I suggest you look up how these 'daddy's girl' stories usually end. Quite entertaining."

"Are you threatening me?" Tiffany's voice trembled despite her bravado.

"Consider it friendly advice." Sophia's tone remained even.

"Who do you think you are?" Tiffany's voice rose sharply. "A parasite living off the Roscentes' charity, lecturing me?"

Theodore frowned. "Mind your language—"

"Shut up!" Tiffany whirled on him, malice flashing in her eyes. "Defending her like this—is she your mistress? Let me warn you, my mentor's father is Theodore Orlando, the architectural legend. One word from me, and you'll be blacklisted!"

Theodore's lips curved with amusement. "Why your mentor's father and not your mentor himself?"

At the mention of her mentor, Tiffany's expression turned dreamy. "Master Theodore is the guest of honor tonight. Of course a nobody like you wouldn't know."

Theodore stroked his chin. When had his son's taste become so questionable?

"Then guess who I am," he said playfully.

"You're just some lowlife—"

"Tiffany!" Sophia cut in sharply. "Insult my professor again, and I won't hold back!"

"Sophia, how dare you—"

"That's enough."

A calm yet authoritative male voice interrupted from behind.

Tiffany froze. When she turned, all color drained from her face. "P-Professor Valdemar..."
###Chapter 121

Sebastian Valdemar rounded the corner with his phone in hand, just in time to hear Tiffany Roscente's biting sarcasm.

His steps faltered. His gaze turned icy in an instant.

"Father." He strode forward, subtly positioning himself between Sophia Lowell and Theodore Orlando. His concerned eyes settled on the older man. "Are you all right?"

Tiffany's eyes widened as they darted between the two men. When she noticed their strikingly similar profiles, her face drained of color.

"P-Professor Valdemar..." Her voice trembled, nails digging into her palms. "I..."

Theodore scoffed, refusing to even glance her way. His expression softened instantly when he turned to Sophia. "Come, my dear. Let me introduce you to some old friends."

Sophia nodded obediently. Before leaving, she cast Tiffany a meaningful look.

"Satisfied?" Theodore whispered once they were out of earshot, winking at her.

Sophia pressed her lips together to suppress a smile. "Very."

Theodore sighed. "That girl has been giving you trouble, hasn't she?"

"She never wins." Sophia swirled her champagne glass. "You taught me to stand my ground when necessary."

The old man patted her shoulder approvingly. "Good. Remember—we don't start fights, but we don't back down from them either."

Outside the ballroom, Tiffany intercepted Sebastian with red-rimmed eyes. "Professor Valdemar, I had no idea—"

"Does ignorance excuse cruelty?" His tone was calm, but his stare was glacial.

Tiffany stomped her foot in frustration. "It's all Sophia's fault! She provoked me on purpose, insinuating that she and Professor Orlando—"

"Enough." Sebastian cut her off sharply. "You have no right to judge my junior."

As he turned to leave, Tiffany desperately reached for his sleeve. Sebastian sidestepped, disgust flashing in his eyes.

"Mind your boundaries, Miss Roscente." His voice was steel. "And I won't tolerate any more slander against Sophia."

Tiffany bit her lip hard. "She's a fraud! In our family—"

"I said enough!" Sebastian's raised voice drew glances from nearby guests. He took a deep breath, lowering his volume. "One more word against her, and there will be consequences."

###Chapter 122

"Enough!" Sebastian's voice turned icy, his gaze sharp as daggers as he glared at Tiffany. "I knew Sophia long before you entered the picture. If I hear you speak ill of her again—"

The unspoken threat hung heavy in the air.

Tiffany froze, momentarily stunned by his outburst before jealousy twisted her features. Her nails dug into her palms as she stared at Sophia's retreating figure.

"She's just some junior colleague. Why defend her so fiercely?" Tiffany's voice trembled. "Unless... you have feelings for her?"

Sebastian's expression darkened further, his disdain palpable as he refused to even look at her.

"Miss Roscente," he said coldly, "you're overstepping."

The dismissal stung. Tiffany's eyes burned with unshed tears as she stomped her foot. "You're avoiding the question!"

"What if I do?" Sebastian's lips curled into a humorless smile, his eyes glacial. "Pursuing her would be perfectly honorable. Unlike you—" His tone shifted, razor-sharp. "What exactly is your stake in this?"

Tiffany paled, but before she could retort, movement caught her eye. Her face instantly brightened with feigned distress. "Uncle Ethan! Isabella!"

Ethan stood by the pillar, impeccably dressed in his tailored suit, his gaze locked on Sebastian with unsettling intensity. Isabella clung to his arm, her manicured nails biting into his jacket sleeve.

"This is Professor Valdemar," Tiffany announced loudly, throwing Sebastian a triumphant look. "I may have spoken out of turn earlier—about his father, and about Sophia—"

Her sudden contrition was transparent as she glanced expectantly at Ethan.

Sebastian gave the legendary Roscente patriarch a curt nod before turning on his heel.

"Sebastian Valdemar!" Tiffany shrieked, stomping again in frustration.

Isabella chuckled, pinching Tiffany's cheek. "Our little Tiffany is all grown up."

"Stop it, Isabella!" Tiffany flushed crimson.

"I didn't say a word," Isabella murmured, her gaze sliding meaningfully toward Ethan. "Right, darling?"

Ethan's attention remained fixed on Sebastian's departing figure before he finally responded, his voice flat. "If you want him, go after him."

Tiffany gasped. "You approve?"

Ethan didn't answer, his expression inscrutable. Isabella's smile stiffened, her grip on his arm tightening imperceptibly.

###Chapter 123

Ethan Roscente watched Sebastian Valdemar with cold disdain, a flicker of mockery in his eyes.

A married man still coveting Sophia Lowell? What a delusion.

He took a sip from his wine glass, his tone indifferent. "He's barely passable for you. If you can actually land him, I'll be impressed."

If Tiffany Roscente could keep Sebastian occupied, that man wouldn't have the energy to harass Sophia.

Beneath her lowered lashes, Isabella Valentine's eyes darkened with calculation.

She knew Ethan's game too well. This so-called support for his niece's pursuit of love was just a ploy to sever Sebastian's lingering attachment to Sophia.

What kind of spell had that wretched girl cast over Ethan?

Her gaze flicked to Tiffany's blushing face, and her red lips curved slightly.

"Your standards are too high, Uncle," Tiffany pouted. "Even Professor Valdemar doesn't meet them?"

Isabella gently linked arms with her. "Your uncle just thinks his precious niece deserves better."

Tiffany blinked playfully. "The best is you, Uncle. Isabella hit the jackpot with you."

Isabella glanced shyly at Ethan's flawless profile and murmured, "Ethan, I'll take Tiffany to freshen up."

After receiving his absent-minded acknowledgment, she led Tiffany toward the restroom.

"Is something bothering you?" Tiffany paused at the vanity.

Isabella's expression turned serious. "Are you really set on Professor Valdemar?"

Tiffany adjusted her hair in the mirror, her gaze distant. "I fell for him at first sight."

She'd schemed to eliminate rivals just to get close to him. Even knowing he'd reluctantly accepted her as a student, she'd forced her way in.

Isabella sighed. "But he's in love with someone else..."

"So what?" Tiffany cut her off, flames of determination igniting in her eyes. "I always get what I want."

The girl in the mirror flashed a triumphant smile, as if already seeing her prey ensnared.
###Chapter 124

Tiffany Roscente clenched her fists, her nails digging deep into her palms. "Someone like Sophia Lowell—Professor Orlando will see her true colors eventually."

"But Sophia, she..."

Isabella Valentine suddenly hesitated, her gaze flickering. Tiffany immediately grabbed her wrist. "What about her?"

Isabella bit her lip, her eyes reddening.

"Bella!" Tiffany stamped her foot impatiently. "We're best friends! What can't you tell me?"

"Tiff..." Isabella's voice trembled. "If I say this, I'm afraid..."

"Just say it!" Tiffany's eyes gleamed—her instincts told her this was the leverage she needed to take Sophia down.

Isabella took a deep breath. "You have to promise me absolute secrecy. Especially that you won't let your uncle know I told you."

Tiffany nodded eagerly, raising three fingers. "I swear!"

"Sophia and your uncle..." Isabella suddenly covered her face, tears spilling between her fingers. "They've been..."

"What?!"

Tiffany froze as if struck by lightning.

"They aren't even related by blood!" Isabella lifted her head abruptly, hatred burning in her eyes. "I saw them... at a hotel..."

Tiffany's face turned deathly pale, her lips trembling.

She remembered the always-askew collar of Sophia's blouse in her uncle's office. The way his gaze lingered on Sophia during family gatherings—seemingly casual, but never accidental.

"That bitch!" Tiffany shrieked suddenly. "She must have seduced him!"

Isabella wiped her tears and nodded. "With that face of hers, who knows how many beds she's crawled into..."

Tiffany trembled violently, Sophia's perpetually mocking smile flashing in her mind. She grabbed her purse. "I'm telling Grandpa!"

"No!" Isabella frantically pulled her back. "You promised me!"

Tiffany shook her off, fury blazing in her eyes. "This scandal has to be exposed!"
###Chapter 125

A faint smile curled at the corners of Isabella Valentine's lips.

She wiped away the tears at the corners of her eyes and took Tiffany Roscente's hand, her voice soft yet laced with persuasion. "Tiffany, I truly envy you. At least you still have the chance to pursue your own happiness. Unlike me..." She paused, a shadow flickering in her eyes. "Even though I'm about to marry your uncle, his heart..."

Tiffany immediately understood, her eyes blazing with fury. "That Sophia Lowell again!"

"I'm just worried about you," Isabella sighed. "Professor Orlando is so outstanding—it's inevitable that some people might get... improper ideas. Especially..." She hesitated deliberately. "I heard Sophia is currently teaching at the university, on the same campus as him."

"What?!" Tiffany clenched her fists so tightly her nails dug into her palms. "How dare she!"

Isabella subtly observed Tiffany's reaction before fanning the flames further. "What's even stranger is that she's just a fresh graduate, yet so many students are scrambling to attend her classes. There are already rumors circulating about her and Professor Orlando—"

"Shut up!" Tiffany suddenly snapped, her eyes glinting with something unhinged. "She won't get away with this!"

Isabella feigned alarm, covering her mouth. "I was only thinking of you—"

"Thinking of me?" Tiffany let out a cold laugh and pulled out her phone. "Let's see if she still has the face to stay at the university once her true colors are exposed!"

Isabella pretended to stop her. "Don't be rash. What if your uncle finds out—"

"Relax." Tiffany smirked darkly. "This time, I'll make sure she never recovers."

——

On the other side of the banquet hall, Theodore Orlando was guiding Sophia Lowell through the crowd of guests. He leaned down occasionally to whisper something in her ear, drawing curious glances from those around them.

"Is that the new protégé Professor Orlando took under his wing?"

"I heard she's exceptionally talented. Even he can't stop praising her."

Amid the murmurs, Sophia carried herself with effortless grace, unaware of the storm quietly brewing against her.
###Chapter 126

The banquet hall buzzed with clinking glasses and murmured conversations. Discreet glances kept drifting toward Sophia Lowell. Guests who couldn't penetrate Ethan Roscente's inner circle now flocked to the rising star designer.

Sophia swirled her champagne flute with slender fingers, maintaining a polished smile. Her attentive gaze and professional discourse disarmed even the most skeptical guests. After hearing her insights on architectural aesthetics, their initial probing turned to genuine admiration.

"Professor Orlando's protégé has an extraordinary future ahead."

"Her mother was Lilian Lowell? No wonder she's gifted."

Theodore Orlando's eyes crinkled with pride at the surrounding praise. His son Sebastian Valdemar approached with a cocktail, murmuring, "Father, this gala isn't just about architecture, is it?"

"Brat." Theodore chuckled. "Sophia needs a proper stage. With her talent, she'll surpass her mother's legacy."

Sebastian's gaze lingered on Sophia's slender waist. "Since Aunt Lilian helped you when the family pressured you to abandon architecture..."

"Do I need reminding?" Theodore huffed. "Without her intervention, I'd be stuck in business meetings instead of designing buildings."

Near the banquet's edge, Sophia discreetly massaged her lower back. Pregnancy had sapped her stamina, forcing her to seek refuge in a quiet corner.

Suddenly, murmurs rippled through the entrance.

Ethan Roscente strode in with commanding presence, his tailored suit accentuating his broad shoulders. The room's atmosphere shifted palpably at his arrival.

Sophia's fork clattered against her dessert plate.

The chandelier light carved sharp angles across his stern features, his aura deterring even the boldest socialites. Though guests fidgeted with anticipation, none dared approach first.

Sophia ducked her head, her pulse throbbing painfully. She fixed her gaze on the tablecloth, yet still felt the weight of his attention like a physical touch.

"Still have a sweet tooth?"

That familiar baritone voice rolled over her as a manicured hand slid a Black Forest cake toward her. The whipped cream's sweetness suddenly overwhelmed her senses, stealing her breath.
###Chapter 127

A sudden voice from above made Sophia's heart skip a beat.

She looked up to see Sebastian standing beside her, his presence unnoticed until now.

Her fingers unconsciously tightened around her skirt as she accepted the champagne he offered. "Thank you, Professor," she forced a smile.

Sebastian caught the fleeting sadness in her eyes before it vanished. His gaze instinctively shifted toward Ethan Roscente across the room.

The man who always carried an air of indifference had clearly glanced in their direction moments ago.

Though it lasted only a second, Sebastian was certain—Ethan had been looking at Sophia.

The realization coiled something tight in his chest.

Ethan watched the two with icy detachment.

When Sophia smiled at Sebastian, his grip on the wineglass turned dangerously rigid.

The guest speaking to him abruptly fell silent, unnerved by the sudden shift in the Roscente heir's demeanor.

Isabella emerged from the restroom and immediately spotted Sophia at the center of the crowd.

Even in a simple black gown, the girl shone like a pearl against velvet night.

She strode forward and possessively linked arms with Ethan.

Sophia's peripheral vision never left that commanding figure.

The sight of Isabella sent a hammerblow to her chest.

Then, impossibly, Ethan began walking toward her.

Her pulse roared—only to plummet when he passed by without acknowledgment.

"Sophia, come here."

Theodore Orlando's voice pulled her back.

Setting down her plate, she approached her mentor.

"Mr. Roscente, this is my most promising student, Sophia Lowell." Theodore smiled warmly. "I hope you'll guide her in the future."

Ethan's gaze swept over her with detached politeness, as though she were a stranger.

He swirled his wine. "Of course. Family should look after family."

The word "family" rolled off his tongue with deliberate weight, laced with unspoken implications.

Sophia's ears burned as she raised her juice glass. "To my dear uncle."

"Juice for a toast?" Ethan's sudden laugh held no warmth. "Do I not deserve proper respect?"

The air froze around them.

Sophia stared at the tray of red wine being circulated, fingers trembling.

She couldn't drink alcohol.

This secret had become her greatest vulnerability.
###Chapter 128

"Sorry, I'm on antibiotics for a cold." Sophia Lowell lifted her teacup, fingers trembling slightly.

Ethan Roscente tapped the table with his long fingers, his gaze darkening. "The same excuse isn't funny the second time."

Isabella Valentine's grip on her wineglass turned white-knuckled. When had these two gotten close again?

"Miss Lowell," she said, red lips parting, "it's rather rude to toast your elders with tea."

The air in the private room turned icy.

Sophia's cup hovered midair, her wrist already aching. Ethan's stare cut across her face like a blade.

"Mr. Roscente—" Theodore Orlando began, only to be silenced by his brother's sharp look.

Sebastian Valdemar raised his glass instead. "Let me drink in my junior's stead."

The crystal glasses clinked. Ethan watched him drain the wine in one go, then smirked.

"And what capacity are you drinking in, Professor Valdemar?" His fingers traced the rim of his glass. "Colleague? Or... boyfriend?"

Sophia suddenly clutched Sebastian's sleeve.

Memories of the Clementsons' fate sent cold sweat down her spine. "I'll drink," she whispered, voice shaking.

Sebastian frowned. "But you're—"

"Sebastian!" She cut him off, eyes reddening. "It's just one glass."

Ethan's chest tightened at her tearful expression. But when she turned to Sebastian with that trusting gaze, the anger flared again.

"Professor Valdemar trains his students well." He slammed his glass onto the lazy susan with a cold laugh. "Such an obedient protégé."

Theodore forced a chuckle while mentally cursing the entire Roscente lineage.
###Chapter 129

Theodore Orlando's temples throbbed with rage. He finally understood—Ethan Roscente was deliberately making things difficult for his prized student.

If he'd known Ethan was this despicable, he would never have introduced Sophia Lowell to this bastard.

A cold smile curled Sophia's lips as she plucked a fruit cocktail from a passing tray. She drained it in one gulp before giving Theodore a reassuring look. "Professor, I need to visit the ladies' room."

Theodore nudged his son. "Sebastian, accompany your junior."

Ethan watched their retreating figures with icy detachment, swirling his whiskey. The amber liquid cast frigid reflections in his merciless eyes.

In the restroom, Sophia bent over the toilet, expelling the alcohol. She splashed cold water on her face, droplets tracing her pallid cheeks.

"Bastard..." she hissed through clenched teeth. Though the drink had been minimal, the thought of her unborn child sent tremors through her.

Drying her face, she turned—only to meet Isabella Valentine's mocking gaze.

"Impressive tactics, Miss Lowell." Isabella blocked the exit, crimson lips twisting. "Chasing after Ethan when you know we're engaged?"

Sophia froze, her stare glacial. "If your vision's impaired, I suggest an emergency eye exam."

Isabella's gaze suddenly locked onto the jade hairpin in Sophia's hair. A vicious glint flashed in her eyes as she stroked her manicured nails. "Oh? Isn't this the custom piece Ethan commissioned for me? No wonder I couldn't find it."

Sophia's fingers twitched.

"He ordered it during that Denver business trip." Isabella leaned in, breath hot against Sophia's ear. "Pity I disliked the design. How does it feel, scavenging my rejects?"

Under the sterile restroom lights, the last vestiges of color drained from Sophia's face. She lifted her chin and laughed softly. "You're worshipping a man I've already discarded, yet dare lecture me?"
###Chapter 130

Sophia Lowell's fingertips lightly traced the jade hairpin in her updo as she flashed a radiant smile at the camera.

"Ethan personally styled my hair and said this pin suits me best." Her eyes glimmered with deliberate emphasis on the word "personally." "Since it doesn't look right on you, Isabella, perhaps it was never yours to begin with."

Isabella Valentine's smile froze instantly.

"You!" Her crimson-nailed fingers clenched the fabric of her gown. "How shameless, flaunting a man's attention!"

"Weren't you the one who started this?" Sophia's laugh was icy as she turned, her skirt swirling sharply. "Instead of wasting energy competing with me, focus on keeping your man in line. His constant pestering is exhausting."

The moment she stepped out of the ballroom, Sophia's poised posture collapsed.

She yanked out the hairpin. Moonlight glinted coldly off the milky jade.

"Trash collecting indeed," she muttered bitterly.

"Sophia!" Sebastian Valdemar hurried toward her, concern darkening his gaze as he took in her pallor. "Do you need medical attention?"

She shook her head, a damp strand of hair clinging to her temple.

Sebastian reached out instinctively. Just as his fingers brushed the stray lock, a camera flash exploded in the distance.

Around the restroom corner, Isabella examined the captured image with satisfaction. The photo showed Sebastian tenderly tucking Sophia's hair behind her ear—an undeniably intimate moment.

"Tiffany," she whispered into her phone, "Professor Valdemar is clearly smitten with Sophia."

Tiffany Roscente's reply appeared instantly: "Tonight, we'll expose her true colors to everyone."

Isabella pocketed her phone, her red lips curling into a venomous smile.

The terrace breeze carried a chill.

Sophia shivered involuntarily. Moments earlier, she'd felt serpentine eyes boring into her back.

"Cold?" Sebastian offered his jacket.

She declined with a shake of her head, gesturing toward the far balcony. "I need some space."

Moonlight pooled around her like liquid silver, failing to penetrate the shadows in her eyes. The hairpin—still warm from her grip—rested heavily in her palm, cold as glacial ice.
###Chapter 131

Sebastian Valdemar gave a slight nod, his gaze lingering on her retreating figure. "Be careful."

Sophia Lowell murmured an acknowledgment, her stiletto heels clicking as she walked toward the balcony.

Sebastian moved to follow, but a business partner suddenly intercepted him with pleasantries.

On the balcony, Ethan Roscente leaned against the railing, exhaling smoke into the night. Moonlight outlined his sharp silhouette, his expression obscured by swirling tendrils of cigarette haze.

Felix Roland approached with a champagne flute in hand. After discussing work, he lowered his voice. "Guess who I just saw? Your little rabbit."

Ash tumbled from Ethan's cigarette. His eyes turned glacial.

"She was clinging to some man," Felix drawled, swirling his drink. "Suit-and-tie elite type. The way he looked at her—practically undressing her with his eyes."

The cigarette was crushed violently against the railing.

"And?" Ethan's voice dripped with ice.

Felix lit a fresh cigarette with a scoff. "Stop pretending you don’t care. She’s clearly cutting ties." He blew a smoke ring for emphasis. "The whole company knows you got called a mediocre narcissist."

A glass thudded heavily against the table.

"Zachary Evans has a death wish," Ethan growled, darkness churning in his gaze.

"Don’t take it out on him," Felix said, amused. "Face it—if you won’t give her a real commitment—"

"Then what?" Ethan whirled, his shadow engulfing Felix. "Let her marry someone else? Have another man’s children?"

Felix coughed around his cigarette. "You can’t possibly—"

"She’ll never escape me." Ethan’s laugh was cold. "The moment she crashed into me, she was mine."

Felix shook his head. "Was it really her who made the first move?" He arched a meaningful brow. "That night, you were clearly—"

"Shut up." Ethan’s eyes narrowed dangerously.

Felix mimed zipping his lips but couldn’t resist muttering, "If she ever finds out about that drink—"

A sudden gust of wind billowed the curtains, casting Ethan’s profile into flickering shadows between the glow of his cigarette.
###Chapter 132

"Watch your mouth." Ethan Roscente's voice was icy.

Before the words faded, the terrace door slammed open.

Sophia Lowell stood in the doorway, her face pale with rage. Her trembling fingers clenched at her sides as she glared at Ethan.

Both Ethan and Felix Roland froze.

Felix swallowed hard. "Shit. She heard everything."

A vein throbbed at Ethan's temple. "Shut up."

"Should we call an ambulance first?" Felix suggested with barely concealed amusement.

"Get lost."

Sophia's nails dug into her palms. Step by step, she advanced, lifting the jade hairpin toward Ethan.

"Ethan Roscente, you're worse than an animal."

Gripping both ends of the hairpin, she snapped it in two with a sharp crack under his darkening gaze.

"If you dare harass me again," she hurled the broken pieces at his chest, "this will be you."

Before he could react, she snatched the wineglass from the table and flung its contents at his face.

Felix gasped.

Crimson liquid dripped down Ethan's sharp jawline, staining his white shirt like blood.

"Sophia!" Ethan's voice burned with fury.

"Serves you right." She smashed the glass and turned to leave.

Ethan moved to follow, but Felix yanked him back. "The press is swarming outside. Want to humiliate her further?"

He halted.

Wiping the wine from his face, his eyes turned venomous. "This is your fault."

Felix rubbed his nose sheepishly. "Who knew the door wasn't soundproof—"

A deafening crash interrupted him as Ethan kicked the terrace door off its hinges.
###Chapter 133

"If you can't control that mouth of yours, I'll gladly shut it for you." Ethan Roscente's gaze was sharp as a blade, his voice colder than ice.

Felix Roland pouted. "Why are you taking it out on me—"

Before he could finish, he noticed Ethan bending to pick up the broken jade hairpin from the floor. His eyes lit up with amusement. "Tsk, tsk. Sophia's got quite the grip. Can't even twist open a water bottle normally, but now she's snapping hairpins in half..." He stroked his chin thoughtfully. "Think she was aiming for your skull instead?"

Ethan stared at the fractured hairpin in his palm, his knuckles turning white. The sharp edges had left faint cuts, drawing blood.

"Care to test how thick your own skull is?" He lifted his gaze slowly, danger swirling in his eyes.

Felix immediately mimed zipping his lips shut.

Sophia Lowell stormed back into the banquet hall and downed a glass of juice in one gulp.

That bastard had played her!

All this time, she'd thought she was the one who'd lost control and climbed into his bed. The guilt had eaten at her. But it turned out Ethan had orchestrated everything.

No wonder there hadn't been a single bodyguard around that night. No wonder he'd been just drunk enough...

The more she thought about it, the angrier she got. She grabbed another glass and drained it.

Strange. Why was she feeling so dizzy?

Sophia rubbed her temples as an unnatural heat spread through her body. Her cheeks burned, and her breathing grew uneven.

She tugged at her collar, but it only made her feel hotter.

Sebastian Valdemar spotted Sophia slumped on a sofa, her hair cascading loosely. She irritably tucked a strand behind her ear, her flushed face unbearably adorable.

"What are you standing around for?" Theodore Orlando appeared behind him unexpectedly. "If you like her, go after her."

"But her heart—"

"So what if her heart belongs to someone else?" Theodore glared. "As long as she's not married, you've got a shot. A girl like that shouldn't go to waste on outsiders."

Sebastian smiled bitterly. "She's pregnant."

"What?!" Theodore's voice boomed. "Sophia's pregnant? Who's the father?"
###Chapter 134

Sebastian's pupils contracted. "You didn't know?"

"What should I know?" Theodore's face paled with shock before sudden understanding dawned. "No wonder the girl's been scrambling to take on extra projects..."

He'd assumed his father already knew about Sophia's condition. Regret twisted his gut for the careless slip. "Dad, forget what I said. I'm worried about how Sophia might—"

Theodore raised a hand, cutting him off. "Understood." His gaze hardened as it landed on Sophia in the distance. "When I find out which bastard took advantage of her, I'll skin him alive!"

He sighed heavily. "But this complicates your pursuit. That girl's stubborn like her mother—once she sets her mind, it's for life. If she's decided to keep the baby..."

Sebastian's eyes remained fixed on Sophia's retreating figure. "I won't give up."

"That's my boy!" Theodore clapped his son's shoulder. "I'll be waiting for that wedding toast."

Sophia's breathing grew labored, a sheen of sweat glistening on her forehead. Her fingers fumbled at her collar before she jerked her head up in alarm.

Recognizing Sebastian, she relaxed slightly. "Finished with your work, Professor?"

His brow furrowed at her flushed cheeks. "Are you unwell?"

"Just... stuffy." Her weak nod barely concealed her exhaustion. "No energy."

Sebastian pressed a palm to her forehead—normal temperature. "You need rest. Now."

Theodore hurried over. "What's wrong with Sophia?"

"Overexertion." Sebastian supported her swaying frame. "I'm taking her upstairs."

Opting not to disturb his father's recovery, Sebastian guided her straight to reception.

The clerk's fingers froze mid-air when taking Sophia's ID.

"Problem?" Sebastian's sharp eyes caught the hesitation.

"N-none at all!" The receptionist stammered, hands trembling as she processed the check-in.

The elevator doors had barely closed when she grabbed the phone. "Miss Tiffany? They're heading to 1808."

Tiffany's crimson lips curled. "Excellent. Someone will collect the keycard shortly. You know the drill."

"My payment—"

"Will be delivered in full." The line went dead as Tiffany's eyes glittered with malice.
###Chapter 135

Tiffany Roscente twirled her wine glass, her fingertip tracing the rim.

"The money's transferred," she sneered into the phone. "Remember—keep your mouth shut."

"Don't worry, Ms. Roscente. My lips are sealed."

She ended the call and dialed another number.

"The girl's in the room," she said, crimson lips curling. "I want crystal-clear footage. That bitch won't recover from this."

Oily assurances crackled through the receiver.

Tiffany downed the wine in one gulp, scarlet liquid trickling down her chin. She stared at the empty glass, venom flashing in her eyes.

"Sophia Lowell, how dare you steal my man?"

The crystal shattered against the wall.

Sebastian Valdemar steadied the swaying Sophia toward the elevator.

"Almost there," he murmured, swiping the keycard.

Her legs buckled. As Sebastian reached to catch her, a dark figure materialized from the shadows and yanked her into a steel embrace.

Sebastian looked up into glacial eyes.

Ethan Roscente stood there in a charcoal suit, shirt collar undone, radiating danger. His grip on Sophia's waist made her whimper.

"Ow..." She squirmed unconsciously.

Ethan smirked, clamping her wrist. "Hurts? Then you shouldn't have run."

Sophia blinked dazedly at the familiar face and slurred, "Stalker..."

Before she could finish, Ethan crushed his mouth to hers.

"Mmph—"

The sudden chill made her shudder. Instinctively, she parted her lips, craving more.

Ethan's eyes darkened with satisfaction. "Say my name," he growled against her ear.

"E-Ethan..." Her voice trembled.

Sebastian stood frozen, face bloodless. Now he understood Ethan's possessive stares, Sophia's conflicted reactions.

"Good girl." Ethan stroked her fevered cheek, then leveled Sebastian with an arctic glare as he lifted Sophia into his arms.

"Wait!" Sebastian blocked the exit. "You can't take her."

Ethan arched a brow. "Why not?"

"She's in no condition—"

"My woman," Ethan cut in, voice like shards of ice, "is none of your concern."
###Chapter 136

Sebastian Valdemar blocked the car, his fingers clenched until they turned white. His gaze locked onto Sophia Lowell's unconscious form in Ethan Roscente's arms, his Adam's apple bobbing. "Mr. Roscente, given your impending wedding, this is highly inappropriate."

Ethan smirked coldly, pulling Sophia closer. The heat of her feverish skin seeped through the fabric, darkening his eyes.

"My affairs are none of your concern."

He strode past Sebastian, lowering his voice as they brushed shoulders. "Remember this, Mr. Valdemar—every inch of Sophia, from her hair to her toes, belongs to me."

Sebastian stood frozen, watching the black Maybach vanish into the night.

Inside the car, the air thickened with a cloying sweetness. Sophia writhed unconsciously, her silk dress riding up her thighs, revealing luminous skin. She bit her lower lip hard enough to draw blood.

"Who drugged you?" Ethan gripped her chin, his voice icy.

Her only response was a kitten-like whimper. She clung to his shoulders, her scorching cheek brushing his pulse. His breath hitched as he slammed the partition button.

"Get out."

The driver scrambled to stop the car and fled into the darkness.

The backseat suddenly felt suffocating. Pinned against the leather seat, Sophia gasped as Ethan's hot breath grazed her ear. A flicker of clarity pierced her dazed eyes.

"Hospital... need to go..."

With one hand, Ethan loosened his tie and methodically bound her flailing wrists. He captured her earlobe between his teeth, relishing her violent tremors.

"Too late." His low chuckle sent shivers down her spine as his fingers traced her flushed collarbone. "You won't last ten minutes like this."

Sophia arched suddenly, tears streaming. The protective hand over her abdomen didn't escape Ethan's notice.

"Afraid?" His eyes darkened as he ripped open her collar. "Weren't you bold enough when you schemed against me?"

Faded love marks still marred her porcelain skin. The sight dragged Ethan back to that rainy night three years ago—eighteen-year-old Sophia in a soaked white dress, calling him "Uncle" with feigned innocence in the Roscente garden.

Even then, he'd wanted to tear that act apart.

"If you dared provoke me..." He sank his teeth into her shoulder. "...you'll never escape."

The car began rocking rhythmically. Moonlight spilled through the window, illuminating their entangled shadows. Sophia's cries dissolved into fragmented gasps against his lips.

In the distance, church bells tolled midnight. Ethan brushed damp strands from her forehead, his gaze stormy.

Tomorrow was his engagement party.

And the woman in his arms would forever remain his secret.
###Chapter 137

The drug took effect more violently than expected.

Sophia felt her blood boiling, every inch of her skin screaming with desire. She bit her lower lip hard, using the pain to cling to consciousness.

"Don't touch me..."

Her resistance was feeble. The moment her fingertips brushed Ethan's chest, her strength dissolved.

In the cramped confines of the car, Ethan effortlessly pinned her beneath him. He tore open her collar, his scorching lips branding her collarbone.

"Who else would you go to?" His voice dripped with icy danger. "Sebastian?"

The words stabbed like a knife.

Sophia's eyes reddened instantly, tears trembling on her lashes. "Ethan, you're always like this..." Her voice cracked. "Forcing me two years ago, and now—"

"Forcing?" He chuckled darkly, his heated breath searing her ear. "Your body says otherwise."

She raised a hand to strike, but he caught her wrist and pressed it into the seat.

"Feeling bold?" His eyes narrowed as his thumb traced slow circles on her palm. "Who was it that threw herself into my arms at the gala last night?"

Waves of heat crashed through her.

Sophia clenched her teeth, but a soft moan escaped her throat. Her rationality crumbled as she realized—her body was betraying her will.

"No..."

Her final protest dissolved into a whimper.

At last, she broke. Her arms wound around his neck, trembling as she offered her lips. The gesture ignited Ethan's fury and desire in equal measure.

"Sophia," he murmured against her flushed ear, his voice rough beyond recognition. "You never learn to be honest."

Night swallowed the last shreds of reason.

In a fleeting moment of clarity, Sophia clutched her abdomen, tears streaming as she pleaded, "Gently... It hurts..."

Ethan stilled.

Noticing how she'd been shielding her stomach, he assumed the drugs had upset her digestion. Uncharacteristically tender, he eased his movements. "Alright," he whispered, kissing away her tears. "Anything for you."

Sunlight filtered through the sheer curtains at three in the afternoon when Sophia awoke.

She found herself in the master bedroom of Bayview Residences. Fresh sheets, clean pajamas, even the scent of shampoo in her hair.

She flung back the covers.

No blood. No expected discomfort. Against all odds, Ethan had honored her plea with surprising gentleness.

The realization made her heart tremble.

Her phone lay silent on the nightstand—no work calls on a weekend. Wincing, she sat up, fingers absently tracing her flat stomach.

She needed a medical checkup.

Last night's alcohol, drugs, and rough intimacy could have harmed the life inside her. The thought jolted her awake, and she hurried to dress.

The mirror reflected a woman with a throat littered in marks.

Sophia closed her eyes, tightening her scarf. As she left the bedroom, she noticed a thermal lunchbox on the dining table beside familiar handwriting:

"Reheat before eating."

No signature. But she knew.
###Chapter 138

Sophia lay weakly in bed, her body aching. Ethan had already cleaned her up and even changed her into pajamas.

She lifted the covers, intending to find one of Ethan's shirts to wear.

The dress from last night had been torn beyond recognition—completely unwearable.

The moment her feet touched the floor, her legs gave out like limp noodles, nearly sending her crashing onto the carpet.

"Bastard..." she muttered through gritted teeth.

Ethan pushed the door open just in time to see Sophia sitting on the carpet, her face flushed with anger.

Though he couldn't make out her words, the way she clenched her jaw made it clear she was cursing him.

He strode over, towering above her.

"If you're thanking me for saving you last night, there's no need to bow so deeply," he teased, a smirk playing on his lips.

Sophia glared up at him. This man was always so infuriating.

She gripped the edge of the bed, trying to stand, but her legs betrayed her again.

Ethan swiftly caught her, pulling her into his arms. His deep voice held amusement. "This fragile?"

"Let go!" She shoved at him, her cheeks burning.

He released her but held out a tray instead. "Take this."

Sophia stared at the glass of water and the pill, confused. "What is it?"

"No protection last night," he said casually, as if discussing the weather. "This will prevent pregnancy."

The words stabbed through her like a knife.

Her face paled instantly, her fingers trembling. "So afraid I’d have your child?"

Ethan’s expression darkened, his voice turning icy. "I told you—I won’t let you get pregnant."

Even though she’d expected it, the pain still tore through her.

Sophia tilted her head back, forcing the tears away. "You’re cruel, Ethan."

She should’ve known better. Yet she kept testing him, foolishly hoping.

The worst part? Last night’s tenderness had made her believe in something impossible.

Seeing the redness in her eyes, Ethan’s chest tightened.

He brushed his thumb over her cheek, his tone softening. "Do you really want my child that badly?"

"If you—"

"No!" She slapped his hand away, her gaze icy. "Last night was just a mistake. A game between adults, nothing more."

Ethan’s eyes turned frigid. "Is that really how you see it?"

"What else? If you hadn’t shown up—"

"So I ruined your little reunion with your senior?" he sneered.

"Think whatever you want." Sophia turned her face away.
###Chapter 139

Sophia clenched the pill in her palm, her resolute gaze locking onto Ethan Roscente.

She threw her head back and swallowed the tablet. The dry gulp echoed sharply in the silent room.

"Happy now?" Her lips curled into a bitter smirk.

Ethan's eyes darkened instantly. He seized her slender wrist, his scorching fingers pressing hard enough to bruise bone.

"For that senior of yours, you'd really go this far." His voice dripped with ice.

Sophia wrenched free and strode toward the walk-in closet. Her fingertips brushed empty hangers before she remembered leaving without even a scarf.

A dress suddenly descended over her head.

"Wear this." Ethan stood at the threshold, holding a set of lace lingerie.

She snatched the garments and slammed the door. The moment the lock clicked, she spat the hidden pill into the toilet.

The flush erased all evidence.

When she emerged dressed, the man leaned against the foyer. His long fingers toyed with car keys while his gaze pinned her in place.

"Did I say you could leave?"

Her hand paused on her purse. "Planning unlawful confinement, Mr. Roscente?"

He forced her into a dining chair. A charred-edged omelet sat on the porcelain plate, its edges blackened like cinders.

"Your handiwork?" She arched a brow.

Ethan's ears flushed pink. "Michelin takeout."

She prodded the burnt crust with a fork. "They should fire their chef."

The air froze.

"Take it or leave it." He loosened his tie and sat opposite her.

Sophia meticulously sectioned the omelet. Beneath the crisp exterior, the yolk oozed golden. The sight transported her to a memory of a teenage boy who'd once blown up a kitchen.

"Does Ms. Valentine know?" she asked abruptly. "That her fiancé spent last night in another woman's bed?"

Silverware screeched against china. Ethan's knuckles whitened, his expression turning murderous.

"Must you phrase it like that?"

She pushed the plate away. As her skirt grazed the table edge, his strained voice followed:

"That child...if it had survived—"

Her entire body locked rigid.
###Chapter 140

At last night's gala, only two types of people would target her—those who hated her to the core, or those who wanted to humiliate her. Scanning the ballroom, Sophia could think of no one besides Tiffany Roscente and Isabella Valentine.

She suspected they had conspired. Tiffany, the brainless one, had always been Isabella's most obedient weapon.

"Not her." Ethan Roscente's firm voice cut through her thoughts.

Sophia's chest tightened. His defense of Isabella was always so unwavering.

"Even if she wasn't the mastermind, she's involved." Sophia clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms.

Ethan scoffed, exhaling a smoke ring. "Planning to weaponize public opinion again? Don't embarrass yourself."

His words stabbed straight through her heart.

"Of course. With you protecting her, no one can touch her." Sophia's lips curled into a bitter smile, her eyes icy.

A sudden phone ring shattered the tension. Sebastian Valdemar's name flashed on the screen, and Ethan's expression darkened instantly.

"Don't answer."

She pressed the call button anyway. The urgent voice on the other end made her face pale.

"Move!" She shoved past him.

Ethan seized her wrist. "You dare care for another man in front of me?"

Sophia stomped hard on his polished shoe, wrenching free as he hissed in pain. Behind her, Ethan's furious roar echoed just as the elevator doors slid shut.

In the hospital corridor, Vivian Valdemar paced anxiously, her pregnant belly prominent. Tears spilled the moment she saw Sophia.

"My dad—"

"Professor Orlando will be fine." Sophia pulled her trembling friend close. "You can't stress yourself right now."

Vivian sobbed. "He saw my stomach and—it's all my fault—"

Sophia rubbed her back, scanning the empty hallway. "Where's Sebastian?"

"Filling out paperwork." Vivian wiped her tears. "The doctor said his blood pressure is dangerously high. He could—"

The emergency light flicked off. Both women stood as the doctor emerged.
###Chapter 141

The emergency room doors swung open abruptly as the doctor removed his mask and stepped out.

"Family of Theodore Orlando?"

Sophia Lowell quickly supported Vivian Valdemar as they approached.

"I'm his daughter. How is my father?"

The doctor wiped his brow. "He fainted due to a sudden spike in blood pressure but is stable now. We recommend overnight observation."

When the nurses wheeled out the hospital bed, Theodore was already conscious.

Sebastian Valdemar pulled Sophia aside into a corridor corner.

"About last night..." He hesitated.

Sophia instinctively shielded her abdomen. "It's over."

Sebastian's gaze dropped to her hands. "Is the child Ethan Roscente's?"

She bit her lip and nodded.

"Does he know?"

"He never will." Her voice was barely audible. "This is my child."

After a pause, Sebastian spoke softly. "I'll keep your secret."

Sophia looked up in surprise.

"I trust you have your reasons." His eyes were gentle. "Come to me if you need help."

Her eyes stung. Finding understanding at such a moment felt like a miracle.

"Should you get checked?" Sebastian asked with concern. "After last night's ordeal..."

"I was just heading there." She glanced toward the hospital room. "Stay with the professor."

The maternity ward was on the second floor.

The test results were normal. Sophia exhaled in relief.

As she stepped out of the examination room, a familiar voice carried down the hallway.

"Isn't that Professor Lowell?"

Felix Roland stood with his new girlfriend, gaping at the maternity ward sign.

His girlfriend asked curiously, "Is the professor married?"

"Holy—!" Felix yanked out his phone. "Ethan's gonna be a dad?!"
###Chapter 142

Felix Roland hung up the phone, a mischievous grin still playing on his lips. He glanced at his petite girlfriend curled up on the couch, clutching her stomach, and casually tossed his jacket over her.

"Sweetheart, I need to make an important call."

The moment the line connected, he blurted out, "Ethan Roscente, congratulations! You're going to be a father!"

Ethan was reviewing documents in his office when the words made his pen halt, ink bleeding across the paper. "What nonsense are you spouting?"

"Don't play dumb." Felix chuckled suggestively. "Emily Laurent is pregnant. No wonder you were so smug yesterday—fatherhood suits you."

The pen slammed onto the desk with a sharp crack. Ethan shot to his feet, two buttons of his suit popping open. "Say that again."

The hospital room reeked of antiseptic. Sophia Lowell pushed the door open to find Theodore Orlando propped against the pillows, his face as pale as parchment.

"Professor, you're awake?" She hurried to the bedside. "Should I call the doctor?"

Theodore waved her off, his gaze sliding past her to his daughter. "Thanks to this devoted child, I nearly met my maker ahead of schedule."

"Dad..." Vivian Valdemar twisted her fingers, eyes rimmed red.

Sophia gently pressed Theodore's IV-pierced hand. "Professor, you're about to become a grandfather. This is a happy occasion." She lowered her voice. "Vivian is pregnant. She shouldn't be stressed."

"Happy?" Theodore scoffed. "I raised this girl for twenty years, and some boar rooted up my cabbage without even asking!"

Vivian's tears splattered onto the sheets. Sophia shot her a look, urging her to seize the moment.

"Think about it," Sophia whispered near the old man's ear. "A chubby little grandchild calling you 'Grandpa,' toddling after you..."

The stern lines of Theodore's face softened slightly. Sophia pressed her advantage. "Scolding Vivian won't change anything. Focus on recovering so you can hold that baby."

The professor sighed heavily, his conflicted eyes returning to his daughter. "I just worry this child will burden you..."

"Dad!" Vivian threw herself against the bed, tears soaking the blanket. "I was wrong... I've missed you every single day these past two years..."

Theodore turned his face away, but not before Sophia caught the glimmer in his eyes. "You'll be the death of me..."
###Chapter 143

"Dad, I'm sorry..."

Vivian Valdemar's soft voice drifted from the hospital room. Sophia Lowell stood outside the door, her lips curling into an unconscious smile. She quietly stepped back, leaving the space for the father and daughter.

Sophia had just settled onto the hallway bench when a shadow loomed over her.

"Sophia!"

Ethan Roscente's voice was icy. He seized her wrist with enough force to make her wince.

"Pregnant?" His words were gritted out. "You've got some nerve."

Sophia's heart skipped. She lifted her gaze to meet his stormy eyes. Those usually charming peach-blossom eyes now burned with fury, his jaw clenched tight.

"What pregnancy?" She forced calm into her voice.

Ethan sneered and flung a medical report at her. The paper grazed her cheek before fluttering to the ground.

"Obstetrics?" He leaned in, his voice dangerously low. "Didn't I tell you you're unworthy of carrying my child?"

Her fingers turned cold. Bending down, she picked up the report and exhaled in relief when she saw the name.

"This belongs to my senior." She slapped the paper against Ethan's chest. "What's wrong with you?"

He yanked her toward the elevators.

"Tests." His tone was unyielding. "Now."

"Let go!" Sophia struggled, colliding with Vivian who had just stepped out of the room.

"Sophie?" Vivian frowned, immediately shielding her. "Sir, no disturbances allowed in the hospital."

Ethan's eyes narrowed. He recognized this pregnant woman—the one Sebastian Valdemar had accompanied that day.

"Pathetic," he mocked, glancing at Sophia. "Even sucking up to Sebastian's wife for his sake?"

Sophia laughed in disbelief.

"This is my senior's younger sister!" She wrenched her wrist free. "Donate your eyes if you're not using them."

The air froze. Ethan stared at Vivian's face, his expression stiffening.

Vivian blinked, then suddenly linked arms with Sophia. "Darling, who's this lunatic?"

Watching Ethan's livid face, Sophia felt an unexpected surge of satisfaction.
###Chapter 144

Sophia Lowell curled her lips in a cold smile, flicking the pregnancy test report with her fingertips. "If you don't believe me, Mr. Roscente, feel free to check Vivian Valdemar's medical records."

She met the man's stormy gaze head-on, her tone dripping with sarcasm. "I know my place. I wouldn't humiliate myself like that. But your constant suspicion makes you look rather foolish."

Without waiting for a response, she grabbed Vivian's arm and stormed out, slamming the hospital room door behind her.

In the hallway, Ethan Roscente stared at the closed door, his chest tight with frustration.

He loosened his tie irritably, fingers absently tracing the outline of his lighter. He should've felt relieved. So why did hearing she'd picked up the report for someone else leave him with this inexplicable emptiness?

"Felix. Where are you?" His voice was glacial when the call connected.

"At the boxing club," Felix Roland answered cheerfully, his girlfriend giggling in the background. "What, daddyhood making you wanna throw punches?"

Ethan crushed his cigarette, eyes flashing dangerously. "Wait for me."

Inside the room, Vivian peeked through the door crack and whistled. "He's gone. Looked like he was about to commit murder."

Sophia snorted. Thank god she'd had the foresight to use Vivian's name at registration. The thought of Felix's big mouth made her grit her teeth.

"Do all rich families keep attack dogs like that?" Vivian patted her chest, still shaken. "My brother's on his way. He'll drive you home."

Evening light filtered through the curtains, casting dappled shadows across the hospital bed. Sophia politely declined Sebastian Valdemar's offer and left alone—just in time to see Ethan's Maybach roar out of the hospital parking lot.

The late-night call gave her a headache. Felix wailed on the other end, "Save me! Your man's trying to kill me—"

The next day in the hospital corridor, a limping Felix approached with blackened eyes. Sophia glanced at his arm cast and parted her red lips. "Karma."

The architecture exhibition gala was in full swing. Industry elites flocked around Theodore Orlando while discreetly sliding business cards toward Sophia. Her schedule filled so fast she barely had time to sip water between appointments.
###Chapter 145

Ethan Roscente had been drowning in work lately.

Files piled high on his desk like a mountain range. Dark circles shadowed his eyes after consecutive all-nighters. The scratch of his fountain pen echoed sharply in the silent office.

"Mr. Roscente, everything is arranged for Young Master Jason."

Zachary Evans entered with enrollment documents fresh from Seattle University.

Ethan didn't look up. His slender fingers turned a contract page. "Hmm."

"Jason seems thrilled with the theater program. Says it's more exciting than studying abroad." Zachary chose his words carefully.

Jason Roscente was the family's notorious troublemaker. Since his father's death, the boy had wreaked havoc overseas—bar fights, drunken antics, school complaints flooding Ethan's private line.

Bringing him back and enrolling him in theater...

Zachary stole a glance at his boss.

The man's chiseled profile looked especially severe under the desk lamp. Even his eyelashes cast intimidating shadows.

"Did you see Sophia?" Ethan's question sliced the air.

Zachary's pulse jumped.

"Y-yes. She ran into Jason after class. They chatted briefly—"

The pen tip paused, bleeding ink across the page.

Ethan lifted his gaze slowly. Dark pupils swallowed all light.

"Too much free time?"

Three words turned Zachary's spine to ice.

"None at all! I'll get back to work!" He spun toward the door.

"Wait."

Zachary froze.

"No bonus this month."

Thunderstruck.

The assistant retreated miserably. As the door clicked shut, he glimpsed Ethan already bent over paperwork again—a marble statue with shadows carving his sharp nose bridge.

Something was off.

Very off.

Ethan always protected Sophia fiercely beneath his cold exterior. This reaction...

Zachary scratched his head.

A lovers' quarrel?
###Chapter 146

The office door had just clicked shut when Zachary heard a heavy sigh behind him.

"Got chewed out again?"

The sudden voice made him jump. He turned to see Felix's bruised face and blurted out, "Mr. Roland, did someone come after you?"

Felix's expression darkened further. "Thanks to your precious Mr. Roscente," he ground out.

He'd come hoping to unwind, only to get pummeled by Ethan the moment they sparred. If not for his decent reflexes, he'd be in a hospital bed right now.

Zachary swallowed hard, eyeing the bruises.

Suddenly, his bonus deduction didn't seem so bad.

"Here to see Mr. Roscente?" Zachary forced a laugh. "Friendly warning—he's not in the best mood today."

Felix scoffed. "When is he ever?"

Fair point.

Zachary nodded in agreement, then noticed the file in Felix's hand. "Business?"

Felix waved the folder with a smug grin. "Guess what this is."

"Something good?"

"The Luming Project proposal." Felix smirked. "Thought I'd give your boss a preview. Show him what real professionalism looks like."

He hadn't forgotten Ethan's snide remarks about his taste last time. Today, he'd reclaim the upper hand.

This proposal should've been submitted when Ethan returned to New York, but it got delayed. If not for the project team's reminders, he might've forgotten entirely.

Probably because that bastard Ethan scrambled his brains last time.

Zachary stepped aside. "Go ahead. But tread lightly—don't set him off again."

Felix waved him off and pushed the door open.

"Busy, Mr. Roscente?"

Ethan didn't look up. "What do you want?" His peripheral vision caught Felix's garish shirt, and he frowned. "Spend any more time in nightclubs, and you'll catch something."

Felix fired back, "Oh, like you're so virtuous. That stone face of yours scares everyone off. Sophia still won't give you the time of day."

Ethan's pen stilled.

"Girls these days prefer sunny guys like me," Felix continued, gaining momentum. "Your gloomy act just makes them run. That professor hanging around Sophia seems perfect for her—same field, good looks. Imagine their kids—"

A vein throbbed at Ethan's temple.

He pinched the bridge of his nose. "State your business or get out."

Seeing Ethan's expression, Felix slapped the file onto the desk and perched on its edge. "Already cracking? Pathetic."

Ethan's gaze turned glacial, zeroing in on the side of Felix's thigh touching the desk. "Looking to die?"

Felix's entire left side went numb.
###Chapter 147
Ethan Roscente leaned back in his leather chair, a lit cigarette held between his slender fingers.

Smoke curled around him as he narrowed his eyes at the door.

Felix Roland pushed it open, his suit jacket slung carelessly over one shoulder, his tie loose around his neck.

"Well, well, Ethan, lost in thought?" Felix grinned as he sauntered closer.

Ethan didn’t even bother to look up. "What do you want?"

Felix plopped onto the edge of the desk and picked up a pen, twirling it between his fingers. "Just here to deliver a little surprise."

"Get off." Ethan’s icy gaze flicked to where Felix was sitting.

Felix immediately hopped down, dramatically brushing off the desk. "Wouldn’t dare disrespect the boss’s territory."

He slid a file toward Ethan. "Luming Studio just sent over their new design proposal. Take a look."

Ethan stubbed out his cigarette and flipped open the file.

His fingers paused slightly as the first page revealed the design sketch.

The fluid lines of the architectural outline leaped off the page, seamlessly blending traditional elements with modern aesthetics.

Felix studied his expression. "Well?"

Ethan turned the page without a hint of reaction. "Passable."

"Just passable?" Felix’s eyes widened. "This was unanimously approved by the entire project team!"

When Ethan reached the last page, his gaze lingered on the designer’s signature.

"Lilian?" He raised an eyebrow. "A newcomer?"

Felix nodded eagerly. "Yeah, freshly scouted by Luming. No big reputation yet, but her skills—"

"No." Ethan shut the file decisively.

"What?" Felix nearly jumped. "You’re rejecting a design this good?"

Ethan stood, looking down at him with cool detachment. "An unknown designer, no matter how talented, isn’t worth the risk."

"Luming recommended her!"

"An outsider." Ethan smirked. "Never met her. No idea who she really is."

Felix scratched his head in frustration. "Since when are you this rigid?"

Ethan had already turned toward the floor-to-ceiling window, his posture radiating finality.

Felix stared at the back of his head, then suddenly grinned. "Fine. I’ll have her come meet you in person."

Ethan didn’t turn around. "Not interested."

"You will be." Felix’s voice dripped with implication. "She’s a rare beauty."

The window’s reflection showed Ethan’s slight frown.

Felix seized the moment to shove the file into his desk drawer. "Three p.m. tomorrow. Don’t be late."

He bolted before Ethan could refuse.

Silence reclaimed the office.

Ethan stared at the drawer for a long moment before finally pulling out the proposal again.

The signature on the design stood out starkly.

Lilian.
###Chapter 148

Felix Roland tapped his fingers lightly on the desk, his sharp gaze catching the key point in the other man's words. "So you're saying you'll approve the proposal as long as you meet the designer in person?"

"Perhaps." Ethan Roscente exhaled a slow stream of smoke, his chiseled profile half-hidden behind the haze.

"What do you mean, 'perhaps'?" Felix frowned in irritation. "I need a clear answer."

"I'll know when I see them."

Felix scoffed and snatched the design drafts from the table. "Fine. Since it's Mr. Roscente's request, I'll make sure they show up. Don't go back on your word."

The corner of Ethan's lips lifted, but his eyes remained cold.

"Oh, and one more thing," Felix suddenly turned serious. "What I said earlier about Sophia and Professor Orlando wasn't a joke."

The cigarette between Ethan's fingers tightened imperceptibly.

"I went to the hospital for a dressing change these past few days and kept running into Sophia there." Felix lowered his voice. "Rumor has it she's been taking care of Professor Orlando's hospitalized father. Meeting the parents already—aren't you worried?"

"Meeting the parents?" Ethan's eyes darkened instantly, the air around him turning icy.

Felix shrugged. "If you don't make a move soon, the wedding invitation will land on your desk."

The cigarette was crushed violently into the ashtray. Ethan's jaw clenched, shadows swirling in his gaze.

This woman clearly hadn't taken his words seriously at all.

Late at night, Sophia Lowell had just stepped out of the shower when the doorbell rang.

Wrapped loosely in a silk slip dress, she padded barefoot to the door.

"Vivian, did you forget your key aga—"

Her words died abruptly.

Ethan stood outside, his expression stormy. His gaze lingered on her exposed collarbone for a fraction of a second before darkening further.

"You answer the door like this for strangers?"

SLAM!

The only response he got was the door slamming shut in his face.
###Chapter 149

Ethan's nose nearly touched the door.

He took half a step back, his face dark with anger. "Sophia," he ground out through clenched teeth.

Inside the bedroom, Sophia ignored him, pulling the covers over herself.

BANG! BANG! BANG!

The deafening knocks exploded through the apartment.

She yanked the blanket over her head, but the sound pierced through, growing more urgent with each strike.

"Who the hell is banging doors at this hour?"
"I'm calling the cops!"
Neighbors' angry shouts rose from nearby apartments.

Ethan paid no attention, only knocking harder. "Open this door, or I'll break it down."

Sophia rolled over, unmoving.

Old Mrs. Li from across the hall shuffled out in her robe, blinking at Ethan in surprise.

"Young man, who are you looking for so late?"

Instantly, Ethan's expression softened into concern. "My girlfriend is inside. She's not feeling well—her cycle—and I'm worried something might be wrong..."

Mrs. Li's face melted with sympathy. "Ah, young couples these days, always so dramatic. Wait here, dear. Let me talk some sense into her."

Sophia heard every word.

She threw off the covers. How dare he twist the truth!

"Mrs. Li, don't believe him! He's just a—"

Before she could finish, Ethan shouldered past the door and slammed it shut behind him.

"A wanted criminal? A home invader?" His eyes narrowed dangerously. "Your storytelling skills are improving, Ms. Lowell."

Sophia backed away, watching him warily. "What do you want?"

Ethan leisurely undid his cufflinks, a slow smirk curling his lips. "To collect what you owe me."
###Chapter 150
The night was ink-black, neon lights flickering beyond the floor-to-ceiling windows.

Sophia had just stepped out of the shower, water droplets still clinging to her hair. As she towel-dried the damp strands, her bedroom door burst open with violent force.

A cold gust swept in, carrying the scent of cedarwood and an underlying sweetness of perfume. Her nose wrinkled at the cloying fragrance, stomach churning.

"Ethan Roscente, have you lost your mind?" Her fingers tightened around the towel, knuckles bleaching white.

His towering frame eclipsed her, suit jacket draped carelessly over one arm. He loosened his tie with a single tug, Adam's apple bobbing. "Seems I've been too lenient with you."

Sophia retreated until the dressing table pressed against her back. The chilled surface seeped through her thin nightgown, drawing an involuntary shiver.

"Lenient?" Her laugh was brittle. "You must be drunk, Mr. Roscente. Isabella Valentine's suite is next door at the Ritz."

Ethan's eyes darkened. He seized her wrist with enough force to make her gasp.

"Sebastian Valdemar's father is hospitalized, and you're playing the devoted nurse." His voice dripped ice. "Three hospital visits in one day? People might mistake you for the Valdemars' daughter-in-law."

Her pupils contracted. She hadn't expected him to track her movements so meticulously.

"He's my thesis advisor!" She twisted against his grip. "Let go!"

Instead of releasing her, he yanked her flush against his chest. Hot breath scorched her ear. "That lingering gaze at the charity gala—did you think I wouldn't notice?"

A humorless smile curved her lips. "Is this jealousy?" Deliberately, she inhaled near his collar. "Pity. That perfume drowns out any vinegar."

His fingers clamped around her chin.

"Sharp tongue." His thumb traced her lower lip. "Needs correcting."

Her heartbeat stuttered. The position was dangerously intimate, her hands instinctively shielding her abdomen.

"Scared now?" Ethan noted the protective gesture with a sneer. "Where was this caution when you were cozying up to Sebastian?"

"You're being irrational!" She raised her knee to strike.

He anticipated the move, pinning her leg with his own. Their proximity allowed her to count each obsidian eyelash.

"Remember your place." The words rumbled deep in his chest. "As long as I draw breath, no other man lays claim to you."

Tremors of rage wracked her frame. "What gives you the right—"

"The right of being your uncle." He enunciated each syllable. "Sufficient justification?"

A bitter laugh escaped her. "Then enlighten me, Uncle. What exactly are you doing in your niece's bedroom after midnight?"

Ethan's expression blackened. He released her abruptly.

Sophia staggered before regaining balance, putting distance between them. Rubbing her reddened wrist, she leveled a wary glare.

"Get out." She pointed to the doorway. "Or I'm calling the police."

Adjusting his cufflinks, he smirked. "By all means." He withdrew his phone with deliberate slowness. "Shall I dial for you? Let's see how officers react to photos of Mrs. Roscente canoodling with her lover."

Her breath hitched. The screen displayed a snapshot of her and Sebastian outside the hospital.

"You had me followed?" Her voice wavered.

He pocketed the device, gaze venomous. "Final warning. If I catch you near Sebastian again..." A deliberate pause. "The Valdemars will vanish from Manhattan."

The door slammed shut with enough force to rattle the walls.

Her legs gave out, collapsing onto the bed's edge. Fingers tracing gentle circles over her stomach, unshed tears glistened.

"Don't be afraid, little one..." she whispered. "Mommy will keep you safe."

Outside, black taillights of a Maybach disappeared into the night. Ethan's grip on the steering wheel turned his tendons into raised ridges. The car phone chirped.

"Mr. Roscente, regarding the Valdemar situation—"

"Proceed as planned." His interruption was arctic. "I want results within the week."
###Chapter 151

The calico cat arched its back, hissing at Ethan Roscente with its fur standing on end. I quickly gathered it into my arms, gently smoothing its bristled coat.

"Don't be scared, sweetheart. Mama's here."

Ethan watched us with cold indifference before suddenly reaching for the cat's scruff. I sidestepped, his fingers barely grazing my hair.

"What are you doing?" I sneered. "Can't even leave a cat alone?"

He withdrew his hand, adjusting his cuff with deliberate nonchalance. "After all these years, that ugly thing still hasn't improved."

The calico seemed to understand, growling low in its throat. I scratched under its chin soothingly and glared at Ethan.

"My daughter is far prettier than you." I lifted the cat higher, taunting him. "Look at her coat, her markings. You won't find another like her in the entire neighborhood."

His gaze lingered on the calico before he scoffed. "Your daughter?"

He stepped closer, forcing me back until my shoulders hit the wall. Caging me with one arm, he leaned down, his breath warm against my ear. "Since when could you give birth to cats, Sophia?"

The scent of tobacco and his cologne overwhelmed me. I turned my face away, setting the cat on the floor.

"None of your business." I shoved at his chest. "If you're bored, go find your precious Isabella."

He didn't budge. Instead, his fingers closed around my wrist. "So you are hung up on Isabella."

I twisted, but his grip tightened. His thumb stroked my inner wrist as his voice dropped. "Could it be... jealousy?"

"Jealous?" I laughed bitterly. "Ethan Roscente, you overestimate yourself."

His eyes darkened, fingers digging in. Pain shot through my arm, but I refused to flinch.

"If you hadn't taken advantage when I was vulnerable, I'd never have anything to do with you." I met his gaze head-on. "Stop pretending to care now."

The air turned glacial. Just as I braced for his anger, he released me and strolled to the sofa.

"Denial is just confirmation." He sprawled across the cushions, crossing his long legs. "The more you resist, Sophia, the more entertaining this becomes."

Rubbing my reddened wrist, I watched him pull a cigarette case from his pocket.

"Smoke outside." I snatched it away. "You're not welcome here."

He raised a brow, then yanked me forward. I stumbled onto his lap, trapped in his arms.

"Then what is welcome?" His lips brushed my earlobe. "Like last time?"

I jerked upright. The calico immediately lunged, spitting at him.

"Get out!" I pointed to the door. "Now!"

Ethan rose leisurely, straightening his suit. At the threshold, he glanced back. "Seven tomorrow night. I'll pick you up."

"I'm not going."

"You don't have a choice." His smirk sent chills down my spine. "Unless you've forgotten your aunt's debts."

The door clicked shut. The calico raced over, clawing at the wood. I knelt to gather it close, my hands trembling.

"Mama's okay." I nuzzled its soft head. "That bastard won't hurt us again."

But the voice in my mind laughed coldly: Who are you trying to fool, Sophia? The cat—or yourself?
###Chapter 152

Sophia tightened her coat collar, her gaze icy.

"Think whatever you want."

She turned toward the bedroom.

If she couldn't get rid of this nuisance, she'd rather not see him at all.

Her wrist was suddenly seized. Ethan Roscente's voice held an unyielding command. "I'm hungry. Cook for me."

Sophia tried to wrench free, but his grip didn't budge. She took a deep breath, forcing down her anger. "Are you some kind of beggar?"

Ethan yanked her against him, his large hand locking around her waist. His hot breath brushed her ear. "Either feed me, or I'll feed on you. Choose."

His low voice carried an electric current, sending shivers from her ear down her spine.

Sophia stayed silent for a few seconds before suddenly widening her eyes. "Ethan, were you an oil merchant in your past life?"

The man narrowed his gaze.

"You're so greasy it's nauseating." She smirked.

Ethan's expression darkened.

Seizing the moment, Sophia broke free and retreated to the bedroom to change. She emerged with her bag. "Let's go."

"Where?"

"Grocery shopping. The fridge is empty."

Ethan leaned against the sofa, his sharp eyes scanning her. "Trying to trick me into leaving?"

Sophia's fingers twitched.

Damn, he saw right through her.

She feigned calm. "I even brought my bag. Even if I got you out, you'd just shamelessly follow me back, wouldn't you?"

Impatiently, she urged, "The supermarket's about to close. Keep dawdling, and you'll starve."

After a long scrutiny, Ethan finally stood.

"Wait."

Sophia suddenly dashed into the kitchen and returned with a box of tiramisu. "Eat this first."

Ethan raised a brow. "Since when are you so considerate?"

"Just worried you'll lose your mind from hunger." She rolled her eyes, tearing open the packaging and taking a bite. "See? Not poisoned."

Ethan frowned at the cream on her lips. "I don't eat sweets."
###Chapter 153

"Try this tiramisu. The sweetness is just right." Sophia pushed the last two cake slices toward Ethan. "I saved them especially for you."

He frowned but took a bite.

"Good?" Her eyes sparkled with anticipation.

Against his better judgment, Ethan nodded. "Passable."

Sophia immediately shoved the second piece at him. "Take them both."

The black Maybach idled outside her apartment complex. Sophia checked her watch. "The nearby supermarket's closing soon. Let's go to the one on Riverside Drive."

Ethan had no desire to run errands after dessert, but her eager expression made him turn the wheel.

"Take a right up ahead—it's faster," Sophia suddenly pointed to a narrow side road.

Ethan glanced at the navigation screen. A DUI checkpoint flashed ahead. "We're detouring."

"Why? You haven't been drinking." She rolled down her window, letting the night breeze tangle her hair. "This route leads straight to the supermarket parking lot. Detouring will make us late."

His eyes narrowed. "What are you plotting, Sophia?"

"Me? Scheming?" She blinked with exaggerated innocence. "The store's really about to close."

Ethan studied her for three long seconds before turning onto the shortcut.

Police officers were packing up their breathalyzer equipment.

Sophia suddenly leaned out the window and shouted, "Officer! This man's driving drunk!"

Ethan slammed the brakes, grabbing her wrist. "Have you lost your mind?"

"He drank an entire bottle of red wine!" She wrenched free and kept yelling, "I begged him to call a driver, but he insisted on getting behind the wheel!"

An officer immediately blocked their path.

"Sophia." Ethan's voice could freeze hell. "You'll regret this."

She tilted her head, smiling. "That's for the police to decide."

A sharp knock rattled the window. The officer said sternly, "Step out of the vehicle, please."

Sophia hopped out and pointed dramatically at the driver's seat. "That's him! Completely wasted, swerving all over the road—it was terrifying!"
###Chapter 154

"Sophia! Shut your mouth!" Ethan Roscente glared at the reckless woman before him, his jaw clenched in fury.

Sophia Lowell instantly transformed into a frightened rabbit, darting behind the traffic officer. Her voice trembled with fake tears. "Officer, look how he’s threatening me! I’m terrified he’ll hit me..."

The officer immediately stepped forward, shielding her. "Daring to threaten someone in front of the police? Outrageous! Xiao Zhang, run a breathalyzer on him!"

The young officer approached with the device. "Sir, please blow into this."

Ethan’s dark eyes burned into Sophia, a storm of rage swirling in their depths.

From behind the officer’s back, Sophia stuck out her tongue at him, silently taunting: Come on, try and catch me.

A vein throbbed at Ethan’s temple as he forced himself to exhale into the device.

"Test confirms alcohol in his system," the officer announced sternly. "Sir, you’ll need to come with us."

"Impossible!" Ethan snapped, his sharp gaze slicing toward Sophia. "The tiramisu—"

Sophia tilted her chin up smugly, mouthing: Surprise!

"Still making excuses?" The officer waved impatiently. "Take him away!"

Ethan let out a cold laugh. "I’m the CEO of Roscente Group—"

"I don’t care who you are!" the officer cut him off. "Drunk driving is illegal!"

Sophia chimed in sweetly. "Officer, I barely know him. He dragged me into his car outside a bar..."

"What? And now kidnapping?" The officer’s eyes blazed. "That’s an additional charge!"

Ethan’s expression darkened to murderous levels. He enunciated each word slowly. "Sophia. You’re dead."

Sophia shrank behind the officer, trembling dramatically. "Officer, he’s threatening me again!"

"Don’t worry," the officer reassured her, patting her shoulder. "He won’t lay a finger on you with us here. Go home, miss."

Sophia bowed obediently. "Thank you, Officer!"

As the police car sped away, Sophia pulled out her phone and dialed Zachary Evans. "Zach, your boss got arrested for drunk driving. Better bail him out from XX precinct—fast."

"What?" Zachary’s sleepiness vanished. "Mr. Roscente would never—"

"Don’t believe me? Listen." Sophia held her phone toward the fading siren. "If you don’t hurry, he’ll be spending the night in a cell."

###Chapter 155

"Miss Lowell, why do I sense a hint of schadenfreude in your tone?" Zachary Evans's voice came through the phone.

I bit my lip to suppress a laugh.

Wasn't it obvious?

"Mr. Evans, the priority now is to get Mr. Roscente released as soon as possible," I feigned urgency.

The sound of rustling clothes came from the other end. "I'm on my way."

After hanging up, I couldn't hold back my laughter. Just then, my ride arrived.

I had booked this car while still in Ethan's vehicle, ready to make my escape the moment the traffic police took him away.

Serves him right. Who told him to harass me all the time?

As for the tiramisu, Vivian had bought it three months ago. I never dared to eat it because of the alcohol content—it was probably expired by now.

But none of that mattered anymore.

Humming a tune, I slid into the car and headed home to sleep in high spirits.

......

Outside the police station, Ethan's expression was darker than storm clouds.

The police chief personally escorted him out, sweat beading on his forehead. "Mr. Roscente, safe travels. We welcome you next—"

He immediately regretted his words.

Ethan's gaze turned even frostier.

"Don't worry, Mr. Roscente. These two idiots will be severely disciplined!" The chief glared at the traffic officers.

The two officers shrank back, not daring to breathe too loudly.

They never imagined they'd pulled over the one person in New York no one dared to cross.

Ethan gave them a cold once-over before suddenly asking, "What's the penalty for filing a false police report?"

The officers stammered an explanation. Seeing his expression darken further, one added, "But the young lady didn’t technically file a false report. The tiramisu did test positive for alcohol..."

"Shut up!" The chief kicked him.

Ethan narrowed his eyes, a dangerous smirk playing on his lips.

"Mr. Roscente, how would you like to handle Miss Lowell?" Zachary asked cautiously.

It was the first time he'd seen anyone dare to mess with his boss like this.

Ethan motioned for a bodyguard and murmured instructions.

The bodyguard visibly hesitated.

"Problem?" Ethan's voice was glacial.

"None! It'll be done immediately!"

As the black sedan sped off, Zachary shuddered.

Angering the devil would be preferable to crossing Ethan.

Miss Lowell was in for a world of trouble.
###Chapter 156

At four in the morning, Sophia Lowell jolted awake, pierced by a bone-chilling cold.

Her fingers fumbled for the bedside switch. Light flooded the room, revealing the windows tightly shut as always.

An icy draft seeped through the door crack, carrying a biting chill.

She tightened her robe around her and stepped barefoot onto the floor.

The moment she pushed open the bedroom door, her pupils constricted in shock.

The living room was in chaos.

Cushions lay scattered across the floor. Papers from the coffee table swirled in the air.

The most horrifying sight—the security door had vanished.

The glass balcony door was also gone, leaving the room exposed to the howling wind.

Her calico cat trembled in its bed, fur standing on end.

"Meow—"

The pitiful sound twisted Sophia's heart.

She rushed to inspect the doorframe and found the screws neatly lined up in the corner.

This was too precise.

Only that lunatic Ethan Roscente could pull off something like this.

"Bastard!"

She scooped up the cat and hurried back to the bedroom, only to find the hinges already loosened.

Clearly, he'd shown mercy.

Before dawn, she soothed the frightened feline while calling a security door installation company.

"Ten this morning? Yes, please hurry."

After hanging up, she sent a voice message to Grandma Lee next door.

In the classroom, students buzzed with excitement.

"Professor Lowell, leaving so fast? Going to see Professor Valdemar?"

"We saw you at the architecture exhibit last time!"

Sophia massaged her temples. "Someone broke into my apartment. I need to get the door fixed."

Gasps erupted.

"Who would do that?"

"Was it Professor Valdemar?"

Sophia nearly choked on the chalk dust. "Don't be ridiculous!"

She grabbed her lesson plans and fled, only to be cornered at the hallway turn.

Tiffany Roscente blocked her path, crimson nails gleaming.

"Sophia," she hissed. "Stay away from Sebastian."

Sophia arched a brow. "Tell him that, not me."

"You bitch!" Tiffany's hand flew up.

Sophia caught her wrist mid-air.

As they stood locked in tension, rapid footsteps echoed down the hall.
###Chapter 157

Sophia narrowed her eyes, her gaze sweeping over Tiffany's face.

The girl looked like a cat with its tail stepped on, teeth clenched in fury.

"What's wrong? Got rejected by Professor Valdemar and decided to take it out on me?" Sophia's lips curled into a mocking smile.

Tiffany's pupils constricted, her nails digging deep into her palms.

Her failed plan at the banquet still stung, but now Sebastian wanted to transfer her to another professor. She'd refused, only to be met with colder indifference.

Same lectures. Same guidance. Yet an invisible wall had risen between them.

This had to be that bitch Sophia's doing!

"Stop pretending!" Tiffany's voice trembled. "If you hadn't poisoned Professor Valdemar's mind—"

Sophia cut her off. "Need I remind you what Professor Valdemar hates most?"

She stepped closer, lowering her voice. "Students who shift blame."

Tiffany's hand flew up.

The slap never landed. A lean hand intercepted it midair.

"Jason!" Tiffany shrieked, struggling. "Have you lost your mind? Taking an outsider's side against family?"

The young man stood with one hand in his pocket, effortlessly restraining her. His school jacket hung carelessly over one shoulder.

"Tch." He tilted his head, studying her. "You look no different from a fishwife screaming in the market."

A crowd of students had gathered to watch the spectacle.

Tiffany paled. Her carefully crafted gentle persona was crumbling.

"At least I'm better than you!" she hissed. "Everyone knows about your scandals overseas. Uncle would—"

"I earned those scandals fair and square." Jason released her with a shrug. "What about you? Besides the Roscente name, what do you have?"

Sophia nearly laughed aloud.

The infamous troublemaker lived up to his reputation when it came to verbal sparring.

Tiffany's chest heaved, strands of her perfectly styled curls coming loose. Her venomous glare locked onto Sophia.

"This isn't over."

With those words, she turned and fled into the crowd, her stiff back resembling a wooden plank.
###Chapter 158

Sophia's lips curled into a mocking smile.

No wonder Tiffany Roscente and Isabella Valentine were best friends.

She checked her watch and nodded politely at Jason Roscente. "Thanks."

She turned to leave.

"Hold up."

Jason stood with one hand in his pocket, his voice laced with lazy arrogance.

Sophia glanced back. "Something else?"

"You—" He hesitated.

Sophia frowned impatiently.

"You're my step-aunt's niece?" Jason finally blurted out.

"Yeah. Got a problem with that?"

"Nah." He grinned. "From now on, I've got your back at Seattle U."

Sophia nearly laughed.

He sounded like a street thug.

She forced a tight smile and walked away.

Jason watched her retreating figure, his gaze thoughtful.

By the time she got home, the installers were visibly annoyed.

Sophia apologized repeatedly as they fitted the new door.

Her bank balance shrank by another five digits.

She gritted her teeth, cursing Ethan Roscente under her breath.

Then an idea struck.

She grabbed her phone and ordered a delivery service.

"Place this speaker near the Roscente Group building." She handed over a small black device. "Avoid the cameras."

The delivery guy accidentally hit the play button.

"A former Roscente Group employee wishes Ethan Roscente a happy marriage! May you be a groom every night and father ten babies a year!"

His hand jerked. "Miss Lowell, will I get arrested for this?"

"Extra pay." She transferred another sum. "Set it to loop."

The delivery guy swallowed hard at the amount.

Money talks.

After he left, Sophia packed in a frenzy, grabbed Calico, and fled to Vivian Ashcroft's place.

The moment she opened the door, a wave of perfume hit her.

Vivian, clad in a sequined gown, pinned her against the wall with a dramatic flourish.

"Darling," she purred around a rose stem, eyes gleaming. "Free tonight?"

Sophia played along, looping an arm around her neck. "What does the lady desire?"

"Ugh." Vivian abruptly released her. "Too cringe. Even I can't handle it."

Sophia shoved her away. "What terrible script is this?"

A fresh screenplay lay on the coffee table.

"Rich Family Tragic Love." Vivian rolled her eyes. "I play the heiress seducing her bodyguard."

She lowered her voice. "But the paycheck could buy a penthouse."
###Chapter 159

Sophia flipped open the script with a frown. "Another villainess role?"

Vivian Ashcroft lifted her chin proudly. "Of course. I'm the queen of villainesses. My goal is to play every wicked supporting role out there!"

"Such ambition." Sophia rolled her eyes. "Can't you aim higher?"

Vivian shrugged. "No one's offering me better roles."

Sophia slung an arm around her shoulders. "When I make it big, I'll produce a female-led drama just for you."

"Long live my sugar mama!" Vivian immediately clung to Sophia's arm like an eager puppy.

......

Outside the Roscente Group headquarters.

Ethan Roscente stepped out with his executives, heading toward his car.

A blaring horn shattered the quiet.

"Former Roscente employee wishes the universe's biggest scumbag Ethan Roscente a happy wedding! May you have a new bride every night, sire ten babies at once, and fill the world with your offspring!"

The entire plaza fell silent.

The air turned to ice.

Passing employees froze, slowly turning to stare at Ethan.

His handsome face darkened like a thundercloud.

The loudspeaker kept looping the message.

Executives twitched, shooting Ethan sympathetic looks.

So this was why the CEO avoided women...

Several balding executives unconsciously straightened their postures.

Zachary Evans nearly collapsed as he opened the car door.

His first thought: Did Sophia do this?

He glanced back to see Ethan scanning the crowd with icy eyes.

"Surely none of you believe this childish prank?"

The executives exchanged uneasy glances.

An elderly board member spoke gravely. "Ethan, son, there's no shame in seeking treatment..."

A vein throbbed at Ethan's temple. "I'm perfectly functional."

Zachary almost bit his tongue.

The executives turned to stone.

Their aloof, celibate CEO had just publicly declared his virility?

Thud!

A bodyguard finally located the speaker hidden in the flowerbed—and dropped it in shock.
###Chapter 160

Every eye in the room snapped toward Ethan Roscente.

Bodyguards fumbled for the switch. A sharp click echoed as the jarring recording cut off.

The room plunged into silence so deep you could hear a pin drop.

Zachary Evans broke out in a cold sweat under Ethan's murderous glare. He forced a smile. "Everyone, Mr. Roscente is... very capable... always... persistent..."

Before he could finish, all gazes involuntarily dropped to Ethan's crotch.

Ethan's face darkened. His knuckles turned white.

The air froze for ten solid seconds.

"Zachary." Ethan's voice was icy, each word dripping with menace.

Zachary stiffened. "This is slander from competitors! Anyone who discusses it will be treated as corporate spies!"

"Yes, sir!"

The thunderous response made passing employees turn their heads.

Ethan stormed into his car. The temperature inside plummeted the moment the door slammed shut.

"Where's Sophia?" His voice could freeze hell.

Zachary handed over a tablet with trembling hands. "Ms. Lowell has no classes this afternoon..."

Ethan scanned the schedule, then smiled dangerously. "Head to Waterside Gardens."

"But the dinner meeting tonight—"

"Didn't they say I'm 'incapable'?" Ethan sneered. "I'm going to get 'treated.'"

Zachary nearly dropped the tablet.

Thirty minutes later, Ethan stood in the empty apartment, his expression black as storm clouds. He kicked over the coffee table, sending glass shards flying.

Meanwhile, Sophia stretched lazily in bed, blissfully unaware of the tempest she'd stirred.
###Chapter 161

The golden glow of sunset streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows. Sophia curled up in the beanbag chair, flipping through a book. Vivian's apartment now looked completely refreshed after her meticulous cleaning, even the air smelled crisper.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Theodore popped up: "The proposal got approved. The client loved it."

Sophia arched an eyebrow. That was much faster than she'd anticipated.

"So soon?" she typed back.

"The client couldn't stop praising your design," Theodore replied instantly. Then came the ellipsis: "But..."

Sophia stared at those three dots, her fingers lightly tapping the book's pages.

The phone suddenly rang.

"The client wants to meet the designer," Theodore's voice came through the receiver. "It's a joint project between the Roscentes and Rolands."

Sophia's grip tightened.

Ethan Roscente and Felix Roland.

Those names pierced her nerves like needles.

"I'm guessing you'd rather not," Theodore said gently. "I can decline for you."

The distant sound of ocean waves drifted through the window. Sophia gazed at the churning sea in the distance.

She knew Ethan too well. Once that man grew suspicious, he wouldn't let go easily. Refusing this meeting could mean the entire proposal getting scrapped.

"Let me think about it," she murmured.

After hanging up, Sophia massaged her temples. This wasn't just about her—it involved Luming Studio's reputation. Her mentor had been anticipating this long-term collaboration for ages. She couldn't let personal feelings ruin it.

The sea breeze lifted the curtains, carrying its briny scent. Sophia took a deep breath and picked up her phone.

"I'll meet them."
###Chapter 162

Ethan Roscente detected the hesitation in her voice and softened his tone. "Sophia, don't push yourself. Luming Studio isn't short on projects."

Sophia Lowell's lips curved slightly. "I understand, Professor."

"Good. Get some rest."

The call ended, and the smile faded from Sophia's face. She stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, absently tracing the edge of her phone.

Theodore Orlando quickly replied to Felix Roland: "Mr. Roland, Lilian's schedule is packed. She needs time to consider the meeting."

Felix stared at his phone, brow furrowed. He typed rapidly: "Are you sure you conveyed it properly? Does she know who wants to see her?"

"Of course," Theodore replied promptly. "But she's genuinely swamped. I hope you'll understand."

Understand?

Felix nearly threw his phone. Since when did Felix Roland need to understand anyone?

Remembering the bold claims he'd made to Ethan, his temples throbbed.

If this fell through...

He took a deep breath, forcing down his irritation. "Fine. Give her time. But the project won't wait. There are plenty of architecture firms."

Theodore sent a smiling emoji. "Mutual understanding is key."

Felix responded with a passive-aggressive smiley and angrily locked his screen.

Two days passed.

When Theodore's message finally arrived—"Lilian has agreed to meet"—Felix was lounging at a private club with a drink in hand. He bolted upright from the couch.

"It's happening!" He practically sprinted to Ethan's side. "Lilian said yes. When are you free?"

Ethan swirled his glass without looking up. "It's just dinner. Why the fuss?"

"This is a billion-dollar project!" Felix rubbed his hands together excitedly. "Once the resort is built, profits could multiply tenfold."

Ethan scoffed. "Pathetic."

"So? When?"

"Whenever." The man downed his drink, tone indifferent.

Felix's eyes gleamed as he leaned in. "I bet the designer's a knockout. Maybe this’ll lead to something more."

Ethan stood, straightening his suit jacket. "More like a middle-aged woman with thinning hair."

"Wanna bet?" Felix pressed. "If she's stunning, what then?"

"Childish."

Felix suddenly grinned. "Heard you got arrested for drunk driving the other day?"

Ethan froze. His gaze turned icy. "Who told you that?"

"It's all over the circle," Felix said, barely containing his laughter. "Rumor has it the cops hauled you in during a vice raid."

Ethan's expression darkened.

Felix's curiosity grew. "What really happened? Who reported you?"

"Sophia. Lowell." Ethan ground out each syllable through clenched teeth.
###Chapter 163

Felix Roland nearly fell out of his seat laughing after hearing Ethan Roscente's story.

"Sophia Lowell really got you good!" He slapped his thigh, tears of laughter forming at the corners of his eyes. "The mighty Ethan Roscente, taken down by a drunk driving report!"

Ethan shot him a frosty glare.

Unfazed, Felix slid into the driver's seat. "This has to make the top ten news stories of the year in New York!"

"Find it amusing?" Ethan's voice was icy.

"Hilarious!" Felix buckled his seatbelt, still wheezing with laughter. "I can just picture you in handcuffs—"

The car window rolled down before he could finish.

"Officer," Ethan nodded toward a traffic cop on the sidewalk. "This man's driving under the influence."

Felix's grin froze.

"Damn it, Ethan! You're serious?!" He whipped his head around just as the officer approached.

Calmly stepping out, Ethan dialed Zachary Evans.

"Instant karma," he remarked coolly before walking away without a backward glance.

Felix was still cursing as the cop yanked him from the car. The breathalyzer lit up red immediately.

When Zachary arrived, he found Felix being loaded into a police cruiser.

"Mr. Roland is...?"

"Drunk driving." Ethan settled into the backseat, his tone as casual as discussing the weather.

Zachary inhaled sharply. "What a coincidence..."

"I reported him."

The car fell silent.

Zachary's grip on the steering wheel tightened as he stole a glance at his boss through the rearview mirror—this was next-level petty revenge.

Meanwhile, Sophia Lowell was having lunch with Vivian Ashcroft.

Her phone buzzed with Theodore Orlando's name flashing on the screen.

"Han Palace Restaurant tomorrow noon. They requested that location." Theodore's voice came through the receiver. "I'll have our design director accompany you."

Sophia's chopsticks paused mid-air. "Understood."

"Remember," he added after a beat, "never compromise."

After hanging up, Vivian leaned in. "What's wrong? You've been distracted lately."

"Important client meeting tomorrow." Sophia stirred her soup absently.

Vivian gave her shoulder an encouraging pat. "With your skills, you'll nail it!"

Sophia forced a smile, her heart heavy. She hadn't told Vivian the truth—tomorrow, she'd be facing Ethan Roscente.
###Chapter 164

Vivian kicked the suitcase, but it didn't budge.

"Leaving tomorrow?" She pouted. "It's not like I'll be gone forever."

Sophia stuffed the last piece of clothing into her bag. "You'll be filming from dawn till dusk. What's the difference between that and me living alone here?"

"Any progress on dodging Ethan?"

"His temper should've cooled by now." Sophia zipped up the backpack. "He can't possibly hunt me down for three months."

Vivian burst into laughter. "I bet Ethan's face is priceless right now."

"Getting tricked twice in a row." A faint smile touched Sophia's lips. "He's probably fuming."

"Watch out for revenge." Vivian suddenly lowered her voice. "That bastard holds grudges."

Sophia's fingers stilled.

That night, she had a nightmare. Ethan chased her with a knife, her legs heavy as lead. Just as the blade touched her back, she jolted awake.

Morning light streamed through the window.

Her morning class ended quickly. After assigning homework, Sophia hurried out of campus.

Vincent Laurent, the design director of Luming Studio, had been waiting in the café. The forty-something man in a crisp suit stood immediately when she entered.

"Nervous?" Vincent noticed her white-knuckled grip on the bag strap in the elevator.

Sophia forced a smile. "A little."

"Leave it to me." He handed her a business card. "Just nod when needed."

At a private booth on the second floor of Han Palace, Felix Roland was fuming into his phone.

"You stood me up?" He gritted his teeth. "We're not done with last night!"

The sound of rustling papers came through the line.

"In a meeting." Ethan's voice was flat.

Felix was about to curse when he spotted the waiter leading two people over. His phone nearly slipped into his teacup at the sight of the woman in a beige trench coat.

"Sophia?"

The line went dead silent.

Felix narrowed his eyes at the approaching pair. He recognized Vincent. But the woman beside him...

"How interesting." He chuckled into the phone. "Your little designer is Sophia Lowell."

The lemon slice in his teacup slowly sank to the bottom.
Twilight deepened as city lights flickered to life.

I stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, gazing at the glittering skyline. My reflection in the glass revealed a weary face, eyes shadowed with quiet unease.

My phone lit up with a message from Assistant Lin: "Mr. Roscente, the emergency board meeting has been moved to 8 PM tonight."

My fingers hovered over the screen before I typed a reply: "Understood."

Outside, neon signs pulsed and traffic streamed past. The vibrant cityscape contrasted sharply with my mood.

Turning away, I picked up the quarterly report from my desk. The numbers were impressive, but I knew they weren’t enough.

In the descending elevator, I adjusted my cufflinks. The mirrored walls reflected my tense jawline.

The doors slid open with a soft ding.

The conference room was already full. Every head turned as I entered.

"Mr. Roscente, about the new project—"

I raised a hand to cut them off. "Data first."

The projector hummed to life, charts and graphs illuminating the screen.

Silence settled over the room.

My gaze swept the table, lingering on one empty seat.

"Director Li is absent again?"

Assistant Lin lowered his voice. "He claims he’s unwell..."

A cold smirk curled my lips as I snapped the folder shut.

"Then we’re done here."

As I stood, I caught the exchanged glances between several board members.

My phone buzzed again outside—this time, an unknown number:

"Watch your back."

I stared at the message until the screen went dark.

Night thickened.

Pausing at the building’s entrance, I looked up at the lit office on the top floor.

Someone was waiting for me there.

I knew exactly who.
###Chapter 165

Ethan strode into the presidential suite on the top floor of the hotel.

The elevator doors slid open silently. He walked with purposeful strides toward the suite.

Five minutes later, Mr. and Mrs. Zhang arrived, trembling under the watchful eyes of the bodyguards. They knocked on the door with shaking hands.

"Have a seat."

Ethan's voice was icy.

"Th-thank you, Mr. Roscente."

Mrs. Zhang's hands trembled so badly she nearly knocked over the water glass on the coffee table.

Mr. Zhang steadied his wife, forcing composure. They sat across from Ethan like obedient schoolchildren.

The air grew thick with tension.

"Mr. Zhang."

Ethan tapped the table lightly with his long fingers. The sound wasn't loud, but it made the couple flinch.

"I called you here today to discuss your son, Zachary."

Mrs. Zhang's head snapped up, her lips pale. "Mr. Roscente, this must be a misunderstanding! Zachary would never—"

"He's been harassing my wife."

The words exploded like a bomb in the room.

Mr. Zhang's teacup slipped from his fingers and shattered on the floor, tea splashing everywhere.

"Impossible..." Mrs. Zhang's voice shook. "Zachary likes..."

Her eyes widened suddenly, as if realizing something horrifying.

Mr. Zhang broke out in a cold sweat. "Mr. Roscente, your wife is...?"

"Sophia."

The name made Mrs. Zhang collapse against the sofa. She remembered the threats she'd once made to Sophia, and her back instantly soaked with sweat.

Mr. Zhang's face turned ashen. Now he understood why the Roscente Group had suddenly turned against the Zhang family.

The woman envied by every socialite in the city—Ethan's wife—was Sophia.

"Mr. Roscente, we truly didn't know..." Mr. Zhang's voice quivered. "Zachary, he..."

"I don't need explanations."

Ethan's gaze was sharp as a blade.

"Control your son. Or else..."

The unspoken threat was more terrifying than any words.

Mrs. Zhang clutched her husband's sleeve so tightly her nails nearly pierced the fabric.

She was suddenly grateful she hadn't actually harmed Sophia.

Otherwise, the Zhang family would already be...

"We will discipline him strictly!" Mr. Zhang nearly shouted.

Ethan stood, looking down at them with cold authority.

"Remember your words today."
###Chapter 166

Felix Roland immediately saw through Ethan Roscente's intentions.

He calmly lifted his wine glass, maintaining a polite smile. "This is Vincent Laurent, our design director from Luming Studio. And this is our designer..."

His gaze lingered meaningfully between them. "Lilian."

Vincent stood hastily. "Mr. Roscente."

When Sophia Lowell remained frozen, he cleared his throat. "Lilian?"

Sophia snapped back to reality, fingers trembling slightly. "Mr. Roscente."

Ethan's eyes held hers for three full seconds before turning to shake Vincent's hand.

As he pivoted, he extended his hand toward Sophia. "Lilian. I've heard so much about you."

Her breath hitched.

Was he pretending not to know her?

Hesitantly, she offered her hand. "You flatter me, Mr. Roscente."

His palm was warm and broad, but his thumb secretly traced circles around her wrist bone where no one could see.

Sophia's ears burned.

The audacity of this man—flirting in public!

She tried to pull away, but his grip tightened.

"Lilian's designs are extraordinary," Ethan said evenly, though danger flickered in his eyes.

Sophia gritted her teeth. "Too kind, Mr. Roscente."

He suddenly squeezed harder, making her wince.

Still holding a grudge, obviously.

Vincent eyed their clasped hands and remembered Theodore Orlando's warning. "Mr. Roscente?"

Ethan ignored him.

His fingertip brushed her knuckles as he murmured, "What hand cream do you use? The texture is exquisite."

Felix nearly choked on his drink.

"Mr. Roscente has a... unique habit," he interjected awkwardly. "He can't resist beautiful hands."

Vincent forced a laugh. "How... distinctive."

"Lilian seems to be enjoying it," Ethan observed, staring at Sophia's flushed earlobes.

Enjoy this, my ass!

Sophia suppressed her fury. "Please call me Sophia."

"Ah, so you have a Chinese name." Amusement laced his tone.

She finally wrested her hand free. "My oversight."

Ethan released her with visible satisfaction, triumph glinting in his eyes.

Felix leaned in to whisper, "You're shameless."
###Chapter 167

Ethan Roscente slid the menu toward Sophia Lowell with his slender fingers, a faint smile playing on his lips. "Ladies first, Miss Lowell."

Sophia's fingertips trembled slightly as she glanced at the menu before quickly looking away. "You can decide."

"So indifferent?"

His deep voice sent a jolt through her chest.

She clenched the fabric of her skirt. "I'm not picky."

Ethan chuckled, his gaze loaded with meaning. "How accommodating."

The tips of her ears burned, but she pretended not to catch the sarcasm in his tone.

A server approached. "Any recommendations, sir?"

Ethan flipped through the menu idly. "What are your specialties?"

The server listed a few mild Cantonese dishes.

"We'll take them all." He closed the menu abruptly. "And add some Sichuan dishes for the lady—the spicier, the better."

Sophia's head snapped up.

Since her pregnancy, she'd avoided anything spicy. Even the smell of chili turned her stomach.

"My stomach hasn't been well lately..." she murmured.

Ethan smirked. "But you used to love spicy food, didn't you?"

Each word struck like a knife, precisely where it hurt most.

Every dish he ordered had once been her favorite.

Felix Roland gave Ethan a puzzled look. "Since when did you change your taste?"

Ethan's eyes flickered toward Sophia. "Someone corrupted me."

Water sloshed from Sophia's glass onto her hand.

She looked up in panic, meeting his dark gaze before hastily turning away.

He remembered.

Remembered how she used to pester him into eating spicy food with her. Remembered her triumphant smile every time she got her way.

Felix let out a knowing hum. "Didn't expect you to change your habits for a woman."

Sophia stared fixedly at the napkin's embroidery.

It wasn't change.

It was compromise, bought with night after night of intimacy. Every time she forced him to eat spicy food, he'd exact his revenge in bed.

Looking back now, real love shouldn't require transactions.
###Chapter 168

I stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, gazing at the city lights below.

The night wind rushed through the half-open window, tousling my hair.

My phone screen lit up with a message from Ethan Roscente: "Business dinner tonight. Don’t wait up."

I stared at it until the screen went dark.

The signed divorce papers lay on the coffee table, waiting for the final step.

The doorbell rang.

I opened the door to find Bianca Savigny standing there.

She wore the red dress Ethan loved most, her makeup flawless.

"Aren’t you going to invite me in, sis?" She smiled sweetly.

I stepped aside.

Her eyes swept the room, lingering on the documents.

"So you’ve finally come to your senses." She settled onto the sofa. "Ethan said he has a surprise for me tonight."

I poured her a glass of water.

"Do you know what he loves most about me?" She took the glass. "He says I’m more understanding than you."

I remained silent.

"Oh," she pulled a photo from her bag, "this was taken in the Maldives last week."

In the picture, Ethan held her waist as they kissed at sunset.

My fingers trembled slightly.

"You’ve actually been divorced for a while, haven’t you?" she said suddenly. "You just refused to sign."

My head snapped up.

She smirked. "Ethan told me everything."

Outside, lightning split the sky.

The rain poured down in sheets.
###Chapter 169

The black Maybach glided smoothly along the ring highway.

Sophia's slender fingers rested lightly on the steering wheel. Her profile looked especially striking in the golden sunset. "Master Ye," she said softly, "Grandfather has been mentioning you often these days. He's worried you might not have time to attend his birthday banquet."

Ye Chen leaned back in the leather seat, his gaze drifting past the fleeting scenery outside. "I never go back on my word."

"Grandfather will be overjoyed to hear you're coming." A faint smile touched Sophia's lips. "He told me privately that seeing you is his greatest wish for this celebration."

Ye Chen's brow twitched slightly.

He knew exactly why the old man was so eager. The miraculous transformation of Shi Tianqi after taking the Rejuvenation Pill must have ignited the elder's longing.

To ordinary people, the Rejuvenation Pill was a priceless treasure for longevity. But to him, it was merely a common item easily obtained. The thousand-year-old snow ginseng was the true rarity.

"Oh," Sophia suddenly remembered, "Grandfather specifically invited several of your friends."

"Oh?" Ye Chen's interest was piqued.

"Vice Chairman Wang Dongxue will be there." Sophia glanced at the rearview mirror. "I heard you two are close?"

Ye Chen nodded. "Indeed."

"And the heads of the Wang and Qin families." Sophia paused. "As well as... Wei Liang."

At the mention of Wei Liang, a glint of amusement flashed in Ye Chen's eyes. "He's been managing Wei Pharmaceuticals quite well."

Sophia chuckled. "I heard his father and brother are still digging for ginseng in the Changbai Mountains?"

"They enjoy it there," Ye Chen replied flatly.

"Latest update," Sophia said with a playful blink. "A heavy snow recently trapped them in the mountains. They stole a villager's chicken and were beaten so badly they couldn't get out of bed. Now they're surviving on tree bark."

Ye Chen arched an eyebrow. "You seem quite invested in their affairs."

"Just curious." A faint blush colored Sophia's ears. "The ones sent to the coal mines in Shanxi have it worse—twelve-hour workdays, crying themselves to sleep every night."

A low laugh rumbled from Ye Chen in the quiet car.
Ethan Roscente's grip was ironclad, pinning Sophia Lowell's slender wrist against the wall.

She tilted her chin up, meeting those fathomless dark eyes.

"Architectural design?" His voice dripped with ice. "You've hidden your talents well."

A mocking smile curled Sophia's lips. "With your busy schedule, Mr. Roscente, when would you have time to notice my affairs?"

She emphasized the word "my" deliberately.

Ethan's gaze darkened as his thumb pressed hard against her lower lip. "You chose today to debut your work. Was this your idea of humiliation?"

A sharp pain lanced through Sophia's chest. For a fleeting moment, hurt flashed in her eyes.

So in his mind, every move she made had ulterior motives.

"You flatter yourself," she said suddenly, her smile brightening. "I simply took a commission."

The warmth of her skin beneath his fingertips made Ethan's breath hitch.

"Liar." He leaned closer. "Felix went out of his way to notify me. Wasn't that your doing?"

Sophia's pupils constricted.

She hadn't expected Felix to interfere.

"Cat got your tongue?" Ethan sneered, his thumb pressing into her collarbone. "You used to play the obedient little lamb. Now you've grown claws."

The words ignited Sophia's fury.

"Let go!" She jerked her knee upward.

Ethan anticipated the move, pinning her leg with his own. Their bodies pressed together seamlessly, her back flush against the wall. She could feel the rise and fall of his chest.

"You—" Heat crept up Sophia's ears.

The man's eyes darkened further as his hand slid beneath her blouse.

Cold fingers grazed her waist, making her shudder.

"Ethan Roscente!" Her voice trembled. "You're disgusting!"

He chuckled, his palm gliding over bare skin. "You were putting on quite the show earlier."

Sophia's eyes burned with unshed tears.

Abruptly, she stopped struggling and met his gaze head-on. "So the great Mr. Roscente prefers forcing himself on women?"

The words doused Ethan like cold water.

He stilled, the storm in his eyes gradually receding.

"Sharp tongue." Releasing her, he adjusted his cufflinks. "My office. Nine tomorrow."

Sophia blinked. "Why should I?"

"Because," he said over his shoulder, "I'm taking your design proposal."

The door slammed shut. Sophia's legs gave out, and she slid down the wall, trembling fingers pressed to her lips.

A humorless laugh escaped her.

What was this?

Cruelty followed by crumbs of kindness?

She clenched her fists until her nails bit into her palms.

Ethan Roscente, do you really think this will make me obey?
###Chapter 170

"After behaving like a beast so many times, what's one more?"

Sophia's breath hitched.

This man had the audacity of a fortress wall.

"Besides," he drawled, lifting his gaze to her flushed cheeks with smoldering intensity, his voice rough with desire, "who was the one who climbed into my bed first and said I could do whatever I wanted with her waist? Now that I want to claim that offer, why the resistance?"

The memory made Sophia's ears burn crimson.

All those shameless words he'd coaxed from her lips had become ammunition against her.

"Let go." She turned her face away, her voice barely above a whisper.

She tried twisting her wrist free.

The movement made Ethan's eyes darken dangerously.

His grip tightened like a vise, his voice a controlled threat. "Apologize for lying to me."

Sophia's head snapped up. "What lie?"

"Architect." He bit out the word.

She scoffed. "That's literally my degree. If you hadn't forced me into being your secretary, I would've started in the field right after graduation."

Drawing a sharp breath, she continued, "You're the one who never cared. Now you're playing the victim? Ethan Roscente, who gave you that right?"

"So you're blaming me for neglecting you?" His eyes narrowed.

"I wouldn't dare." Her laugh was icy. "Someone like me isn't worth your attention."

"Enough with the sarcasm. Apologize!"

Seeing his stubbornness, Sophia gritted her teeth. "Fine. I'm sorr—" She tacked on, "Not actually sorry."

Ethan's expression turned thunderous. "Word games now?"

Watching his frustration, Sophia arched a brow. "Fun, isn't it? Though I'm surprised a beast understands human language. Impressive evolution, Ethan."

"Sophia!" His voice was pure gritted teeth.

She smirked. "Unlike certain animals, I don't have a tail to tuck—"

Her taunt was cut off as his mouth crashed onto hers.

The kiss was punishment—all teeth and dominance. His hands gripped her waist possessively, fingers digging into the sensitive curve.

"Mmph—"
###Chapter 171

Sophia's toes curled involuntarily as a soft moan escaped her lips.

The sound was sweet and sultry, sending a shiver down Ethan's spine.

He pulled back slightly, gazing down at her defiant eyes. "Do you understand your mistake now?"

The kiss had been fierce and relentless, leaving Sophia dizzy. Gasping for air, her swollen lips parted slightly—an irresistible sight.

Ethan's eyes darkened with desire as he leaned in again. Sophia quickly surrendered, her voice soft as cotton candy. "I understand..."

The fire in Ethan's chest subsided. Seeing her unusually docile expression, his grip loosened slightly.

Seizing the moment, Sophia shoved him away and darted off like a slippery fish.

A dull thud echoed as Ethan's lower back slammed against the stair railing. He winced in pain, looking up just in time to catch a glimpse of Sophia's retreating figure.

This woman played dirty.

Grimacing, he straightened up slowly, all romantic notions thoroughly knocked out of him.

Sophia didn't stop running until she was certain Ethan wasn't pursuing her. Catching her breath, she smoothed her disheveled clothes and stormed back to the private dining room.

Felix and Vincent were leisurely sipping tea, discussing details of the Republic-era Resort Project.

Noticing her return, Felix was about to resume contract talks when his gaze froze on her swollen lips. Spotting Ethan's murderous expression as he entered behind her, Felix raised an eyebrow suggestively. "Did you encounter a ruffian, Sophia? You look rather disheveled."

Sophia knew there was no hiding it. Their prolonged absence and current states made the situation obvious.

She took a calm sip of water and remarked casually as Ethan sat down, "Ran into a beast."

Ethan stiffened, shooting her a cold glare.

"Oh?" Felix drawled, glancing pointedly at the man beside him. "A beast indeed—one with no concept of gentleness."

Ethan's warning glare silenced him.

Vincent wisely pretended not to hear, focusing on his tea.

Eager to change the subject, Sophia prompted, "Felix, where were we?"

Taking the hint, Felix smoothly continued, "Regarding the construction adjustments—can you oversee them?"

"Of course. It's part of my responsibilities."

"Great. Let's proceed with signing—"

"Wait." Ethan cut in sharply, his intense gaze fixed on Sophia. "Before signing, I have additional requirements."

Sophia arched an eyebrow. "Go ahead, Ethan."

"This is a joint investment between Roscente Group and Roland Holdings. Perfection is non-negotiable." Ethan spoke deliberately. "I expect you to supervise the entire construction process to ensure flawless execution of the design."
###Chapter 172

Ethan Roscente's businesslike tone made Sophia Lowell frown slightly.

Her fingers tapped lightly on the table as she replied calmly, "I'm afraid your request is unrealistic, Mr. Roscente."

The project was massive, with a minimum two-year timeline. Supervising it full-time meant she couldn't take on any other work during that period.

As a freelance designer, she had no base salary. The design fee alone wouldn't cover her living expenses.

The bigger issue was the location—the site was in a neighboring city. After her three-month internship ended, she had to return to Seattle for her teaching position.

"Would periodic site inspections suffice?" she ventured.

Sophia took a sip of tea before continuing, "Every construction site has professional supervisors. It's not standard practice for designers to take over their duties."

Ethan's brow furrowed slightly.

She wasn't wrong. Even for major projects, designers only needed to be present at critical milestones.

But he wasn't interested in logic—he wanted to test her limits.

"You're absolutely right, Ms. Lowell," he said, lips curving slightly. "But I believe in seeing things through. Since you created the design, you should oversee its execution."

Sophia's chest tightened.

This meant frequent interactions with him. The memory of his previous boundary-crossing behavior made her skin prickle.

Her original plan had been to hand the project over to Luming Studio after signing the contract. Now, it seemed far more complicated.

Ethan leisurely sipped his tea, steam softening his sharp features.

"Changing hands mid-project invites errors," he set down his cup. "If the final result falls short, the remaining payment might..."

His gaze locked onto hers. "I assume you'd prefer to avoid that outcome?"

Sophia clenched her fists.

Another threat. Using Luming, using her mentor as leverage.

She never should have agreed to this meeting. Now he had her cornered at every turn.

"You worry too much, Mr. Roscente," she forced out through gritted teeth. "Luming will assign their most qualified designer, and I'll conduct regular checks—"

"So this is your stance?" Ethan cut in coldly. "It seems Luming's sincerity leaves much to be desired."

With his fingertip, he traced the Chinese character for "sincerity" in spilled tea.

"The Roscente and Roland groups have shown full commitment," he tapped the character. "Yet Luming intends to cut corners?"

Sophia drew a deep breath.

This man had no interest in reason.
###Chapter 173

Ethan Roscente's slender fingers traced lightly across the table, completely erasing the speech radical from the Chinese character for "sincerity." With deliberate nonchalance, he wiped away most strokes of the remaining component, leaving only the final stroke.

"Look. Now there's nothing left but a blade." His low chuckle held no warmth.

That blade now hung over Luming Architectural Studio—and over Sophia Lowell's heart.

Whether it became an asset or a threat depended entirely on her choice.

Sophia kept her gaze lowered, long lashes casting shadows across her cheeks. Her fingers whitened around the fountain pen.

Felix Roland frowned from the sidelines. Ethan's move was ruthless, cornering her with no escape.

Vincent Laurent's forehead hadn't stopped sweating. He'd finally witnessed how this man could switch from gentle warmth to arctic frost in seconds.

"Ms. Lowell," Ethan's voice was unhurried, "such prolonged consideration suggests reservations about our collaboration?"

Sophia's head snapped up, meeting his fathomless gaze.

She nearly gritted her teeth to dust.

Another trap.

"You overestimate my hesitation, Mr. Roscente." She forced a professional smile. "Luming eagerly anticipates this partnership."

The corner of Ethan's mouth lifted as he struck the final blow: "Then it's settled. I'll personally inform your studio director how much... effort you've invested to facilitate this deal."

Sophia froze.

Outmaneuvered.

But retreating now was impossible. She inhaled sharply. "Shall we proceed with signing?"

Ethan smiled benignly. "Naturally."

He turned to Felix. "Your thoughts, Mr. Roland?"

Felix mentally rolled his eyes. His friend had turned a business negotiation into courtship theater. Playing along, he grinned. "No objections. Let's sign."

The contract passed between all four parties.

Ethan produced a custom fountain pen from his inner pocket, signing with bold strokes.

Sophia scrutinized every clause before finally storing her copy.

"Pleasure doing business." Ethan stood, extending his hand.

Sophia stared at those elegantly jointed fingers, remembering how they'd recently traced her waistline. After a beat, she accepted the handshake.

The moment their fingertips touched, she unmistakably saw triumph flicker in his eyes.
###Chapter 174

Ethan's slender fingers lightly traced her palm, sending an electric jolt through Sophia. She instinctively tried to pull her hand away.

"What's wrong?" Ethan chuckled darkly, his thumb stroking the delicate skin of her inner wrist. "I thought Miss Lowell adored these hands?"

Felix whistled. "Can't blame her. Those are some impressive hands, Roscente."

Sophia's ears burned.

This was clearly retaliation for her previous comment about his hands.

"Pleasure doing business." She gritted her teeth through the handshake, immediately attempting to withdraw.

"Ethan!"

Isabella's voice cut through the air behind them.

Sophia turned to see the socialite's perfectly made-up face contort with rage. Those meticulously lined eyes locked onto their joined hands, her manicured nails digging into her own palms.

"Miss Lowell is here too." Isabella forced a smile, striding forward to cling to Ethan's arm. "I was filming nearby and heard you were closing a deal."

She emphasized "personal assistant" with venom, pressing her body flush against Ethan's.

Ethan glanced down. "Weren't you scheduled until evening?"

"I missed you." Isabella batted her lashes, voice dripping honey. "Even the director said my performance was exceptional today."

Sophia turned away, pretending to discuss contract details with Vincent.

Yet Ethan's low laugh still reached her ears.

"Needy, aren't we?"

"You don't like it?"

"What do you think?"

Sophia's nails bit into her palms. Staring blankly at the contract, all she saw was Isabella's triumphant gaze wrapped around Ethan's arm.

"Miss Lowell?" Vincent's puzzled voice snapped her back.

She realized she'd been death-gripping the pen.

Taking a steadying breath, she forced herself to focus on the paperwork.

Behind her, Isabella's saccharine laughter mingled with Ethan's uncharacteristically tender responses.

Sophia pressed her tongue between her teeth.

The man who only ever gave her cold indifference now showered another woman with warmth.

Her fists clenched until half-moon indents marked her palms.
###Chapter 175

Ethan Roscente's gaze darkened, his eyes boring into Sophia Lowell as if he wanted to devour her whole.

Isabella Valentine took in the scene, her nails digging deep into her palms. Forcing a smile, she feigned surprise. "What a coincidence! I didn’t expect Mr. Roscente’s client to be you, Sophia. Weren’t you teaching at the university? Since when did you take on side projects?"

She already knew about the Republic-era Resort Project collaboration between the Roscentes and the Rolands. Connecting the dots with Sophia’s background, she immediately realized she was the designer.

That bitch!

She thought kicking her out of Roscente Group would crush her. Instead, Sophia became a university lecturer and now a collaborating designer.

Like a ghost that wouldn’t leave.

"There’s plenty you don’t know, Isabella," Sophia scoffed. "If I had to report everything to you, the FBI would be out of a job."

Translation: None of your damn business.

Isabella’s smile stiffened before she recovered. "Fair point. But had I known you were the designer, I would’ve taken time off to properly host you. Maybe even shown you our wedding home for decorating advice."

She emphasized wedding home, staking her claim.

Sophia nearly laughed. If Isabella knew what her precious fiancé had just done, she’d lose her mind.

Done with the charade, Sophia packed her files briskly. "Mr. Roscente has deep pockets. If he doesn’t like the wedding home, he can always buy another. Ten or eight properties—one’s bound to suit your taste."

Slinging her bag over her shoulder, she nodded at Ethan. "Contract’s signed. I won’t interrupt your date."

Then she signaled Felix Roland and Vincent Laurent. "Let’s go."

A flicker of malice crossed Isabella’s eyes.

There was no wedding home. Just a property her father gifted her. When she excitedly told Ethan, he’d only muttered, "Do what you want."

It festered like a thorn.

"Wait!" she called out.

Sophia didn’t turn. Isabella hurried after her, reaching out to grab her arm.

Sophia dodged. Isabella stumbled forward, crashing hard onto the floor.

The thud drew stares from nearby diners.

Sophia stepped back instinctively. "I’m broke. Don’t try to scam me."

Isabella was stunned.

Her plan was to grab Sophia, fake a fall, and frame her—while cozying up to Ethan. Instead, she ate concrete before the act even started.
###Chapter 176

Isabella Valentine approached in her high heels, a fake smile plastered across her face. She reached out to grab Sophia Lowell's arm, but Sophia swiftly dodged her.

"Ah!"

Isabella lost her balance and crashed heavily onto the floor. Her carefully styled hair tumbled loose, and her expensive dress was now covered in dust.

All eyes in the vicinity turned toward her. Isabella's face flushed crimson with humiliation. She looked up at Ethan Roscente with panic in her eyes, silently pleading for help.

Ethan frowned, clearly bewildered by her actions.

Sophia gazed down at her coldly, a mocking smile playing on her lips. "The surveillance cameras caught everything, Ms. Valentine." She pointed to the camera above them. "Don't even think about framing me."

Ethan's expression darkened at her merciless words.

Isabella struggled to stand, leaning against the wall for support. Tears welled up instantly. "I just wanted to invite you to our wedding..." she sobbed. "I didn't expect you to dodge like that..."

"Wedding?" Sophia arched an eyebrow in disdain. "Are we close?" She took a sudden step forward. "And what do you mean, you 'didn’t expect' me to dodge? Was I supposed to stand there and let you push me?"

Isabella had no retort. Her tears only fell harder.

"I have good reflexes," Sophia said icily. "When someone suspicious comes at me, my first instinct is to move away. Is that a problem?"

Isabella's tearful act failed to sway anyone. If anything, it made Ethan's expression grow even sterner.

"Ethan..." She reached out pitifully to tug at his sleeve. "My ankle hurts..."

He yanked his arm away. "I told you not to provoke her." His voice was sharp. "And which staff member told you I was here?"

Isabella's face paled.

"Enough!" Ethan cut her off harshly. "Keep this up, and the wedding is off."

His words were like a bucket of ice water dumped over her head. Her eyes widened in terror, her voice trembling. "Ethan, I'm sorry..."

He ignored her, turning to Felix Roland instead. "Take her home." Without another word, he strode after Sophia.

Felix sighed and approached Isabella. "Ethan despises being manipulated," he said meaningfully. "The harder you push, the further you’ll drive him away."

Isabella bit her lip so hard it nearly bled. The hatred in her eyes was unmistakable.

Meanwhile, Sophia stood before the elevator, her expression blank as she waited. The director had gone to the restroom, giving her a moment to breathe.

The elevator doors slid open. Just as she was about to step inside, a long, strong hand suddenly held them back.
###Chapter 177

The elevator lobby was packed during rush hour. Sophia Lowell stared impatiently at the flickering floor numbers, tapping her foot.

She had just pulled out her phone when a large, well-defined hand snatched it away.

"Ethan Roscente!" She glared at the man beside her through gritted teeth. "Give it back!"

He held the phone high above his head, a teasing smirk playing on his lips. "Beg me."

Sophia stretched on her toes to reach it, only for Ethan to wrap an arm around her waist. His breath tickled her ear as he murmured, "So eager?"

"Drop dead!" She stomped hard on his polished leather shoe.

Ethan hissed in pain and loosened his grip. Sophia seized the chance to grab her phone and turn away. But before she could take a step, his fingers closed around her wrist, yanking her into a private elevator.

"Let go!" She struggled fiercely.

"Stop fighting." He tightened his hold, pinning her against the elevator wall. "We're in a hurry."

In the confined space, his phoenix eyes gleamed with danger. Sophia turned her face away, but her breathing grew uneven despite herself.

"What's wrong?" His fingertip traced the flushed shell of her ear. "Scared of me?"

"Scared you'll lose your mind." She scoffed. "Shouldn't you be with your fiancée instead of harassing me?"

Ethan suddenly leaned in until their noses almost touched. "Jealous?"

"Delusional narcissism is a disease." She shoved him away.

The elevator jolted unexpectedly, sending Sophia stumbling into his chest. He took advantage, cradling the back of her head as his voice dropped to a husky whisper. "Last time, you said I was bad in bed—"

"Shut up!" She clapped a hand over his mouth, her palm burning at the contact.

He licked her skin, making her jerk back as if electrocuted.

"I'll prove it to you tonight." He nipped at her earlobe. "I'll have you begging for mercy."

Heat flooded Sophia's body. She lifted her foot to kick him just as the elevator dinged open on the top floor. Ethan dodged effortlessly and dragged her out.

"Release me! I'm going home!"

"Home?" He glanced back, dark fire smoldering in his gaze. "Tonight, you're mine."
###Chapter 178

Ethan Roscente's breath was dangerously close, his warm exhales brushing against Sophia Lowell's ear. She could feel her heartbeat accelerating, her skin burning with an uncontrollable heat.

"Your ears are red." His deep voice carried a teasing lilt as his lips barely grazed her sensitive earlobe. "Just like that night."

Sophia jerked her face away, only for his long fingers to catch her chin.

"Let go!" Her voice trembled.

Instead of releasing her, Ethan leaned in closer. "You didn’t say that that night." His thumb traced her soft lips. "You liked it—"

"Shut up!"

The elevator lurched violently. The lights flickered before plunging them into complete darkness. Sophia froze as the shadows swallowed them whole.

"What’s happening?" Her voice shook.

Ethan released her and calmly pressed the emergency button. "Just a malfunction."

But Sophia was already sliding down the wall, her knees drawn tightly to her chest. In the dark, she was back in that nightmare—trapped in an elevator for twelve hours. The last thing she’d heard before her phone died was Ethan’s impatient dismissal.

"Breathe." His voice cut through the blackness.

Only then did she realize she’d been holding her breath. She gasped, her back drenched in cold sweat.

"Afraid of the dark?" Ethan crouched in front of her.

Sophia bit her lip, refusing to show weakness in front of him.

Then his warm hand enveloped her icy fingers. His palm was dry, steady—an anchor in the storm.

"Count with me," he said. "One. Two—"

The elevator jolted back to life. Harsh light flooded the space, forcing Sophia to squeeze her eyes shut. When she opened them, Ethan’s face was inches from hers.

His dark eyes held something unreadable.

"That night..." His voice was low. "I came back for you."

Sophia’s pupils constricted. She couldn’t believe what she was hearing.

The doors slid open. Ethan stood, looking down at her with an inscrutable gaze.

"But you were already gone."

The words stabbed through her like a blade.

###Chapter 179

The elevator doors slid open, and Sophia Lowell stepped out with an impassive expression.

Her back was ramrod straight, as if nothing had happened.

Only when she reached the company's entrance did her legs suddenly give way, sending her tumbling onto the steps.

She woke two days later.

Ethan Roscente stood by the hospital window, his sharp profile reflected in the glass. He still believed she was throwing a tantrum, deliberately ignoring him.

Those seven days had been a nightmare.

She moved through life mechanically, her soul already gone.

Only now did she realize the darkness of that night had seeped into her bones...

Ethan pulled out his phone to call Zachary Evans, but there was no signal. As he was about to put it away, ragged breathing echoed behind him.

He whirled around, the phone's light illuminating the corner.

Sophia was curled against the elevator wall, trembling like a leaf in the wind.

"Sophia!"

Under the harsh light, her pallid face glistened with sweat. Her nails dug into the wall as if she wanted to claw her way inside.

His chest tightened. He dropped to one knee. "Sophia?"

Only violent shudders answered him.

Beads of sweat rolled off her chin, leaving dark stains on the floor.

"Talk to me!" He reached for her shoulder.

She flinched like she'd been burned, a broken whimper escaping her throat as her fingers twisted in her collar.

Ethan hauled her into his arms.

She thrashed wildly, her pupils dilated, limbs convulsing so violently she nearly broke free.

"It's me." His arms tightened, voice rough. "Ethan's here."

His palm smoothed over her drenched back, repeating like a mantra, "It's okay, Sophia."

The tremors slowly stilled, replaced by a flood of tears.

Finally, her voice returned, fragile and choked. "Scared..."

Like a lost child finding her way home at last.
###Chapter 180

The elevator plunged into darkness without warning, freezing Sophia Lowell in place.

Ethan Roscente immediately sensed her distress. His arm tightened around her. "Don't be afraid," his deep voice cut through the blackness. "I'm here."

Her slender fingers clutched desperately at his suit lapels as her breathing grew ragged. "It's too dark...everything's black..." Her voice dwindled to a barely audible whimper.

When she suddenly went limp in his arms, Ethan's heart lurched. "Sophia!" He shook her shoulders urgently, his voice uncharacteristically frantic. "Wake up! Stay with me!"

Harsh fluorescent lights flickered on as the elevator resumed operation. Ethan took in her ashen face and closed eyelids, his chest constricting painfully.

Ding—

The doors opened on the ground floor where Zachary Evans nearly barreled inside. "Mr. Roscente, are you—" His words died as he gaped at the unconscious woman in his boss's arms, mouth hanging open.

The maintenance worker blinked in astonishment. Since when did elevator malfunctions lead to romantic conquests?

Isabella Valentine arrived just in time to witness the scene. The blood drained from her face as her manicured nails dug crescent moons into her palms.

Felix Roland sauntered up moments later, leaning against the wall with amusement. "Seems we're superfluous here."

Vincent Laurent was the first to voice concern. "Is Sophia unwell?"

Ethan was already striding toward the exit with his precious burden. "Get the car ready. We're going to the hospital!" His command sliced through the air like ice.

Zachary snapped to attention and rushed to retrieve the vehicle.

"Ethan!" Isabella moved to intercept him but was brushed aside without acknowledgment. The man disappeared through the doors without a backward glance, leaving her trembling with rage. Strands of her meticulously styled updo came loose in her distress.

Felix's voice dripped with mock sympathy. "Should I call an ambulance? You look positively green."

"Stop gloating!" Isabella hissed through clenched teeth.

He shrugged. "Just showing concern for my future sister-in-law."

The derision in his eyes stung worse than the words. Felix had never concealed his disdain for her.

An uncomfortable silence settled over the elevator bay. The maintenance worker cleared his throat awkwardly. "Uh...the elevator's fixed now..."
###Chapter 181

The sharp click of stilettos echoed through the hallway.

Isabella clenched her fists, her nails digging deep into her palms.

She whirled around, her gaze slicing through the air like a blade.

"Sophia Lowell, just you wait!"

Before she could finish, her foot slipped.

The ten-inch heel twisted violently beneath her.

A searing pain shot up from her ankle, radiating through her entire body.

She collapsed onto the steps, her carefully styled curls now a tangled mess.

"Ah—!"

Her scream drew startled glances from passersby.

Isabella's face paled, beads of cold sweat forming on her forehead.

She stared at her swollen ankle, fury burning in her eyes.

"This is all your fault..."

The words hissed through gritted teeth.

......

The emergency room lights glared harshly.

Ethan Roscente carried Sophia into the hospital, drawing countless stares.

"Move!"

His voice was icy, his entire aura warning others to keep their distance.

Doctors rushed forward.

The examination lasted half an hour.

"The patient is experiencing a PTSD episode."

The doctor removed his mask, brow furrowed.

Ethan's expression darkened. "Meaning?"

"Similar to post-traumatic stress disorder," the doctor explained carefully. "She may have been triggered by a confined space."

Memories of the elevator flashed through Ethan's mind.

His jaw tightened. "Can it be treated?"

The doctor shook his head. "Psychological trauma takes time."

After a pause, he added, "However..."

The blare of an ambulance siren cut through the air.

Medical staff rushed past with a stretcher.

"The patient is pregnant and needs—"

The rest was drowned out by the noise.

Ethan frowned. "What?"

But the doctor had already turned toward the emergency room.

The hospital room was so quiet the drip of the IV could be heard.

Sophia lay on the bed, her lashes casting shadows on her pale face.

Ethan stood by the window, phone pressed to his ear.

"Find out everything about her past."

Hanging up, he turned to study the figure on the bed.

Sunlight filtered through the curtains, tracing soft contours on her face.

This version of Sophia was both unfamiliar and achingly familiar.

He stepped closer, fingers hovering just above her cheek.

In the end, he only adjusted the blanket gently.

"What exactly... have you been through?"

Outside, dusk settled.

Ethan opened his laptop, the blue glow illuminating his sharp profile.

The room filled with the quiet tap of keys.

And the steady rhythm of breathing.
###Chapter 182

The night was deep when Zachary Evans pushed open the hospital room door. Ethan Roscente had just set down his fountain pen.

"Did you find anything?" The man lifted his gaze, his eyes sharp as a blade.

Zachary swallowed hard, tightening his grip on the file folder.

"Mr. Roscente..." He hesitated. "The results... might not be ideal."

Ethan tapped the desk with his fingertips, his voice icy. "Get to the point."

"It's about... you." Zachary gulped. "That incident six months ago."

The temperature in the room plummeted.

The pen rolled halfway across the desk before clattering to the floor. Ethan narrowed his eyes. "Me?"

"The night you ordered Sophia Lowell to deliver documents." Zachary forced himself to continue. "When she was trapped in the elevator."

Memories flooded back. Ethan recalled the inexplicable irritation after that business dinner, the laughter between Sophia and her male classmate over the phone, the absurd command he'd given in his drunken haze.

"Go on."

"Someone in the executive office tampered with the elevator." Zachary's voice grew quieter. "It was stuck for eight full hours..."

Ethan shot to his feet, his chair screeching against the floor.

"She was unconscious for two days." Zachary closed his eyes briefly. "You thought she was just throwing a tantrum."

Suddenly, the details he'd deliberately ignored became painfully clear—Sophia's pale complexion, her evasive gaze, the way her fingers trembled slightly every time she stepped into an elevator afterward.

Slap!

Ethan struck himself hard across the face, his knuckles turning white, regret churning in his eyes.

Zachary stumbled back in shock.

"Am I a complete bastard?" Ethan's voice was hoarse.

Zachary stared at his shoes, not daring to respond.

Moonlight filtered through the curtains, casting dappled shadows across the hospital bed. Ethan moved closer, his thumb brushing lightly over the dark circles beneath Sophia's eyes.

In her sleep, Sophia frowned and instinctively curled deeper under the blankets.

"Hot..." she murmured, her lashes fluttering.

Ethan immediately loosened the covers, but as he withdrew his hand, her fingers unconsciously wrapped around his wrist. Her warm breath ghosted over his cold skin—like a flame, searing his heart with pain.
###Chapter 183

Sophia stirred in her groggy state, drawn toward a comforting warmth. She instinctively nuzzled closer—only to be abruptly seized by a strong arm around her waist.

"Who's there?!"

Her eyes flew open. Her back pressed against a scorching chest. Steady breaths tickled her ear, carrying the familiar scent of cedarwood.

This wasn’t a dream.

Her body tensed. She drove her elbow backward with force.

"Tch—"

The man grunted in pain, releasing his grip. Sophia twisted free and delivered a sharp kick.

Thud!

The dull impact of a heavy body hitting the floor echoed through the hospital room.

Propping herself up on the bed, she finally recognized the figure rising from the ground. Ethan Roscente rubbed his lower back, his white dress shirt crumpled beyond recognition.

"Attempted spousal homicide?" he hissed through clenched teeth.

The overhead lights flickered on. Sophia squinted as memories flooded back—the elevator malfunction, oxygen deprivation, losing consciousness...

"Wake up and immediately turn hostile?" Ethan loomed over her, bracing his arms on either side of the bed. "Should’ve left you to rot in that elevator."

She turned her face away. The antiseptic hospital air mingled with his ambergris cologne, making her temples throb.

"I'll repay the medical bills."

"Think I need your pocket change?" His laugh was icy. "Better consider how you'll compensate for my back."

He leaned in suddenly, his thumb grazing her pale lips. "Or... pay in kind?"

Sophia snatched a pillow and hurled it at him. "Get out!"

Ethan caught it midair. His gaze darkened as he pinned her back onto the mattress. The IV line jerked violently, cold medicine surging back up the tube into her vein.

"Let go!"

"Keep struggling." He trapped both her wrists with one hand. "See if I don’t take you right here."

She froze. The predatory glint in his eyes sent a chill down her spine—the look of a leopard sighting prey.

"Planning to assault an innocent woman, Mr. Roscente?" She raised her voice deliberately. "The hallway’s under surveillance."

Ethan suddenly smirked. Releasing her, he adjusted his cuffs with deliberate slowness. "Cameras were disabled." His fingertip traced her collarbone. "How else to... tend to my patient?"

Sophia grabbed the call button.

"Save your energy." He snatched the device and tossed it onto the sofa. "This entire hospital answers to me."

A thunderclap split the sky outside. Harsh lightning illuminated his razor-sharp profile—and the lipstick stain on his shirt collar.

Her pupils constricted.

That exact shade—the same "man-eater red" Isabella Valentine had worn during this morning’s financial news segment.
###Chapter 184

Ethan Roscente sat motionless on the opposite sofa, his long fingers tapping lightly on the armrest.

"Wait till morning," he said in a low voice. "I don't want to become a police suspect tomorrow."

Was he cursing her misfortune?

Sophia Lowell frowned, silently cursing the man for his sharp tongue.

"Calling me names in your head again?"

Ethan saw right through her.

Sophia kept her expression blank. "You're too paranoid, Mr. Roscente. I suggest seeing a psychiatrist."

His gaze lingered on her pale face, and an inexplicable softness flickered in his chest. He scoffed. "I'll leave once you're discharged tomorrow. For now, stay in bed."

"Unnecessary." Her tone was icy. "I've already called a friend to stay with me."

Ethan immediately thought of Sebastian Valdemar. His face darkened.

He stood abruptly, strode to the bed, and gripped her chin. "Who? Sebastian?"

Sophia pulled free. "None of your business."

She had only said it casually, never expecting him to jump to that conclusion.

His jaw tightened. "I don't have the energy to argue with you."

Sophia smirked and threw off the covers, swinging her legs over the edge.

"What are you doing?" he snapped.

"Leaving." Her resolve was firm.

A vein throbbed at Ethan's temple. "Did you ignore everything I just said?"

"At least you're self-aware," she mocked.

He was momentarily speechless.

Seeing him flustered eased some of the bitterness in Sophia's heart.

If he hadn't tormented her back then, she wouldn't have developed claustrophobia—wouldn't have been trapped in that broken elevator, reliving her nightmare.

"I'm not being stubborn," she said, her voice gentler. "I just hate hospitals. Resting at home is the same."

"No." His refusal was absolute. "The doctor said you need observation. Try leaving and see what happens."

Sophia laughed coldly. "Do you know what I hate most about you?"

His eyes sharpened.

"Your arrogance. Your selfishness. How you never consider others." She enunciated each word.

Ethan's pupils contracted. Remembering the root of her fear, he hesitated.

Just then, Zachary Evans entered with a food container. "You're awake, Ms. Lowell? Feeling better?"

Sophia averted her gaze. "Much better."

"Good. You've been asleep for hours. Have some porridge first."

Though she had no appetite, she nodded for the sake of the baby. "Thank you."

"Don't mention it." Zachary smiled warmly. "We're family."
###Chapter 185

Ethan Roscente set the porridge bowl gently on the nightstand and reached for the bed adjustment handle.

Sophia Lowell was about to thank him when she noticed his sudden pause.

"Let me." Ethan stepped forward, his slender fingers already gripping the lever.

The hospital bed rose slowly. He leaned over to unfold the tray table, arranging the utensils with practiced efficiency. Steam curled from the uncovered porridge, softening the sharp angles of his profile.

"Eat while it's hot." He handed her the spoon, his fingertips brushing against the back of her hand.

Sophia froze. Since when had this man learned to care for others?

The aroma of the porridge filled her senses. She took a tentative sip—the rice was perfectly tender, the shrimp sweet and fresh.

"Does it suit your taste?" Zachary Evans leaned in to ask.

She nodded, catching Ethan staring at the takeout bag from the corner of her eye.

Silence settled over the room. Zachary cleared his throat and launched into office anecdotes. Sophia responded occasionally, a faint smile playing on her lips.

Bang. Ethan suddenly stood, his chair scraping loudly against the floor.

"I need a smoke." He stormed out without a backward glance, the door slamming behind him.

Sophia set down her spoon and met Zachary's gaze. "You're unusually chatty today."

"Am I?" His smile stiffened.

"Like a dog wagging its tail." She tilted her head. "Out with it. What happened?"

A bead of sweat formed on Zachary's forehead. He couldn't very well admit he'd just finished digging into her background.

"Just building rapport for our upcoming project." He forced a laugh.

Sophia nodded thoughtfully. "Then would you mind fetching me some water?"

The moment his footsteps faded, she threw off the covers. Her wallet contained the exact amount of cash she'd left, but the items inside had clearly been disturbed.

From a hidden compartment, she pulled out a photograph—a yellowed image of a little girl grinning brightly at an amusement park.

"I knew it..." Her fingers trembled slightly.
###Chapter 186

She absolutely had to return this medical payment.

Sophia refused to owe Ethan Roscente a single cent. More importantly, she couldn’t risk staying in the hospital. If they discovered her pregnancy, the consequences would be disastrous.

At the end of the hallway, Ethan crushed his cigarette underfoot. As he turned, he nearly collided with Zachary Evans.

"What are you doing here?" he demanded, brows furrowed.

Zachary lifted a water bottle. "Miss Lowell wanted a drink."

"Was there no water in the room?" Ethan’s voice turned icy.

"Maybe…" Zachary scratched his head. "The outside water tastes better?"

"Idiot!"

Ethan’s expression darkened as he strode toward the hospital room. Zachary hesitated before hurrying after him.

When the door swung open, the bed was empty.

"That woman has a death wish!" Ethan growled through clenched teeth.

Zachary spotted the neatly stacked bills on the nightstand. "Mr. Roscente, Miss Lowell left the medical fees and left."

"I can see that."

His knuckles whitened as his face twisted with fury.

Zachary ventured cautiously, "Should we…?"

Before he could finish, Ethan snatched the money. "If she gave it, why refuse?"

Zachary swallowed the rest of his words.

Inside the taxi, Sophia had just given the driver the address when her phone buzzed.

Six missed calls—all from Emily Laurent.

"Why aren’t you answering?" Emily’s voice dripped with irritation.

Sophia rubbed her temples. "I just woke up."

"You gave up a perfectly good secretary job for this?" Emily launched into her usual lecture.

"Get to the point," Sophia cut her off.

"Come to the family estate. We’ll talk in person."

Sophia checked the GPS—only two blocks from Vivian Ashcroft’s place.

"Can’t we discuss it over the phone?"

"It’s important," Emily insisted.

"Fine."

Hanging up, Sophia wearily changed the destination.

Forty minutes later, at the Lowell family estate.

"What’s this about?" Sophia slumped onto the couch, her face pale.

Emily studied her for a long moment. "You look terrible."

"Didn’t sleep well," Sophia murmured, closing her eyes.
###Chapter 187

"Young people these days have no sense of restraint. Wait till you're my age—you'll regret it." Emily Laurent frowned, poking Sophia Lowell's forehead with her finger.

Sophia tilted her head away. "Did you call me here just to lecture me?"

"Of course not."

"Then get to the point."

Exhaustion weighed on her. All she wanted was to collapse into bed.

Suddenly, Emily's expression brightened. She linked arms with Sophia affectionately. "There's a birthday party for the child of a family friend the day after tomorrow. I need you to go in my place—"

"No." Sophia shook her off and turned to leave.

"You ungrateful girl!" Emily grabbed her wrist. "I'm swamped right now!"

"Skip a few mahjong games, and you'll have time."

Emily let out an awkward chuckle, caught in her lie. "The games were scheduled weeks ago. A person must keep their word." She forced Sophia to sit. "Besides, these events are for young people like you. Someone my age would just kill the mood. Just deliver the gift and leave. Deal?"

"I have a client meeting that day to sign a contract. This deal could earn me at least this much." Emily held up her fingers.

"Three million?"

"Who do you take me for?" Emily swatted her. "Thirty million!"

Sophia's pupils constricted. "What kind of business earns that much? You're not getting scammed again, are you?"

"Here we go again! If they were scammers, they'd have done it by now!" Emily's face darkened. "Why do you always assume the worst in people?"

Sophia smirked coldly. "If I hadn't been vigilant, you'd have lost everything by now."

Emily's expression shifted, clearly recalling an unpleasant memory. Seeing Sophia's icy demeanor, she deflated. "Fine. I'll quit after this deal."

"Not even this one."

"Thirty million! Think of all the bags I could buy!" Emily stomped her foot in frustration. "Why are you so stubborn?"

Sophia picked up her purse. "Take it or leave it."

"Alright, alright!" Emily blocked her path. "Go to the party, and I won't sign the contract."

"Promise?"

"Have I ever lied to you?" Emily's eyes darted away as she muttered, "You're the only one who'd turn down easy money."

"Money doesn't fall from the sky." Sophia took the gilded invitation, skimmed it, and tucked it into her bag.

"It's so late. Why go back now?" Emily held her arm. "Look at you—you might faint on the way."

It was already midnight. Sophia was too drained to argue and reluctantly agreed to stay.

Thrilled, Emily immediately ordered the maid to prepare bird's nest soup. She chattered endlessly, but Sophia barely listened.

After her shower, the fatigue mysteriously vanished. Lying in bed, Sophia stared at the ceiling, replaying the moment in the elevator when Ethan Roscente had pulled her into his arms.

The warmth of his palm still lingered at her waist. That fleeting tenderness had made her feel—just for a second—like she was cherished.
###Chapter 188 

The sound of a window sliding open cut through the silent night.

Sophia lay on her bed, staring blankly at the ceiling when a sudden chill swept over her.

She turned sharply and saw a dark figure climbing through the window.

"Who's there?" Her fingers tightened around the edge of the blanket.

Moonlight outlined the man's tall, imposing silhouette. Ethan Roscente's handsome face flickered in the shadows.

"How did you get in here?" Her voice trembled.

He didn’t answer, his long fingers already working at the buttons of his shirt.

"This is my room!" She shrank back.

Ethan shrugged off his shirt in seconds, then pulled back the covers and slid in beside her.

"Get out!"

She kicked at him, but he caught her ankle effortlessly.

"Don't make a scene." His deep voice held a warning.

The world spun as he pinned her to the mattress. His muscular arm locked around her waist like an iron band, his hot breath searing the nape of her neck.

"Have you lost your mind? This is the Roscente estate!"

"Hmm." His lips brushed the delicate skin behind her ear.

Sophia struggled wildly, but he flipped her onto her back. One hand pinned both her wrists above her head while the other gripped her chin.

"Mmph—"

His scorching kiss swallowed every protest.

The assault was fierce and relentless, stealing her breath. When she came to her senses, her pajama top hung open.

"Ethan Roscente!" She shook with fury. "Have you no shame?"

He chuckled, thumb tracing her swollen lips. "Shame doesn’t get me what I want."

"You—"

"Shh." His lips grazed her ear. "Want someone to find us like this?"

His warm breath sent shivers down her spine.

Sophia bit her lower lip. "If anyone sees us, your family will blame me for seducing you."

"Clever girl." He kissed the tip of her nose approvingly. "So behave."

Tears of anger pricked her eyes. "Aren’t you afraid Isabella will find out?"

His movements stilled, his gaze turning icy.

"Why bring her up?"

"Am I wrong?" Sophia scoffed. "The great Mr. Roscente sneaking into his niece’s bed—what a scandal."

Ethan suddenly smiled, twirling a lock of her hair around his finger. "Scandalous? I find it thrilling."

"Pervert!"

"There’s more where that came from." He nipped at her collarbone. "Want a taste?"

Sophia gasped, her heart pounding so hard she feared it might burst.

Outside, tree shadows danced—anyone could walk by at any moment. The thought filled her with equal parts terror and exhilaration.

"Aren’t you afraid—"

"Of what?" Ethan cut her off, his fingers slipping beneath her pajama top. "That we’ll get caught? Or that you won’t be able to resist?"

Humiliation and fury burned through her. She tried to knee him.

He anticipated the move, pressing his thigh between her legs. Leaning close, his voice turned rough with desire:

"You’re not escaping tonight."
###Chapter 189

"Mm, I won't touch you." His voice was low, eyes closed.

Sophia scoffed. "Then what are you doing now? Lying naked in my bed—expecting me to be your secret lover? Forget it!"

As if undressing meant nothing.

This man couldn't be trusted.

Her body trembled with anger when his eyes suddenly opened, pulling her closer. Warm lips brushed the soft skin of her neck, sucking gently.

"Ah—" A shiver ran down her spine.

"Talk too much, and this is what you get."

She gritted her teeth. "I didn't—"

"Then be quiet." His voice was rough. "I'll leave after resting."

She'd be a fool to believe him.

Sophia struggled to sit up. "Get out. I don't sleep with dogs."

His grip tightened. "Keep moving, and neither of us sleeps tonight."

She froze instantly.

"Good. Stay still." His arms locked around her.

She stiffened like wood, afraid to provoke him.

His breathing steadied. Listening to his heartbeat, her eyelids grew heavy.

Just as she drifted off, a whisper came from behind. "Sophia... I'm sorry."

Her eyes snapped open. "Why... are you apologizing?"

"You're afraid of the dark because of me."

Her body tensed. He knew?

Of course. For Ethan Roscente, digging up her past was child's play.

"I won't forgive you." Her voice was ice.

Those days of darkness were her eternal nightmare.

"I don't expect forgiveness." His tone was somber. "But an apology was due."

She laughed coldly. "If you were truly sorry, you wouldn't keep bothering me after we ended things."

"So you despise me that much?" His gaze burned.

She hesitated. It wasn't him she hated—but the man bound by an engagement.

"Yes. Completely." Her words were final.

His arm around her waist tightened. "Hate me all you want. You owe me this."

"Owe you what? You—"

"Sophia?" Emily's voice called from outside. "Who are you talking to?"

The doorknob turned.

Panicked, she shoved him. "Ethan!"

His hand clamped over her mouth.

Click.

The lights went out.

Darkness swallowed the room.
###Chapter 190

The night was heavy with silence. Emily Laurent stood before the slightly ajar bedroom door, peering through the crack to see only a shadowy lump beneath the covers.

"Why aren't the lights on?" She frowned in confusion. "Haven’t you been sleeping with them on lately?"

The man under the blankets pinched Sophia Lowell’s waist lightly, making her tense instantly.

"I... I'm not dressed," she stammered, her fingers clutching the edge of the comforter.

Emily burst into laughter. "Since when are you shy around me? I’ve seen you running around naked as a child."

The warmth beneath the covers intensified, Sophia’s ears burning. "Aunt Emily!"

"Alright, alright, I’ll stop teasing you." Emily pretended to close the door but paused. "By the way, I heard you talking to someone just now?"

Ethan Roscente’s breath brushed against Sophia’s neck, his deep voice laced with amusement. "Tell her who you were talking to."

Sophia inhaled sharply—he was toying with her.

"It was... Vivian!" she blurted out, thinking fast. "We were on a video call."

A knowing chuckle drifted from the hallway. "Young people should know their limits. Too much of that kind of content isn’t good for you."

Sophia froze as if struck by lightning, stiffening in Ethan’s arms.

"That’s not what it was!" Her voice cracked with panic. "We really were just video chatting!"

"Sure, sure. I was young once too." Emily’s voice faded as she walked away. "Crack the window open a bit—don’t suffocate in there."

The moment the door clicked shut, Sophia barely had time to exhale before Ethan flipped her onto her back.

"Mmph—"

His scorching lips met hers, only for her to bite down hard.

"Little hellcat," he muttered, pulling back and wiping blood from his lip.

Sophia’s eyes burned like an angry cat’s. "You promised not to touch me! Ethan Roscente, you liar!"

She shoved him away, leaping barefoot from the bed to lock the door. Pointing at the window, she hissed, "Out. Now. Disappear!"

Unhurried, Ethan twisted the bedside lamp on. Bathed in its golden glow, he propped his head lazily on one hand. "So you can go back to watching those videos once I’m gone?"

"You—!" Sophia stomped her foot. "I don’t watch that garbage!"

He arched a brow, studying her flushed ears. "Never?"

She had—twice—dragged into it by Vivian. But the overacting male leads paled compared to the way Ethan’s gaze alone could unravel her.

Realizing where her thoughts had strayed, Sophia wanted to melt into the floor from sheer mortification.
###Chapter 191

Ethan Roscente stood up casually and walked straight to the bathroom.

"I told you to leave," Sophia Lowell frowned, glaring at him.

The bathroom door clicked shut. His deep voice came through the wood. "Just a quick shower."

Sophia's ears burned.

"Leave as soon as you're done."

She yanked the blanket over her head, forcing herself to sleep.

Morning sunlight streamed through the curtains, jolting Sophia awake.

She had no memory of when Ethan left last night. She'd meant to stay awake until he was gone, but after waiting over an hour with the shower still running, exhaustion had claimed her.

While washing up, a vivid red mark glared back at her from the mirror, stark against her porcelain skin. Gritting her teeth, she cursed Ethan silently and rummaged for a silk scarf to cover it.

The day was unusually hot, the scarf stifling around her neck. As she stepped into the garden, Emily Laurent paused her watering to give her a puzzled look. "A scarf in this heat?"

Sophia's fingers absently traced the edge of the fabric. "It matches the dress."

Her beige dress paired with a light brown cardigan did look more stylish with the scarf's addition.

Emily nodded thoughtfully. Her niece had an eye for design—even casual outfits looked magazine-worthy.

A soft scoff came from behind.

Ethan strode over from the guesthouse, his gaze lingering on Sophia's neck. Mockery flickered in his eyes. "Tacky."

Sophia tightened her grip on her phone, pretending not to hear.

"Ethan, you came back last night?" Emily sounded surprised.

"Yeah."

Sophia reluctantly muttered, "Uncle." He responded with a distracted hum, but his smirk remained fixed on her scarf.

Emily suddenly gasped, noticing the broken skin at the corner of his mouth. "What happened there?"

"Got bit by a dog," Ethan said flatly.

Emily's lips twitched.

That was clearly a human bite mark. She gave him a knowing look. "Must've been one fierce dog."

Probably some feisty little wildcat.
###Chapter 192

"I should've pulled out that sharp tongue of hers last night." Ethan Roscente flicked his cigarette, his tone dripping with mockery.

Emily Laurent frowned. "Must you always speak so violently?"

Sophia Lowell stood silently, nails digging into her palms. She checked her phone. The ride would arrive in three minutes.

"My car's coming. I should go." She turned to leave.

Emily caught her arm. "Stay for breakfast."

"I have an 8 AM class." Sophia pulled away. "I remember the birthday banquet."

She hurried through the garden, her silhouette vanishing into the morning light.

"What birthday banquet?" Ethan tapped his cigarette, watching her go.

"Tyler Roland's coming-of-age party. Half the elite circle's invited." Emily sighed. "Your fourth brother has ties with the Rolands. We can't decline. At my age, I'd rather skip the fuss. Sophia and Jason will represent me."

She suddenly gasped. "Oh! I forgot to tell Jason. That boy's always racing cars—I need to call him now."

Ethan's gaze darkened as Emily rushed off.

Two days later, outside the lecture hall.

Jason Roscente blocked Sophia's path, one hand in his pocket. "Emily sent me to pick you up for the Roland event. Give me your WeChat for the location."

"Can't we just meet at the Rolands'?" Sophia scowled.

"No." Jason held his phone steady. "Emily's orders."

Sophia suppressed an eye roll. Since when did this rebellious Roscente heir obey anyone?

"Sophia!" Vivian Ashcroft called from across the quad. "If you take any longer, I'll start growing mushrooms!"

She jogged over, spotting Jason. Her eyes lit up. "Who's this hottie?"

"My aunt's stepson." Sophia kept it brief.

Vivian whispered in her ear, "Damn, he's the puppy-dog type. Not considering him?"

"He's practically a child." Sophia glared. "Don't corrupt minors."

Vivian gave Jason a once-over, smirking suggestively.

Sophia massaged her temples. Her best friend's mind was a gutter.
###Chapter 193

Sunlight streamed through the café windows as Jason Roscente absently traced the rim of his coffee cup.

The moment Vivian Ashcroft pushed open the door, his breath caught.

Those almond-shaped eyes still sparkled like stars, her red lips curved in the exact same smile he remembered. Jason's Adam's apple bobbed as his knuckles whitened around the cup.

"This is my best friend, Vivian Ashcroft." Sophia Lowell's voice snapped him back to reality.

Jason's gaze locked onto Vivian with an intensity that could have burned holes through her.

"You know me?" Vivian tilted her head, her crimson lips quirking in amusement.

"The young princess you played in Midnight in Chang'an," Jason's voice dropped low. "That red dress dance scene in episode three—I watched it twenty-seven times."

Vivian's lashes fluttered. That web series had flopped so badly even she'd nearly forgotten the plot.

"So I've got a little fanboy," she chuckled, pulling a compact from her bag. Her fingertip dabbed at the gloss on her lips. "Want an autographed photo?"

Jason suddenly leaned in until his nose almost brushed her hair. "I want your lip print." His eyes fixed on the smudge of red on her finger. "Right here."

Sophia's spoon clattered against her saucer.

The tips of Vivian's ears turned visibly pink. She instinctively licked her lips before pressing a kiss to the corner of the photo. "Kids these days sure know how to flirt."

"I'm not a kid." Jason's fingers grazed her wrist as he took the photo. "I'll be at the fan meet for your new drama next Wednesday."

Vivian's head jerked up. She'd never publicly announced that filming schedule.

"How did you—"

"I'm Jason Roscente." He cut her off, tucking the photo inside his jacket. "From now on, I'm calling you Viv."

Outside, plane tree leaves rustled. Vivian suddenly realized this "fan's" gaze resembled a wolf eyeing its prey.
###Chapter 194

The contact name on the phone screen burned her eyes.

"Darling" stabbed her heart like a knife.

Her fingers turned white from gripping the phone too tightly.

So Ethan Roscente was capable of such endearments.

No wonder he'd defended Sophia Lowell so fiercely. They'd been sneaking around all along.

Memories flashed through her mind—Ethan avoiding her, then imagining him tangled in sheets with Sophia. Her chest heaved violently.

Sophia!

You bitch!

You'll pay for this!

Ethan slid into the car and ripped off his tie, tossing it onto the seat.

"Get rid of it," he ordered coldly.

Zachary Evans caught the expensive suit jacket with a silent sigh. The boss had been discarding clothes at an alarming rate lately.

"Mr. Roland said the design draft was sent to Luming Studio. They'll submit the initial version for your review."

Ethan gave an absentminded hum, his gaze fixed on his phone.

"Mr. Roscente."

Simon Sherwood's voice came through the line.

Ethan tapped his knee with slender fingers. "Her reaction?"

"Miss Lowell is furious."

The corner of his mouth lifted. "Good."

If she insisted on drawing boundaries, he'd play hardball.

Either she returned to him willingly, or drowned in debt.

He was certain Sophia would choose the former.

After hanging up, he stared at his screen, waiting for her plea.

But instead of a call, a bank notification popped up.

Six million dollars.

Ethan's expression darkened instantly.

"Sir..." Zachary spoke cautiously. "Miss Lowell texted me."

His voice turned icy. "Read it."

Zachary swallowed. "'Debt cleared. Keep your word and stop clinging to me like a pathetic leech...'"

The air in the car turned arctic.

"Continue."

Sweat beaded on Zachary's forehead as he scanned the string of vulgar insults. "Th-that's all..."

Ethan suddenly laughed lowly, his eyes glacial.

"Perfect."
###Chapter 195

Jason's eyes flickered with a dangerous glint as his lips curved into a predatory smile. When it came to warding off admirers, he was an expert.

At Roscente Group headquarters, Zachary strode into the CEO's office with a tablet in hand. "Mr. Roscente, Mr. Liu from Heng'an Group requests dinner at eight tonight."

Ethan glanced at his watch and snapped a file shut. "Decline."

"But... this project is crucial."

"The Rolands' birthday gala." Ethan adjusted his cufflinks, his sharp jawline reflected in the mirror.

Zachary blinked. "Didn't you already refuse?" He distinctly remembered his boss tossing the invitation into the trash, calling it "mind-numbingly dull."

"Changed my mind." A shadow crossed Ethan's eyes as he straightened his tie.

"I'll prepare the car immediately."

The Roland mansion blazed with light, its grand birthday banquet drawing the city's elite. Jason noticed Sophia's empty glass. "Not drinking?"

"On antibiotics." She swirled her water, condensation beading on the crystal.

Jason nodded in understanding. Then Sophia's phone buzzed—"Professor Orlando" flashing on the screen.

"Excuse me." She wove through the champagne-sipping crowd to a quiet corner.

"Professor?"

"Sophia, a lucrative opportunity." Theodore's voice was warm. "Apple TV's career education show wants you as a guest."

Sophia froze. "Career Insight?"

"Live broadcast. Generous compensation." He paused. "Plus, it promotes architecture."

Her knuckles whitened. "But I'm a university lecturer—"

"The dean approved." Theodore chuckled. "Perfect timing with college admissions season."

A waltz floated through the phone. Sophia gazed back at the ballroom, where Jason stood encircled by socialites beneath the chandelier. She bit her lip. "Let me think about it."
###Chapter 196

"There's no rush. Take your time to think it over."

Sophia hesitated before finally relenting. "Alright, I'll consider it..."

Before she could finish, someone slammed into her from behind. Her phone flew from her hand, arcing through the air before landing with a splash in the fountain pool.

The screen flickered twice, then went dark.

She turned to face Tiffany Roscente's malicious gaze. The woman wore a strapless white gown and feigned surprise, covering her mouth with a hand. "Oh, how clumsy of me." But her eyes gleamed with triumph.

"On purpose?" Sophia cut straight to the point.

Tiffany played dumb. "I have no idea what you're talking about." She turned to leave.

Sophia blocked her path. "Pick it up."

Tiffany crossed her arms and sneered. "It's just a cheap phone. I'll pay for it. Why so serious? Trying to scam me?"

"With all this space, you just had to bump into me?"

"I said it was an accident." Tiffany lifted her chin defiantly.

Sophia smiled coldly. "Fine. Let's pretend it was."

Tiffany spun away, seething inwardly that she hadn't pushed harder. If only she'd shoved the bitch into the water and snapped some humiliating photos for the internet—that would've been satisfying.

"Stop." Sophia stepped on the trailing hem of Tiffany's gown.

Tiffany stumbled, nearly falling. She yanked at her skirt, furious. "Sophia! Have you lost your mind?"

"I said," Sophia replied calmly, arms folded, "pick it up."

"You're insane!" Tiffany shrieked.
###Chapter 197

Tiffany Roscente's fingers dug into her skirt fabric, nails nearly piercing through the delicate material. The humiliation of having her hem stepped on sent tremors through her body.

"Can't even apologize properly?" Sophia Lowell's voice was measured, yet each word sliced through Tiffany's eardrums like a blade. "Even a three-year-old knows basic manners. Did the Roscentes fail to teach you?"

"You worthless—" Tiffany's hand flew up to strike.

Sophia caught her wrist and twisted it upward. Tiffany arched backward with a gasp, tears springing to her eyes instantly.

"Pain is the best teacher." Sophia glanced toward the fountain plaza. "Will you retrieve it yourself, or shall I assist you?"

Meeting those calm eyes, Tiffany shuddered. Biting her lip, she inched toward the fountain, her skirt dragging through puddles.

"Stop this!" Isabella Valentine arrived with an entourage, her voice ringing across the garden. "Forcing someone into freezing water is beyond cruel, Miss Lowell."

Whispers rippled through the crowd. Isabella's lips curved as she raised her voice further. "Tiffany already apologized. Must you be so merciless?"

Sophia smiled suddenly. She turned toward the back of the gathering. "Tyler, if I recall correctly, there are surveillance cameras near the fountain?"

Tyler Roland stiffened at being addressed, snapping to attention reflexively. "Yes, Professor Lowell!"

"Be a dear and pull the footage." Sophia's tone remained pleasant, but her gaze swept over Isabella's frozen expression.

Isabella cut in hastily. "Tyler, today is your birthday celebration—"

"Perfect timing for surveillance footage to commemorate it!" Grinning, Tyler called out to security. "Fetch the camera recordings now!"

His adolescent voice carried across the garden with rebellious clarity. Isabella's grip tightened on her crocodile leather clutch, nails leaving pale scratches across its surface.
###Chapter 198

Tyler Roland narrowed his eyes with an angelic smile. "That's not fair, Isabella. Even good days shouldn't excuse false accusations. If Professor Sophia really bullied Tiffany, I'd be the first to stand against it. But if someone's picking fights intentionally..."

He shrugged, his voice dripping with saccharine sweetness. "Even a teenager like me knows wrongdoers deserve consequences."

His repeated use of "sister" carried cloying affection—classic green tea behavior.

Apparently, manipulative tactics weren't exclusive to women.

Isabella Valentine and Tiffany Roscente turned ashen, their nails digging into their palms.

"Pull up the surveillance footage," Tyler ordered the security guard with steely authority.

As the guard moved to comply, a glacial male voice cut through the tension.

Sophia's pulse spiked.

Ethan Roscente?

What was he doing at a teenager's birthday party?

The crowd parted as Ethan approached, flanked by the Roland patriarch and several New York elites. His tailored navy suit accentuated his broad shoulders and narrow waist, making him stand out like a panther among peacocks. The garden's blooms seemed to wilt in comparison to his presence.

"Isabella, explain." The middle-aged man beside Ethan spoke first, his gaze briefly skimming Sophia before settling on his daughter.

William Valentine's smile didn't reach his inscrutable eyes.

"Dad!" Isabella brightened instantly, morphing into demure grace. She nodded deferentially to Ethan before clinging to her father's arm. "Just a minor misunderstanding. Miss Lowell insisted Tiffany retrieve a phone from the fountain in this freezing weather..."

Her three-sentence version painted Sophia as the unreasonable aggressor.

William ignored Sophia entirely, beckoning Tiffany forward. "Come here, dear. Tell Uncle what happened."

Tiffany strutted past Sophia, whispering venomously, "So what if I did it on purpose? With Uncle William and Mr. Roscente here, what can you possibly do? That Roland brat?" She scoffed. "Please. Look how his father's groveling."

Center stage, Tiffany launched into an elaborate fabrication.

"That's not what happened!" Tyler jumped in frustration.

"Tyler!" Mr. Roland barked, his forehead glistening with sweat as he forced a smile toward Ethan. "Mr. Roscente, forgive my son's impulsiveness—"

"I'm eighteen!" Tyler's face flushed crimson. "You're all ganging up on Professor Sophia because she has no backing!"

"Enough!" Mr. Roland paled, his voice cracking with panic.
###Chapter 199

Tyler Roland's face turned pale with rage, his fists clenched so tight his knuckles whitened.

He opened his mouth to argue, but Sophia Lowell silenced him with a single glance.

Some words shouldn't be spoken. Some actions shouldn't be taken.

The mere presence of Ethan Roscente and William Valentine made their stance unmistakably clear.

This farce had been rigged against them from the start.

"Cowards," Tyler spat through gritted teeth.

He kicked the ground hard before storming off, his retreating figure radiating fury and disillusionment.

Sophia stood alone, an isolated island amidst the crowd.

William finally deigned to look at her, his gaze dripping with disdain. "Ethan, so this is your country bumpkin niece? Pretty enough, but utterly lacking in manners."

He adjusted his cuffs with deliberate slowness. "Normally I wouldn't interfere in Roscente family affairs. But Tiffany and Isabella have been close since childhood. I can't stand by while she's wronged."

Tiffany Roscente lifted her chin triumphantly.

Her挑衅 stare screamed "You're finished" as it locked onto Sophia.

Sophia met Ethan's gaze instead, her lips curling into a sardonic smile.

She waited to see how her "dear uncle" would perform.

Ethan's brow furrowed slightly. "The Roscentes never shield those at fault."

His quiet pronouncement instantly hushed the room.

William's face stiffened.

He'd intended to assert dominance, never expecting Ethan would deny him even this small courtesy.

The weight of the guests' stares prickled against his skin like needles.

Ethan turned to Tiffany. "Are you certain this wasn't deliberate?"

Tiffany's triumphant expression froze.

Her lips trembled as cold sweat dampened her back.

Sophia's breath caught.

This marked the first time Ethan had publicly taken her side.

Just as Tiffany opened her mouth, Isabella Valentine grasped her hand.

"Ethan, you're frightening her," Isabella soothed. "Tiffany may be willful, but she understands propriety. Making a scene like this only gives outsiders fodder for gossip."

William seized the lifeline. "Exactly! Family disputes shouldn't air in public. By causing this commotion, Sophia has disgraced the Roscente name."

His meaningful glance at Ethan carried clear warning. "Old Mr. Roscente values family reputation above all. If word of this reaches him..."
###Chapter 200

Tiffany Roscente seized the opportunity instantly. Tears streamed down her face as she choked out, "Uncle Ethan, it's all my fault..."

William Valentine snorted coldly, his gaze sharp as a blade as it sliced toward Sophia Lowell. "Do you really need reminding at an event like this? Clearly, you have no respect for the Roscentes!"

Sophia's fingertips trembled slightly.

If she stayed silent any longer, this farce would be twisted entirely into her wrongdoing.

"Mr. Valentine," Sophia lifted her eyes, her voice cool and composed. "You just said this was a Roscente family matter. Since your daughter isn't married into the family yet, isn't your interference disrespectful to the Roscentes?"

"How dare you!" William slammed his hand on the table, his face dark with fury. "Is this how you speak to your elders?"

He turned to Ethan Roscente, his tone ominous. "Ethan, if this isn't resolved today, I doubt the old man will be pleased."

Sophia straightened her spine.

"If you feel insulted, Mr. Valentine, I apologize." She inclined her head slightly, her posture respectful but not submissive.

Her composure only fueled William's anger.

"Ethan Roscente!" he barked. "Is this the upbringing of a Roscente?"

"Sophia!"

Jason Roscente's voice suddenly rang out from the entrance. Behind him was Tyler Roland, both striding forward briskly.

Jason swept his gaze across the room, pausing briefly on William before scoffing. "Tyler, your birthday party sure is lively."

Tyler caught on immediately, raising his voice deliberately. "Isn't it? A perfectly good celebration, and yet some outsiders insist on meddling."

William's expression turned stormy.

Sophia turned to leave but froze at the sound of an icy command.

"Stay where you are."

Ethan's eyes were frigid, lingering on Jason's protective hand on Sophia's arm.

"Sophia," his voice was like ice. "Apologize to Tiffany and Mr. Valentine."

Sophia's heart twisted sharply.
###Chapter 201

The fleeting warmth she'd felt from his defense shattered instantly. Sophia's fingers turned bone-white as she clenched her handbag, barely restraining herself from smashing it against that handsome face.

Even knowing he'd always side with Isabella unconditionally, the dull ache in her chest felt like a rusty knife twisting deeper.

Blood roared in her ears. Her vision darkened at the edges.

"Sophia—"

Jason caught her elbow as she swayed.

"I'm fine." She jerked free, icy gaze raking over Ethan. A mocking smile curled her lips. "I'm not a Roscente by blood. Never took a penny from your family. Your rules mean nothing to me." She enunciated each word. "Cross me, and I'll make sure you regret it."

Her cutting glance swept past William. "Respect is earned, not demanded. I don't entertain entitled elders." The sharp swish of her coat mirrored her exit. "Moral blackmail disgusts me."

William's enraged bellow followed her. "Ethan Roscente! Is this how your family educates their—"

"Mr. Valentine." Ethan's voice dropped to subzero. "Threatening my family carries consequences."

The older man choked, face purpling. "You're shielding her?"

"You overstepped." Ethan slid a hand into his trouser pocket, the razor-sharp crease of his suit emphasizing his lethal calm. "Meddling in children's squabbles?" A derisive chuckle. "Beneath you."

William's complexion drained to chalk-white. Humiliated twice by these young wolves, his fists trembled with suppressed fury.

This wasn't over.

"If Sophia offended you..." Ethan's tone softened unexpectedly. "I'll apologize on her behalf."

Isabella's nails bit into her palms. She forced a brittle smile. "Ethan, why would you—"

"Uncle entrusted Aunt Emily's care to me." His gaze skimmed Isabella's frozen expression. "Her niece falls under my protection." The pleasantry vanished as he locked eyes with William. "But harm her..." A polished shoe crushed the carpet fibers. "You insult Uncle directly. A man of your stature understands, yes?"

Not enough.

Ethan leaned in, whispering words that made William's facial muscles twitch violently. "The old man's blood pressure fluctuates lately. Should someone... agitate him further..." Straightening, he adjusted his cufflinks with deliberate slowness. "A son might do reckless things."

Under the crowd's scrutiny, William swallowed his rage whole. His contorted expression resembled a vengeful specter.
###Chapter 202

His knuckles turned white, a terrifying storm brewing in his eyes.

The air froze for several seconds.

Ethan Roscente's cold, chiseled face remained impassive, his dark eyes unreadable.

William Valentine suppressed his fury and forced a stiff smile. "Ethan is right."

The crowd gradually dispersed.

Isabella Valentine hurried away with her father.

Zachary Evans approached swiftly, handing over a USB drive. "Mr. Roscente, the surveillance footage."

Tiffany Roscente's legs trembled, cold sweat soaking her back.

She thought the storm had passed, but the real judgment was just beginning...

Ethan opened the video, which clearly showed Tiffany deliberately bumping into Sophia Lowell. The force had been miscalculated, sending the phone into the fountain.

With an icy expression, he tossed the phone to Zachary and slowly twisted the ring on his pinky.

"Article Seven of the Roscente Family Code."

Tiffany's face drained of color, her lips trembling uncontrollably. She feared this indifferent demeanor of her uncle the most—the calmer he appeared, the more terrifying he became.

"Mistakes must be owned... No shirking responsibility..."

Before she could finish, she dropped to her knees with a thud. "Uncle, I was wrong! I'll apologize to Sophia right now!"

Ethan glanced down, toying with his ring. "What did she ask you to do?"

"G-Get the phone from the water..." Tiffany answered tearfully.

"Then what are you waiting for?"

Tiffany scrambled up, ignoring the pain in her knees, and waded into the fountain, lifting her skirt.

The icy water rose past her calves, making her shiver violently. After fumbling in the dim water for what felt like forever, she finally retrieved the phone.

"Mr. Roscente, the phone."

Zachary presented the soaked device.

Ethan gripped the cold phone, his gaze shifting to Tiffany in the water. "Kneel in the Ancestral Hall until dawn."

He turned to Zachary. "You'll supervise her personally."

The night wind cut like knives. Tiffany's soaked dress clung to her legs, and she nearly collapsed back into the water at the verdict.

Kneel all night? Would she even have legs left?

Ethan checked his watch. "Where is she?"

"The footage showed Miss Lowell speaking with Young Master Jason at the gate. They must have just left."

"Keys."

Zachary quickly handed over the car keys.

Ethan strode out with purpose.

Outside the Roland estate, Sophia was bidding farewell to Tyler Roland, completely unaware of the aftermath.

"Thank you for today," she said sincerely.

Tyler waved it off with a smile. "It was nothing."

After a few more pleasantries, she and Jason Roscente headed toward the parking lot.

Suddenly, her high heel caught on a pebble, and Sophia stumbled.

"Ah!"

She pitched sideways.

Jason reacted instantly, catching her by the waist.

Their proximity became intimate, breaths mingling.

Sophia looked up, startled, meeting Jason's handsome face mere inches away.

"Are these heels just for show?" He frowned, releasing her and casting a disdainful glance at her shoes.
###Chapter 203 

That afternoon while shopping, Vivian Ashcroft had instantly fallen in love with this pair of shoes and insisted Sophia buy them. Now her entire outfit, from head to toe, reflected Vivian's taste.

Jason Roscente's expression shifted instantly. "Actually, they look quite nice on you."

Sophia Lowell: "..."

His mood swings were ridiculously fast.

"What are you doing!"

Ethan Roscente's furious roar came from behind them. When he reached the parking lot, he saw Jason holding Sophia in his arms, his face darkening with rage.

Sophia glanced back at him without a word, yanking open the car door. "Drive."

Jason eyed Ethan's murderous expression. "Really not waiting for him?"

"Wait for him to demand an apology?" Sophia scoffed. "Dream on."

She slapped the seat impatiently. "Go. Now."

Jason shrugged and started the engine. The parking barrier blocked Ethan's path, and by the time he detoured around it, only the retreating taillights remained.

Ethan punched the steering wheel and slammed on the gas in pursuit.

Inside the car, Jason kept stealing glances at Sophia.

"What?" She bristled under his stare.

"You and Uncle Ethan have history." His tone was certain.

Sophia's heartbeat stuttered. "Don't be ridiculous."

"The way he looks at you isn't normal."

"Please. You're seeing things."

"Men understand men," Jason said meaningfully. "Especially that particular look."

Sophia rolled her eyes. "Since when did a brat like you become an expert?"

"In ancient times, men my age were already fathers."

"..."

Modern teenagers were impossible.

"Out with it. Did you two have something going on?" Jason pressed.

Sophia exhaled sharply. "It's over."

"Is it?" Jason smirked. "Uncle Ethan doesn't seem to think so."

"You're blind—"

A blaring horn cut her off. Jason checked the rearview mirror. "Uncle's catching up. Told you so."

"Unless you want to call me Aunt Sophia, step on it."

"Wouldn't bother me," Jason drawled. "Someone's got to fill that role eventually."

Sophia twisted to see the approaching headlights and tried a new tactic. "Some race car driver you are."

"Reverse psychology won't work on me." Jason remained unflappable. "I respect my elders."

"Oh?" Sophia arched a brow. "But Vivian can't stand him. Guess you're incompatible after all."
###Chapter 204

Jason Roscente's expression visibly wavered.

Sophia seized the opportunity, a sly smile curling at the corners of her lips. "Help me lose him, and Vivian Ashcroft's WeChat is yours."

His head snapped toward her. "Seriously?"

"Have I ever lied to you?"

"Hold on tight!" Jason's eyes sharpened as the previously smooth-running sports car roared to life, shooting forward like an arrow released from its bow.

Sophia was slammed back into her seat by the force, watching the shrinking headlights in the rearview mirror with glee. "Perfect! Can you go faster?"

The engine screamed as the speedometer needle swung wildly to the right.

"Damn it!"

Ethan Roscente's knuckles whitened on the steering wheel as he glared at the taillights weaving ahead. With a cold smirk, he floored the accelerator.

The two sports cars tore through the night in a high-speed chase. Just as Jason began to smirk, the familiar black Maybach filled his rearview mirror.

The window rolled down, revealing Ethan's chiseled profile under the streetlights. "Pull over."

Sophia's breath hitched. Gripping the seatbelt, she caught Jason's hesitation and urged, "Don't stop! I'll give you Vivian's number too!"

A competitive fire ignited in Jason's eyes. He flashed Ethan a racing hand signal before wrenching the wheel. Tires screeched as the car executed a perfect drift, abruptly changing direction.

Sophia was thrown against the door, instinctively shielding her abdomen. The night wind howled through the cabin, and she realized things had spiraled out of control.

Ethan narrowed his eyes. The speedometer hovered in the danger zone now. Like a cat toying with prey, he systematically blocked every attempt Jason made to overtake.

After repeated provocations, Jason saw red. As he prepared for a reckless acceleration, the Maybach suddenly swerved sideways—

"Screech—!"

At the near-collision, Jason slammed the brakes. Sophia's stomach lurched as she looked up to see Ethan striding toward them, his long legs eating up the distance.

"Open the door."

Jason forced a laugh as he lowered the window. "Uncle Ethan, your driving skills are still unmatched..."

"Spare me." Ethan reached for the door handle.

Sophia shook her head frantically, her nails digging into her palms.
###Chapter 205

Jason Roscente flashed a roguish grin. "Don't blame me, man. You saw it yourself—I can't take him in a fight. If we keep this up, we're both toast."

"You think I'd be paying you if reasoning with him was an option?"

"Cut your losses," Jason said, swiftly unlocking the passenger door. "Survival first."

The door was yanked open. Ethan Roscente loomed over them, his expression stormy. "Get out."

Sophia Lowell clung to her seatbelt. "No."

A cold smirk twisted his lips. "Grew a spine, did you? Seems you need a reminder of who's in charge."

He leaned in to unbuckle her. Sophia fought back, shoving at his hands. "Get off me! Don't touch me!"

The struggle was futile.

The belt clicked open, and she was hauled over his shoulder. Sophia thrashed wildly. "Let go! Help! Someone call the police—this man's kidnapping me!"

Jason scratched his ear. "Uncle, maybe dial it down a notch with the lady—"

"Shut it!" Ethan snapped. "Ten-thousand-word reflection. No car keys until it's on my desk tomorrow."

"Come on!" Jason wailed. "I need this ride to impress the campus queen!"

His protests fell on deaf ears.

Sophia was dumped unceremoniously into the backseat. She lunged for the door handle, then pounded the window when she found it locked.

"Ethan Roscente! I’m not apologizing to Isabella Valentine!"

He slid in beside her and dragged her back by the waist. "Who said anything about an apology?"

"Stop pretending!" Sophia sneered. "You dragged me back just to grovel to the Valentines, didn’t you?"

"I already handled it."

"Your fake chivalry makes me sick!" She wrenched free, her nails raking a crimson line down his cheek.

"Sophia!" His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper.

"What?" She tilted her chin up defiantly. "Consider it a free lesson in how to treat women."

A vein pulsed at his temple. Rubbing his forehead, he exhaled sharply. "All this drama over nothing? Fine, skip the apology. But take your temper out on me again, and we’ll see who’s laughing."

"Sure. And pigs might fly."

###Chapter 206

The car turned onto an unfamiliar street. Sophia Lowell instinctively straightened her spine.

"Where are we going?" Her fingers tightened around the seatbelt.

Ethan Roscente rested one hand on the steering wheel, his profile flickering under the streetlights. "A hotel."

"I want to go home!" Her voice rose sharply.

The rearview mirror reflected his faintly amused smirk. "Afraid I'll devour you?"

Sophia scoffed. "Who wouldn't be scared of sharing a room with a rapist?"

Tires screeched as Ethan slammed the brakes. He turned and gripped her chin. "Then keep quiet." His thumb brushed her lips. "Or I might just prove you right."

The scent of leather and cedar filled the car. Sophia turned away, fogging the window with her breath.

"I saw the footage." He tossed a phone into her lap. "Tiffany knelt in the ancestral hall all night."

The cold screen pressed against her thigh. She hesitated before touching it. "With your busy schedule, why bother—"

"Still angry?" He leaned in suddenly, his breath hot against her ear.

She flinched back. "Do you even care?"

"Of course." His hand closed around the nape of her neck, dragging her close like a misbehaving kitten. "You pout so much—were you a pufferfish in your past life?"

"Let go!" She clawed at his fingers.

Instead, his arm tightened. He buried his face in her hair. "Stop running off with other men." His voice was muffled. "It irritates me."

Sophia laughed abruptly. "Jason was the first to ever fight for me." She drawled deliberately. "His skills were—"

Thud.

The leather seat dented under Ethan's fist. A blizzard raged in his eyes. "Say that again."

A bodyguard up front stammered, "Miss Lowell, actually that day—"

"Get out!"

The window rolled down. As icy wind rushed in, Sophia watched the man scramble away in terror. Ethan's grip on her waist trembled, as if he was barely holding back.

"You have no idea..." His Adam's apple bobbed. "That night, I—"

A shrill ringtone cut him off. The screen flashed brightly: Jason Roscente.
###Chapter 207

Ethan Roscente's gaze turned dangerously icy. The bodyguard immediately fell silent, not daring to utter another word.

Zachary Evans was right—the boss was destined to die alone.

The bodyguard thought bitterly to himself.

The man had a perfectly good mouth, yet he refused to speak like a human being. All he knew was how to glare and throw tantrums.

No wonder Sophia Lowell wanted nothing to do with him.

Even he wouldn’t tolerate such an insufferable, stone-hearted man.

Ethan stared at his reddened knuckles, the emotions churning in his chest no longer containable. He dialed Jason Roscente’s number. "Meet me in the boxing room."

"???"

Jason, who had been about to return to campus to write a self-criticism, was utterly confused.

Why the sudden demand to spar?

Sophia reacted instantly. "Don’t go! He’s going to beat you up!"

Jason hung up in sheer panic.

Holy hell!

That was a close call.

He slammed on the accelerator. As long as he made it back to his dorm, he’d be safe.

The abrupt disconnection darkened Ethan’s expression. He gripped Sophia’s chin. "Protecting him now?"

"What else?" she sneered. "Watch you lose control again?"

Her breathing was uneven, her eyes filled with mockery. "Ethan Roscente, what else are you good at besides taking your anger out on others?"

The disdain in her gaze cut deep. His grip tightened, his words laced with venom. "Sophia, you certainly have a habit of shielding men. First Sebastian Valdemar, now Jason. Who’s next? That brat Tyler Roland? Even children aren’t safe from you. Your tastes are… unique."

Sophia’s pupils contracted sharply. Her nails dug into her palms.

She saw Tyler as a younger brother. Yet Ethan could say something so vile.

How was he any different from William Valentine and his daughter?

In his eyes, she had always been beneath contempt.

She turned her face away. "Since that’s how you see me, let me out. I wouldn’t want to dirty your car—I can’t afford to pay for the cleaning."

Ethan released her, disgusted. He pulled out a handkerchief and wiped his fingers as if they’d touched something filthy.

The handkerchief was tossed carelessly to the floor.

Sophia stared at it, feeling as though her dignity had been trampled just the same.

She blinked away the moisture in her eyes and flashed the bodyguard a bright, artificial smile.

###Chapter 208

 "Pull over."

The bodyguard hesitated, unwilling to defy Ethan’s orders.

Sophia’s lips curled in derision. "What’s wrong, Mr. Roscente? Not disgusted anymore? Or are you planning to take me to a hotel for a quick fuck?"

She had never spoken so crudely before.

Ethan’s chest constricted. He shut his eyes tightly. "Stop the car. Let her out."

The vehicle screeched to a halt.

Sophia stepped out without looking back.

The black sedan sped away, leaving her behind.

Dark clouds swallowed the moon. A cold wind rose abruptly.

The late spring night carried a biting chill. Dressed in only a thin gown and heels, Sophia sank onto the roadside.

She reached for her phone to call a ride, only to find the screen black.

Right. It had been ruined by water.

Just her luck.
Raindrops pounded the asphalt, sending up tiny sprays of water.

Sophia Lowell walked barefoot, each step like treading on knives. The night wind carried icy rain down her collar, making her teeth chatter.

An engine growled behind her.

She instinctively moved aside, but blinding headlights forced her to shut her eyes.

"Get in."

The car window lowered, revealing Ethan Roscente's sharp profile. Rain slid down his jawline and disappeared beneath his collar.

Sophia turned her face away.

The sound of tires splashing through puddles faded into the distance.

She counted her steps—then suddenly found herself lifted into the air. Ethan's chest burned against her, his scent of ambergris mixing with rainwater until her head spun.

"Put me down!"

"Shut up." His arms tightened. "Keep struggling and I'll throw you into the ocean."

A bodyguard jogged over with an umbrella, tactfully averting his eyes from the drenched figure in his boss's arms.

Inside the car, the heater blasted warm air.

Sophia curled into the corner, watching the blurred rain outside. Her silk dress clung to her, outlining the sharp edges of her shoulder blades.

"Put this on."

His suit jacket, still warm from his body, dropped over her head. She tried to shrug it off—only for his hand to clamp around her wrist.

"Sophia." Ethan's voice was rough. "Must you always be this stubborn?"

Rain dripped from his hair, leaving dark stains on the leather seats.

Suddenly she remembered that rainy night three years ago. The same torrential downpour. Him standing outside the marriage registry, clutching their voided marriage certificate.

"You flatter me, Mr. Roscente." She forced a smile. "I wouldn't dare oppose you."

The car radio interrupted with a breaking news alert:

"Armed robbery reported on Coastal Highway. Residents advised to avoid the area—"

Ethan's expression darkened.

He yanked off his tie. The metal clip hit the window with a sharp clink.

"Turn around!"

Tires screeched on the wet pavement. Sophia was thrown against his chest by the momentum, her ear pressed to the frantic rhythm of his heartbeat.

"Scared now?" His fingers dug into her chin. "If I hadn't come back tonight—"

He cut himself off.

The windshield wipers moved mechanically. On the glass, two trails of water kept intersecting before parting again.

Just like them—forever entangled, never reconciled.
###Chapter 209

The rain poured down in sheets as Ethan Roscente shoved Sophia Lowell into the backseat with swift efficiency.

"Take her home."

The car door slammed shut, sending water splashing.

Sophia quickly rolled down the window. "It's pouring! How will you get back?"

"I won't die."

He turned and walked away, his figure soon swallowed by the rain.

As the bodyguard hit the gas, Sophia craned her neck to look back. "Is it really okay to leave him here alone?"

"Mr. Roscente has already arranged for a car."

The rain grew heavier. Ethan stood by the roadside, lighting a cigarette. Water trailed down his jawline, soaking his shirt.

His phone screen flickered before going dark.

"Damn it."

He pressed the power button furiously, but the device remained unresponsive.

Cold rain lashed his face as he glared at the empty street, his expression darker than the storm clouds.

......

The Valentine mansion blazed with light as a bolt of lightning split the night sky.

"Useless! Can't even keep a man!"

William Valentine's palm struck hard, sending Isabella Valentine stumbling to the floor.

"Dad, I'm sorry—" She crawled forward on her knees, clutching his pant leg. "Give me another chance—"

"Another chance?" William kicked over the coffee table. "Ethan Roscente humiliated me to my face!"

The shattering glass made Isabella tremble violently.

"It's Sophia! That bitch seduced Ethan!" she shrieked suddenly. "If we just get rid of her—"

"Enough!" William yanked her up by the collar. "You have three days. If you fail, we'll replace you in the marriage alliance."

Isabella collapsed to the floor, her nails digging deep into her palms.

Once her father left, she pulled out her phone, her eyes glinting with venom.

......

Sophia sneezed, bundled in a blanket.

Pregnant women couldn't take medicine. She sighed, clutching a mug of hot water.

The steady patter of rain filled the room as she traced the rivulets on the windowpane with her gaze.
###Chapter 210

Sophia Lowell had to replace her entire set of communication devices after her phone got waterlogged. Standing in the service center, she stared blankly at the screen of her new phone.

Eight missed calls from "Ethan the Bastard."

Her finger hovered over the screen, hesitating whether to call back, when the phone suddenly vibrated.

"What now?" she answered sharply.

"Miss Lowell!" Zachary Evans' panicked voice came through, gasping for breath. "Mr. Roscente has a high fever—he's unconscious!"

"Take him to the hospital," she said flatly.

"He refuses!" Zachary's voice trembled. "His temperature is 103.6°F. If this continues, it could be dangerous!"

Sophia clenched the phone. The same thing happened last time Ethan was injured—he wouldn’t let anyone near him.

"He was out in the rain all night," Zachary suddenly whispered. "Because he gave his car to you..."

Sophia’s breath hitched.

"Where’s the driver?"

"Sent to supervise Miss Tiffany’s punishment in the Ancestral Hall." Zachary gave a bitter laugh. "Mr. Roscente’s phone died, so he walked all the way back to Bayview Residences."

A dull thud sounded from the other end of the line.

"Miss Lowell! He collapsed again!" Zachary was practically shouting now. "I’m begging you—"

"Send me the address." She hung up and flagged down a taxi.

The scenery outside the window blurred past. Sophia stared at her whitened knuckles and realized—her hands were shaking.
###Chapter 211

The pharmacy's glass door reflected the blinding sunlight. Sophia Lowell squinted as she pushed it open.

Five minutes later, she stepped out clutching a box of fever reducers. The security guard at Bayview Residences nodded at her as she took the private elevator straight to the penthouse.

The doors slid open to reveal Zachary Evans' frantic face.

"Ms. Lowell!" He looked ready to drop to his knees. "You're finally here!"

Sophia arched a brow, slipping off her shoes while eyeing the half-million-dollar-a-year assistant. "Zachary, does your boss pay you that much just to perform melodramas in his foyer?"

Zachary choked on his reply.

The bedroom door stood ajar. Sophia pushed it open—then froze mid-step.

Ethan Roscente lay sprawled across the bed, a towel draped loosely over his hips. His golden chest rose and fell unevenly, damp strands of hair clinging to his fever-flushed forehead. The usually composed features were now twisted in discomfort.

"He took an ice bath as soon as he got home," Zachary whispered. "By the time I found him, his fever had spiked to 103."

Sophia approached the bed. Even unconscious, the man's sculpted physique commanded attention.

She reached to check his temperature. Her wrist was suddenly seized in a vice-like grip.

"Get out." Ethan's voice was hoarse, but his hold was ironclad.

Sophia hissed in pain. "Ethan! It's me!"

His lashes fluttered. The grip loosened slightly, but he stubbornly clung to her. "Don't go..."

Zachary hovered awkwardly with a glass of water.

With a sigh, Sophia leaned close to Ethan's ear. "I'm not leaving." Her fingers brushed his burning skin, abruptly recalling a rainy night three years prior.

The alley had reeked of blood. Under her umbrella, she'd spotted a battered teenager curled against the wall. Bloodied but defiant, he'd grabbed her ankle and uttered those same words.

She'd relented then.

And she was relenting now.
###Chapter 212

That ring woven from foxtail grass, the bouquet of wildflowers picked carelessly, those tender words... all just her wishful thinking.

He had only ever used her. Even his life-saving act was a lie...

"Miss Sophia, here's the water."

Zachary's voice snapped her out of her thoughts. She realized her cheeks were wet with tears. Her softened heart hardened again as she tried to wrench her wrist from Ethan's grip. "You feed him."

But the man's fingers tightened. His lips moved faintly beneath closed eyelids. "Sophia... you promised not to leave..."

"Leave?" Sophia scoffed. "Stay and keep being fooled by you?"

Her voice carried clearly, leaving Zachary bewildered. Just moments ago, she'd seemed to relent—how had fetching water changed her mind?

As Sophia struggled, her nails leaving red marks on Ethan's hand, Zachary intervened. "Miss Sophia, Mr. Roscente is unconscious. This is just a reflex. You'll hurt yourself—"

"Reflex?" Her lips curled mockingly. "Right. His reflex is to deceive me."

She snatched the glass from Zachary and flung the water onto Ethan's face.

"..."

Zachary gaped.

No one in the world would dare treat Mr. Roscente like this—except Sophia.

The cold water made Ethan frown. His eyes fluttered open, landing on her icy expression. For a moment, he seemed dazed. "Am I still dreaming?"

The woman who'd walked away so decisively couldn't possibly be here.

"Keep dreaming!" Sophia slammed the pills onto the nightstand. "Take your medicine!"

Only then did Ethan fully wake. "Why are you here?"

"To see if you're dead yet." She shook her trapped wrist. "Now that you're awake, let go!"

Noticing Zachary's pointed look, Ethan caught on. He groaned dramatically, pressing a hand to his forehead and yanking her into his arms. "Sophia, I feel awful..."

"You—!" She tried to push him away, but her palm met scorching skin. She recoiled. "You're burning up!"

"Yes, Miss Sophia," Zachary chimed in. "Without medicine, it could get serious."

Sophia smirked. "Just send him straight to the crematorium."

"..."

Zachary shot his boss a sympathetic glance.

Ethan ignored the jab, nuzzling her cool skin like a spoiled child. "Sophia, you're so cool..."

"Ethan Roscente!" She squirmed, uncomfortable. "If you don't take these pills, you'll fry your brain!"

"No pills." His arms tightened stubbornly. "Holding you is enough."

Zachary discreetly turned away. Mr. Roscente's shamelessness had reached new heights.

With a sigh, Sophia pushed his head back and gestured for Zachary to refill the glass. Gazing down at his fever-flushed face, her tone softened despite herself. "Take the medicine first, okay?"
###Chapter 213

"No."

"......"

Sick Ethan Roscente was acting like a petulant child.

His fingers clung stubbornly to the hem of her blouse, his gaze so obstinate it gave her a headache.

Sophia Lowell took a deep breath and hardened her expression. "Ethan, I swear I'll lose my temper if you keep this up."

He stilled, lifting his eyes to hers with a wounded look. "If I let go, you'll leave."

"I won't. Not if you take your medicine like you're supposed to."

"Promise?"

She nodded. "I keep my word."

Ethan loosened his grip slightly but still refused to release her wrist. Zachary Evans seized the moment to hand her a glass of water. "Miss Lowell."

Accepting it, she motioned for the assistant to retrieve the fever reducers.

"Take these."

She held out the pills and water, but Ethan didn’t move.

"Too weak..." He blinked feebly.

Sophia glanced at the hand still clamped around hers and scoffed. Without hesitation, she pinched his chin and shoved the pills into his mouth.

"Bitter!" His face scrunched in distaste.

"Drink. It’ll help."

He propped himself up sluggishly, sipping from the glass she held. Seeing him so docile for once, Sophia found herself asking impulsively, "Want more?"

A slight nod.

Zachary moved to refill the glass but suddenly gasped. "Damn it—the board meeting!"

Flustered, he turned to Sophia. "Miss Lowell, I’m entrusting Mr. Roscente to you!"

"What’s the point of a meeting without him?" She saw right through the act.

"The resort project can’t afford delays. If I miss another one, those old foxes will riot."

Before she could retort, Zachary bolted from the room.

Sophia gritted her teeth.

The man might as well have "wingman" tattooed on his forehead.

She shot Ethan a frosty glare. "Your idea?"

"Swear I’m innocent." He batted his lashes. "Haven’t even touched my phone."

Though Zachary definitely deserved a doubled bonus this year.

Sophia tucked the blankets around him. "Let go. I won’t leave—consider it a sickday pass."

Ethan studied her for a long moment before finally uncurling his fingers.
###Chapter 214

Ethan Roscente's grip left angry red marks on Sophia Lowell's slender wrist. She rotated it gently, her voice calm. "Get some rest. I'll make congee."

Before he could respond, she'd already left the bedroom.

His gaze followed her until the door clicked shut. Only after hearing pots clattering in the kitchen did he close his eyes with relief.

By the time the congee was ready, Ethan had fallen into a deep sleep. Sophia pressed a hand to his forehead and frowned at the scorching heat.

"103.6°F..." She grabbed an ice pack from the fridge, wrapped it in a towel, and placed it on his forehead. A basin of cool water and repeated sponge baths followed.

After several rounds, the medication finally took effect. His fever broke. Sophia exhaled sharply—she'd been moments away from calling an ambulance.

She texted Zachary Evans: "ETA?"

"Still tied up. Appreciate your help, Ms. Lowell."

"I'll wait." After sending the reply, she collapsed onto the couch. Exhaustion from her own cold and nursing Ethan pulled her into sleep.

Golden sunset streaked through the half-drawn curtains. Ethan woke to the dim light, his eyes immediately searching for Sophia.

Finding her curled on the couch, he lifted her carefully and placed her on the bed. The bitterness of medicine faded when his lips met hers, sweetness taking its place.

"If only you'd always be this obedient..." His fingertip brushed her nose. Sophia frowned in her sleep, turning away from his touch.

Ethan pulled her close, tucking her against his chest. Breathing in her floral shampoo, he closed his eyes in contentment.

Dawn shattered with the shrill ring of a phone. Sophia groped blindly, her fingers encountering cool, firm muscle instead of her device.

A sharp inhale sounded beside her ear. Just as her exploring fingers trailed lower, her wrist was captured in an iron grip.

"Sophia." Ethan's voice was rough with sleep and something darker. "You're playing with fire."
###Chapter 215

Sophia jolted awake, meeting Ethan Roscente's fathomless dark gaze.

Her breath hitched.

The corner of his lips curled as he pressed the vibrating phone into her palm. "Enjoying yourself earlier? This is actually your phone."

Realization dawned. Her ears burned. She hit answer without looking.

"Sophia, open the door! I'm outside your apartment!" Emily Laurent's urgent voice crackled through the receiver.

"What?"

Sophia bolted upright. Seeing Ethan's composed expression beside her, panic surged like a cheating wife caught red-handed. She frantically shoved at his shoulders, signaling him to hide.

His brows knitted. One hand clamped her shoulder, pulling her close. "Relax," his lips brushed her earlobe, "This is my place."

Warm breath grazed her skin. A shiver ran down her spine. Only then did she remember—she was still at Bayview Residences.

"I'm not home," she exhaled into the phone.

Emily eyed the locked door skeptically. "Not home? I've been here since dawn. Did you stay out all night?"

Avoiding Ethan's amused stare, Sophia muffled the mic. "I'm at Vivian's—"

A low chuckle cut through the quiet bedroom.

"Since when does Vivian have a man over?" Emily's tone sharpened.

Sophia's pulse spiked. She shot Ethan a warning glare. "Just...the TV. I'll be back soon— Ah!"

Her excuse dissolved against his invading lips.

The phone tumbled onto sheets as he gripped her chin, kissing her with punishing intensity.

"What was that?" Emily demanded. "That didn't sound like any TV! Where are you really, Sophia?"

Morning arousal already simmering, Ethan was now fully ignited. He nipped the tender skin of her neck, branding fresh marks over old ones.

She bit her lip hard, stifling any sound.

"Tell your aunt who you're with," he coaxed darkly, sucking her earlobe.

When she resisted, his hand slid under her shirt, squeezing ruthlessly.

"Mmm—" A moan escaped before she could stop it.

The line erupted. "Sophia! That sound was suspicious! What are you doing? Who's there with you?"
###Chapter 216

Sophia tensed as Emily interrogated her. Her slender arms wrapped around Ethan Roscente's neck, her voice trembling slightly. "Stop..."

The man paused, amusement flickering in his eyes. "How exactly should you beg?"

She answered by locking her legs around his waist.

Ethan released her with a satisfied smirk. Sophia immediately regained her composure. "I'm out getting a spa treatment with Vivian. I'll be back soon."

"No need," Emily said sternly. "Send me your location. I'm coming to you. Let’s see what you’ve done now."

"What’s wrong?" Sophia frowned.

"That bitch Tiffany Roscente ran to Victoria Langley and tattled. I’ve been dealing with her nonsense all night."

Sophia shot Ethan a glare before replying, "Fine. I’ll send the address."

She quickly texted Vivian for backup.

The moment she set her phone down, a large hand pulled her back onto the bed. Ethan loomed over her. "Sophia, when are you going to make this official?"

She shoved him away. "Have you lost your mind?"

Their relationship wasn’t something to hide—it was something that shouldn’t exist at all.

Smoothing her disheveled clothes, she stormed out without a backward glance.

Outside the café, Vivian’s car pulled up just in time.

"Where’s your aunt?" Vivian leaned out the window.

Sophia gestured toward the distance. "Over there. Remember our story."

Vivian gave her a knowing look. "What exactly did you do last night?"

"Later," Sophia hissed. "Help me get through this first."

Emily was already impatient. "Weren’t you just at a nearby spa? What took so long?"

"We had to finish the treatment," Sophia said smoothly.

"Where’s Vivian?" Emily glanced around.

"Parking the car."

Right on cue, Vivian rushed over, breathless. "Aunt Emily! Your skin is flawless! I feel like a mess next to you!"

The flattery made Emily beam, her frustration from Victoria’s antics fading slightly.
###Chapter 217

"Aunt Emily, your skin is absolutely flawless!" Vivian Ashcroft linked arms with Emily Laurent, her crescent-moon eyes sparkling. "People would mistake you for my sister!"

Emily chuckled, patting Vivian's hand. "You sweet talker. If Sophia were half as charming as you, I'd look ten years younger."

Vivian winked at Sophia Lowell triumphantly, but her smile froze mid-gesture.

"Look out!"

Her head snapped upward. A dark object plummeted from a fifth-floor window.

Sophia reacted instantly, shoving Emily aside. A flowerpot grazed their sleeves before shattering on the pavement, ceramic shards scattering like shrapnel.

"Sophia!" Vivian yanked her friend behind her, voice trembling. "Are you hurt?"

Sophia's gaze locked onto the window, catching only the fleeting swish of a skirt. The shattered remains formed a chillingly precise pattern—an unmistakable warning.

"Vivian," Sophia's voice turned glacial, "take Aunt Emily to the hospital."

Emily winced, clutching her twisted ankle. "It's too dangerous—"

"Security's on their way." Sophia already had her phone pressed to her ear. "I'll join you after I handle this."

As Vivian helped Emily toward the parking lot, she called over her shoulder, "Don't go up there alone!"

The fifth-floor café stood eerily vacant.

Sophia scanned the space. The fourth window table lacked its usual potted plant. A waiter cleared nearby dishes.

"The guest at this table—where did they go?"

"Just left." The server handed her a napkin. "The lady left you a message."

Crude letters sprawled across the paper: Stay away from Ethan Roscente. Next time it won't be a flowerpot.

Sophia's fingers turned icy. The threat mirrored previous texts, but now brazenly overt.

"Security footage?"

"System crashed this morning." The waiter lowered his voice. "She said her surname was Valentine."

Isabella Valentine!

Sophia's fists clenched, nails biting into her palms.
###Chapter 218

The moment her phone lit up, Sophia knew exactly who it was.

No one but Isabella Valentine would call at this critical juncture.

"Isabella, what do you want?" She answered immediately, her voice icy.

A soft chuckle came through the line, laced with chilling delight. "Guessed it was me so quickly? Not as dumb as you look."

Sophia's fingers tightened around the napkin, her knuckles turning white.

"But..." Isabella's tone darkened abruptly. "This is just the beginning. Should we arrange a few more 'accidents'?"

"Don't you dare!" Sophia shot to her feet, drawing stares from nearby diners. "Come at me if you want, but leave my aunt out of this!"

"Oh, getting worked up?" Isabella drawled. "Stay away from Ethan, or next time it won't just be a minor car crash."

Outside, sunlight vanished behind gathering clouds. A chill ran down Sophia's spine.

"You think Ethan Roscente actually cares about you?" Isabella's voice slithered into her ear like a venomous snake. "Did you see his face when he made you apologize in public the other night?"

Sophia's nails dug into her palms.

"Oh, and that precious best friend of yours..." Isabella lowered her voice. "What if something unfortunate happened to her—"

"Isabella!" Sophia hissed through clenched teeth. "If you lay a finger on Vivian, I swear I'll—"

"With what?" The laughter that followed was razor-sharp. "You're just an orphan with no family, no power."

Sophia's chest heaved, her ears ringing.

"Remember," Isabella's voice dropped to a whisper. "This is your warning. If I catch you near Ethan again..."

The line went dead.

Sophia stared at the darkened screen, her blood turning to ice.

She should've known.

Isabella would never let things go—not since that birthday banquet.

Outside, storm clouds blotted out the sky.
###Chapter 219

The antiseptic smell in the hospital hallway stung Sophia's nose.

She pushed open the door to find Emily propped against the headboard, scrolling through her phone. A bandage wrapped around her ankle, her face still pale with shock.

"Auntie, what did the doctor say?"

"Just a sprain." Emily set her phone aside and grasped her hand. "Did you find out who did this?"

Sophia's lashes fluttered.

The surveillance footage had been tampered with. The security guards had been evasive. These details swirled in her mind before she sighed. "No leads."

"It was deliberate!" Emily smacked the mattress in frustration. "That flowerpot was huge. If I hadn't dodged in time—"

Sophia's grip tightened on her bag strap.

She knew exactly who was behind this. Isabella's arrogant threat still echoed in her ears: This time it's your aunt. Next time, who knows?

"Rest well." She tucked the blanket around Emily. "I'll handle this."

The sedative took effect quickly. Sophia stood by the bed, throat tight as she studied the fine lines at the corners of her aunt's eyes.

Vivian slipped in and pressed a warm milk carton into her hands.

"The Valentines?" Vivian cut straight to the point as they sat on a bench in the hallway.

Sophia ran her fingers along the carton's edge and nodded.

"I knew it!" Vivian punched the bench's backrest. "That troublemaker Ethan Roscente!"

"It's probably about the birthday banquet." Sophia summarized the events of that night.

Vivian's eyes widened. "The Roscentes' shamelessness is hereditary?" She lowered her voice. "But they got what they wanted that night. Why lash out now?"

Sophia gazed at the darkening sky outside.

The window reflected her pressed lips. Isabella's反常 behavior. Tiffany's evasive glances. Ethan's recent barrage of missed calls. These fragments churned in her mind.

"Unless..." Vivian leaned closer. "The Valentines are about to collapse?"

At the end of the hallway, a nurse wheeled a medicine cart past. The squeak of wheels against tile sounded like an ominous portent.
###Chapter 220

Sophia's fingers tapped lightly on the table, dark currents swirling in her eyes.

"This isn't over."

Vivian leaned closer. "Got a plan to deal with her?"

She took a sip of milk, a white droplet lingering at the corner of her lips.

"Still thinking."

Vivian suddenly grinned, mischief flashing in her eyes. "I have an idea."

"Let's hear it."

"Isabella cares about Ethan more than anything. Why don't you..." Vivian made a suggestive gesture. "Guaranteed to drive her insane."

Sophia's fingers stilled.

"Too risky."

She shook her head. "Ethan would misunderstand."

Vivian pouted. "True. That bastard's more troublesome than Isabella."

Changing the subject, Sophia recalled the recent phone call.

"What happened?"

Vivian's eyes lit up. "Good news! My agent landed me a reality show."

Sophia's pulse quickened.

"What kind?"

"A live family bonding show. Participants bring relatives." Vivian grabbed her wrist. "Come with me. My siblings are useless."

Sophia hesitated. "We're not blood-related..."

"People bring honorary brothers all the time!" Vivian insisted. "Just two or three days. Dates aren't set yet."

Sophia frowned slightly.

"Professor Theodore also got me a show."

She explained Theodore's arrangement.

Vivian clapped. "Perfect! You need the money now. It'll be harder when your belly shows."

"Worried about scheduling conflicts."

"Your show takes priority," Vivian said breezily. "I'll just find another honorary relative."

Sophia nodded. "We'll check the dates."

After seeing Emily back to the Roscente estate, Sophia texted Theodore.

"I'm in."

Theodore's voice carried delight. "The script outline will be sent shortly."

On filming day, outside the TV station.

Sophia dialed Emily's number.

"How's your foot feeling?"
###Chapter 221

Emily's voice came through the phone in a rushed flurry, cutting the call short after just two sentences.

Sophia stared blankly at her darkened screen.

Her aunt was always the picture of composure. This abruptness was unlike her.

Shaking her head, Sophia turned and stepped into the television studio.

Sebastian leaned against the hallway corner, waiting. The moment he spotted her, his lips curved. "Done with your call?"

"Yeah."

"Let's go. Recording starts soon. We'll review the script first, then touch up your makeup."

Originally, the show had only invited Sophia. Later, the director decided to bring Sebastian on as an expert consultant to add depth. Their pairing—theory meeting practice—elevated the program instantly.

Sophia fell into step beside him.

With no rehearsals for this live broadcast, the director noticed her tension and smiled reassuringly. "Relax. Just standing there, you two are ratings gold."

It wasn't an exaggeration. Together, they outshone even the A-list celebrities present.

"Thanks, Director." Sophia chuckled.

The live show began—a mix of games and interviews.

Among the six guests, four were actors promoting their new drama. Only Sophia and Sebastian were non-celebrities. Thankfully, the seasoned host kept the energy high through rounds of games.

During team assignments, Sophia was paired with the drama's second male lead.

The spoiled heir played his narcissistic, sleazy persona to perfection. Even on live TV, he couldn't resist hitting on her.

"Don't hold back, Professor Lowell," he flexed with a smarmy grin. "If you want to thank me, how about—"

"You're stepping on my shoe." Sophia's icy interruption cut through his act.

The man stumbled back, flushing. "S-sorry—"

"Just stay away," she said flatly. "I'm allergic to cheap cologne."

In the break room, Zachary nearly dropped his phone laughing.

So Miss Lowell's sharp tongue spared no one. He couldn't wait to share this clip with Mr. Roscente.

A knock sounded at the CEO's office door.
###Chapter 222

Sunlight filtered through the blinds, casting fragmented patterns across Ethan Roscente's office.

His slender fingers flipped through a merger proposal. The fountain pen left sharp strokes on the paper.

When Zachary Evans entered, the pen tip smudged a small ink blot.

"Speak." Ethan didn't look up, his voice icy.

Zachary swallowed hard.

"Miss Sophia's live reality show..." He hesitated. "Would you like to watch?"

The pen slammed onto the documents.

Ethan lifted his gaze. His dark eyes were like bottomless frozen pools. "Too much free time?"

Zachary stiffened. "I'll go finalize the quarterly reports!"

As the door clicked shut, Ethan tapped the spacebar.

The paused livestream resumed.

The camera focused on Sophia Lowell's profile. Her lashes cast delicate shadows when she looked down. A speck of sand clung to her nose.

Sebastian Valdemar stood beside her, sleeves rolled to his elbows, revealing toned forearms. He handed her a tool with practiced ease.

"Thanks." Sophia reached out, her fingertips brushing his hand.

The director instantly zoomed in.

Sebastian's Adam's apple bobbed. His fingers curled slightly as he withdrew. The way he looked at her dripped with tenderness.

The comments exploded.

[Just get married already!]
[That look says everything!]
[Rumor says they were inseparable in college.]

Ethan's knuckles whitened around the desk edge.

BANG!

The entire 28th floor heard the crash from the CEO's office.

When Zachary rushed in, the latest MacBook lay shattered on the floor—a modern art masterpiece. The screen's final flicker showed a flood of pink hearts.

Stealing a glance at his boss's stormy expression, Zachary had an epiphany—

Since when did Mr. Roscente watch reality shows?
###Chapter 223

The thought startled even himself.

Ethan Roscente watching reality TV?

He had just reprimanded her for watching shows during work hours.

But those pink subtitles and the shattered computer—how to explain those?

Ethan's icy gaze swept over Zachary before landing on the ruined laptop. "Clean this up."

His voice was calm, yet the office temperature seemed to drop instantly.

Zachary shivered. "Yes, sir."

Soon, the office was spotless, a new computer placed neatly on the desk.

Ethan opened a file, his tone low. "Get out."

Zachary hesitated. He wanted to ask if Ethan had seen Sophia and Sebastian's interaction.

One glance at his boss's stormy expression made him swallow the question. He turned and left.

A notification buzzed on his phone—an entertainment news alert.

Against his better judgment, Ethan tapped it. His face darkened instantly.

The university had officially released footage of Sophia and Sebastian collaborating, meant to promote the architecture program.

But their striking looks and effortless chemistry had gone viral.

What infuriated him more was the edited fan video pairing them romantically.

The title glared back at him: [Playful Designer x Gentle Professor] | Sweetest Moments.

Views had already surpassed 300,000.

The video slowed their interactions, adding romantic filters and a sugary love song, amplifying the intimacy.

Ethan's grip tightened on his phone. Their lingering eye contact burned his vision.

The comments section—flooded with "So perfect together!"—made his chest constrict.

He summoned Zachary and tossed him the phone. "Erase all related content and discussions."

Zachary entered confused and left even more baffled.

Only at the PR department's door did it click—his boss was jealous.

So this was how the ice-cold CEO handled jealousy. Petty and passive-aggressive.

Back in his office, Ethan took a deep breath and dialed Sophia.

During her hospital stay, he'd quietly removed himself from her blocked list.

The line connected. No answer.

Thirty minutes later, he tried again. Still nothing.

Patience evaporated. He grabbed his coat and strode out.
###Chapter 224

Zachary Evans rushed into the office, his suit jacket still carrying the chill from outside. He approached Ethan Roscente swiftly, keeping his voice low.

"Mr. Roscente, all videos and discussions about Miss Lowell have been completely erased. There's no trace of them online now."

Ethan stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, his slender fingers tapping lightly against the glass. He glanced at his watch, his tone icy.

"When does it end?"

"End...?" Zachary hesitated, momentarily confused.

Meeting Ethan's stormy expression, realization struck. He quickly checked the schedule.

"If we leave now, we can make it before the recording wraps up. The show runs for two hours."

Ethan's eyes darkened. He grabbed his suit jacket and strode toward the door.

"Get the car ready."

Backstage at the studio, Sophia Lowell had just finished removing her makeup when she noticed two missed calls on her phone.

Her finger paused over the name Ethan Roscente. She swiped the notification away without hesitation.

As she was about to put her phone away, Vivian Ashcroft's call flashed on the screen.

"Sophia! You're trending!" Vivian's voice was loud enough to pierce through the noise. "Your shipping video with Professor Orlando is blowing up the internet! That look he gave you—God, even I was blushing through the screen!"

Sophia leaned against the dressing room wall, rubbing her temples wearily.

"What are you talking about? I just finished filming."

"I'll send you the clip!" Vivian said excitedly. "Good thing I saved it—it's already been taken down. Probably reported by some jealous hater."

Her phone buzzed. Sophia tapped the video.

It was an edited montage of her interactions with Professor Orlando during the show, set to romantic music and flooded with "OMG they're so cute!" comments.

"This is ridiculous..." Sophia sighed. "We were just talking normally."

Vivian clicked her tongue. "Even your university's official account is shipping you two! The way he looks at you—like he wants to devour you whole!"

"Stop exaggerating," Sophia frowned. "He's just my senior from college."

"Please!" Vivian lowered her voice. "A guy like him, who even knows about your pregnancy—he’s practically the perfect rebound—"

"Vivian!" Sophia cut her off sharply. "I'm hanging up if you keep talking nonsense."

"Fine, fine, I'll drop it," Vivian backtracked. "But seriously, he’s a million times better than that scumbag Ethan. Think about it?"

Before Sophia could retort, the dressing room door swung open.

She looked up—and froze.

Ethan stood silhouetted in the doorway, his tall frame blocking the light. His expression was thunderous.

"Perfect timing," he said coldly, his gaze dropping to the still-glowing phone screen in her hand.
###Chapter 225

"Huh?"

"You'd make an excellent matchmaker with that silver tongue of yours." Sophia couldn't help but laugh. "Those professional matchmakers online are quite popular these days, but you're even more persuasive than them."

Vivian's voice crackled through the phone, indignant. "Sophia! I'm being sincere here, and you're making fun of me?"

"I'm serious." Sophia pressed her lips together to suppress a smile. "Your eloquence truly suits the profession."

"Oh, you—!" Vivian huffed. "Who do you think I'm worrying about? Decent men are practically extinct these days, and you're still dragging your feet!"

Sophia gazed at the sunset outside her window, her voice softening. "Mm, I know. I'm so touched I could cry."

"Enough with the sarcasm. The director's calling me." Vivian's tone turned hurried. "Remember what I said! A man like Sebastian Valdemar doesn't come around often!"

Before the call ended, Sophia received an exaggerated cheering sticker. Shaking her head with amusement, she turned—only to meet a pair of deep, penetrating eyes.

Sebastian stood a short distance away, her bag in hand.

"The studio's cleared out," he said, stepping closer. "I noticed you weren't there, so I brought your things."

Sophia took the bag, her fingertips brushing lightly against his knuckles. "Thanks. I was just on a call."

She silently thanked her lucky stars Vivian's outrageous comments hadn't been overheard.

At the end of the hallway stood a glass door. Sebastian quickened his pace to open it. Just as Sophia was about to thank him, a group of crew members carrying equipment surged past. He waited silently by the door, holding it open until everyone had passed before finally releasing it.

That small act of consideration warmed her heart.

It was precisely this kindness that made Vivian's suggestion seem all the more absurd. He deserved better.

As they stepped out of the television station, Sophia was about to say goodbye when Sebastian spoke first. "Dinner?"

"Can't." She waved her phone. "Still have a design draft to finish."

Streetlights flickered on one by one, casting dappled neon shadows across his sharp features. Suddenly, he called her name softly. "Sophia."

"Hmm?" She glanced down at her messages, her lashes fluttering like delicate fans under the glow.

For the cameras, she'd worn more makeup than usual. Her typically understated face now glowed with a radiant charm. Unconsciously, he took half a step closer. "You don't have to push yourself so hard. I could— Look out!"
###Chapter 226

Sebastian was mid-sentence when he noticed two crew members carrying heavy equipment toward them. Sophia stood with her back turned, oblivious to the approaching danger.

His pupils contracted. In one swift motion, he yanked her aside.

Sophia stumbled into his arms, her nose filling with the crisp scent of his shower gel—fresh and clean, like a forest after rain.

"What did you say?" She tilted her face up.

Their eyes locked, and for a moment, time seemed to freeze.

Outside the TV station, a black Maybach rolled to a stop. Ethan stepped out, his gaze sharp as a blade as it landed on the embracing pair.

"What the hell is this?"

His icy voice cut through the air. Sophia jerked back, pushing Sebastian away on instinct.

"Why are you here?" She frowned.

Dark currents churned in Ethan's eyes. The air around him thickened with palpable tension as he strode forward, his knuckles whitening around the memory of Sebastian's touch on Sophia.

"Am I interrupting?" His laugh was bitter.

Sophia turned her face away. "What's your problem now?"

"Couldn't wait, could you?" Ethan's voice dripped venom. "Should I book you a room?"

Sebastian stepped between them. "Mr. Roscente, you've misunderstood—"

"Does she not have legs? Since when is she your concern?" Ethan's words were laced with thorns.

Sophia trembled with anger, gripping Sebastian's sleeve. "Let's go. Ignore this lunatic."

The moment she turned, Ethan seized her wrist with bruising force, dragging her toward the car. Her heel caught on the pavement, sending a sharp pain up her leg.

"Let go!"

She clawed at his hand, leaving red marks, but he didn't flinch. With a rough shove, he forced her into the backseat. The door slammed shut with a deafening crash.

By the time Sebastian reached them, the taillights were already vanishing into the night. Jaw clenched, he pulled out his phone and dialed his agent.
###Chapter 227

Sebastian Valdemar lunged forward, gripping Ethan Roscente's wrist like a steel vise.

"Mr. Roscente, forcing someone against their will isn't gentlemanly behavior." His voice was icy. "You're hurting her."

Ethan halted, dark turbulence swirling in his eyes.

"Get out of my way." He shook off Sebastian's hand and adjusted his cuff. "This is a private family matter. Outsiders have no say."

Sebastian stood firm, shielding Sophia Lowell.

"My junior's concerns are mine." He didn't budge. "If she refuses, no one can force her."

Ethan let out a low chuckle that sent chills down the spine.

"What devoted senior-junior camaraderie." He leisurely unbuttoned his suit jacket. "But what's mine stays mine—even if I have to break it before letting others have it."

He stepped closer until their noses nearly touched.

"The last person who dared take what's mine is still hospitalized." Ethan narrowed his eyes. "Care to join him?"

Sophia suddenly grabbed Ethan's arm.

"Was Daniel Clementson's incident your doing?" Her voice trembled.

Ethan smirked disdainfully.

"Just a warning." He traced her pale cheek. "Who do you think will be next?"

Sebastian yanked Sophia behind him.

"Quite the display of power, Mr. Roscente." He sneered. "What kind of man bullies a woman?"

Ethan's gaze lingered on their clasped hands before turning glacial.

"Sophia." His tender tone was unnerving. "Are you sure you want him fighting your battles?"

Sophia recoiled from Sebastian as if electrocuted.

"I'll go with you." She bit her lip. "Leave the innocent out of this."

Sebastian moved to intervene, but Sophia shook her head.

Their silent exchange fueled Ethan's rage. He roughly dragged Sophia and shoved her into the car.

The black Maybach sped off, leaving Sebastian standing alone, his knuckles white.

The car's atmosphere was suffocating.

Sophia rubbed her reddened wrist, breaking the silence first.

"What's today's performance about?" She mocked. "An inquisition? Or catching me in the act?"

Up front, Zachary Evans nearly choked on his saliva.

Ethan seized her chin.

"Who gave you permission to join that show?" He gritted his teeth. "From today onward, you're staying home—no exceptions."
###Chapter 228

"Don't you dare tell me how to do my job!" Sophia Lowell slapped Ethan Roscente's hand away, the sequins at the corners of her eyes glinting sharply under the lights.

Her stage makeup was heavy tonight. The eyeliner accentuated the seductive curve of her eyes, and her lips were painted a startling red. The pale dress clung to her waist, outlining curves that would make any man's blood run hot. Her wavy hair swung in a graceful arc as she turned in anger.

Ethan's temple throbbed as he took in her appearance. The thought of her flaunting herself like this all evening in front of Sebastian Valdemar—while countless fans called her "wifey"—made his gaze darken.

With a sharp snap, he seized her slender wrist and pinned her to the seat.

"Ethan, have you lost your mind?" Sophia struggled, her skirt riding up to reveal pale thighs.

His eyes darkened further. His other hand gripped her waist. "Try moving again."

"You—!" Her cheeks flushed with fury. "If you're looking for a woman, go find Isabella Valentine. Don't take it out on me!"

Ethan smirked, fingers tracing her waistline. "Gaining weight?"

The words struck a nerve. Sophia froze. She was only two months pregnant—her stomach hadn't shown yet—but her waist had softened slightly.

"None of your damn business!" She slapped his hand away and hastily smoothed her skirt. "I earn my keep with my own skills. You have no right to interfere!"

Ethan stared at the red mark on his hand, an odd feeling flickering in his chest—gone as quickly as it came, replaced by deeper rage.

"Need money?" His voice was ice. "You refuse what I offer, but you'll sell smiles for it?"

Sophia's pupils constricted. She raised her hand to strike, but he caught her wrist mid-air. He leaned in, breath hot against her ear. "What? Hit a nerve?"

"Ethan Roscente!" She trembled with anger. "We're done! Does Isabella know you're harassing me like this?"

His expression turned stormy. Sophia instinctively shrank back, only for the back of her head to meet a warm palm—Ethan had shielded her at the last second.

"Scared?" He scoffed, complex emotions churning in his eyes.
###Chapter 229

Ethan's fingers suddenly gripped Sophia's chin, forcing her to meet his gaze.

"Sophia, this is my final warning." His voice was icy. "If I see you with Sebastian Valdemar again, I won't touch you—but I'll make sure he suffers beyond imagination."

His fingertip trailed from her lips and pressed hard against her chest.

Sophia felt an invisible hand clenching her heart.

"This time, you'll watch it happen." His scorching breath brushed her ear. "You know what I'm capable of."

A chill ran down her spine.

With Isabella Valentine lurking ahead and Ethan Roscente closing in behind, fury, humiliation, and defiance churned inside her, threatening to tear her apart.

She bit her lower lip until it turned white.

Just as Ethan thought she'd surrendered, Sophia lifted her head, cold fire blazing in her eyes.

"Fine. Everyone wants to push me to the edge?" Her laugh was bitter. "I have nothing to lose. Touch anyone I care about, and Isabella will pay with her life."

Ethan's pupils contracted sharply.

"Don't believe me?" Sophia bared her teeth. "Test me. Let's see who breaks first!"

She slammed her palm against the driver's seat. "Stop the car!"

The startled driver hit the brakes.

Ethan seized her wrist. "What did Isabella do to you?"

"Spare me the act!" She wrenched free. "Aren't you two cut from the same cloth?"

The car door slammed shut behind her.

Ethan watched her retreating figure, his expression darkening.

"Investigate," he ordered Zachary Evans in the passenger seat. "I want every detail of Isabella's recent activities."

The next morning, Sophia was revising design drafts when her phone buzzed.

Unknown caller.

She declined immediately.

Thirty seconds later, it rang again.
###Chapter 230

"Your aunt is in my custody. Prepare 300 million for her release..."

Sophia immediately ended the call and blocked the unknown number.

Scammers were getting more outrageous these days.

300 million? She couldn't even spare 300 dollars.

She picked up her stylus again but couldn't focus.

Her fingers swiped across the screen as she dialed Emily's number.

After endless ringing, no one answered.

Frowning, she called the family estate next.

"Margaret, is Aunt Emily home?"

"Madam Laurent went out for mahjong and hasn't returned yet."

"She's not answering her phone."

"Perhaps it's on silent. I'll have her call you back when she returns."

Hanging up, Sophia exhaled in relief.

Just a scam call after all.

But her concentration was already shattered. She decided to call Vivian instead.

"Still suffering on set?"

"Don't even ask. That talentless lead actor messed up twenty takes. The whole crew's stuck babysitting him." Vivian lowered her voice. "Isabella's here too. Absolute nightmare."

Sophia paused. "Why would she take a web drama role?"

"Here to fawn over the male lead. Acting like she owns the place."

"I made pastries. Want me to bring some over?"

"Seriously?" Vivian's voice brightened instantly. "Come rescue me from this hell!"

Thirty minutes later, Sophia arrived at the studio lot in her dust-covered Mini Cooper.

She spotted Vivian's assistant Daisy peering anxiously by the entrance.

The round-faced boy jogged over. "Sophia! The director just called cut. Vivian sent me to get you."
###Chapter 231

The sun blazed overhead as Sophia Lowell watched Daisy Rustichel wipe sweat from her brow. She handed the girl an unopened bottle of water.

"How much do you make a month?" Sophia asked casually.

Daisy's skin was tanned from the sun. When she smiled, her white teeth gleamed. Her eyes held the innocence of a high schooler. "I'm still an intern. I get paid daily—fifty bucks."

"Fifty?" Sophia arched an eyebrow. "You work this hard for fifty?"

"Vivian Ashcroft is the hottest star at our agency," Daisy said proudly, puffing out her chest. "My pay is actually high compared to other interns. Some only get twenty."

Sophia chuckled and pulled a box of homemade cookies from her bag, pressing it into Daisy's hands.

Under the shade of a tree, Vivian Ashcroft was hunched over her phone, cursing under her breath as she played a game. Daisy nibbled on a cookie and whispered, "Vivian turns into a rage-filled gremlin when she games."

Before Sophia could approach, hurried footsteps echoed from a distance.

"Trouble!" A crew member rushed over, panting. "Vivian and Isabella Valentine are fighting!"

The makeup room was in chaos.

Isabella's hair was disheveled, her face marked with angry red streaks. Though Vivian had the upper hand, her left cheek was swollen.

"What happened—" Sophia's question was cut off as a cup of hot tea splashed across her face.

The liquid dripped down her cheeks, stinging her eyes.

"If you can't control your dog, you'll take the punishment!" Isabella shrieked. "Vivian Ashcroft, I'll make sure you end up in jail!"

Vivian lunged forward, fists clenched. Sophia grabbed her wrist and shook her head slightly.

The other actors huddled in the corners, too afraid to breathe.

Sophia wiped the water from her face, her fingers trembling.
###Chapter 232

Isabella Valentine crossed her legs, fingertips drumming against the armrest of the sofa. Her disdainful gaze swept over the crowd holding up their phones. "One more photo, and I'll ruin your career in this industry." Her crimson lips curved. "Test me if you dare."

The onlookers fell silent. A few timid ones quietly slipped out of the dressing room.

"See that?" Isabella toyed with her freshly manicured nails. "In this industry, I make the rules. What is Vivian Ashcroft? She doesn't deserve to share a dressing room with me."

A teardrop slid from Sophia Lowell's lashes, tracing a wet path down her cheek. She lifted her gaze slowly, a glint of steel flashing in her eyes.

"Understood."

Before the words fully left her lips, Sophia grabbed a bottle of makeup remover from the vanity and hurled it at Isabella's face. The liquid arced through the air, drenching Isabella's head and face with perfect precision.

Isabella's scream pierced the air.

Daisy caught on instantly, turning to bolt for the door. Vivian already had a second bottle in hand, smashing it over Isabella's head. "Those slaps earlier were to teach you manners. This one is to shut you up!"

The surrounding actresses recoiled in horror, afraid of getting caught in the crossfire. Isabella scrambled to dodge, but Vivian seized her collar and delivered two more resounding slaps.

"Sophia!" Isabella's assistant finally snapped out of her shock, lunging forward with claws bared.

Sophia was rubbing her stinging eyes when she heard the rush of air. Instinct made her tilt her head—just in time to see the incoming hand caught in a strong, masculine grip.

Backlit by the light, Ethan Roscente's figure loomed like an avenging deity. His powerful frame was encased in a black suit, the tie clip glinting coldly. His fingers tightened, and the assistant's face twisted in pain.

"M-Mr. Roscente..." The assistant's voice trembled.

The man's lips pressed into a hard line, a terrifying storm brewing in his eyes. He flung the assistant's hand away, each step of his polished shoes striking the floor like a death knell.

The dressing room was so quiet you could hear a pin drop.
###Chapter 233

The leather shoe slammed into the assistant's knee with a sickening crack of dislocated bone.

The assistant shrieked and crumpled to the floor, sweat instantly soaking through his shirt.

Ethan Roscente adjusted his cuffs with deliberate calm before accepting the sanitizing wipe Zachary Evans handed him. He scrubbed his fingers methodically, the icy glint of his wristwatch catching the light.

That cold gleam made Sophia Lowell's eyes sting. She wanted to rub them but feared the bacteria on her hands would worsen the pain.

"Ethan... help me..."

Isabella Valentine spotted him first. She abruptly stopped struggling and collapsed dramatically, stretching a trembling hand toward the doorway, tears streaking her ruined makeup.

"Enough."

Ethan's voice was glacial.

The dressing room fell dead silent. Zachary stepped forward to separate the grappling women.

Ethan's gaze swept over Sophia's damp hair before landing coldly on Vivian Ashcroft. "Public brawling again? Craving another jail visit?"

Vivian shook off Zachary's grip, lips curling in disdain. "Birds of a feather. Called in your knight in shining armor, huh?"

Sophia shielded Vivian, meeting Ethan's stare head-on. "Isabella threw the first punch."

Isabella clutched her face, her smeared foundation making her look pitiful. "They provoked me first!" She sniffled at Ethan. "I'm calling the police—"

"Bullshit!" Vivian trembled with rage. "I was removing my makeup when she started hurling insults and slapped me!"

Isabella's assistant cowered like a frightened chicken—no match for Vivian's fury.
###Chapter 234

"You saw it with your own eyes, Ethan!" Isabella Valentine covered her reddened cheek, tears streaming down her face. "They dared to bully me right in front of you..."

She turned to scan the crowd, her gaze sharp and venomous as it swept across each face.

"Tell me, didn't they throw the first punch?"

The intimidated staff members lowered their heads under her glare.

"It... it was Vivian who pushed Ms. Valentine first..."

"Yes, we all saw it..."

Sophia Lowell watched the farce unfold with cold detachment.

Daisy rushed over and whispered something in her ear.

"You retrieved the surveillance footage?" Sophia raised her voice deliberately. "Perfect. Let the police see the truth."

Isabella's face paled instantly.

Ethan Roscente's expression darkened. "There's no need to involve the authorities."

"Protecting her, Mr. Roscente?" Sophia's laugh was icy.

"A mutual fight at best." His voice was glacial. "Pressing charges won't benefit you."

Sophia clenched her fists.

Her nails dug deep into her palms.

She should have known. In this man's heart, Isabella would always come first.

"Ms. Valentine!" Isabella's assistant suddenly wailed. "Your face is swelling terribly! What if it scars..."

Ethan's brow furrowed. "To the hospital."

He reached out to steady Isabella.

As they passed by, Isabella leaned in and hissed, "See? He'll always take my side."

Sophia stood rooted to the spot.

The sight of their retreating figures pierced her heart like a blade.
###Chapter 235

Sophia's fingertips trembled slightly.

She remembered how Ethan had lost control in bed that night, nearly costing her the baby. Now he was carefully accompanying Isabella to her gynecologist appointment.

The photo of medicated ointment in his social media feed pierced her heart like a knife.

He cherished Isabella too much to touch her, yet used Sophia as his outlet.

All their recent entanglement was just his anger at a disobedient tool.

"Soph?" Vivian nudged her arm with concern.

Sophia snapped back to reality, forcing a smile. Her gaze landed on Vivian's swollen cheek. "Your injury..."

"Nothing!" Vivian waved it off. "Isabella's face is the real masterpiece—puffed up like a pig's head!"

Inside the van, Sophia carefully applied medicine to Vivian's wounds.

"Your eyes are terrifyingly red," Vivian frowned. "Should we go to the hospital?"

Sophia shook her head. "Just tired."

"That bitch!" Vivian gritted her teeth. "She definitely targeted me because she saw you on set!"

Sophia lowered her lashes guiltily.

"Not your fault!" Vivian jumped up. "I'll get ice cream for your eyes!"

The door slammed shut.

Sophia stared at her bloodshot reflection. Hot water and rubbing had left them rabbit-red.

The image of Ethan shielding Isabella haunted her. She tossed the mirror aside, leaning back against the seat.

If she could turn back time...

She'd never have tangled with that man.

Better to part as strangers than endure this torment. At least the memories could have remained beautiful.

Tears suddenly overflowed.

Just as she teetered on the edge of breakdown, the door yanked open.

Harsh sunlight framed a familiar icy voice: "So fierce earlier, now playing the victim?"

Sophia froze.

A hallucination? He should be at the hospital with Isabella.

"Sophia." The voice came again, colder than frost. "Get out."

Slowly, she lowered her hands and turned.

Ethan stood outside, his dark eyes fathomless.

Sophia looked away in silence.
###Chapter 236

Zachary Evans had just helped Isabella Valentine into the ambulance when Ethan Roscente turned back toward the dressing room. He pushed open the door to find it empty.

As he pulled out his phone to order his men to track someone down, his peripheral vision caught Vivian Ashcroft rushing out of a convenience store with shopping bags.

Following the direction she came from, a flicker of understanding passed through Ethan's eyes. Sure enough, just a dozen meters away, Sophia Lowell sat alone in her car.

"Sophia." He rapped on the window, his voice icy. "I'm talking to you."

Silence.

His expression darkened. Without hesitation, he yanked the car door open. Sophia was scrolling through her phone, refusing to even glance at him.

"Playing deaf?" he sneered.

She finally looked up, lips curling in mockery. "Oh, it's Mr. Roscente. I thought it was some stray dog barking."

"Do you always have to talk like this?" His knuckles whitened.

"What? Now you're policing how I speak too?" She snapped her phone shut. "Did your precious darling not teach you that being too controlling shortens your lifespan?"

"Sophia!"

She moved to slam the door, but Ethan seized her wrist and dragged her out. Stumbling in her heels, Sophia tried to wrench free. "Let go!"

"Come with me." His grip didn't budge. "We need to talk."

"Sophia!"

Vivian came sprinting with two ice cream cones, only to freeze at the sight before her. She lunged forward but was intercepted by a black-clad bodyguard two meters away.

"Back off!" Vivian's eyes turned sharp.

The bodyguard remained impassive. "You can't win against me."

Vivian: "..."

What kind of toxic masculinity was this?

She kicked out, but within three moves, her arms were twisted behind her back and pinned against the car hood. The ice cream splattered on the ground, cream staining her pants.

"Vivian!"

Sophia's pupils constricted as she whirled on Ethan. "Tell your man to release her! If she loses a single hair, I swear I'll turn Isabella's face into a canvas!"

Ethan recalled her threat about mutual destruction yesterday, his temple throbbing. "Get in the car with me, and she'll be fine."

"Sophia, don't listen to him! I'll fucking—ow!"

Vivian's bravado was cut short as the bodyguard pressed her face-first onto the hood.

"Miss Ashcroft," the bodyguard said calmly, "former special forces combat instructor. You really can't beat me."

"Fuck you! Fight me fair!"

The bodyguard gave her a look reserved for idiots and increased the pressure.
###Chapter 237

Sophia's fingers dug into the car door's edge, her knuckles turning white.

Ethan Roscente's cold gaze swept over her trembling hand, his lips curling into a mocking smirk.

"Let go."

She jerked her hand back, leaving faint white scratches on the door.

His grip clamped around her slender wrist, tight enough to crush bone. Sophia stumbled as he yanked her into the car, her back slamming against the leather seat.

"Sophia!"

Vivian Ashcroft's desperate scream was cut off by the closing door.

Sophia barely had time to sit up before Ethan forced her across his lap. His long fingers traced her cheek with unyielding pressure.

"Let me see."

"Get off!"

She turned her face away, but he seized her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. Her eyes burned with fury, wild and untamed.

Ethan's expression darkened.

"Explain yesterday."

Sophia scoffed. "Didn’t Isabella Valentine brag about it already?" She wrenched free. "She nearly killed my aunt. I won’t forget this."

His brow furrowed.

"Proof?"

"She admitted it herself!" Sophia's voice shook. "Stop pretending, Ethan."

The air in the car turned glacial.

Ethan narrowed his eyes, his thumb brushing her reddened eyelid. "Just your word against hers?" His grip tightened. "The Valentines' prized heiress—stupid enough to confess to murder?"

Sophia gasped in pain.

"Because she knows you’ll protect her!" She spat the words through gritted teeth. "With her loyal guard dog—"

"Enough."

His hand shot to her throat, squeezing just shy of suffocation. He leaned in, his breath hot against her pale face.

"Say that again..." His thumb grazed her fluttering pulse. "And I’ll silence you permanently."

Her pupils dilated in terror.

Abruptly, he released her. Watching her cough violently, he calmly adjusted his cufflinks.

"Stay away from Isabella." He rolled down the window, icy wind rushing in. "Next time, it won’t just be a flowerpot."

The door slammed shut.

Sophia stared at the retreating taillights, her nails biting into her palms. Blood dripped onto the snow, blooming into stark crimson.
###Chapter 238

Sophia lifted her face, her eyes glinting with defiance. "What if she provokes me first?"

"Avoid her."

Those two clipped words struck her heart like a hammer.

The blatant favoritism made her chest tighten.

She bit her lower lip hard, swallowing the bitterness rising in her throat. Her voice was barely audible. "Why?"

"Because she's Isabella Valentine, and you're Sophia Lowell."

The words pierced her like a sharp blade.

She forced a smile uglier than tears. "Understood. Can you let go now?"

Seeing her apparent submission, Ethan's expression softened slightly. His long fingers brushed the redness at the corner of her eye. "Stop being stubborn. Your eyes are swollen. I'll take you to the hospital."

"No need." She turned her face away. "This cheap body of mine isn't as precious as Miss Valentine's."

His grip on her chin tightened abruptly, his gaze darkening. "Don't speak in that tone."

Her lips pressed into a thin line, her delicate features icy as she slapped his hand away again.

She hated her own helplessness.

If only she were stronger...

Sensing the sudden drop in temperature around him, she braced herself for the storm. Instead, she was abruptly pulled into a warm embrace.

His lips brushed lightly against her hair.

A careful, soothing gesture.

Sophia stiffened. He held her tighter, his sigh laced with exhaustion. "Enough. Let me hold you for a while."

A lump rose in her throat. She cursed herself for being so weak, so easily swayed.

He buried his face in the crook of her neck, his breathing gradually steadying as if genuinely drained.

Moments later, he released her, insisting on taking her to the hospital.

Her phone vibrated suddenly. Sophia opened the message, her pupils contracting sharply. She shoved the screen in his face, her voice trembling. "Did you do this?"

Vivian Ashcroft had been removed from the cast.

The order came from Ethan Roscente himself.

He glanced at it indifferently, admitting calmly, "Since she clashes with Isabella, it's best they're separated."

"Why not replace Isabella instead?" Sophia's voice rose. "Vivian earned that role fairly!"

His gaze darkened. "Isabella was seriously injured. Someone has to take responsibility."

"So Vivian's career is the apology gift?" She laughed bitterly. "Isabella started the fight!"

"Those are the rules." His tone was frigid. "I warned you to stay away from her."

Sophia felt as if she'd plunged into an icy abyss, staring at him in disbelief. "So in your world, ordinary people's dreams are just toys to amuse your golden canary."
###Chapter 239

Ethan Roscente's brow furrowed slightly, his thin lips curling into a cold smirk.

"She won't lose out. I'll arrange—"

"Enough." Sophia Lowell cut him off sharply, her eyes frosty. "I'm sick of your games, Ethan. You disgust me."

She shoved him away and stormed out of the car without looking back.

The door slammed shut with a deafening crash.

Ethan's face darkened, his knuckles turning white from how tightly he clenched them.

Inside the van, Vivian Ashcroft slumped in her seat like a deflated balloon. Daisy Rustichel paced anxiously, her face lighting up when she saw Sophia.

"Sophia... am I just not cut out for acting?" Vivian's voice trembled. "I finally found a role that suited me..."

Sophia pulled her into a tight hug, her nose stinging. "I'm sorry. This is all my fault."

"Don't say that!" Vivian suddenly flared up. "Those two deserve to rot! When I make it big, I'll expose every dirty secret they have!"

"Karma will get them."

After a rushed meal, they flipped through the scripts sent by the agency—all cheaply made short films, not even close to proper web series quality.

Outside the studio, Ethan stepped straight into Felix Roland's newly acquired red Ferrari.

"Too flashy," he muttered, scanning the interior with distaste.

Felix whistled. "That's the point. I’ve got another loud sports car that’d match your current vibe perfectly."

Ethan narrowed his eyes. "Looking for a beating?"

"Cut the act." Felix engaged the autopilot. "Stringing along Emily while keeping your fiancée happy—even a playboy wouldn’t be this busy."

"That script wasn’t for Isabella."

"Then…" Felix paused, realization dawning. "Wait, is Emily trying to break into the industry?"

"Her friend."

After hearing the full story, Felix clicked his tongue. "No wonder Emily called you disgusting. Sacrificing her best friend for your fiancée? I’d have punched you already."

"I was about to discuss compensation."

"Please," Felix scoffed. "In that situation, anything you said would’ve sounded like an excuse."

Ethan’s gaze darkened. "Then I’ll let actions speak."
###Chapter 240

Lin Tian'er frowned slightly as she watched the weeping woman before her.

"Can land deeds really bind people?" she wondered silently.

The woman wiped her tears. "The landlord wrote our names on the deed. If the new owner won't let us farm, we'll have no food."

Three gaunt children peeked out from behind the woman, their eyes fixed on the bread in Lin Tian'er's hands.

"I'll do what I can." Lin Tian'er broke the bread and shared it with the children.

The woman's eyes brightened. "We can still plant one more crop of wheat before July!"

Watching the children devour the bread, Lin Tian'er suddenly had an idea.

"Listen—bring me snails and eels from the fields. I'll pay five coppers per pound."

The woman rubbed her hands excitedly. "Those things are everywhere in the paddies!"

Xiao Shan stomped his foot anxiously. "Little sister, you'll lose money on this deal!"

Lin Tian'er simply smiled and packed the vegetables left by the women into her basket.

On the way back, Xiao Shan kept muttering, "Skewers sell slowly. We should stock less."

Gazing at the distant mountain shadows, Lin Tian'er seemed lost in thought.

Five days later, Zhu Huanhuan waited eagerly at the city gates.

"Little sister!" She waved her plump arm. "I've lost seven pounds!"

Lin Tian'er studied her noticeably slimmer face. "Madam Xu, you look radiant."

Zhu Huanhuan eagerly pulled out banknotes. "Give me more of those pills!"

But Lin Tian'er pushed the money back. "There's something I'd like your help with."

Lowering her voice, she explained the tenants' plight.

Zhu Huanhuan thumped her chest. "Leave it to me!"

A grateful smile crossed Lin Tian'er's face as she produced five pills from her sleeve.

"But remember—only one pill per day."

Zhu Huanhuan nodded vigorously, then leaned in conspiratorially. "I heard you're opening a shop at the post station?"

Lin Tian'er's eyes sparkled. "You're very well-informed."

"I got you a business permit." Zhu Huanhuan proudly waved a scroll.

The two women exchanged knowing smiles—each getting what they wanted.

At sunset, Lin Tian'er stood on the field ridge, watching the distant figures of working tenants.

"System," she asked silently, "how many virtue points will this earn?"

A breeze carried the scent of fresh earth.
###Chapter 241

The loan agreement on her phone screen burned into Sophia Lowell's eyes. A principal of 45 million, doubled with additional loans, now ballooned into a staggering debt. Emily Laurent's signature and fingerprint were unmistakable.

"Convinced now?" The man's mocking voice dripped through the receiver. "Black and white contract. Chopping off your aunt's hand wouldn't even be illegal. Calling the cops? Don't waste your time."

Her knuckles whitened around the phone. He'd anticipated her move.

"Three minutes." His tone turned glacial. "Bring the money, or collect her body."

"45 million isn't small change!" Her voice trembled. "I need time—"

"Final offer. Not a negotiation." The line went dead with a jarring dial tone.

The darkened screen reflected Sophia's ashen face. Sweat soaked her back. How had Emily gotten entangled with loan sharks? Her bank balance was a drop in the ocean compared to the debt.

The three minutes evaporated. When the phone rang again, her hand shook as she answered.

"Proof she's alive." She forced steadiness into her voice.

The video showed Emily unconscious, bound to a chair. Sophia's heart lurched.

"Just keeping her quiet." The man chuckled. "Pay up, and she walks out unharmed. We want money, not blood."

"Two hours." His voice hardened. "One minute late, and her right hand arrives as a greeting gift."

The dial tone screeched again. As Sophia started her car, the rearview mirror showed her ghostly pallor. Emily's limp form haunted her mind.

At the studio district intersection, a black Maybach glided to a stop.

"Isn't that Tiffany Roscente's car?" Felix Roland pointed at a red sports car speeding away.

Ethan Roscente narrowed his eyes. A black-helmeted motorcyclist materialized, tailing the vehicle like a phantom.
###Chapter 242

The roar of an engine shattered the street's quiet.

A pitch-black motorcycle stood out sharply in traffic. The rider was clad in black leather from head to toe, even the helmet a dull, matte shade.

Felix Roland narrowed his eyes. "That bike is tailing Sophia."

Ethan Roscente's gaze turned razor-sharp.

"Follow them."

Felix jerked the steering wheel. Tires screeched against asphalt.

Sophia Lowell's silver Volvo raced ahead. Her knuckles whitened around the wheel as she checked the rearview mirror. The black motorcycle clung to her like a shadow.

The light turned red.

The Volvo rolled to a stop. The motorcycle brazenly halted behind her. The rider lifted a phone and snapped multiple shots of her license plate.

Felix watched from the adjacent lane. "Photographing her? That's suspicious."

Ethan's jaw clenched, his eyes glinting like steel.

The light turned green.

Sophia suddenly accelerated. The silver car shot through the intersection like an arrow. Felix was caught off guard, trapped by the red light.

"Damn it!"

The black motorcycle blasted through the red light without hesitation.

Ethan's expression darkened. "Get out."

Before Felix could react, his seatbelt was ripped open. A sharp kick sent him tumbling onto the pavement.

"Ethan, you son of a—"

The black sports car vanished in a cloud of exhaust.

Ethan floored the accelerator. The speedometer needle swung violently to the right.

As he rounded the corner, a heart-stopping scene unfolded—

The black motorcycle suddenly surged forward, ramming hard into the Volvo's rear.

BANG!

The deafening crash of metal echoed down the street.

The silver car lurched violently, tires leaving long black streaks. Airbags exploded from the dashboard.

At the last second, Sophia twisted sideways to shield her abdomen, barely avoiding the airbag's impact.

###Chapter 243

The afternoon sun glared down, turning the asphalt into a shimmering heat mirage.

Sophia Lowell was grateful this back road had little traffic—otherwise, that out-of-control motorcycle would have caused a deadly pileup.

She had just unbuckled her seatbelt when the engine's roar surged again.

Turning, she saw the black motorcycle spin around a hundred meters away, then gun straight for her at full throttle.

Her legs gave out.

Sophia collapsed onto the scorching pavement, her pupils reflecting the headlights growing larger.

Death rushed toward her.

"CRASH—"

A deafening impact split the air.

But the pain she expected never came.

Trembling, she opened her eyes to see a red sports car wedged between her and disaster, its body mangled from taking the hit.

Motorcycle parts scattered like shrapnel.

The Ferrari had been thrown back several meters, its door twisted, the windshield a spiderweb of cracks.

Sophia clamped a hand over her mouth.

Someone had just risked their life to save hers.

With a metallic groan, the wrecked door was kicked open.

A tall figure emerged against the blinding sunlight.

The light gilded his silhouette, his tailored suit pants cutting sharp lines as he strode forward with unwavering steps.

Each footfall synced with the frantic beat of her heart.

Closer.

Until the familiar scent of his cologne enveloped her.

"Are you hurt?"

His deep voice carried a tremor he couldn’t hide.

Tears blurred her vision as she looked up into the face she’d ached for every day.

"Ethan... Roscente?"

The floodgates broke.

He crouched, the fabric of his suit straining over his thighs, his outstretched hand frozen midair, knuckles white.

"It’s me."

A scalding tear hit his skin.

Ethan yanked her into his arms, one hand cradling the back of her head, pressing her firmly against his chest.

"You're safe now."

His voice was rough, his breathing ragged.

Sophia fisted his shirt, the fabric crumpling in her grip.

Mint and blood filled her senses.

The delayed terror of near-death erupted—she sobbed uncontrollably against him.

"Why did you come...?"

"Because it was you."

His arms tightened, his jaw resting atop her head.

The wrecked car still smoked behind them. Sirens wailed in the distance.

But in this moment, his world narrowed to the trembling woman in his arms.
###Chapter 244

Ethan Roscente held Sophia Lowell in a crushing embrace, his arms like steel bands around her.

"Don't be afraid. I'm here."

His deep voice trembled slightly as his warm palm gently stroked her back.

Sophia buried her face against his chest, listening to the frantic rhythm of his heartbeat.

After what felt like an eternity, she lifted her head.

Ethan cradled her face, his thumb brushing away the moisture at the corner of her eye.

"Let me check if you're hurt."

His words were feather-light, as if afraid to startle her.

She shook her head, voice hoarse. "The car stopped in time."

Only then did the tension in his shoulders ease slightly. But he still meticulously checked her for injuries.

When he confirmed she was unharmed, he exhaled sharply and pulled her close again.

"Thank God you're alright..."

The veins in his arms stood out in sharp relief.

Sophia didn't catch his words and looked up in confusion.

Ethan didn't explain. He simply tightened his hold.

His heart had nearly stopped when he saw that motorcycle hurtling toward her car.

He'd acted on pure instinct.

"What were you doing here?"

Sophia noticed the wrecked sports car nearby.

"I saw someone following you."

His tone was casual, but the lingering fear in his eyes betrayed him.

Warmth bloomed in Sophia's chest. "Thank you."

Ethan tilted her chin up, his gaze intense. "Still angry with me?"

She pressed her lips together, silent.

He leaned in slowly, his warm breath ghosting over her cheek.

A tender kiss landed between her brows.

"Forgive me?"

Before she knew it, Sophia found herself nodding.

"Let's get you checked at the hospital," he said.

"I'm fine—"

Her words died as her eyes widened in horror.

"You're bleeding!"

Her trembling fingers reached for the wound on his forehead.

Ethan caught her hand and pressed a kiss to her knuckles. "Just a scratch."

"That much blood isn't a scratch!"

Tears welled up again.

He wiped them away tenderly. "It's really nothing."

"We're going to the hospital. Now."

She tried to pull him toward the car, but he stopped her.

"Alright. Whatever you say."

His eyes were filled with such tenderness, as if the terror of moments ago had never happened.
###Chapter 245

The wail of police sirens pierced the sky, growing louder as they approached.

Screeching tires marked the arrival of the patrol cars at the accident scene.

Felix Roland jumped out of his vehicle, wincing at the sight of his mangled Ferrari. He hurried over to the pair, his gaze lingering on Ethan Roscente's bloodied forehead. "Are you two okay?"

"I'm fine," Sophia Lowell replied tightly. "He hit his head."

Felix raised a brow, leaning in with mock concern. "Well, well. Looks like someone's on the fast track to becoming a vegetable."

Ethan shot him a glare sharp enough to cut glass.

Felix recoiled, satisfied the bastard was still alive.

The officers began taking statements.

Sophia recounted the incident in detail. When she mentioned Ethan intercepting a speeding motorcycle, everyone gasped.

"Mr. Roscente," Felix whistled, "got a death wish or something?"

"Shut up," Ethan's voice could freeze hell.

Sophia pressed a tissue to his wound, shooting Felix a glare. "He's bleeding heavily, Felix."

Felix clamped his mouth shut.

The lead officer looked grim. "Initial findings show the Ferrari absorbed most of the impact. The motorcyclist died instantly—broken neck."

"Dead?" Ethan's brow furrowed.

"The body's in bad shape," the cop added.

Felix let out a low whistle. "And you walked away? Hades must be blind today."

"I need to see it." Ethan stood, turning to Sophia. "Stay here."

She shook her head stubbornly. "He came for me."

"It's going to be gruesome."

"I don't care."

Ethan exhaled sharply and scooped her into his arms. "Then stop pretending you're fine."

The motorcycle wreckage lay scattered across the asphalt, the rider's corpse twisted at unnatural angles. Blood pooled dark against the road. When the officer removed the helmet, the face beneath was unfamiliar.

"I don't know him," Sophia said through gritted teeth, fighting nausea.

The police assured a full investigation.

Ethan gave Felix a look. The man immediately stepped forward to handle the authorities.

"To the hospital," Ethan told the woman in his arms.

Sophia opened her mouth to protest, but he carried her straight into the waiting ambulance.

At the ER, Ethan addressed the approaching doctor. "Check her first."

Sophia vaulted off the gurney and shoved Ethan onto the examination table instead. "Doctor, scan his brain. See if the crash damaged anything."

Ethan: "..."
###Chapter 246

Ethan Roscente's temple bore a gruesome wound, blood tracing the sharp contours of his face.

The doctor rushed forward, the sterile scent of antiseptic permeating the air.

Sophia Lowell stood by the examination bed, fingers digging into her palms. Her throat tightened as she stared at the jagged gash.

"Does it hurt?" Her voice trembled.

Ethan tilted his head back for treatment, lifting his eyelids at her question. Seeing her red-rimmed eyes, his lips curled into a taunting smirk.

"Worried about me?"

Sophia bristled instantly. "I just don't want you turning brain-damaged and blaming me!"

His low chuckle turned into a sharp hiss when the wound pulled. Sophia's face paled as she grabbed the doctor's coat. "Be gentler!"

The elderly doctor adjusted his glasses, giving her a knowing look. "Young lady, your boyfriend's built like an ox. This scratch won't kill him."

When the gauze peeled away, Sophia gasped. The bone-deep laceration snaked viciously through his hairline.

Words failed her. Her eyes burned.

Ethan seized the moment to clasp her ice-cold hand. This time, she didn't pull away.

Test results arrived quickly. The doctor tapped the CT scan. "Mild concussion. Hospital observation recommended."

"No." Ethan's refusal was absolute.

Sophia stamped her foot. "Are you insane? What if you have a brain hemorrhage tonight?"

"Then I'll die in your bed." He buttoned his shirt with deliberate slowness. "Since you clearly don't care."

The words stabbed her chest. Memories flooded back—her kidnapped aunt, the loan sharks' threats. Her grip on the backpack strap turned white-knuckled, nails nearly piercing the fabric.

"Zachary's waiting downstairs." She turned toward the door. "I have urgent business."

Ethan yanked her wrist, sending her stumbling. Dark tempests churned in his eyes. "Where are you running to this time?"

The examination room froze.

The doctor coughed awkwardly. "Perhaps... we should process the admission first?"

Sophia wrenched free and fled without looking back. The corridor's fluorescent lights cast a sickly pallor on her face.

Her phone screen lit up—thirteen missed calls. All from loan sharks.
###Chapter 247

Sophia turned to leave, but Ethan Roscente's fingers closed around her wrist like a steel trap.

His eyes narrowed to dangerous slits. "What are you hiding from me, Sophia?" His voice could freeze hell itself.

Her heart skipped a beat.

Fresh blood seeped through the bandage on his forehead. The torn sleeve of his designer suit glinted cruelly in the sunlight. Even disheveled, the man radiated lethal elegance.

"You seem in quite a hurry." His gaze pinned her like a butterfly to corkboard.

Sophia clenched her fists.

The $45 million debt pressed against her ribs like a boulder. This man could solve her problems with a snap of his fingers—but the cost would be her soul.

Isabella Valentine's wedding date loomed closer each day. Asking Ethan for help meant stepping into quicksand.

"Don't flatter yourself." She wrenched her arm free, voice brittle. "I have an appointment."

"Sophia!"

She didn't look back.

Ethan's expression darkened. Zachary Evans materialized at his elbow, murmuring urgently.

"Confirmed?" Ethan's pupils dilated.

"Beyond doubt. Miss Lowell couldn't possibly raise that sum in ten minutes."

A mirthless smile curled Ethan's lips. "Trying to escape me?" His knuckles rapped the car window. "Dream on."

Zachary vanished like smoke.

Outside the ER, Sophia scrolled through her contacts with shaking fingers. Theodore Orlando's name glowed on the screen—her last hope.

The phone vibrated violently. A loan shark's number flashed.

"The deadline hasn't—" Her voice cracked.

"Mr. Roscente settled your debt in full." The thug's tone dripped newfound respect. "Your aunt is already en route home."

Sophia froze.

"Miss Lowell." Zachary's voice came from behind her. "Mr. Roscente requests your presence."

Inside the black Maybach, Ethan exhaled a lazy smoke ring. Through the haze, he watched his prey approach. Victory tasted sweeter than the Cuban cigar.

The door opened. A wave of tobacco assaulted her senses.

Sophia's stomach lurched. Pregnancy had stolen her tolerance for the scent she once found intoxicating.
###Chapter 248

Ethan Roscente tapped the car window with his slender fingers, amusement glinting in his eyes. "Ran faster than a rabbit, yet here you are crawling back?"

Sophia Lowell clenched the hem of her shirt, her nails digging into her palms. She'd just escaped the loan sharks when she learned Ethan had repaid her 45 million dollar debt.

"I never asked for your help," she muttered under her breath.

The man's eyes narrowed dangerously. "Breaking the bridge after crossing the river, Miss Lowell?"

The temperature in the car plummeted. Zachary Evans caught his employer's stormy expression in the rearview mirror and discreetly adjusted the AC.

"I..." Sophia bit her lip, suddenly remembering her aunt was still captive. "Thank you for the assistance, Mr. Roscente. I'll repay every cent."

Ethan scoffed, trailing his fingers along the leather seat. "With what? That failing design studio of yours?"

Her ears burned. She lacked the means, but refused to show weakness.

"I'll clear the debt in two months," she insisted stubbornly. "We can sign an agreement."

"Agreement?" Ethan suddenly leaned in, his sandalwood cologne enveloping her. "A contract of servitude would be more fitting."

His thumb brushed her flushed earlobe, voice turning husky. "After all, this body of yours—"

"Ethan!" She shoved him away, only for him to trap her wrist.

He chuckled darkly. "Running again? Shouldn't a 45 million dollar creditor collect some interest?"

Neon lights flickered across his sharp features through the window. Sophia noticed the bandage on his temple—a wound from rescuing her earlier.

Her heart fluttered. "Uncle..."

"Now you remember I'm your uncle?" His fingers tightened on her chin. "Weren't you calling me 'Mr. Roscente' just now?"

Beneath his gaze, her lashes trembled. "What do you want?"

His eyes darkened as he pinned her against the seat. Warm breath grazed her neck. "An advance payment."

Zachary silently raised the partition and drove deeper into the night.
###Chapter 249

His lips nearly brushed against her earlobe.

The scorching breath carried his husky voice straight into her ear canal.

Sophia shuddered violently.

She glanced frantically at the front seat, only to find the partition had been raised at some point.

The tips of her ears burned crimson.

"Well?"

Ethan Roscente tilted her chin back, their noses touching. Dark currents swirled in his eyes like a lurking beast.

Their mingled breaths carried traces of mint and tobacco.

"I..." Her voice wavered. "Need to think—"

"Shaking like this already?" His thumb grazed her reddened eyelid. "Still need time?"

Sophia bit her lip. "Fine! If I can't pay back, we'll do it your way!"

After the internship ended, she'd vanish to Seattle. Could he possibly chase her there?

Ethan rapped his knuckles against the partition in satisfaction.

"Wait!" Sophia pressed against the car door. "Let me out."

"We're going to Riverside Heights." His grip tightened around her wrist.

"The contract expired ages ago!" She struggled. "I'm free now."

"So my saving your life means nothing?" He smirked, lifting the gauze at his temple to reveal an angry scar. "I prefer tangible gratitude."

The sight of that vicious wound deflated her defiance.

"But your estate has so many servants—"

"You want Grandfather knowing you spent the night with me?" His voice dropped lower. "Or should I tell him you've already been in my bed?"

Her face paled. "No!"

"Then behave."

"Riverside Heights is too far from work..." She made a last-ditch protest.

Ethan's lips curved suddenly. "Your place works too."

"Absolutely not!"

"Seems someone's gratitude lacks sincerity." His eyes narrowed.

Sophia twisted her shirt hem nervously. "My dumpy apartment isn't fit for Mr. Roscente..."

"I don't mind."

She choked on her words.

"One hundred thousand." His tone turned businesslike. "One night."

Sophia's eyes widened. "How much?"
###Chapter 250

The crowd speculated endlessly about Theodore's feelings for Sophia.

No matter how many times he explained it was simply because he adored little Lucas, no one believed him. They all assumed he was laying groundwork to become the boy's stepfather someday.

"An emergency at the office?"

Mrs. Orlando pressed again.

Theodore remained impassive. "Yes, Mother. I should go."

"You will be home for dinner tonight." Her tone brooked no argument. "Lilian picked out several new suits for you. If you don't come, she'll deliver lunch to your office every day starting tomorrow."

She knew her son too well.

His current indifference toward Lilian made him allergic to persistent attention. This tactic would work.

"And stop camping at Ethan's place. The newlyweds don't need a third wheel. Don't you have your own home? Move back tonight."

"They've been married six months," Theodore protested.

"For couples in love, every day feels like a honeymoon. Got a problem with that?"

He fell silent.

"If you don't return, I'll visit Ethan myself. Tell him we're renovating and need to stay with them. Wherever you go, I'll follow."

A bead of sweat formed on Theodore's temple.

His mother absolutely would.

Lilian stood quietly nearby, lips curved. Mrs. Orlando's domineering attitude created the perfect opportunity for her.

"Fine. I'll be back tonight."

Defeated, Theodore fled into the elevator.

As the doors closed, he exhaled in relief.

Mrs. Orlando turned to the secretary. "What's so urgent?"

"Possible issues with the XX project," the secretary replied respectfully. "Mr. Orlando is handling it personally."

Lilian suddenly interjected, "Why aren't you going with him?"

"Another secretary oversees that project. My presence wouldn't help."

"Theodore has two secretaries?" Lilian arched a brow.
###Chapter 251

Ethan Roscente narrowed his eyes, watching the flustered woman before him.

She darted around the living room like a startled rabbit, shoving suspicious items into drawers.

"Destroying evidence?" he drawled.

Sophia Lowell froze mid-motion and glared at him. "None of your business!"

A phone rang abruptly. She hurried to the balcony. Their calico cat seized the moment to leap onto Ethan's lap, rubbing against him affectionately.

"Hospital?" He caught her deliberately hushed voice. "Got it. I'll be right there."

After hanging up, Sophia crouched to refill the cat's bowl. The calico ate eagerly, tail held high.

"My aunt's hospitalized." She didn't look up. "You're on your own."

Ethan lounged on the sofa, long fingers tapping the armrest. "Two million buys me this treatment?"

She rolled her eyes. "Take it or leave it."

Suddenly, he pressed his temples, brow furrowing. "Headache."

"Serves you right." Despite her words, she fetched a blanket. "Couch it is."

His gaze drifted toward the bedroom. "The bed's more comfortable."

"In your dreams!" Sophia bristled. "My bed's off-limits."

"Two million doesn't even get me a bed?" He smirked. "What was the consumer hotline again?"

Her jaw clenched. The man was blatantly threatening her.

"Fine!" she spat. "But if you dare soil my sheets—"

"Soil?" He raised an eyebrow.

"Don't play innocent!" Her ears burned. "If you try anything, I'll toss you out the window!"

As he stood, he deliberately stepped closer, warm breath grazing her ear. "Like... this?"

Sophia jerked back, nearly colliding with the coffee table.

Ethan laughed heartily and strode into the bedroom, shutting the door behind him.

"Bastard!" She shook her fist at the door.

The hospital hallway reeked of antiseptic. Margaret Lefèvre rushed to meet Sophia, relief washing over her.

"Madame Laurent kept rambling..." The elderly maid fretted. "Like she'd seen a ghost."

Inside the room, Emily Laurent lay curled on the bed, pallid. IV fluid dripped steadily.

Sophia gently grasped her aunt's icy hand. "Who brought her in?"

"An unknown number." Margaret lowered her voice. "When I reached the hotel, Madame was already..."

She mimed collapsing.

Sophia's eyes hardened. The loan sharks had dared target her aunt?

Emily suddenly convulsed, mumbling incoherently. "Stay back... I'll repay..."

"Doctor!" Margaret frantically hit the call button.

By the window, Sophia watched medical staff rush in. The glass reflected her stormy expression.

This debt wouldn't go unpaid.
###Chapter 252

"About the family estate..."

Margaret quickly waved her hands. "Don't worry, Mrs. Laurent. I didn't breathe a word. If the Third Branch finds out, who knows what trouble they'll stir up."

The elderly maid had served the Roscente family for over a decade, personally selected by the late Mr. Roscente IV for Emily.

Sophia handed her a glass of water with a faint smile. "Thank you for everything."

Margaret accepted the drink, hesitating as she glanced at the unconscious figure in the hospital bed.

The sterile scent of disinfectant filled the room. Emily had always been particular about her comforts, so Margaret needed to fetch some personal items from the estate. Sophia sat by the bedside, watching the IV drip methodically.

"Sophia!" Emily suddenly jolted awake, clutching her niece's hand. "Those men...they threatened to cut off my hands..."

Tears spilled instantly. The pampered socialite trembled like a frightened child.

Sophia pulled her into an embrace, smoothing her disheveled hair. "It's over now."

"I should have listened to you..." Emily sobbed. "That Mr. Wang promised guaranteed returns, but then the interest kept compounding..."

Sophia's eyes darkened. Three months ago, she'd warned her aunt about the glaring red flags in that so-called investment scheme.

"Forty-five million," she said icily. "If Uncle Ethan hadn't intervened, you'd be on a gambling ship in international waters by now."

Emily shuddered violently.

"I was wrong..." She gripped the sheets desperately. "I'll listen to you from now on..."

Sunlight filtered through the blinds, casting dappled shadows across the bed. Sophia sighed and adjusted the blankets.

"About Jason—"

"He doesn't know," Sophia interrupted. "No one at the estate does."

Emily suddenly seized her wrist. "How did your uncle even...?"

The same question haunted Sophia. Ethan Roscente was famously detached. Even out of respect for his late uncle, he'd always maintained careful boundaries.

"Why would he know about the loan sharks?" Emily's voice shook. "And why would he...?"

Sophia turned toward the window. The sycamore shadows swayed in the wind, mirroring her tangled thoughts.

Why had that man who always lingered in the shadows suddenly reached out this time?
###Chapter 253

The loan sharks' call had barely ended two hours ago when Ethan Roscente got wind of it. The speed was unnerving.

Between the car accident and hospital visit, most of the day had been consumed. How had he found out so quickly?

Then again, Ethan was the Roscente family patriarch. Every move within the household fell under his surveillance. And Emily Laurent—his late uncle's widow—would naturally warrant special attention...

Yet something felt off.

First the investment scam, then the loan sharks. The sequence was too convenient.

"Can you still reach that friend who introduced you to the business venture?" Sophia Lowell asked abruptly. "Any chance of recovering the money?"

Emily's jaw tightened. "Don't even ask. She got duped too. The whole scheme was designed to recruit friends targeting friends. The perpetrators fled overseas the moment they got the funds."

"We considered going to the police, but our social circle cares too much about face. A public scandal would humiliate everyone involved. Private investigators found nothing—they'd vanished without a trace."

Her eyes reddened. "I poured my savings into that thirty-million deal, even borrowed heavily. Now I can't buy a handbag without budgeting. How am I supposed to live like this?"

"Serves you right," Sophia said coldly. "Some lessons only stick after suffering."

Emily lowered her head guiltily, then hesitated. "About the money I owe your uncle..."

"You'll repay it," Sophia cut in. "Start cutting expenses."

She knew Emily could never realistically settle the debt. The statement was merely to rein in her extravagance.

"My limited edition bags..." Emily ventured. "Could you help me find buyers? I need the cash."

Sophia blinked. Those handbags were Emily's prized possessions. She must be truly desperate.

"I'll ask Vivian," she relented. "She has extensive entertainment industry connections."

"Perfect! Update me immediately!"

The sedative in Emily's IV took effect, lulling her back to sleep.

After Margaret Lefèvre returned, the three had dinner together. Sophia accompanied Emily for a garden stroll before excusing herself—someone awaited her at home.

Thirty minutes later, Sophia entered her apartment.

A rustling sound came from the kitchen. She frowned. Rats?

Her calico cat was far too regal for rodent hunting. If anything, the spoiled creature would leap into her arms at the sight of a mouse.

In this aging building, rats and cockroaches were regular visitors. Sophia had long mastered the art of dealing with them.
###Chapter 254

Sophia tiptoed to grab a shoehorn from the cabinet, holding her breath as she crept toward the kitchen.

The kitchen door swung open abruptly.

Ethan Roscente leaned against the doorframe, twirling a cookie tin between his fingers. His gaze dropped to the weapon in her hand, one eyebrow arching. "Planning to crack my skull open?"

"There's... there's a mouse!" Sophia hid the shoehorn behind her back, forcing a nervous laugh.

Water droplets still glistened in his damp hair, tracing paths down his collarbone and over his sculpted chest. Her eyes involuntarily followed one bead as it journeyed across his defined abs before disappearing beneath the edge of his white towel.

"Enjoying the view?" His deep voice held amusement.

Sophia jerked her head up, meeting his teasing gaze. Her ears burned as she snapped, "Stop staring!"

"Can't blame me." Ethan suddenly closed the distance, cornering her against the dining table. "Especially when you're practically drooling."

The minty scent of his body wash mixed with his body heat overwhelmed her senses. His arms caged her on either side, leaving no escape.

"I'll give you one chance." His breath tickled her earlobe as he leaned down.

Sophia gripped the table edge. "W-what chance?"

"To touch these abs."

He captured her wrist, pressing her palm against his bare chest. Heat radiated through her fingertips as she felt the ridges of muscle flex with each breath. Her fingers trembled, but his grip held firm.

"Ethan, you—!"

"Focus." He guided her hand lower, voice turning husky. "You've been eyeing them long enough."

Sophia felt her entire body combust. Her fluttering lashes cast delicate shadows beneath her eyes like startled butterfly wings.

His nose brushed her burning ear. "Want to see... something else?"

"N-no thanks!" She shoved him away, nearly tripping in her haste to flee.

Low laughter followed her. "Running already? Weren't you hunting mice?"

Sophia slammed the bedroom door behind her, sliding down against it. The searing imprint of his skin still burned against her palm.

A deliberate knock sounded through the door.
"Sophia."
"My towel's slipping."
###Chapter 255

Ethan Roscente's dark gaze burned into her, intense and unyielding.

He guided her hand slowly across his sculpted abs. Each muscle was taut and warm beneath her fingertips.

Sophia Lowell's fingers trembled slightly.

Their breaths mingled, the air thick with tension.

"Like what you feel?" His voice was low, his lips brushing against her flushed ear.

Heat rushed to Sophia's ears.

She tried to pull away, but his grip tightened.

"Tell me," he murmured, nipping at her earlobe.

A shiver ran down her spine, weakening her resolve.

Her mind screamed to resist, but her body betrayed her with a small nod.

Ethan chuckled darkly, guiding her hand lower—

"Wait!" Sophia jerked back as if burned. "We agreed—"

"Agreed on what?" He arched a brow, amusement glinting in his eyes. "You started this."

Realization dawned.

"You set me up!" She shoved him away, flustered.

Ethan leaned lazily against the desk, watching her with smoldering intensity. "You wouldn't have fallen for it if you weren't already thinking about it."

"Shut up!"

Sophia grabbed the nearest cookie jar and shoved it at him, desperate to change the subject.

He took a deliberate bite.

"I'm hungry," he said pointedly. "You promised dinner."

She stiffened—right.

"I'll start now." She hurried to the fridge, avoiding his gaze. "Put your shirt on first."

Ethan scoffed. "A little late for that."

Ignoring him, she rummaged through the fridge.

Then she spotted the cat food bag peeking from the cabinet.

Her head snapped up.

"Wait—where did you get that cookie?"
###Chapter 256

Ethan Roscente pointed to the corner cabinet without looking up.

Sophia Lowell's expression turned peculiar.

The man didn't notice her reaction as he took another bite of the biscuit in his hand. He nudged away the calico cat circling his feet with his shoe, wrinkling his nose in disdain. "You live like a slob. Keeping snacks next to cat treats?"

Sophia glanced at him, then at the bristling cat on the floor.

"Um..." She chose her words carefully. "Is there a chance... you're holding cat treats right now?"

The air froze.

"Meow!" The calico yowled angrily, claws scraping against the hardwood.

Ethan's hand stilled mid-air.

He slowly lifted his head, disbelief flashing in his eyes.

Sophia bit back a laugh and nodded. "Premium imported cat biscuits. Quite expensive, actually."

Ethan's face turned ashen.

"Gah—" He flung the treat aside and bolted for the bathroom.

Sophia picked up the discarded biscuit and fed it to the sulking calico. She deliberately raised her voice. "For the record, humans can eat these too! The ingredients are perfectly safe!"

"Sophia!" came a growl from behind the bathroom door.

Her eyes crinkled with amusement as she scratched the cat's head. "Don't pout, sweetheart. Mama will buy you a fresh pack tomorrow."

To be fair, it wasn't entirely Ethan's fault. The calico had torn open the original packaging, so she'd transferred the treats to an empty jar. Who knew he'd mistake them for human snacks?

Thirty minutes later, savory aromas wafted from the kitchen.

Sophia emerged carrying tomato pasta and fish soup just as Ethan stepped out of the shower. His damp hair dripped onto his casual sweater, and the angry red mark on his forehead stood out.

"The doctor said your wound shouldn't get wet—" she blurted before catching herself.

"Shut it." His glare could frost glass.

Sophia mimed zipping her lips.

She set the table and gestured for him to join her.

Ethan scoffed. "Cat got your tongue?"

She shot him an indignant look.

He massaged his temples with a long exhale. "...Talk."
###Chapter 257

"Dinner's ready. Want some?"

Ethan Roscente slumped on the couch, his face pale. His obsessive cleanliness made him shudder at the memory of accidentally eating cat food.

"What's on the menu?"

"Spaghetti with tomato sauce and crucian carp soup."

At the mention of "fish soup," Ethan's stomach churned. The image of that orange tabby and the damn cat biscuit flashed in his mind.

"Are you doing this on purpose?" His eyes narrowed dangerously.

Sophia Lowell blinked in confusion before realizing what he meant. "No! Fish soup helps with wound recovery—"

Ethan stared at her like a prosecutor scrutinizing a suspect.

She met his gaze without flinching.

"Not hungry." He turned away, rubbing his stomach.

"Seriously? Cat biscuits won’t kill you." Sophia muttered under her breath. She grabbed an orange from the fridge, peeled it, and handed it to him. "Try something sour to settle your stomach."

Ethan took it hesitantly.

In the end, Sophia devoured the entire dinner herself. Over the next two days, she diligently nursed the injured man. Surprisingly, Ethan behaved unusually well—either resting or handling work.

Even after his wound scabbed over, he showed no signs of leaving. Sophia started plotting ways to kick him out. She hid her prenatal vitamins, terrified he’d discover her pregnancy.

Worse, since the cat food incident, Ethan and Calico had become sworn enemies. The poor cat was banished to the balcony, only allowed inside when Ethan was out.

That afternoon, just as Sophia texted Ethan about dinner plans, the doorbell rang.

"Surprise!" Vivian Ashcroft stood at the doorstep, arms laden with shopping bags.

"The show’s tomorrow. Why are you here today?"

"To give you a pre-show pep talk, obviously!" Vivian tossed the bags onto the sofa. "I got a full-body treatment and even changed my nail polish three times."

Sophia handed her a glass of lemonade. "Was that necessary?"

"You naturally gorgeous people don’t get it!" Vivian gritted her teeth. "Those haters will nitpick every flaw. I need to be flawless from every angle."

"If you know they’ll attack, why agree to a live show?"

"Desperate times call for desperate measures." Vivian suddenly lowered her voice. "Seriously, about that thing with you—"

"Don’t." Sophia cut her off. "It was Isabella—"

"That blind bastard Ethan!" Vivian exploded, snatching a cushion and pounding it furiously. "Ditching a natural beauty like you for that plastic-faced green tea bitch!"
###Chapter 258

"That Isabella Valentine isn't fit to lick your boots!" Vivian Ashcroft slammed the couch cushion, her teeth clenched. "Ethan Roscente must be blind, treating trash like treasure!"

Sophia Lowell gave a small smile. "Maybe it's true love?"

"Bullshit!" Vivian rolled her eyes. "Even the most devoted woman in history would call him a masterclass in foolishness—" Her voice cut off abruptly as she spotted the men's underwear drying on the balcony. Her eyes widened. "Holy shit! Sophia, you've got a man stashed here?"

Sophia followed her gaze and felt her scalp prickle.

Damn Ethan and his ridiculous demand that she hand-wash his underwear. He'd threatened to parade around naked if she refused. The mental image alone had forced her into playing laundress.

And now Vivian had seen it.

"Spill it!" Vivian bounced up, grinning. "Who's the lucky guy? Hotter than Ethan? Good in bed?" She whipped out her phone. "I'm posting this! Let that bastard Ethan see you've got options!"

"Wait!"

Sophia grabbed her wrist.

Vivian frowned in confusion.

Sophia had never told her about the car accident or Ethan rescuing her. Seeing the misunderstanding spiral, she opened her mouth to explain—

Knock knock.

Vivian bolted to the door. "Must be the mystery man! Let me see who's worthy of my bestie—" She yanked it open and froze.

Sophia covered her face in despair.

"Ethan?!" Vivian's shriek rattled the windows. "You dare show your face here? Why don't you crawl back to hell with that bitch Isabella?"

She grabbed the broom by the door and brandished it. "Get out! I'll break your legs myself today!"

Ethan eyed the furious woman. "Off your meds?"

"You're the one who needs meds!" Vivian swung the broom. "Leave or I'm calling the cops!"

Leaning lazily against the doorframe, he pulled out his phone. "Go ahead. Let them see who's causing trouble."

"Threatening me?" Vivian sneered. "Listen up, Ethan—Sophia's got a new man! They're living together! Scram, you homewrecker!"

Ethan's expression darkened.

Sophia rushed to clamp a hand over Vivian's mouth. "She's lying!"

"Am not!" Vivian shook her off, shielding Sophia with the broom. "Stay away from her, Ethan!"

Ethan narrowed his eyes at Sophia. "Your roommate needs psychiatric help."

"You—"
###Chapter 259

Vivian Ashcroft was about to explode when Sophia Lowell swiftly covered her mouth. "That's Ethan Roscente's underwear," she whispered urgently. "He's staying with me temporarily—"

"What?!" Vivian's eyes widened, her voice jumping an octave.

"Shh!" Sophia stomped her foot in frustration. "I'll explain later. Just go home for now."

"Wait! How did you two—"

"Escort her out." Ethan's icy voice cut through the air as he gestured toward the door.

A black-suited bodyguard stepped forward. Vivian recoiled when she recognized him. "Damn it! Not you again, Mr. Stone-Face!"

"Miss Ashcroft," the guard said impassively, "you know resisting won't end well for you."

"This is provocation!" Vivian fumed, hopping mad.

"Be gentle with her—" Sophia's plea was cut off by the door slamming shut.

She pressed against the peephole, biting her lip anxiously.

Ethan yanked her away. "Pack your bags. We leave in thirty minutes."

"Why should I?" Sophia shook off his grip. "Your business trip has nothing to do with me."

"Someone needs to change my bandages." His tone was infuriatingly matter-of-fact.

"Bullshit!" Her chest heaved with anger. "You just want to torment me!"

"I need a temporary secretary." His voice softened unexpectedly. "You're perfect for the job."

Sophia scoffed. "What about Isabella Valentine? Surely your precious fiancée would love to serve you."

Ethan narrowed his eyes. "Still holding a grudge?"

"Wouldn't dream of it." She turned away.

"That stubborn temper of yours—"

"Deal with it!" She jutted her chin defiantly.

After a long stare-down, Ethan suddenly gripped her chin. "Fine. Stay here. We'll discuss Vivian's illegal trespassing instead."

"You—!" Tremors of rage ran through her.

Releasing her, he adjusted his cuffs leisurely. "Your choice."
###Chapter 260

Sophia studied Ethan Roscente's face for a long moment, utterly baffled by his intentions. She pressed her lips together and decided to cut straight to the chase. "Isn't Isabella Valentine more suitable? She's devoted to you. One word from you, and she'd cancel all her engagements to accompany you."

The memory of Isabella's warning flashed through her mind, darkening her gaze. "Instead of turning to your fiancée, you insist on dragging me—an outsider—along for this business trip. If she finds out, she'll probably cry herself into a faint."

For a fleeting second, Sophia even wondered if this man harbored feelings for her.

But Ethan's next words shattered that illusion. "Isabella's facial injuries haven't fully healed yet."

He lifted his eyes, his tone indifferent. "You're right. She is my treasure. And treasures should be cherished, not dragged around on exhausting trips."

Sophia's chest tightened as if an invisible hand had clenched around her heart.

How laughable that she'd entertained the thought of him liking her.

"I don't have time for your games." She shook off his hand and turned to leave. "Find someone else."

At the doorway, she paused and glanced back, a mocking smile on her lips. "By the way, you seem to have recovered just fine. My humble abode can't accommodate someone of your stature. Get the hell back to Bayview Residences."

Ethan's brow furrowed.

Just as she stepped out, his deep voice stopped her. "Accompany me on this trip, and I'll waive the interest on those 45 million."

Sophia whirled around. "You were planning to charge interest?"

"Why wouldn't I?" Ethan smirked. "Are you better at serving me than others? Or better at keeping me entertained?"

"I thought we—"

"What exactly are we?" He cut her off, his gaze intense. "Weren't you the one who drew the line? My money is only for my woman. Are you her?"

Sophia was speechless.

When it came to shamelessness, Ethan Roscente had no equal.

"It's just a business trip," he said, his voice softening unexpectedly. "Do you really think I'd sell you off?"

"Wouldn't put it past you," she sneered.

"With your scrawny frame, how much could you even fetch?"

"Oh, so I'm too thin now? Who was it that couldn't keep his hands off me before?"

"Did that happen?" Ethan suddenly closed the distance, his large hand covering her chest. "Let me verify."

"Get lost!" She slapped his hand away, but he seized her waist instead.

Pulling her flush against him, their noses almost touching, he murmured, "Come with me, and the interest is waived. Of course, you could always refuse..." His eyes turned icy. "I wouldn't mind bundling you onto the plane by force."

"Are you a damn bandit?"

"Care to find out?"

"..."

When she remained silent, he dangled another carrot. "One more million when the job's done."

Sophia frowned.

"Just stand there looking pretty. No effort required." He scoffed. "Even you can do the math on such a sweet deal, can't you, Professor Lowell?"

A million plus waived interest was tempting.

But she'd already promised Vivian she'd appear on that show tomorrow.

"No," Sophia shook her head. "I promised Vivian I'd film the show with her. I won't bail on her."

###Chapter 261 

Ethan Roscente's slender fingers tapped rhythmically against the desk, his gaze icy.

"Cancel the variety show appearance."

Sophia Lowell toyed with her phone, not bothering to look up.

"Why should I?"

"Because I'm your boss."

She finally lifted her head, a mocking smile playing on her lips.

"Since when does being my boss give you the right to control my personal life?"

Ethan narrowed his eyes, his voice dropping lower.

"This business trip involves a project worth hundreds of millions."

"What does that have to do with me?"

He leaned forward abruptly, his presence overwhelming.

"That endorsement Vivian Ashcroft has been chasing..."

Sophia's fingers stilled.

"What are you implying?"

Ethan adjusted his cufflinks leisurely.

"I heard she turned down three roles for this opportunity."

She bit her lower lip.

"That's low."

He chuckled, though his eyes remained cold.

"Five million. Accompany me to Hong Kong."

"Ten."

"Seven."

"Deal."

Ethan raised an eyebrow, surprised by her quick agreement.

Sophia stood, looking down at him.

"But I have conditions."

"Name them."

"No more than eight hours of work per day. Five-star accommodations. Meals covered separately."

He scoffed.

"You think this is a vacation?"

She tilted her head, grinning slyly.

"Isn't it?"

They locked eyes for a tense moment before Ethan looked away first.

"Fine."

Sophia turned to leave but paused.

"Oh, about Vivian's endorsement..."

Ethan flipped through his documents without glancing up.

"That depends on your performance."

She stomped her foot in frustration but knew she was outmatched.

That evening, Sophia stood before a private jet, dragging her suitcase with visible reluctance.

"Do we really have to take this?"

Ethan fastened his seatbelt without sparing her a glance.

"Scared?"

She snorted and marched up the steps.

"I'm scared you'll puke on me."

As the plane took off, her knuckles turned white from gripping the armrest.

Ethan handed her a glass of champagne.

"Relax."

She took the glass and downed it in one gulp.

"How much longer?"

"Three hours."

Closing her eyes, she tried to steady her breathing.

Suddenly, a warm hand covered hers.

"First time on a private jet?"

Sophia yanked her hand away.

"None of your business."

Unfazed, Ethan smirked.

"We'll have plenty of time to get acquainted in the coming days."
###Chapter 262

Sophia explained everything to Vivian before boarding.

When Vivian heard Ethan had saved Sophia's life, half her angry words died on her lips. Learning someone else would accompany Sophia on the reality show, she readily agreed.

"If that bastard dares lay a finger on you, make sure he never reproduces," Vivian warned before hanging up.

"Don't worry. I've got all the anti-assault gear you gave me. He'll regret being born."

"Call me anytime. I'm on standby 24/7."

"Got it."

The moment she hung up, Sophia met Ethan's icy gaze. A chill ran down her neck. "Wh-what?"

"Anti-assault gear?" His lips curled in a cold smile. "That's how you defend against me?"

She faltered. "A girl's gotta be careful when traveling..."

"Hmph."

That mocking sound made Sophia think he was ridiculing her.

Until security pulled out her pepper spray and stun gun during screening. The suppressed laughter around her made her wish the ground would swallow her whole. Only then did she realize that "Hmph" had been laughing at her naivety.

Fuming, Sophia added another black mark against Ethan in her mental ledger.

The bastard had definitely planned this humiliation.

Utterly despicable.

Night had fallen when their plane landed in Hong Kong.

In her hotel room, Sophia quickly unpacked before ducking into the shower. Hong Kong's night views were legendary, and she planned to explore after freshening up.

She'd just dried her hair and changed clothes when her phone rang. Seeing "Ethan Roscente" on the screen, she rolled her eyes. Nothing good ever came from his late-night calls.

On the third ring, she cleared her throat and adopted a sickly tone: "Yes, Mr. Roscente..."

Since this was a business trip as his secretary, she'd switched to formal address after landing. Ethan hadn't commented, seemingly pleased with her professionalism.

"What's wrong with your voice?" His sharp ears caught the change instantly.

Sophia fake-coughed twice. "Just a cold. Took medicine and was about to sleep..."

"Can you get up?"

The odd question confused her, but she maintained the weak act. "Probably not..."

"You're coming anyway."

The command brooked no argument.

Sophia: "???"

Normal people would tell her to rest. This capitalist monster had no humanity.

She deliberately hoarsened her voice. "Whatever you need, we can discuss over the phone. I'm really unwell..."

"Two minutes. My room."

The line went dead.
###Chapter 263

Sophia glared at her blacked-out phone screen, gritting her teeth in frustration. She mentally cursed Ethan Roscente's entire ancestral line.

With a resigned sigh, she dragged her heavy footsteps toward the elevator.

Ethan occupied the presidential suite on the top floor. Originally, he'd insisted she share the space with him. Knowing his predatory nature all too well—and without her pepper spray handy—Sophia had flatly refused and booked a separate room.

She'd hoped for some peace, but the man wasn't giving her a moment's respite.

Standing before the suite door, she took a deep breath and knocked.

"Come in."

The scent of cedar greeted her as she entered. Fresh from his shower, Ethan stood by the floor-to-ceiling window. A crisp white shirt hugged his broad shoulders, paired with a charcoal-gray vest that accentuated his tapered waist. The tailored suit outlined his athletic frame to perfection, the shirt tucked in to emphasize his lean hips.

City lights glittered beyond the glass. A cigarette dangled between his fingers, smoke curling around his tall, statuesque silhouette—like a figure stepped out of an oil painting.

Sophia's pulse stuttered.

The man had this uncanny ability to make hearts race with just his back turned.

She dug her nails into her palm, forcing composure. "What did you need, Mr. Roscente?"

He turned, nodding toward a tie on the table. "Help me with this."

She nearly rolled her eyes.

Were his arms broken?

Planting her feet, she stayed silent in protest.

"Problem?" Ethan arched a brow, lips quirking in amusement. He emphasized each syllable: "Miss Secretary unwilling?"

That title—delivered in his trademark drawl—sent heat rushing to her ears. It instantly transported her back to those reckless moments in his office, when he'd murmur "Miss Secretary" against her skin in that gravelly voice...

"Your face is red." He closed the distance abruptly, breath scorching her neck. Sophia jolted backward. "N-nothing! Just...admiring how handsome you look today."

She averted her gaze, terrified he'd see right through her.

"Oh?" His chuckle was low. "With that expression, I'd think you were imagining something indecent."

Sophia: "..."

Wasn't he the very source of all indecency?

When she still didn't move, Ethan's eyes darkened. "Tying my tie falls under secretarial duties. Have you forgotten already?"

Gritting her teeth, she picked up the silk. He towered over her; even on tiptoe, she struggled to reach. Her slipper slipped—sending her crashing against his chest.

"An enthusiastic approach?" His hands steadied her waist, tone dripping with mockery.

She flushed crimson, pushing upright. "An accident."

Looping the tie around his neck, she worked quickly. He obligingly bent his head. Her fingers flew, crafting a flawless Windsor knot in seconds.
###Chapter 264

Sophia's fingers deftly tied the navy blue silk tie into a perfect Windsor knot.

Ethan had taught her this three years ago, guiding her hands patiently when she first became his secretary and couldn't even manage the simplest knot.

His dark gaze lingered on her. Under the warm lamplight, her porcelain skin glowed like pearls, every delicate downy hair visible. The fresh scent of her shampoo made his throat tighten.

"Feeling better?" His voice was low as his fingertips brushed her earlobe. "You look well, Ms. Lowell."

Her hands paused briefly before resuming their task. Tilting her chin up, she offered a sweet smile. "The medicine worked quickly."

That radiant expression stole his breath. Suddenly, he crushed her against his chest.

"Let go!" She struggled. "You promised not to touch me."

"Just holding you." His arms tightened as he buried his face in her hair.

Sophia seethed. This man could make any outrageous claim sound reasonable.

"Sophia." His tone turned serious.

When their eyes met, she saw piercing understanding in his gaze.

"Faking illness?" His thumb stroked her jaw. "You can't lie to me."

Flushing, she turned away. "I...really wasn't feeling well..."

"Liar." He turned her face back. "How should I punish you?"

"You—"

His mouth crashed down before she could finish. The kiss was fierce, leaving her lips tingling when he finally pulled away.

"Just collecting interest." Ethan rested his forehead against hers. "The rest...we'll settle after the gala."

"Gala?" She blinked in confusion.

"A friend's birthday celebration." He adjusted his cuffs. "You're accompanying me."

Only then did she notice his unusually formal attire. She shook her head. "That's inappropriate. Your fiancée should—"

A warm hand slid under her blouse. Ethan's eyes darkened dangerously. "Say that again?"

"I-I mean..." She grabbed his wandering hand. "Our relationship is undefined..."

"Undefined?" He chuckled, tracing circles on her waist. "What did you just call me?"

Realization dawned. Biting her lip, she softened her voice. "Ethan..."

The name pleased him. Withdrawing his hand, he smoothed her collar. "Go change into your evening gown."
###Chapter 265

"Are you going or not?" The man's slender fingers traced slow circles on the small of her back, his warmth seeping through the thin fabric.

Sophia shivered, her voice trembling. "Ethan, I really don't want to..."

A soft click cut her off.

His fingertip flicked, and her bra clasp came undone. The silk slid down her smooth skin.

She scrambled to catch it, but he was faster. His arm hooked around her, his large hand snatching the fabric and yanking it down. "If you're not going, you don't need this."

Sophia's temples throbbed.

Who said Ethan Roscente was celibate? This sanctimonious hypocrite!

His practiced movements made him seem like a seasoned offender.

She clutched her chest, tugging desperately at the strap. "Ethan Roscente! Let go!"

"Why not call me 'Ethan' anymore?" His low chuckle carried danger. "Go on, my dear niece."

Her cheeks burned. So he hadn't just minded "Mr. Roscente"—he'd remembered "Ethan" too.

Suddenly, he leaned in, his hot breath against her ear. "Call me brother."

"What?" Her eyes widened.

He was her uncle in name!

"Surprised?" His fingers teased mercilessly. "I haven't even made you call me husband yet."

Sophia gasped.

Was he insane?

"Say it." His grip tightened.

She shuddered, a soft whimper escaping. "Stop..."

"Call me brother."

"Brother..."

The whisper ignited him. Ethan crushed her into the couch, kissing her fiercely. Between breaths, his voice roughened. "Sophia, call me Ethan."

Dizzy, her vision blurred. Everywhere his hands touched, electricity sparked.

Lost in the haze, her lips parted. "Ethan..."

"Good girl."

He kissed her burning cheek before releasing her.

As clarity returned, Sophia curled her toes in embarrassment. She glared. "How could you make me say that?"

Ethan tapped her nose. "I'm older. What's wrong with calling me brother?"

This wasn't about age!

It was about propriety.

The man played forbidden games with terrifying ease.

"Give it back." She reached for her bra.

He arched a brow, unmoving.

If she refused to go, she'd leave bare beneath her clothes.
###Chapter 266

Sophia finally surrendered. She could never win against this scoundrel.

"Fine, fine! I'll wear it!"

"Should've been this obedient from the start."

Ethan released his grip with a smug smirk.

Sophia gritted her teeth but didn't dare delay. She scrambled to put on the lingerie, fingers fumbling with the stubborn back clasp. Beads of sweat formed on her nose from frustration.

Noticing her struggle, Ethan's eyes gleamed with mischief. "Let me."

His arms encircled her waist, pulling her close. Skilled fingers brushed over her trembling hands, effortlessly fastening the clasp.

But he wasn't done.

His gaze lingered on the woman in his arms—her damp eyes brimming with embarrassment, like a flustered rabbit. Heat surged through him.

Without warning, he captured her slightly swollen lips again.

The kiss was relentless.

Dominating.

Suffocatingly deep.

Sophia's head spun. It was always like this. He effortlessly stripped away her reason until she melted against him.

Ethan pressed his forehead to hers, voice husky. "Like it?"

She turned her face away.

He chuckled, pecking her lips once more. "You do."

Sophia's ears burned crimson.

She did crave his forceful kisses—proof that he wasn't entirely indifferent to her. In this illicit relationship, it was her only solace.

"Wear this."

He tossed her a gift box. Sophia caught it instinctively and stood. "I'll change at home."

"Here."

Ethan rose, his gaze roaming over her. "We can adjust if it doesn't fit."

She rolled her eyes internally. That dress was definitely trouble, but to avoid complications, she obediently retreated to the bathroom.

The mirror reflected a vision in mist-blue—snowy skin, a subtly rounded belly adding softness to her figure.

But the dress...

Sophia frowned at the strained bodice, fabric taut under the pressure. She strongly suspected his intentions.

Knock knock.

"Come out, or I'm coming in," Ethan's impatient voice warned through the door.

Biting her lip, she hurriedly replied, "Almost done."
###Chapter 267

Sophia instinctively tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear as her fingers brushed the doorknob.

The door swung open, revealing Ethan Roscente's towering frame.

His scorching gaze traveled from her tousled hair down to her toes, lingering at the slight dip of her neckline.

"Seems my technique was effective." His Adam's apple bobbed, voice gravelly. "At this rate, we might need a different measuring method."

"Shut up!" Sophia's ears burned as she turned to leave.

A strong hand clamped around her wrist, yanking her against his blazing chest. Ethan looked down at her. "In a hurry?"

"Isn't there a gala to attend?"

His eyes dropped to her fluffy slippers, one brow arching. "Wearing these?"

Sophia gasped at her oversight. As she spun around, strong arms lifted her effortlessly onto the sofa.

Ethan knelt on one knee, retrieving diamond-studded heels from a velvet box. Silver satin shimmered under the light.

"Lift your foot."

Sophia stared, transfixed, as his deft fingers slid along her ankle. The ruthless business titan was now kneeling to put shoes on her.

"Perfect." His thumb stroked her instep. "Like Cinderella's glass slipper."

Her pulse stuttered. "Why..."

"Hong Kong's elite will be there tonight." Ethan rose, adjusting his cufflinks. "Just stand there and look pretty."

Of course. Sophia bit her lip and jerked her foot back. "I can manage without your help."

"Between decorations," he suddenly leaned in, breath grazing her earlobe, "I prefer my accessories with claws."

The gala sparkled under crystal chandeliers. Ethan paused at the entrance, offering his arm.

"Unnecessary." Sophia stepped back. "There's a difference between secretary and date."

Darkness flashed in his eyes. "Are you lecturing me, Ms. Lowell?"

A chill crawled down her spine. Reluctantly, she took his arm and was swept into the glittering den of vipers.

Amidst clinking glasses, she maintained a porcelain smile while Ethan charmed the power brokers.

"And this is?" A corporate director eyed Sophia.

"I'm Mr. Roscente's—"

"My personal assistant." Ethan cut her off, fingers digging warningly into her waist.

The man smirked. "Excellent taste. Compared to Miss Valentine, this one seems more..."

"Director Qi." Ethan swirled his champagne, eyes glacial. "Choose your next words carefully."

Sophia's nails bit into her palms. She never should have come.
###Chapter 268

Mr. Galatea approached with a wine glass in hand, his eyes glinting shrewdly. "Secretary Lowell, care for a drink?"

The crystal glass refracted the light, casting an enigmatic smile across his face.

Sophia's fingers trembled slightly. This man was notorious in business circles for being difficult, and Ethan had just warned her to behave...

"She doesn't drink."

Ethan's voice cut through like ice. He pulled Sophia close by the waist and turned away without another word.

Sophia offered Mr. Galatea an apologetic smile before her heels clicked sharply against the marble floor.

"Mr. Roscente..." she murmured in reminder.

Ethan ignored her, his grip unyielding.

Across the ballroom, Tyler Galatea laughed with his date until his peripheral vision caught a familiar silhouette.

"Fuck!" His grip tightened around his glass.

The humiliation from that live reality show flooded back. Because of Sophia's mocking remark, he'd been forced to deactivate all his socials—his name had become a running joke online.

And now she was here.

His gaze slithered over her like a snake. The moonlight-blue halter dress hugged every curve, her bare shoulders glowing under the chandeliers. The slit in the skirt teased glimpses of toned legs with each step, making his throat tighten.

Even more alluring than on screen.

"Tyler?" His date pouted, pressing closer.

He shoved her away roughly and grabbed a passing guest. "Who's that guy?"

"Ethan Roscente from the mainland. Rumor says he's well-connected."

"The mainland?" Tyler's gold tooth flashed as he grinned.

In Hong Kong, even dragons had to coil and tigers had to crouch.

He fired off a text, his eyes glued to Sophia's retreating figure as if he could already see her begging on her knees.

A sudden chill ran down Sophia's spine.

She turned and met Tyler's venomous stare, her pupils contracting. Why was this loser here?

"What's wrong?" Ethan sensed her tension.

"Nothing." She forced a smile, though her ankle throbbed faintly.

Subtly, she leaned closer into Ethan's side.
###Chapter 269

Since becoming pregnant, Sophia had practically sworn off high heels. On the rare occasions she needed to wear them, she only chose low-heeled styles. The pair Ethan had picked for her tonight had terrifyingly tall stilettos.

She discreetly flexed her ankles, trying to ease the discomfort.

"Ethan, I'd like to discuss a few projects with you." A Hong Kong socialite approached with a champagne flute, speaking in flawless Cantonese.

The corner of Ethan's mouth lifted. "How could I refuse an invitation from my esteemed elder?"

Sophia was surprised to discover Ethan's Cantonese was so fluent. His accent and pronunciation made him sound like a true local.

She seized the chance to slip her arm free. "You two talk. I need to visit the ladies' room."

After receiving his nod, she hurried out of the banquet hall.

In the restroom, Sophia eagerly kicked off her heels. The cool marble tiles against her bare feet made her exhale in relief.

The woman in the mirror had flawless makeup, but exhaustion lingered in her eyes. After running around all day, she just wanted to collapse in their hotel room.

"Just a little longer," she encouraged her reflection.

After touching up her makeup, she took a deep breath and forced the heels back on. The moment she pushed the door open, a large hand clamped around her wrist.

Tyler Galatea's greasy face loomed inches from hers.

"Mr. Galatea, behave yourself!" She struggled violently but couldn't break free.

"Stop playing hard to get." He sneered. "No one in Hong Kong dares disrespect me."

His breath hit her face as he leaned closer. "What does Ethan Roscente amount to? Here, I make the rules."

Sophia's back hit the wall with nowhere left to retreat.

"You should consider the consequences," she said with forced calm, nails digging into her palms.

Tyler gripped her chin. "Consequences? After tonight, you'll be mine. If Ethan knows what's good for him, he'll hand you over without a fuss."

He roughly yanked at her shoulder strap. Sophia drove her knee hard between his legs. As he doubled over in pain, she turned and ran.

"You bitch!" Tyler roared, chasing after her.

At the corner, Sophia crashed into a familiar chest. Ethan caught her with one arm while his other hand effortlessly intercepted Tyler's swinging fist.

"Mr. Galatea." His voice was glacial. "You should've asked my permission before touching what's mine."
###Chapter 270

Sophia let out a cold laugh. "Then we'll see each other in court. Let's find out who goes bankrupt first."

Tyler Galatea scoffed. "Stop pretending to be virtuous. Ethan Roscente already has a fiancée, yet you still cling to him like a parasite. Proud of being the other woman? You'd be better off with me—at least you wouldn't have to hide."

"Thanks for the offer, but I have no interest in trash."

Tyler's face darkened. He grabbed her slender wrist. "You bitch! How dare you disrespect me!" His other hand swung toward her face.

Sophia tried to dodge, but her back suddenly collided with a solid chest.

"Lay a finger on what's mine?" Ethan's voice was glacial as he seized Tyler's wrist. "It seems the Galatea family no longer wishes to operate in Hong Kong."

Tyler's legs weakened under the icy stare. He hastily released Sophia, sweat beading on his forehead.

Sophia quickly retreated behind Ethan. The man glanced at her briefly, ensuring she was unharmed before locking eyes with Tyler again. "Even your father grovels in my presence. Who do you think you are?"

Tyler paled. His father, a powerful figure in Hong Kong, was reduced to nothing in Ethan's words.

"Mr. Roscente, I—" Tyler's voice cut off abruptly when he spotted the man behind Ethan. "Uncle... Oliver?"

Sophia followed his gaze. It was Oliver Alpinus, the Hong Kong tycoon who had just been in a private discussion with Ethan. Now this influential figure, whose mere presence could shake the city, stood respectfully at Ethan's side.

Tyler's legs trembled, his drunkenness evaporating.

Oliver scowled. "You disgrace! You've humiliated the Galatea name!"

"I... I had too much to drink—" Tyler stammered, his back drenched in sweat.

Sophia smirked inwardly. These spoiled brats always blamed alcohol for their misdeeds.

Ethan leisurely adjusted his cufflinks. "Since Mr. Galatea can't distinguish real liquor from fake, perhaps a stomach pump is in order." He turned to Oliver. "Don't you agree?"

Oliver studied Sophia for a thoughtful moment before nodding. "A sobering measure is necessary."

Tyler's face turned ashen. He dropped to his knees, slapping his own face repeatedly. "Have mercy, Mr. Roscente! I was wrong! I swear I'll never do it again!"

Ethan looked down at him, his lips curling slightly. "Then kneel here until you're sober."
###Chapter 271

Tyler Galatea's knees buckled, and he collapsed heavily onto the floor.

Ethan Roscente turned to leave, but his peripheral vision caught Sophia Lowell standing motionless. She was eyeing the kneeling Tyler with undisguised amusement, her lips curling in silent schadenfreude.

"Planning to stay the night, Ms. Lowell?" His lips quirked.

Sophia jolted and hurried after him. "This place isn't my style."

After seeing Oliver Alpinus off, Sophia tried to put distance between them—only for Ethan's arm to snake around her waist, pulling her flush against him. His voice dripped with mockery. "Quite the charmer, aren't you? Flowers seem to follow wherever you go."

"..."

Sophia rolled her eyes internally. You can have this "charm" if you want it.

She twisted to escape, but he anticipated the move. His hand slid up her spine, pressing just enough to send her tumbling into his chest.

"You hit me with impressive force before," Ethan murmured, fingers tracing her vertebrae. "Why go easy on that idiot? Couldn't bear to hurt him?"

Her teeth ground together. Of course he'd hold a grudge over that slap.

Pushing against his chest to rise, the angle made it look like she was leaning in for a kiss. A shadow shifted at the corridor's end—someone raising a phone.

"Mr. Roscente, this is inappropriate." She turned her face away, lashes fluttering.

His fingertips danced along her spine, igniting tremors. Her legs weakened, cheeks flushing crimson.

"Answer the question." His tone turned glacial.

Sophia bit her lip. "Playing hard to get only works on humans... Does he even qualify?"

Ethan's gaze locked onto her damp eyes, his Adam's apple bobbing. That rabbit-in-headlights look made him want to torment her further.

"If I catch you attracting more flies," his grip tightened, "you'll learn the consequences firsthand."

Sophia pouted. "But he was the one who—"

"Hmm?" The warning hum lifted.

She swallowed her protest. "Understood."

Only then did he release her. As he turned away, a dark glint flashed in his eyes. Around the corner, the eavesdropper examined the captured photos, lips curling in triumph.
###Chapter 272

Sophia had maintained a careful distance from Ethan's chest, but his sudden movement pressed them flush together. The soft curves of her body molded perfectly against his firm torso, his scorching body heat seeping through the thin fabric of her dress.

Her breath hitched. "Understood," she managed, her voice tight.

Her fingers dug into the sleeves of his suit jacket as she stiffened. "Mr. Roscente, let go—people might see."

Ethan leaned in closer, crushing her against him. A cold laugh rumbled in his throat. "You dare scheme against me, yet fear being seen?"

"Not for my sake," she countered, tilting her head back until her hair brushed his jaw. "But if the paparazzi snap photos of you harassing me..." Her lips curled into a mocking smile. "Wouldn’t that ruin your untouchable ice prince image?"

His grip slackened instantly.

Sophia seized the chance to step back, smoothing her tousled hair. When she looked up again, her practiced smile was flawless—as if their heated exchange had never happened.

"Your audacity grows," he sneered.

She resisted the urge to roll her eyes. Who could possibly outmatch this man in shamelessness?

"Coming from you, that’s high praise," she said with a slight bow. "Though I still have much to learn."

The barb in her words made his eyes narrow, but he only shot her a warning glare before disappearing into the crowd.

Meanwhile, the sound of shattering glass echoed through a VIP room at a high-end spa.

Isabella Valentine stared at her phone screen, her overfilled cheeks contorted with rage. The photo of Sophia tilting her face toward Ethan scraped against her nerves like a blade.

"Filthy bitch!" Her crystal nails dug into her palms.

The mirror reflected her distorted face, still swollen from Vivian’s slaps three days prior. The fresh fillers shifted dangerously with her violent emotions.

What drove her madder was the photo’s location tag—Hong Kong. The city held painful significance for Ethan. It was where he and his mother had lived before the Roscente family took him in at age seven.

"How dare she?" She hurled a serum bottle at the mirror.

The fractured glass reflected countless twisted versions of her face. Her father, William Valentine, had warned her never to mention Hong Kong—it was Ethan’s deepest wound, one even she avoided.

Her phone buzzed with Sophia’s flight details from that morning. Isabella suddenly laughed, tracing Sophia’s smiling face on the screen with a blood-red nail.

"Since you’re begging for death..." She dialed a number, her voice dripping with poisoned sweetness. "Prepare something special for me."
###Chapter 273

Back in the hospital room, I pulled out a spare phone from my bag.

"Hello?"

A lazy male voice answered.

"It's me, Isabella."

"Miss Valentine?" Dominic Valrose chuckled. "What's wrong? Ethan Roscente not satisfying you?"

I bit my lip and cooed, "I missed you."

"Cut the act." His voice turned cold. "Using me again?"

I lowered my voice. "There's a vixen clinging to Ethan. She's in Hong Kong right now—"

"Ethan Roscente?" He cut me off sharply. "You want me to touch his woman?"

I rushed to explain. "She's just a plaything. He doesn't care about her."

Silence stretched for several seconds.

"Isabella Valentine," he finally laughed, "do you think I'm stupid?"

My nails dug into my palm.

"Dominic..." I forced a sob. "She humiliated me in public..."

He scoffed. "I know exactly what kind of person you are."

Gritting my teeth, I softened my tone. "I've acquired something new..."

"Oh?" Interest sparked in his voice.

"Imported pills," I whispered. "They can be hidden in..."

His breathing noticeably quickened.

"Send me the details," he rasped.

After hanging up, I immediately forwarded Sophia Lowell's photo.

In the picture, the woman stood by the sea in a white dress, her hair tousled by the wind—an alluring mix of innocence and seduction.

I smirked at the screen.

Dominic always loved prey that looked pure on the surface.

My phone vibrated moments later.

"Tomorrow night." Three simple words. The fish had taken the bait.

Meanwhile, in the CEO office of Valrose Group...

Dominic stared at Sophia's photo, his gaze lingering.

His secretary entered. "Mr. Valrose, the contract—"

He yanked her onto his lap, sliding a hand under her skirt. "Accompany me to see Ethan Roscente tomorrow."

She giggled, pretending to resist. "But what about that Miss Lowell—"

"Shh." He nipped her earlobe. "We all get what we want."

Night deepened.

In a hotel bed, Sophia tossed restlessly in her sleep.

Flames encircled her in the dream, heatwaves crashing over her.

The blanket lay discarded on the floor, her silk nightgown damp with sweat.

Outside, neon lights painted Hong Kong's skyline in lurid shades of purple and red.
###Chapter 274

Sophia stirred awake from her dazed state, her lashes fluttering as she opened her eyes.

The ceiling blurred and then sharpened in her vision.

She pushed herself up from the mattress, immediately wincing at the wave of stifling heat that hit her. The room was sweltering, thick enough to choke on.

"Is the AC broken?" she muttered, rubbing her temples.

A sharp, acrid scent suddenly filled her nostrils.

Her head snapped toward the source, her pupils contracting.

In the dim corner of the sofa, the ember of a cigarette pulsed faintly. Through the haze of smoke, a pair of dark, unreadable eyes watched her coldly.

"Ah!"

Sophia jolted back, her spine hitting the headboard.

"Ethan Roscente, are you insane?!" She grabbed a pillow and hurled it at him. "What kind of sick joke is this, lurking in the dark like some ghost?"

The man’s tall frame remained half-shrouded in shadow, the cigarette between his fingers casting a faint glow. He exhaled a slow, deliberate stream of smoke, his voice low. "You were sleeping so soundly."

Her teeth ground together.

She threw off the covers and swung her legs over the side, her bare feet hitting the scorching floor.

"Did you turn my AC into a sauna?" She stormed to the control panel—sure enough, the display read 32°C.

Ethan stubbed out the cigarette, his metal lighter flipping deftly in his palm.

"Tyler Galatea is dead," he said abruptly.

Her fingers froze midair.

"...What?"

He stood, his long legs encased in tailored slacks carrying him toward her in measured steps. One hand planted on the wall beside her head, caging her in with the mingled scents of tobacco and his cold, expensive cologne.

"I said," he murmured, leaning in until his breath brushed her ear, his tone deceptively tender, "I threw that trash who dared lay hands on you into the ocean for the fish."

A cold sweat broke out down her back.

She forced a laugh, shoving him away. "Mr. Roscente, are you confessing to murder for my sake?"

Ethan chuckled darkly, his thumb tracing the red marks on her wrist—left by Tyler’s grip.

"I hate filth."

Sophia suddenly laughed outright.

Tilting her head to study his stormy expression, she batted her lashes. "Ethan Roscente, don’t tell me..." She dragged out the pause deliberately. "You’re jealous?"

His gaze darkened.

"I own this hotel," he said instead, his fingers hooking into the strap of her nightgown. "And I opened this door."

She slapped his hand away. "So?"

"So," he scooped her up and tossed her back onto the bed in one motion, loosening his tie with his free hand, "if I can’t sleep, neither can you."

Sophia struggled to sit up, only for him to bind her wrists with the silk tie.

"Hey! You—"

"Shh." He covered her mouth, something dangerous glinting in his eyes. "Keep shouting, and I’ll throw you out for everyone to see how the Mrs. Roscente looks half-dressed at midnight."

Her eyes widened.

Was this man... actually a psychopath?
###Chapter 275

Ethan's brows furrowed as his dark gaze pinned her in place. "Do you think I'm joking?"

"Every word is true." Sophia yawned, stretching lazily. "But showing up at 1 AM to discuss this? Ridiculous."

He shot to his feet, eyes blazing. "All because of your heartless attitude!"

She shrugged and burrowed under the covers. "I never stopped you from sleeping. Mr. Roscente, go home. I'm exhausted from keeping your paycheck alive."

Her drowsy eyes flicked to the wall clock. "Even ghosts wouldn't be awake at this hour. In my current state, I'm above the law. If I accidentally push you off the 28th floor..."

Before she could finish, he abruptly turned.

Sophia smirked inwardly. Playing crazy always worked with men like him.

"Close the door on your way— Wait!" Her eyes widened. "Was your night blindness fake? That's the bathroom!"

The sound of running water made her punch the mattress in frustration.

This bastard had planned this all along!

The water stopped abruptly.

"No towel." His deep voice carried through the door.

"Come out naked then," she taunted.

"As you wish." The doorknob turned, making her bolt upright.

"Wait!" She grabbed the used towel from her nightstand and rushed forward. "Here!"

She averted her gaze, ears burning.

Her wrist was suddenly seized. The world spun as her back hit the tiled wall.

Ethan stood perfectly dressed in his suit—no trace of a shower.

"Ethan Roscente, you—"

"The night is short." He nipped her earlobe. "How about joining me for a bath, Secretary Lowell?"

"You promised not to touch me!" She kicked out.

He dodged effortlessly, loosening his tie with one hand. "I changed my mind."
###Chapter 276

Sophia instinctively clutched the collar of her nightgown, her knuckles turning white.

Ethan Roscente looked down at her with a mocking curve on his lips.

"Want to keep my grandfather company? Too bad he's long gone." He slowly undid his cufflinks. "Sophia, I never knew you had such... peculiar tastes."

Heat rushed to Sophia's cheeks.

Before she could retort, his slender fingers had already slipped beneath her collar.

"But..." He leaned in, his breath warm against her ear. "I suppose I could indulge you."

Sophia's words died in her throat.

Ethan swiftly stripped off her nightgown and scooped her into his arms.

Steam rose from the bathtub, carrying the faint scent of herbs.

"Is this... Chinese medicine?" Sophia looked up in surprise.

Ethan leaned against the tub's edge, his Adam's apple bobbing. "You said you were sore." His voice was rough. "If you want to walk tomorrow, stop talking."

Sophia shrank back.

She suddenly remembered Ethan's brief stop at an herbal shop on their way back to the hotel.

"Relax, it won't kill you." His tone was lazy. "I prepared it myself."

Sophia muttered under her breath, "That's exactly why I'm worried..."

She froze mid-sentence.

"Wait, didn't you study Western medicine?" Her eyes widened. "Since when do you know traditional remedies?"

Years ago, her aunt had mentioned Ethan's brief but notable medical career before he switched to business.

His eyes snapped open, sharp and alert. "Investigating me?"

Sophia's heart skipped a beat.

During her infatuation phase, she'd often pried information from her aunt.

"Your medical degree isn't classified information." She turned away. "I lived with the Roscentes for two years. Gossip travels."

Ethan scoffed and closed his eyes again.

"About this prescription—"

"Keep talking," he suddenly moved closer, "and I'll find another way to silence you."

The next morning, Sophia was shocked to find her body miraculously pain-free.

Ethan emerged from the bathroom adjusting his tie and glanced at his watch. "We leave at nine. You have eight minutes."

Sophia suddenly remembered their actual purpose for this trip.

Damn last night's gala.

She struggled upright. "Yes, Mr. Roscente..."

Cold water splashed on her face, clearing the fog in her mind.

At exactly nine o'clock, the black sedan pulled away from the hotel.

But the route to the Valrose headquarters grew increasingly remote.

When Sophia was jolted awake for the third time, dense forests stretched beyond the window.

"The Valrose headquarters..." She eyed Ethan suspiciously. "Please tell me it's not built in a graveyard."
###Chapter 277

The scenery outside the car window blurred past as Sophia Lowell finally noticed the lush greenery lining both sides of the road. This didn't resemble a bustling metropolis at all—it was more like a hidden paradise.

"Dominic changed the location last minute," Zachary Evans said, gripping the steering wheel with a hint of frustration. "We're heading to the Hot Springs Resort for the project discussion now."

He had caught an early morning flight, and the faint shadows under his eyes betrayed his exhaustion. Sophia couldn't help stealing another glance at him, thinking how relentlessly dedicated he was.

Back at the New York studio, Vivian Ashcroft was pacing in agitation.

"If no one shows up soon, the production team will replace me!" She glared at her phone screen, wishing she could reach through it and throttle Ethan Roscente.

Daisy Rustichel rushed over in a panic. "The director says we have ten minutes at most!"

Vivian closed her eyes in despair. Just as she was about to text Sophia, hurried footsteps approached.

"Jason Roscente?" Her eyes widened at the sight of the casually dressed young man. "Here to chase after celebrities?"

The tips of Jason's ears turned pink as he shoved his hands into his pockets and shrugged with forced nonchalance. "Yeah. Here to chase you."

Vivian nearly choked on her own saliva. She scrutinized the boy several years her junior before realization struck. "Wait… you're not—"

"Your new co-host." Jason flashed a brilliant grin. "Looking forward to working with you, Miss Ashcroft."

The studio lights suddenly brightened, illuminating them both. Vivian now noticed Jason had styled his hair for the occasion, and a delicate brooch adorned the collar of his crisp white shirt.

"You—" She faltered.

"Don't worry, I won't hold you back." Jason leaned in unexpectedly, his voice dropping to a whisper near her ear. "I grew up watching your shows."

Vivian's face flushed crimson. She shoved him away. "Stop talking nonsense!"

Daisy stood frozen nearby, her script clattering to the floor.
###Chapter 278

Jason Roscente flicked Vivian Ashcroft's forehead with his slender fingers when he realized she'd completely forgotten he was her fan.

"My idol is you," he said. "I came specifically to meet my celebrity crush."

This kid always had a dramatic way of speaking.

Vivian rubbed her forehead and glared at him. "No respect for your elders. I'm still a celebrity, even if I'm not A-list. Paparazzi don't care about that. I don't want Dylan Langley snapping some compromising photos."

Dylan Langley was infamous in the industry—a paparazzo who made his living blackmailing stars.

Jason scoffed. "I'm nineteen, not a kid. Vivian, stop talking to me like I'm some child."

"Nineteen is still a baby in my eyes." Vivian deliberately ruffled his short hair. "Be good and call me 'Auntie.' I'll buy you candy."

Jason swatted her hand away, his gaze suddenly turning dangerous. "Keep treating me like a kid, and I'll show you what a real man is."

Vivian froze under his sudden intensity.

Before she could change the subject, Jason grabbed her wrist. "Let's go."

"Where?" Vivian tried to pull free. "I'm waiting for someone—a very important guest."

Jason rubbed his thumb over the lingering warmth on her skin, looking down at her. "Isn't that me?"

Vivian tilted her head up, realization dawning. "You're the replacement guest Director Roscente found?"

A roguish smirk curled his lips. "Surprised?"

Vivian: "..."

Meanwhile, in another dressing room.

Isabella Valentine stared at her heavily made-up reflection in the mirror and slammed her hands on the table. "What the hell is this monstrosity?"

The makeup artist flinched back.

"This looks like something out of a horror movie!" Isabella shrieked. "Did you leave your brain at home today?"

The makeup artist lowered her head, tears welling in her eyes.
###Chapter 279

The makeup artist's hands trembled slightly.

With twenty years of experience working with A-list celebrities, she had never endured such humiliation. But Isabella Valentine had Ethan Roscente backing her, so she could only grit her teeth and bear it.

"This makeup is too heavy!" Isabella shrieked at the mirror. "I wanted a natural, no-makeup look!"

Beads of sweat formed on the makeup artist's forehead. Isabella's overfilled face was uneven, with dark circles under her eyes. Heavy makeup was the only way to cover the flaws.

"Miss Valentine, your current skin condition—"

"Shut up!" Isabella grabbed a compact and hurled it. "Are you calling me ugly?"

Her agent, Jessica, quickly intervened, whispering, "Isabella, walls have ears. We just suppressed that bullying scandal. We can't afford another incident."

Isabella sneered. "What's there to fear? The Roscentes are my shield."

She glared at her swollen reflection, fury boiling inside. Sophia Lowell and Vivian Ashcroft were to blame for this!

Jessica expertly massaged her temples. "The new drama is about to air. We can't ruin your innocent persona."

Isabella reluctantly reined in her temper and shot the makeup artist a sidelong glance. "Do it again. If you mess up, I'll make sure you never work in this industry again."

The makeup artist picked up her brush with shaking hands.

Outside in the hallway, Vivian frowned at the stream of curses coming from inside.

"Please use the fifth-floor makeup room," a bodyguard blocked her path.

Vivian scoffed. "Did she buy out the entire floor?"

The bodyguard smirked. "This studio is funded by the Roscentes. Miss Valentine can use any space she wants. Even the director has to bow to her."

"How impressive." Vivian raised her voice deliberately. "Let's see if the Roscentes can control everything!"

Her words carried clearly into the makeup room. Isabella shot to her feet, sending a foundation case crashing to the floor, where it split in two.
###Chapter 280

"You're asking for death!"

Vivian Ashcroft bristled instantly, rolling up her sleeves as if ready to throw punches.

Jason Roscente gripped her wrist firmly, his sharp gaze sweeping over the bodyguard. "Since when are lounges segregated by status?"

"Obviously!"
The bodyguard lifted his chin arrogantly.

Jason turned to the trembling staff member. "Are the lounges first-come-first-serve or assigned by production?"

The staff member stammered, "F-Free choice. But Miss Valentine is an A-lister, so..."

"Being an A-lister means hogging all the lounges?" Vivian scoffed. "Who does she think she is? Some kind of royalty?"

A flicker of amusement crossed Jason's eyes as he suddenly ruffled her hair. "Relax. I've got this."

Vivian froze, caught off guard by the gesture.

"Stop right there!"
The bodyguard moved to block them, but Jason shot him a warning glare. "You dare stand in the way of the seventh son of the Roscente family?"

Before the bodyguard could react, the world spun around him.

"Thud!"

The six-foot-tall brute crashed heavily onto the floor with a dull thump.

Jason leisurely adjusted his cuffs. "Next time you block my path, it won't just be a fall. Bones will break."

Vivian's eyes widened. "Holy crap! That was insanely cool!"

"Call me 'brother,'" Jason teased, raising an eyebrow.

Vivian: "......"

They strode straight into Isabella Valentine's lounge.

Isabella whipped around mid-makeup, half her face still unfinished.

"Get out!" she shrieked. "Bodyguards! Throw these trashy nobodies out!"

Vivian crossed her arms with a cold smirk. "You're the one who should leave. Since when does some wannabe diva get to claim the Roscente heir's private lounge?"
###Chapter 281

Sophia spun around to find Jason Roscente standing behind her. Her brows furrowed. "What do you mean by that?"

Jason ignored her, striding toward the sofa area. "Vivian, this spot's comfortable."

"Got it!"

Their blatant disregard infuriated Sophia. Her face twisted as her voice rose. "Jason! I'm your aunt! How dare you disrespect me? Should I tell your uncle to cut off your allowance?" She glared at Vivian. "And you! Didn't you see someone was already here? Barging in like this—where are your manners?"

Jason scanned the room, then smirked, crossing his arms. "I see two people standing. The one sitting—is that even human? With that two-faced look, I thought it was a ghost."

"You—!"

The makeup artist stifled a laugh.

Sophia trembled with rage, her chest heaving.

Jason poured fuel on the fire. "Aunt? My uncle hasn't even decided if he'll let you through the door. Who are you to act all high and mighty?" He gave her a dismissive once-over. "Ask around. Who have I ever feared? You think you can threaten me?"

"Well said!" Vivian clapped.

Sophia slammed her hands on the table and stood. "Vivian, you bitch! You're the one poisoning Jason against me!" Her face contorted. "I replaced you once—I can do it again! Want to be blacklisted? Then behave!"

Vivian remained unruffled. "Oh? Threats?" She drawled, "This studio is Roscente-funded. Family comes first. Jason, an actual Roscente, hasn't complained. Yet here you are, some unconfirmed fiancée, throwing your weight around." She eyed Sophia meaningfully. "Wonder what Ethan would do if he knew you insulted his nephew. Call off the engagement, perhaps?"

"Bitch!" Sophia lunged, hand raised to strike.

Jason moved to intervene, but Vivian caught Sophia's wrist first. "Throwing a tantrum now?" Her voice turned icy. "Isabella, is this all you've got?" She shoved her away. "I was practicing martial arts while you were still drinking formula. Want a beating? Get out!"

Sophia shook with fury but was powerless. She seethed at Vivian. "You'll regret this!"

Vivian scoffed. "Running to Ethan again? Too bad." She feigned surprise. "You didn't know? Sophia's on a business trip with him—because he insisted on taking her." She tilted her head. "Leaving his fiancée behind for her... What does that tell you?"

"That homewrecker Sophia!" Sophia exploded.

"Homewrecker?" Vivian's laugh was sharp. "Who was with Ethan first? They dated for two years. You're the one who butted in. If anyone's the homewrecker, it's you."
###Chapter 282

Isabella Valentine trembled with rage, her nails digging deep into her palms. She glared at Vivian Ashcroft with venomous eyes.

"Get out." Vivian lounged lazily with her legs crossed. "The sight of your face ruins my appetite."

"You—"

Jason Roscente suddenly stepped between them, his gaze icy. "Try laying a finger on her." A dangerous smirk played on his lips. "I'll make sure you never work in this industry again."

Isabella paled.

She couldn't comprehend why every Roscente man was bewitched by Sophia Lowell's circle. The fourth uncle married Emily Laurent, Ethan Roscente protected Sophia, and now even Jason stood by Vivian's side.

"Isabella, let's go." Her agent Jessica Luwelton quickly pulled her away, forcing a smile as she bowed to Jason. "Please forgive us, Mr. Roscente. We'll find another spot."

"Why should I move?" Isabella shrieked.

Jessica lowered her voice. "That's the youngest Roscente heir. If he says one word to Ethan, your engagement..."

Isabella bit her lip hard.

"Don't worry." Jessica's eyes gleamed cunningly. "The show's director is my old classmate."

Once they left, Vivian exhaled in relief and gave Jason a thumbs-up. "That felt amazing! Last time was humiliating."

Jason suddenly leaned in, his breath brushing her ear. "Want to..." His voice dropped to a murmur. "Be my girlfriend?"

Vivian's ears turned crimson. She grabbed a water bottle and gulped frantically.

Crash!

In the new dressing room, Isabella smashed cosmetics wildly. Foundation splattered everywhere, lipstick smeared across the mirror.

A makeup artist cowered in the corner.

"Leave us." Jessica dismissed the trembling woman and gripped Isabella's shoulders. "I've contacted the director. But you must control yourself—live broadcasts can't be edited."

Isabella took deep breaths, staring at her distorted reflection.

A twisted smile suddenly appeared. She pulled out her phone and sent a message. Seeing the reply, she dragged her finger viciously across Sophia's photo.

Achoo!

Sophia shuddered abruptly in the car.

"Cold?" Ethan frowned, adjusting the AC. His gaze lingered on her slightly pale lips.
###Chapter 283

"The suburbs are indeed cooler than downtown." Sophia rubbed her bare calves.

Ethan Roscente's gaze lingered on her thin skirt, displeasure flickering in his eyes. "Stop pretending."

A tailored suit jacket still warm from his body suddenly draped over her head.

Flustered, Sophia pulled it off and recognized Ethan's custom-made suit. She hastily offered it back. "No need, I—"

"Wear it," Ethan cut her off. "If you catch a cold, don't expect me to approve sick leave."

Sophia gritted her teeth.

This man had serious persecution complex.

The entrance of the hot springs resort swarmed with Dominic Valrose's welcoming committee.

Sophia tightened her grip on the seatbelt. "Mr. Roscente, perhaps I should stay in the car? With so many people, I might embarrass you."

Ethan glanced at her white-knuckled fingers and gave a curt nod before exiting with Zachary Evans.

The crowd surged forward like a tidal wave, swallowing his tall figure.

Sophia exhaled in relief.

She wasn't lying. Crowded places always made her chest feel like it was crushed under a boulder.

Stepping out, the crisp mountain air greeted her.

She inhaled deeply, letting the earthy fragrance of grass and trees dispel the suffocating weight in her chest.

"Excuse me, are you Mr. Roscente's secretary?"

A gentle female voice came from behind.

Turning, Sophia saw a polished woman in a beige suit. Her makeup was impeccable, her smile perfectly measured.

"I'm Mr. Valrose's secretary, Lydia." She offered a business card. "Mr. Roscente mentioned you weren't feeling well. Mr. Valrose asked me to escort you to rest."

Sophia accepted the card politely. "Thank you, Ms. Merovingian. I just had slight motion sickness and needed fresh air."

"Shall I arrange some lemonade for you?" Lydia suggested considerately.

"That would be kind of you."

Lydia gestured toward a distant garden. "This is Mr. Valrose's private retreat. The surroundings are lovely. Feel free to stroll if you're uncomfortable."

After Lydia left, a server soon brought a glass of lemonade.

Sophia thanked him but only touched it to her lips before setting it aside.

In unfamiliar settings, she never consumed anything carelessly.
###Chapter 284

Lydia Merovingian hid behind the wisteria trellis, fingers flying across her phone screen. "Mr. Valrose, Ms. Lowell is too alert. She won't take the bait."

Dominic Valrose was engaged in conversation with Ethan Roscente when the message arrived. A dark glint flashed in his eyes as he typed his reply. "Of course she's difficult. Ethan trained her well."

"Should we keep trying?"

"Just observe for now. Don't spook her."

Dominic pocketed his phone, his gaze drifting to the slender figure in the distance. His plan had been simple—have his secretary lure Sophia to the guest suites for an "accidental" encounter. Afterwards, he could easily deny any involvement. Who could prove he knew Ethan's personal assistant?

But the woman was more cautious than expected.

Still, on this island, she had nowhere to run.

Sophia wandered aimlessly through the gardens, eventually finding herself before the Hot Springs Resort. The gilded sign glittered in the sunlight as guests in yukatas drifted in and out. The place was a gilded den of indulgence—oceanview hot springs, a private golf course, Michelin-starred dining.

"Ms. Lowell." Zachary Evans appeared at her side. "Mr. Roscente requests your presence for lunch."

Following his gesture, she spotted Ethan surrounded by business magnates. The mere thought of navigating that minefield of empty pleasantries made her stomach protest audibly.

"I'll grab something casual," she said, stepping back. "Business lunches give me indigestion."

Zachary hesitated. "Only Mr. Valrose and his secretary are attending. Mr. Roscente specifically asked for you."

Sophia opened her mouth to refuse when her phone buzzed.

Ethan's message contained two words: "Come here."

She looked up and met his piercing gaze across the garden. Even at this distance, the command in his stare was unmistakable.

"Does your boss have me bugged?" She waved her phone at Zachary. "He even predicted I'd try to escape."

Zachary's mouth twitched.

Another buzz.

"Talking shit about me?"

Sophia nearly dropped her phone in alarm. When she looked up again, Ethan was striding toward her. His tailored slacks accentuated the lethal grace of his movements, making her feel like prey under a predator's gaze.
###Chapter 285

Ethan Roscente always knew exactly what Sophia Lowell was thinking. It wasn’t mind-reading—just an intimate understanding of the woman.

Sophia walked slowly toward the seating area. First meetings always required polite small talk.

Dominic Valrose studied her through narrowed eyes. The photos hadn’t done her justice. The simple chiffon blouse hugged her curves perfectly, and her bare face glowed with natural beauty. When those liquid eyes met his, his throat tightened.

Sophia shifted uncomfortably under his blatant stare, instinctively stepping closer to Ethan.

"Mr. Valrose?"

Ethan’s voice was calm but carried a clear warning. As a man, he recognized that look all too well.

"Keep your eyes to yourself." His fingers tapped the table. "Unless you want to lose them."

The threat couldn’t be more obvious.

Dominic blinked, then burst into laughter. "Don’t misunderstand, Mr. Roscente. Your secretary is simply stunning. Even my own assistant can’t stop praising her." He glanced at Lydia. "Right?"

Lydia Merovingian quickly agreed. "Who wouldn’t admire a beauty like Miss Lowell?"

Dominic spread his hands. "Every gentleman appreciates a graceful lady."

Ethan smirked and abruptly pulled Sophia against him. His fingers traced her slender waist as he drawled, "What’s mine stays mine. I don’t like sharing."

"Understood." Dominic wisely wrapped an arm around Lydia. "We all have our favorites."

Lydia giggled and snuggled into him. Sophia watched the pair with cold disgust. Men were all the same.

She sensed the danger radiating from Dominic. Ethan’s display was clearly a protective shield. Playing along, she leaned into his shoulder with a shy smile.

"Dinner is ready," Dominic smoothly changed the subject. "You must try our signature dishes."

During the meal, Sophia’s phone buzzed. A text from Sebastian Valdemar. They hadn’t spoken much since the show ended. The professor was always vanishing into his busy schedule—his sudden message surprised her.
###Chapter 286

Ethan Roscente's gaze turned icy in an instant.

His knuckles whitened as he glimpsed the message on Sophia Lowell's phone screen. The glass in his hand emitted a faint creak under his tightening grip.

"Junior, I'm at your three o'clock."

Sophia turned toward the voice. There, partially obscured by decorative foliage, Sebastian Valdemar sat by the floor-to-ceiling windows in a booth that should have been clearly visible.

She raised her hand to wave when sudden warmth pressed against her thigh.

"Try responding. I dare you." Ethan's breath ghosted over her ear, laced with quiet menace.

Sophia froze.

Was he insane? The restaurant swarmed with food bloggers livestreaming. She clamped down on his wandering hand, voice trembling. "We're in public!"

Ethan chuckled darkly, tracing idle circles at her waistline. "Do I look like I care?"

Her teeth ground together. Just when she thought he'd changed, he always doubled down on being insufferable. Right now, she fantasized about stabbing his hand with her butter knife.

The lunch dragged on like torture.

In the lounge, Ethan and Dominic Valrose conversed effortlessly while Sophia fidgeted, downing glass after glass until her bladder protested.

"Let me accompany you." Lydia Merovingian eagerly linked arms with her.

At a corridor junction, Lydia suddenly steered them toward a secluded area. "There's an amazing entertainment zone—"

Sophia yanked free. "I'm exhausted."

Undeterred, Lydia pointed ahead. "But it's really—"

"Junior?" A mellifluous baritone interrupted.

Sebastian stood where light and shadow met, his white shirt gilded by sunlight. His gaze lingered briefly on Lydia before softening at Sophia. "What a coincidence."

"Senior!" Sophia sprang up like a pardoned convict.

Lydia's expression darkened, nails biting into her palms. This interloper had just derailed everything.
###Chapter 287

Sophia briefly introduced Lydia to Sebastian. "This is Mr. Valdemar from Valdemar Group."

Sebastian gave a slight nod. "Pleasure."

Lydia forced a smile, her eyes darting between them. She glanced at her watch with feigned regret. "Mr. Valrose needs me. I should go."

Once Lydia was out of sight, Sophia slumped onto the bench in relief. "Thank goodness you showed up. I didn't know how to get away."

Sebastian sat beside her, shaking his head. "You always put others first."

"They're Ethan's business partners," she murmured.

Sebastian hesitated. "About you and Ethan—"

"It's transactional," Sophia said plainly. "He pays, I attend events with him."

Sebastian recalled how Ethan had forcibly taken her away last time, his brow furrowing. "He hasn't given you trouble?"

Her fingers absently traced the strap of her bag. "Just business. No trouble." She quickly changed the subject. "What brings you here?"

"A friend's baby shower."

Meanwhile, inside the private room...

Dominic noted Lydia's return and lazily asked, "Where's Ms. Lowell?"

"Chatting with an acquaintance," Lydia replied, then felt a sharp gaze on her.

Ethan set down his teacup. "What acquaintance?"

"A Mr. Valdemar," Lydia added casually. "They seemed... close."

Ethan's lips thinned as he stood. "Excuse me."

Watching him leave, Dominic pulled Lydia closer. "Seems Mr. Roscente cares deeply about his secretary."

Lydia leaned into him. "Might be harder than we thought."

Dominic smirked. "Patience. There's always a way."

Back in the garden, Sebastian mentioned his sister. "Father's upset, but he dotes on her. She's gained weight resting at home." His eyes softened with concern. "You're working while pregnant. That can't be easy."

Sophia gently touched her stomach, a tender smile playing on her lips. "The baby's been kind. Not much fuss."
###Chapter 288

"Let me know if you need anything. I know a very professional obstetrician." Sebastian Valdemar handed her a business card.

Sophia Lowell was about to thank him and stand up when she caught sight of a tall figure in the distance.

Ethan Roscente leaned against a tree trunk, a cigarette burning between his fingers. Through the swirling smoke, his hawk-like eyes locked onto her.

Her fingers trembled, nearly dropping the card.

"How long has he been standing there?" Sophia's voice tightened.

Sebastian followed her gaze and frowned. "Don't worry. He couldn’t have heard us from this distance."

"I think he came specifically to catch me." Sophia gave a bitter smile. "That look in his eyes is like he caught me in bed with someone else."

Sebastian hesitated but only sighed. "Go back. Don’t let him misunderstand."

As she approached, the scent of tobacco mixed with cold cedar enveloped her.

"Having a nice chat?" Ethan crushed the cigarette underfoot, his voice icy. "Ms. Lowell, you never miss a chance to reconnect with old flames, do you?"

Sophia met his gaze. "Thanks to you, Mr. Roscente. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have had the chance to meet an old friend."

"You—" Ethan grabbed her wrist and pinned her against the tree. "Don’t forget your place."

The rough bark dug into her back. Sophia glimpsed Sebastian walking away and exhaled in relief.

"Looking for what? Hoping he’d play the hero?" Ethan gripped her chin. "Too bad your dear senior left without a second glance."

Sophia slapped his hand away. "With such a vivid imagination, maybe you should switch careers and write scripts."

She turned toward the lounge. "I’m skipping the golf this afternoon. I need to catch up on sleep at the hotel."

The crunch of leather shoes on fallen leaves followed her.

"A secretary with a million-dollar salary, slacking off to date during work hours." Ethan yanked her arm. "Have I been too lenient with you?"

Sophia shook him off. "Then fire me!"

"Fine." Ethan adjusted his cuff calmly. "Consider your severance and interest voided."

"You’re despicable!" Sophia trembled with anger. "That interest was part of our agreed travel terms!"

Ethan stepped closer, his warm breath brushing her ear. "Ask yourself, Ms. Lowell. Have you fulfilled your duties as my secretary these past few days?"

The image of Lydia Merovingian shadowing Dominic Valrose flashed in her mind. Sophia fell silent.

"...I’ll go with you this afternoon." She bit her lip in surrender.

Ethan scoffed, turning away with a faint smirk.

Same as always. The mention of money always made her yield.
###Chapter 289

The chill in Ethan Roscente's eyes faded slightly as his slender fingers tapped the desk. "Since you've taken my money, your time belongs to me. If I catch you making eyes at Sebastian Valdemar again, I'll deduct a million per minute."

Sophia Lowell nearly gritted her teeth to dust.

This man was the reincarnation of a penny-pinching tyrant!

Her relationship with Sebastian was completely innocent. How had it become something sordid in his twisted mind?

She seriously doubted the credibility of Roscente Group's HR vetting process.

At dusk, the sunset painted half the sky crimson.

Sophia changed into the golf course's provided sportswear. The white pleated skirt swayed with her steps, revealing a glimpse of her porcelain legs.

Ethan's gaze lingered on her for three seconds before his brows knotted. "Must you dress so provocatively?"

"What's provocative about this?" She tugged at the hem self-consciously.

The outfit was slightly short, but undeniably youthful. The lingering stares from passersby made her ears burn.

Ethan seized her wrist, dragging her toward the locker room without explanation. "Change."

"On what grounds?" Sophia dug her nails into the doorframe. "Since when does the CEO police employee dress codes?"

His lips curled coldly. "Dressing like a temptress harms the company's image."

"It's 2023, Mr. Roscente. Should we apply for you to be listed as a cultural relic?" Her cheeks flushed with anger.

Ethan's eyes darkened as he leaned close to her ear. "Article 44 of the Public Order Administration Punishments Law states that intentional public indecency carries a five-to-ten-day detention."

Sophia's pupils dilated. "Why would you research that?"

"To better..." His gaze trailed down her waistline. "...discipline you."

"Pervert!"

"Change." He released her, Adam's apple bobbing. "It's an eyesore."

A sudden realization struck her. She rose on tiptoes, whispering, "Could it be...you're jealous?"

"Get your vision checked." Ethan turned away. "Wait here."

Five minutes later, an oversized men's tracksuit landed in her arms.

"Wear this."
###Chapter 290

Sophia shook out the men's athletic set, her brows furrowed.

"Does this look like it would fit me?"

Ethan Roscente stood with one hand in his pocket, his gaze sweeping over her frame.

"If a man can wear it, why can't you?"

Her fists clenched.

She wanted to rip that smug smirk right off his face.

Ethan checked his wristwatch, his tone leaving no room for argument.

"Five minutes. Or I'll help you change myself."

Sophia took a sharp breath and turned toward the dressing room.

Just as she pushed the door open, his fingers closed around her wrist.

His breath was hot against her ear.

"I'm quite experienced at undressing women. Need assistance?"

She wrenched her arm free.

"Get lost!"

The dressing room door slammed shut with enough force to rattle the walls.

Five minutes later, Sophia emerged drowning in oversized sportswear.

The long sleeves and pants swallowed her whole, making her look like a walking burlap sack.

Ethan gave an approving nod before striding toward the golf course.

His pristine white athletic wear accentuated his broad shoulders and long legs, radiating aristocratic elegance.

Sophia glanced down at her own ridiculous outfit.

She might as well be a child playing dress-up in her father's clothes.

Dominic Valrose nearly choked on his champagne when he spotted her.

"Where's my eye candy?"

He glared at Lydia Merovingian, who wore a scandalously skimpy outfit.

Lydia whispered, "I definitely packed the lingerie set..."

Dominic's eyes narrowed at Ethan holding court among a flock of admiring women.

"Someone's guarding his prize."

Lydia frowned. "If Mr. Roscente is this protective of her, perhaps you should—"

Dominic swirled his drink, cutting her off.

"One project in exchange for a pretty little thing? Worth it."

Understanding flashed in Lydia's eyes.

"Miss Lowell, that outfit is... quite unique," Dominic called out loudly.

Sophia forced a smile.

"You flatter me, Mr. Valrose."

Wealthy heirs lounged by the sidelines, each with scantily clad women draped over them.

As Ethan and Dominic headed for the golf carts, Sophia remained under a sun umbrella.

"Haven't seen you around before."

A man in a floral shirt sauntered over with a cocktail.

Lydia smiled. "This is Mr. Roscente's secretary, Sophia."

The man's eyes lit up.

"An honored guest! You simply must join me for a drink."
###Chapter 291

Sophia's fingertips traced the rim of her crystal glass as the party hummed around her.

Kevin Heilbronn sidled up with a tumbler of whiskey, his gaze roaming over her body with undisguised hunger. In their world, secretaries and mistresses were often considered interchangeable.

"Mr. Heilbronn, company policy prohibits alcohol during work hours." She took a subtle half-step back, her voice steady.

"Stop playing hard to get." He scoffed, reaching for her waist.

"Mr. Roscente detests policy violations." She set her glass down with a sharp clink that froze his movement.

The name "Ethan Roscente" erected an invisible barrier. Kevin withdrew with a grumble, shooting Lydia Merovingian a meaningful look.

Lydia smoothly appeared with a juice glass. "Mr. Heilbronn and Mr. Valrose grew up together. He's just... forthright."

Accepting the drink, Sophia retreated to a corner sofa. A sudden cheer erupted across the lawn.

On the emerald golf course, Ethan swung his club with precision. His white polo stretched across broad shoulders, rolled sleeves revealing corded forearms.

The ball arced through the sky and dropped cleanly into the hole.

She was still watching when warm breath brushed her ear. "Enjoying the game, Ms. Lowell?"

Sophia jerked upright, spilling juice down her skirt. "I wouldn't know a nine-iron from a putter, Mr. Valrose."

"Let's fix that." Dominic Valrose gripped her wrist before she could protest.

Ethan turned just as she stumbled forward. His club struck the turf with a thud.

"Dominic."

Two syllables made the other man release her instantly. Dominic backpedaled with an awkward laugh. "Your swing's impeccable, Roscente. Why not give the lady a lesson?"

Sophia opened her mouth, but Ethan was already before her. The scent of fresh grass clung to his fingers as he tilted her chin up.

"Interested?"

Her breath caught. In his dark eyes, she saw her own flustered reflection staring back.
###Chapter 292

"Don't want to learn?" Ethan Roscente arched an eyebrow, twirling the cue between his slender fingers. "You can't just sit idle while you're with me."

He crooked a finger at her. "Come here."

Sophia Lowell dragged her feet forward.

"Miss Lowell was completely mesmerized watching Mr. Roscente play earlier," Dominic Valrose interjected. "She must admire his skills. You should teach her properly."

Sophia nearly gritted her teeth to dust.

Damn Dominic!

When she met Ethan's amused gaze, her mind went blank.

"Miss Lowell admires me?" His deep voice rumbled close to her ear.

"Appreciates," she corrected, turning her face away.

"Same difference." Ethan shoved the cue into her hands and pulled her flush against him. "I'll teach you personally."

"How?"

"Like this."

His large hand settled on her waist.

Sophia stiffened.

Ethan stood behind her now, arms encircling her to adjust her stance. His scorching chest pressed against her back, breath ghosting over her ear.

"Bend forward. Lower your center of gravity."

Her entire body burned. His heat seeped through their clothes, his exhales stirring the hairs at her nape—each teasing strand making her shiver.

This position was too intimate!

Her heartbeat threatened to crack her ribs.

"Relax." Ethan's palm pressed lightly against her tense muscles. "Don't lock up like this."

"Stop touching me—" Her voice trembled.

"Can't handle it?" He chuckled darkly. "We've done much more than this."

Sophia's ears burned crimson.

She forced herself to focus. Ethan guided her hands through the swing. The white ball arced perfectly into the pocket.

"It's in!" Her eyes widened with delight.

Applause rippled around them.

"Feel accomplished?" Ethan still caged her, eyes crinkling.

"Yes!" She nodded vigorously.

He stepped back. "Now try alone."

Sophia inhaled deeply and assumed the stance he'd taught. Leaning forward, legs slightly parted, the curve of her backside hinted beneath the sportswear.
###Chapter 293

The golf club traced a graceful arc in Sophia's hands. As she bent forward, the taut line of her waist accentuated the alluring curve of her hips beneath her athletic pants.

Ethan Roscente stood behind her, close enough to catch the scent of roses in her hair.

His Adam's apple bobbed slightly as his gaze swept over her slender waist. He took half a step back, his expression unreadable.

"In!" Sophia spun around with a cheer, her eyes sparkling with triumph. She looked up at Ethan like a kitten waiting for treats.

Amusement flickered in Ethan's dark eyes as he brushed a fingertip over her damp temple. "Not bad," he murmured, his voice rough. "Two more years of practice, and you might catch up to me."

"Obviously." Sophia lifted her chin proudly. "I'm—"

"Just like me." Ethan cut her off.

Sophia's eyes narrowed playfully. She raised her club threateningly. "Mr. Roscente, do you enjoy taking advantage of me?"

"Last night, who was the one who—" Ethan began, but her glare made him chuckle. The way her ears turned pink in the sunlight reminded him of how she'd gasped his name, soft and breathless beneath him.

"Lucky man." Dominic Valrose approached with a champagne flute, his gaze lingering on Sophia. "Miss Lowell would look even more stunning playing in a miniskirt."

Ethan's expression turned glacial. The glass in his hand creaked ominously. "Mr. Valrose," he said, his voice laced with frost. "Mind your eyes."

Dominic laughed awkwardly, raising his hands. "Just a joke. But..." He lowered his voice. "If Miss Valentine finds out you're here with your secretary..."

"The Valentines?" Ethan scoffed. "Beneath my concern."

A burst of applause erupted in the distance. Sophia's final shot landed perfectly in the hole. She turned, waving in the sunlight, her hair whipping around her like a scene from a painting.

"Miss Lowell!" A young man jogged toward her. "How about we make things interesting?" He pointed at the scoreboard. "Loser removes an article of clothing."

Ethan's eyes darkened. He slammed his glass onto a passing waiter's tray.
###Chapter 294

"What kind of game?" Sophia's fingers tightened around her golf club as she eyed Dominic warily.

Kevin flashed a knowing smile. "Just a friendly mixed doubles match. My partner and I will team up against Ethan and you, while Dominic pairs with Lydia."

Sophia instinctively took half a step back. "I'm not good enough..."

Her peripheral vision caught Ethan approaching. The black athletic wear accentuated his broad shoulders and long legs.

"Afraid you'll embarrass me?" Ethan's hand suddenly settled on her waist, his thumb pressing precisely against her sore spot.

Sophia froze.

The warmth of his palm seeped through the thin fabric, the perfect pressure nearly drawing a moan from her lips.

"I..." Her ears burned. "I'll drag you down."

Ethan studied her with dark eyes. "I've got you."

Those three words steadied her. Biting her lip, Sophia nodded, missing the calculating gleam in Kevin's eyes.

Dominic interjected smoothly, "The losing team must grant the winners one request—within legal bounds, of course." His gaze swept meaningfully across the group.

Sophia botched the first swing.

When the ball rolled past the hole, she wanted to vanish into the ground.

"Relax." Ethan's voice came from behind her. "Pretend they're watching monkeys perform."

Sophia burst out laughing. Her second swing landed perfectly. She turned excitedly—only to meet Ethan's usual icy expression.

By the decisive third round, her palms were slick with sweat.

"Don't tense up." Ethan suddenly leaned close, his breath brushing her earlobe. "I'll take the blame if we lose."

Her hands jerked. The ball soared straight into the sand trap.

"Sorry!" She stomped her foot in frustration.

Ethan glanced at the adjacent course—where Kevin's team had made an even worse mistake.

When the final scores lit up, Dominic's team won by a narrow margin. Lydia winked at Sophia while Kevin's partner hurled her club in anger.

"A deal's a deal." Dominic removed his gloves leisurely. "My request is..."

His eyes traveled between Sophia and Ethan.
###Chapter 295

Dominic Valrose stroked his chin, pretending to ponder deeply.

He had wanted to make Sophia Lowell the prize, but Ethan Roscente's warning glare kept him in check. Better to do a favor and enjoy the show.

"How about a French kiss?" He smirked, holding up two fingers. "Two minutes."

Sophia's ears burned instantly.

"That's too much," she protested, biting her lip.

Dominic shrugged. "House rules." His gaze shifted to Ethan. "Unless Mr. Roscente objects."

Sophia looked at the man beside her with hopeful eyes.

Ethan remained impassive. "A bet's a bet."

Sophia's eyes widened.

She suspected these two had conspired against her.

Nearby, another man was already locked in a passionate embrace with his date, the crowd counting down and cheering.

Mortified, Sophia wanted to flee, but she couldn't lose face in front of everyone.

Suddenly, an arm tightened around her waist.

Ethan pulled her firmly against him.

"You—" Her protest was cut off as his lips captured hers.

His scent overwhelmed her.

"Open," he commanded softly.

Sophia clenched her teeth stubbornly.

Ethan pinched her waist, and she gasped in surprise—giving him the opening he needed to deepen the kiss.

It was more intense than any they'd shared before.

Dizzy, Sophia fisted his shirt unconsciously.

"Breathe," he murmured against her lips.

She barely caught her breath before he pulled her back under.

Ethan lifted her slightly, eliminating the need to strain her neck. The new angle made the kiss even more lingering.

Sophia melted into it.

Only when she squirmed slightly did he finally release her.

Her flushed cheeks and dazed expression made Ethan lean in for one last peck.

"Five minutes! Impressive, Mr. Roscente!"

Someone's exclamation snapped Sophia back to reality.

She glared at Ethan, indignant.

He merely licked his lips, unsatisfied.
###Chapter 296

Ethan Roscente's thumb pressed heavily against her damp lips, his dark eyes swirling with turbulent emotions.

"Too sweet," he murmured, his voice rough with desire.

Sophia Lowell's ears burned crimson.

"W-what nonsense!" She pushed him away in a fluster, her fingertips scorching hot.

Ethan chuckled lowly, tilting his head back to drain his glass in one gulp.

As his Adam's apple bobbed, his gaze remained fixed on her flushed earlobe.

Nearby, Dominic Valrose narrowed his eyes.

He watched Sophia's hurried retreat, tongue pressing against his back teeth.

Even fleeing in panic, the woman was irresistibly alluring.

By the poolside, the night breeze carried a slight chill.

Sophia slapped her burning cheeks forcefully.

"Bastard..." she muttered under her breath, yet couldn't stop reliving that searing kiss.

The water reflected shimmering lights.

Lost in thought, she failed to notice the dark figure approaching from behind.

"Ah—"

Her scream tore through the air as an icy hand clamped around her ankle.

Freezing water engulfed her instantly.

She thrashed wildly, but the iron grip dragged her deeper.

Bubbles escaped her lips.

As her vision blurred, a shadowy figure sliced through the water toward her.

"Hel..."

The suffocating burn of inhaled water turned everything black.

Splash!

Strong arms hauled her to the surface.

Gasping and coughing, she collapsed against the pool's edge.

"Sophia!"

Sebastian Valdemar's frantic voice reached her ears.

Blinking water from her eyes, an inexplicable disappointment settled in her chest.

Not him...

The murmuring crowd suddenly erupted into chaos.

Heavy footsteps shattered the moonlit tranquility of the water.
###Chapter 297

Ethan Roscente stood at the end of the hallway, his cold expression freezing the moment he saw Sophia Lowell nestled in Sebastian Valdemar's arms. He strode forward with purposeful steps, each one radiating suffocating intensity.

Sophia was drenched, her wet hair clinging to her pale cheeks. She trembled slightly, like a frightened fawn. Ethan knelt on one knee, brushing the damp strands from her forehead with his long fingers.

"Mr. Roscente..." Her voice shook.

A flicker of pain flashed in his eyes. The radiant rose from earlier now resembled a bud battered by a storm. He quickly assessed her condition, and only when he confirmed she had merely swallowed water did the tension in his jaw ease slightly.

Suddenly, Sophia threw herself into his arms, her tears soaking his shirt. Ethan stiffened for a moment before tightening his hold, shielding her completely.

"Don't be afraid," he murmured, his deep voice steady as his palm gently stroked her back.

Sebastian stood nearby, watching Sophia let her guard down completely in Ethan's embrace. He wiped the water from his face with a bitter smile, his chest heavy as if weighed down by a stone.

Ethan lifted Sophia into his arms. As he turned, his icy gaze swept over Sebastian. "Thanks."

"No need," Sebastian replied, shaking his head. "I did it willingly."

Their eyes locked in a silent clash, sparks flying between them. In the end, Ethan carried Sophia away, his retreating figure exuding undeniable possessiveness.

In the bedroom, Ethan carefully laid Sophia on the bed. He wrapped her shivering body in a blanket and pressed her cold hands against his warm chest.

"The doctor will be here soon," he said, his tone uncharacteristically gentle.

Sophia leaned against him, listening to the steady rhythm of his heartbeat. This version of Ethan was so tender it made her steal a glance at him.

His phone vibrated abruptly. After reading the message, his expression darkened instantly. He met her questioning gaze with a cold smirk. "Touched?"

She was about to nod when his voice turned sharp. "First, explain why my secretary ended up in the water with another man."

Her words caught in her throat.

Ethan rose, looking down at her with an unreadable expression. "We'll talk properly once your body temperature stabilizes."

The sound of the door closing made Sophia shiver. She pulled the blanket tighter around herself, her emotions in turmoil.

The hot shower washed away the chill from her skin but not the confusion in her heart. Just as she lost herself in thought, a knock sounded at the door.

"Who is it?" she asked warily.
###Chapter 298

Sophia's heart clenched when she heard the doctor's knock.

Her hand instinctively flew to her abdomen.

"Miss Lowell, I was sent by Mr. Valdemar," the doctor explained gently.

Sophia froze.

Sebastian Valdemar?

She immediately reached for the landline.

"Sebastian?"

"The doctor is my arrangement," his calm voice came through the receiver. "Let him examine you."

Her eyes grew moist.

After a thorough checkup, the doctor smiled. "The baby is perfectly healthy."

"Really?" Her voice trembled.

"Strong heartbeat. However..." He hesitated. "You've suffered shock. Prenatal vitamins are necessary."

A weight lifted from her shoulders.

Next door, smoke curled through the suite.

Zachary Evans bowed his head. "The surveillance blind spot caught nothing suspicious."

Ethan Roscente crushed his cigarette.

"Keep digging."

His phone vibrated. A glance at the screen.

"The old master—"

"Leave it." Ethan stood abruptly.

In the hallway, he intercepted the doctor.

"How is she?"

"Minor water inhalation. The medication will suffice."

Ethan's gaze darkened.

When he entered, Sophia sat staring blankly at her water glass.

"Still unwell?" His voice was rough.

She shook her head.

He settled beside her, thumb grazing her pale lips.

"My oversight."

She flinched away.

"An accident."

Rain pattered against the windows.

Ethan studied her profile before speaking:

"It wasn't."
###Chapter 299

"Thank you, doctor."

Zachary Evans watched the physician leave, his brow slightly furrowed.

Ethan Roscente noticed his unease. "Problem?"

"Nothing." Zachary shook his head, though privately puzzled. He distinctly remembered requesting a female doctor.

Ethan pushed open the door to Sophia Lowell's room.

The sedative had taken effect, leaving Sophia in deep slumber. He sat by the bed, brushing stray hairs from her forehead with slender fingers. Her pallor tightened his chest.

"Arrange security for her," he murmured.

"Understood."

Dreams surged like tidal waves. Sophia found herself dragged into dark waters, suffocation clawing at her lungs. She jolted awake, gasping.

"Nightmare?"

Ethan's voice startled her. She turned to meet those fathomless eyes and nodded shakily. "Someone was pulling me underwater again."

His fingers twitched. Shadows darkened his gaze. He gripped her chin, voice turning icy. "Your own fault. I told you to stay with me, but you insisted on seeing Theodore."

She slapped his hand away. "Maybe it's your people who want me dead!"

"Isabella?" Ethan frowned, pulling out a cigarette before tossing it in the trash. "Not her."

"Who else?" Sophia sneered. "This isn't the first time you've protected her."

"I said it wasn't her." His tone dropped dangerously as he seized her chin again.

She turned her face away, shutting him out.

Suddenly, Ethan hauled her onto his lap, stroking her hair. "Enough. Let's eat."

"Go find your precious Isabella!" She struggled to escape.

"Jealous?"

"I put vinegar in noodles, not men!" Her traitorous stomach growled mid-sentence.

Ethan smirked. "Kitchen closes at ten. It's 8:30 now. Starve all night if you prefer."

Sophia: "..."
###Chapter 300

Sophia's stomach growled traitorously.

She bit her lip, wanting to refuse Ethan's invitation with dignity, but the gnawing emptiness forced her to relent.

"Let's go," she muttered.

The dim sum restaurant glowed with warm amber light. Sophia ordered century egg porridge, garlic spareribs, rice noodle rolls, goji berry chicken soup, and steamed chicken feet in one breath.

Ethan arched an eyebrow. "Didn't the hot springs water fill you up?"

"That was mineral water!" Sophia nearly slammed the table, dragging all the dishes toward herself. "These are mine."

Unhurried, Ethan added a few more items to their order.

Sophia stared at the untouched stuffed chicken wings on his plate, swallowing hard.

"Aren't... you eating that?"

"It's for the dog." He didn't look up.

Sophia bristled instantly. "Who are you calling a dog?"

The man chuckled, pushing the plate toward her. "Eat. Don't waste it."

"Even dogs have better taste than you." She snatched it through gritted teeth.

Outside, lightning split the sky.

Rain poured down in sheets, hammering against the windows.

"Terrible weather," Sophia frowned.

Ethan wiped his hands leisurely. "Perhaps the heavens disapprove of your wickedness."

"How is this my fault?"

"Wasting food when so many go hungry."

Sophia nearly flipped the table in rage.

The storm trapped them at the hot springs resort for the night.

Somehow, Ethan produced a black umbrella.

The wind howled, nearly tearing the canopy apart. Suddenly, his arm wrapped around Sophia's shoulders, pulling her close.

"I can walk by myself," she protested.

"At your pace, we'll never get there."

Rain soaked through Ethan's shirt, yet he tilted the umbrella toward her.

Sophia glanced up discreetly, catching the sharp line of his jaw.

Their silhouettes blurred into the downpour.
###Chapter 301

The rain poured down in torrents, fat droplets stinging against exposed skin. Ethan Roscente held Sophia Lowell tightly against him as they dashed into the hotel lobby, both drenched and disheveled.

The lobby overflowed with tourists seeking shelter, their complaints rising in a discordant chorus. Water dripped from Sophia's hair as she glanced sideways at Ethan—half his suit was soaked through, clinging to his frame. Something twisted in her chest.

"Good thing we didn't check out," she muttered, fishing the keycard from her pocket.

The moment the door unlocked, Ethan strode in ahead of her.

"This is my room!" Sophia's eyes widened.

"I know." He shrugged off his sodden jacket and tossed it onto the sofa.

She stamped her foot. "What if someone sees you here?"

"Weren’t you the one kissing me on the beach without a care?" His brow arched, amusement glinting in his eyes.

Her retort died on her lips.

"You take the sofa," she gritted out, drawing a firm line.

Ethan stepped closer, his damp shirt plastered to the hard planes of his chest. "You really think that thing can fit me?"

Sophia instinctively retreated until her back hit the cold wall. Only then did she notice the absurdly small loveseat.

"Then... go back to your own room."

"Canceled." He retrieved the hair dryer from the bathroom, his tone casual. "Come here."

Warm air gusted over her damp clothes, and she squirmed. "I can do it myself."

His hand settled on her shoulder, firm. "Stay still." His fingers brushed the nape of her neck—just a fleeting touch—but it sent a shiver down her spine.

Outside, thunder growled, rain hammering against the windows. The room hummed with the dryer’s drone and the quiet rhythm of their breaths.

Sophia stared at the water stains on the carpet. This sudden storm mirrored whatever undefined thing lay between them—unpredictable, overwhelming.

"What’s on your mind?" Ethan switched off the dryer, plunging them into abrupt silence.

"Nothing." She averted her gaze. "It’s just... this feels strange."

A low chuckle escaped him as he pressed the dryer into her hands. "Your turn." He undid two buttons, revealing droplets still glistening along his collarbone.

Sophia’s fingers trembled. A simple task—drying clothes—yet it carried the weight of something far more dangerous.
###Chapter 302

Ethan's hand shifted slightly, evading her reaching fingertips.

"Acting like a child," his deep voice held a trace of exasperation.

Sophia froze, not daring to move.

The chiffon blouse was already sheer, now completely soaked at the shoulder. It could practically be wrung out.

This was with Ethan shielding her. Without his protection, the entire top would've been ruined.

Warm air from the hair dryer swept over the fabric, drying it quickly. But her damp bra still clung uncomfortably to her skin.

She pressed her lips together, already planning to secretly use the dryer again after her shower.

"Overthinking again?" His voice suddenly sounded by her ear.

Before she could react, she felt a release at her back.

Click—

The bra clasp came undone effortlessly.

"You—!" She frantically moved to cover herself, cheeks burning.

Ethan leisurely switched off the dryer. "Uncomfortable in wet clothes?"

"I can handle it myself..."

Helping dry her undergarments? How was this different from washing them for her?

His brow arched. "Shy?"

She kept her head down, the tips of her ears crimson.

"You weren't this reserved when I washed them for you before," he chuckled darkly.

Memories surfaced—each time she suffered menstrual cramps, he'd personally handwash her intimates. His head bent, slender fingers moving through soap suds with the care reserved for treasured artifacts.

"That was different..."

"How?" He stepped closer abruptly, eyes darkening. "Did you change, or did I?"

She bit her lip, retreating—only for his hand to clamp on her shoulder.

Through the thin chiffon, he could trace the outline of her straps with perfect clarity.

"Take it off yourself, or shall I help?" His voice dropped to a rough whisper.

"You're being unreasonable—"

In her struggle, a button popped free.

The blouse slipped off one shoulder, revealing pearlescent skin. The black strap accentuated her delicate collarbones like a masterfully sculpted artwork.

Ethan's Adam's apple bobbed.

Familiar recollections surged—in moments of passion, he'd always marked that flawless expanse. Too exquisite not to claim.
###Chapter 303

Ethan's Adam's apple bobbed as he turned away, his voice icy. "Hurry up, or I'll think you're trying to seduce me."

Sophia's cheeks burned. She wanted nothing more than to kick this narcissist across the room.

His fingers tightened around her wrist in silent warning.

Defiant, she yanked off her lace bra and flung it at his face. "Go dry your hair!"

Before he could react, she darted into the bathroom like a startled rabbit.

To her surprise, silence greeted her from the other side.

Ethan plucked the delicate garment from his face, fingertips tracing the intricate embroidery. His gaze darkened as he glanced toward the bathroom before switching the hair dryer back on.

Morning sunlight streamed through the curtains when Sophia awoke to an empty bed. For once, Ethan hadn't disturbed her—a rare chance to sleep in.

Wrapped in blankets, she scrolled through her phone. Vivian Ashcroft dominated every trending topic.

#VivianTheWildBeauty
#JasonVivianCoupleGoals
#VivianRedefinesSanity
#VivianSlaysTheFakeInnocent
#QueenVivian

The barrage of hashtags made Sophia's head spin.

Each click revealed last night's explosive reality show episode where Vivian had unleashed her unfiltered self—obliterating production tricks and Isabella Valentine's manipulative antics with savage wit.

Audiences ate it up. Ratings skyrocketed, and the director scrambled to feature Vivian more. The wilder she acted, the more fans adored her.

"Damn, Viv!" Sophia dialed her friend immediately. "You crushed it!"

"Finally my big break!" Vivian's triumphant laugh crackled through the speaker. "Should've stopped playing nice years ago! My inbox is flooded—all thanks to you!"

Watching sunlight dance across the garden, Sophia smiled. Her best friend had weathered the storm.

"Speaking of storms," Vivian dropped her voice, "that Roscente bastard behaving? Use the taser I gave you if—"

Sophia swallowed hard, eyeing the confiscation notice for said taser. "All good here."

After hanging up, she padded barefoot to the floor-to-ceiling windows. Last night's storm had scrubbed the sky clean. Sunbeams pierced the clouds, gilding tulips swaying in the breeze.

Stretching, Sophia inhaled the floral-scented air.
###Chapter 304

Ethan Roscente had several premium projects that perfectly matched Vivian Ashcroft's current status. Initially, he worried these opportunities might be too risky for someone who had just risen to fame. But after seeing Vivian skyrocket to stardom through the reality show, he changed his mind.

His phone buzzed on the nightstand.

A message from Ethan popped up: "Awake?"

Sophia Lowell rubbed her eyes and replied, "Just woke up."

"Get ready. Let's meet."

"Where?"

He sent the location of a café. Sophia responded with an OK emoji and headed to the bathroom.

Fifteen minutes later, she pushed open the glass door of the café.

To her surprise, Ethan hadn’t arrived yet. Instead, she ran into Sebastian Valdemar.

"Sebastian?" Sophia blinked in surprise at the man walking in.

He seemed equally startled, his lips curving into a gentle smile. "Breakfast hours at the hotel were over. I have a meeting soon, so I stopped by for coffee."

Sophia glanced at the freshly served juice and sandwich on her table. Since Ethan wasn’t here yet, this was the perfect chance to thank Sebastian for saving her yesterday.

"Care to join me for breakfast?"

"Don’t mind if I do." Sebastian took the seat across from her.

Just as the waiter set down his coffee, a figure suddenly rushed over. Scalding liquid flew toward Sophia’s face.

"Watch out!"

Sebastian shot to his feet, yanking her behind him. The coffee splashed across his pristine white shirt, a few burning droplets landing on the back of Sophia’s hand.

"Did it burn you?" He urgently inspected her hand.

"Don’t touch her!" Tiffany Roscente slapped their hands apart, her face twisted with fury. "Sophia, you shameless bitch!"

Sophia’s gaze turned icy. "Seek professional help if you’re unwell."

Tiffany trembled with rage as she watched Sebastian shield Sophia. "First, you seduce my brother. Now you’re after Sebastian? Are you that desperate for men?"

"Watch your mouth," Sophia snapped.

"Hit a nerve?" Tiffany shrieked hysterically. "You’re nothing but a cheap, promiscuous—"
###Chapter 305

"Enough!"

Sebastian Valdemar's voice cut through the air like ice.

"Professor Valdemar, you're scolding me?"

Tiffany Roscente's eyes instantly welled up with tears. She had never seen Sebastian lose his composure like this. The usually gentle man had now snapped at her twice—all because of Sophia Lowell.

"How dare you defend her! She seduced my uncle—"

"Silence."

Sebastian's brows furrowed, his gaze frosty.

Tiffany trembled, then suddenly turned on Sophia. "It's you! You must have bewitched Professor Valdemar! Sophia, why don't you just die? A worthless bitch like you deserves to be torn apart—just like your dead aunt. And any child she might have—"

Splash!

A glass of juice hit her square in the face.

Tiffany staggered back, her meticulously applied makeup now a ruined mess.

"Ah! Sophia, you—"

"One more word, and next time it'll be boiling water." Sophia's eyes blazed.

For a moment, Tiffany froze. Then she burst into hysterical laughter. "Go ahead! Do it! I'll make sure you rot in prison! Professor Valdemar is just another fool you've tricked! Two years ago, you crawled into my uncle's bed—playing the innocent by day, acting like a whore by night—"

Crack!

A sharp slap landed across her cheek.

Every eye in the café turned toward them.

Clutching her stinging face, Tiffany remembered the humiliation of kneeling in the Ancestral Hall. Rage boiled over. She dropped all pretense and shrieked, "Who are you pretending to be? You're nothing but my uncle's plaything! When Isabella Valentine returns, you won’t even be fit to polish her shoes!"

She raised her hand to strike back.

Sebastian swiftly pulled Sophia behind him, gripping Tiffany's wrist. "That's enough!"

"I'm the crazy one?" Tiffany's tears spilled over. "She's the homewrecker sleeping with my uncle, and you protect her?"

"I seduced him?"

Sophia let out a cold laugh. "Is that the poison Isabella fed you? She’s not even here to fight her own battles, yet you bark like a trained dog. Take my advice—get some sun. Maybe it’ll clear your head."

"Liar!" Tiffany's face twisted. "Isabella and my uncle are getting married! And you still shamelessly follow him on business trips, flaunting yourself! If Grandfather knew—"

Her words grew venomous. "What are you, anyway? Just a stray dog the Roscentes took in! You’re not even fit to lick Isabella’s shoes! In the old days, trash like you wouldn’t even qualify as a concubine!"

Sophia's face drained of color, her nails digging deep into her palms.
###Chapter 306

Tiffany Roscente's words cut through Sophia Lowell like a razor-sharp blade, piercing her heart with brutal precision. A sharp pain lanced through her, yet she found no words to refute them.

The term "bed warmer" echoed relentlessly in her mind.

Her fists clenched, nails digging deep into her palms.

"Tiffany!" Sebastian Valdemar's voice rose sharply, his usually gentle face now frosty with anger. "Mind your language."

He turned to Sophia, his eyes filled with remorse. "This is my fault. I'll handle it."

Sophia forced a brittle smile. "She's not wrong."

Her gaze lifted to meet Tiffany's haughty stare. The vulnerability in her eyes vanished in an instant, replaced by icy derision.

"If you're going to say it like that, then I won't pretend to be the good girl anymore." Her lips curled in disdain. "Instead of pointing fingers at me, why don't you go talk some sense into your clingy uncle?"

"Isabella Valentine might treasure him, but to me, he's just a nuisance. If she can take him away, I'd be grateful."

Tiffany's face paled, but her eyes suddenly shifted past Sophia, locking onto something behind her.

"U-Uncle..."

Sophia's pulse stuttered. Slowly, she turned.

Ethan Roscente stood at the doorway, a paper bag in hand, his handsome face carved from ice. His gaze flickered over Sebastian's grip on Sophia's wrist, a dangerous glint flashing in his eyes.

"Seems I'm interrupting." His voice was frigid. "I had no idea my personal life was such fascinating gossip."

Tiffany trembled, unable to meet his eyes.

Sophia held his stare, her lips pressed into a stubborn line. The explanation on her tongue dissolved before she could voice it.

"Was I wrong?" Her voice was eerily calm as she met his gaze head-on.

Ethan's eyes darkened, the air around him turning glacial. He stepped forward, each footfall like a hammer against her nerves.

"Dead wrong." His laugh was devoid of warmth. "Clearly, I've been too lenient with you."

The paper bag hit the table with a heavy thud.

Sebastian instinctively moved to shield Sophia. "Mr. Roscente, let's discuss this rationally."

Ethan's gaze was a blade. "Professor Valdemar, this is a family matter."

The atmosphere froze, thick with tension. Everyone nearby held their breath.

Sophia suddenly laughed, the sound brittle. "Family? Don't make me laugh." She pushed Sebastian's hand away. "What family do we have?"

The words struck Ethan like a dagger. His pupils constricted, the cold in his expression deepening.

"Fine." The words were ground out between his teeth. "Sophia, you're really something."

Tiffany took two cautious steps back. She'd never seen her uncle look so terrifying.

But Sophia seemed oblivious to the danger, fanning the flames. "If you're feeling wronged, Mr. Roscente, why don't you go complain to your fiancée?"

"Enough!" Ethan seized her wrist, his grip punishing. "We're talking. Alone."

Sebastian moved to intervene, but a single glare from Ethan rooted him in place.

"Professor," Ethan's voice was dangerously low. "Stay out of this."

Sophia struggled futilely against his hold. Staring up at his impossibly close face, she suddenly smiled. "What's this? A public display of forced possession?"

Ethan's eyes darkened. Without another word, he swept her into his arms and strode out, leaving stunned silence in his wake.
###Chapter 307

"I wouldn't dare say you're wrong. Miss Sophia Lowell is always right." Ethan Roscente's lips curled into a mocking smirk. "Too bad. Even if you think I'm worthless, this weed isn't letting go of you."

He suddenly leaned in, his warm breath brushing her ear. "You're the one who keeps pulling me back. Don't even think about shaking me off—not in this lifetime."

The customers in the café, who had been whispering about Sophia, now wore knowing smiles.

Sophia: "..."

Tiffany Roscente had been hiding in the corner like a frightened quail, but she suddenly jumped up. "Uncle! She just humiliated you!"

"None of your business." Ethan's gaze turned icy. "Seems like last time wasn't enough of a lesson."

He snapped his fingers, and Zachary Evans appeared instantly.

"Take her back and teach her some manners." Ethan's voice was frigid. "If she can't learn, don't let her out."

Tiffany paled, remembering the horror of being locked in the basement last time. She screamed and begged, but Zachary dragged her away without hesitation.

Ethan checked his watch and crooked a finger at Sophia. "Come here."

Sebastian Valdemar immediately stepped between them. "Mr. Roscente, my junior still has—"

"Get lost." Ethan's glare was sharp as a blade. "Don't interfere."

Sophia pushed Sebastian aside, her expression cold. "My senior and I still have things to discuss."

Ethan's eyes darkened. He let out a cold laugh. "Fine, Sophia. You’ve got spine."

Outside the café, Zachary had just sent Tiffany away when he saw his boss storm out, radiating fury.

"Mr. Roscente, the breakfast—" Zachary hurried after him, holding a paper bag.

"Throw it away." Ethan didn’t even look back. "I'd rather feed it to dogs than give it to her!"

Fuming, he suddenly turned, snatched the bag, and hurled it into the trash bin. "Ungrateful wretch!"

Inside, Sebastian looked at Sophia with concern. "Are you okay?"

"What’s there to worry about?" Sophia shrugged. "Tiffany causing trouble isn’t new."

"It's my fault for dragging you into this..."

"Not your problem." She checked the time. "I was going to treat you to breakfast, but I guess it’ll have to wait."

Her gaze drifted to the window, where Ethan’s furious retreating figure was disappearing. A faint smile tugged at her lips.
###Chapter 308

Sophia Lowell and Sebastian Valdemar were deep in conversation at the café when her phone buzzed. She glanced at the screen—Ethan Roscente was calling.

"Excuse me for a moment." She offered Sebastian an apologetic smile.

Ethan's icy voice came through the line. "Where are you?"

"The café," she answered truthfully.

"Be back in ten minutes." The call ended abruptly.

When Sophia returned to the hotel, the door had barely cracked open before she was yanked inside.

Ethan pinned her against the wall, his gaze dark. "Having fun with Sebastian?"

"We were just catching up as friends." She tried to pull free.

He let out a cold laugh and dragged her into the bathroom. Freezing water sprayed over her wrists as he squeezed too much soap onto his hands, scrubbing where Sebastian had touched her with rough strokes.

"That hurts!" Sophia gasped.

Ethan ignored her until her skin turned red. Only then did he release her.

"What's wrong with you?" She rubbed her sore wrists.

He loomed over her. "Remember—you're mine." With that, he stormed out, slamming the door behind him.

In the hallway, Zachary Evans hesitated with a paper bag in his arms.

"Mr. Roscente, these pastries—"

"Throw them away." Ethan didn't look back.

Zachary sighed. "You waited in line for two hours..."

"I said toss them!" Ethan whirled around. "Wait. Deliver them to her. Don't mention me."

When Sophia opened the door, Zachary forced a smile. "Miss Lowell, complimentary afternoon tea from the hotel."

She accepted the bag. Inside were still-warm dim sum. The receipt on top clearly read: "Wait Time: 2 hours 15 minutes."

Her phone lit up with a flight confirmation from her assistant. Sophia stared at the pastries, her finger hovering over "Cancel Reservation" before finally tapping it.

At dusk, she stood by the window, watching Ethan and Dominic Valrose walk away below. A faint smile tugged at her lips.
###Chapter 309

Sophia had just stepped out of the hotel when her phone rang abruptly.

The screen displayed an unfamiliar local Hong Kong number.

Her finger hovered over the decline button, but she inexplicably swiped to answer.

"Ms. Lowell?"

Dominic Valrose's signature deep voice came through the line.

Her brow furrowed slightly. "Mr. Valrose, is something the matter?"

"I heard about your unfortunate incident yesterday. I was tied up with contract negotiations and didn’t get the chance to check on you." His tone carried just the right amount of concern. "Are you feeling better now?"

"Thank you for asking. I’m fine."

"Good." He chuckled lightly. "If anything happened to you under my watch, I wouldn’t know how to explain it to Mr. Roscente."

Sophia pressed her lips together in silence.

"By the way," Dominic shifted the topic smoothly, "would you be available to pick up Mr. Roscente?"

Her breath hitched. "What’s wrong with Ethan?"

"After signing the contract, everyone celebrated a bit too enthusiastically." He paused. "Mr. Roscente kept calling your name. I assumed he’d prefer you to come get him."

"Where’s Zachary?"

"Sent away on an errand by Mr. Roscente." Dominic sighed. "I’ll send you the address. Just take the shuttle. It’s crowded here, and I’d hate for anything to happen to him."

The call ended abruptly.

A location pin popped up immediately—a private villa estate.

Sophia stared at her phone, her fingers absently tracing the edges.

Why would a business dinner be held at a villa?

She dialed Zachary’s number.

"You’re not with Ethan?"

"I’m back at the hotel collecting luggage." His voice was harried. "Mr. Roscente said we’d fly out directly from the Hot Springs Resort tomorrow."

"Dominic says he’s drunk."

"Those people are relentless with the drinks." Zachary exhaled. "Sorry to trouble you, Ms. Lowell."

After hanging up, Sophia flagged down a shuttle.

The villa was brightly lit.

Dominic was chatting with someone when he spotted her arrival. He tilted his chin toward the second floor.

"Mr. Roscente’s fiancée has been here for a while." His tone was suggestive. "You know how young couples are."

The man beside him smirked. "What else would an engaged couple do alone?"

Sophia’s fingertips turned cold.

"You didn’t know?" Dominic feigned surprise. "Ms. Valentine arrived this morning with Mr. Roscente’s niece. She’s been by his side all afternoon—a perfect match."

He lowered his voice. "Rumor has it Ms. Valentine was exhausted, so Mr. Roscente had Zachary escort her to rest. But when she heard he was drunk, she rushed back to take care of him."

Sophia stood rooted in place, the lights stretching her shadow long across the ground.
###Chapter 310

Sophia Lowell watched the scene before her with icy detachment, her lips curling into a mocking smile.

No wonder Ethan Roscente had suddenly dismissed her that afternoon.

So Isabella Valentine had arrived.

She turned to leave, only to find Dominic Valrose blocking her path.

"Don't rush off, Miss Lowell." His smile was knowing. "Since Mr. Roscente is busy with his fiancée, perhaps I could keep you company?"

Sophia lifted her gaze, sharp as a blade.

"Did you summon me here just to witness this spectacle, Mr. Valrose?"

She saw right through his game.

Unfazed, he stepped closer.

"You're clever, Miss Lowell. Why not come work for me?" His voice dropped to a whisper. "I'll double whatever Ethan offers."

Sophia retreated half a step, disgust flashing in her eyes.

"You flatter me."

"Three million." He held up three fingers. "That's my offer."

A soft laugh escaped her lips.

"Three hundred million." Her red lips parted. "That's Mr. Roscente's price."

Dominic's face darkened instantly.

"You're mocking me?"

As he bristled, footsteps echoed from the staircase.

Ethan descended leisurely, Isabella trailing behind him.

The man's slender fingers were fastening his cufflinks with deliberate slowness.

Sophia noticed he'd changed shirts.

A wave of nausea churned in her stomach.

Ethan's gaze landed on her, then flicked to Dominic.

The air froze.

"Weren't you negotiating a price, Mr. Valrose?" Sophia's mocking eyes turned to him. "The decision-maker has arrived."

Dominic's face turned ashen as he slunk away.

Sophia stood bathed in the light, the hem of her dress swaying gracefully.
###Chapter 311

The dress had appeared silently at her bedside that morning, nestled in an exquisite paper bag with matching lingerie folded neatly inside. Every measurement was precise. Sophia didn't need to guess who was behind this.

Though her rain-soaked clothes from last night had been dried, the clammy discomfort still clung to her skin. This dress arrived just in time to rescue her from that lingering unease.

Its deceptively simple cut concealed meticulous craftsmanship, demanding a figure of near-perfect proportions. Yet on Sophia, it fit as though tailored specifically for her.

The fitted skirt accentuated her slender waist and graceful hips, while the hem revealed legs that were pale and impossibly long. Her upswept hair exposed the delicate curve of her neck, transforming her into an elegant swan.

Eyes throughout the ballroom began gravitating toward her. The weight of those blatant stares felt like being devoured alive.

"Mr. Roscente has exquisite taste," someone murmured. "A dignified fiancée and such an alluring secretary."

"If she were mine, I'd have—"

"Wake up. That's Ethan Roscente's woman."

"Word is Mr. Valrose already struck a deal with him. Tonight they'll—"

"Look at that tiny waist..."

Sophia's skin prickled under the scrutiny. She turned to leave when a saccharine voice stopped her.

"Leaving so soon, Ms. Lowell?" Isabella Valentine approached on Ethan's arm, a flash of venom in her eyes.

"I'm not feeling well." Sophia kept her tone frosty.

"But this farewell gala was specially arranged by Mr. Valrose for Ethan." Isabella clung to Ethan's shoulder with faux affection. "Wouldn't an early departure be... unprofessional?"

Ethan's gaze lingered on Sophia before he remarked coolly, "Now that you're here, at least pretend to enjoy yourself."

"I didn't come by choice." Sophia's laugh was sharp. "Mr. Valrose claimed you were too drunk to function and insisted I retrieve you. Clearly, I overstepped."

The man's brow furrowed. "When have I ever been incapacitated by alcohol?"
###Chapter 312

Ethan Roscente's words were brutally blunt, without even the pretense of subtlety. What shocked me more was that he'd say such things in front of his fiancée. It seemed scumbags like him had perfected the art of shamelessness.

The strangest part was Isabella Valentine's reaction. Instead of anger, she maintained an elegant, composed smile.

I couldn't help but wonder—was Ethan insane? Or was Isabella? Or perhaps this entire engaged couple had collectively lost their minds.

"How would I know?" I replied coldly. "Why don't you ask Mr. Valrose why he lied to me with such an excuse?"

A flicker of something unreadable passed through Isabella's eyes before she offered an apologetic smile. "I asked Dominic to contact you, Sophia. I thought you might be bored alone at the hotel and wanted to invite you out before we left. I didn’t expect him to use Ethan being drunk as an excuse."

So she was the one who gave out my number.

I scoffed. "Seems you and Mr. Valrose are quite close. Next time, ask for my permission before sharing private information. It avoids unnecessary complications."

A flash of resentment crossed Isabella's face, but she quickly lowered her lashes, feigning remorse. "I apologize. It was thoughtless of me—"

Ethan frowned impatiently. "Enough. It won’t happen again."

Ah, the overprotective fiancé strikes again.

I had no patience for their charade and turned to leave.

These high-society gatherings were nothing but mutual flattery. As someone with social anxiety, I couldn’t stand it. After two glasses of juice, I was desperate to escape.

As Ethan's fiancée, Isabella naturally attracted a crowd of sycophants. I hid behind a potted plant, catching snippets of conversation.

"Isabella, I heard your wedding date was set ages ago. Why the delay?"

"Ethan’s been swamped with work," she replied sweetly. "The ceremony was supposed to happen days ago, but he insisted on securing this project first."

"You’re so lucky to have such a driven fiancé. My boyfriend lazes around all day. If not for his family’s money, he’d have squandered everything by now."

"Your boyfriend is attentive too. He’s been fetching drinks for you all evening."

"Once you return to New York, the wedding will happen, right?"

My heart clenched.

So their wedding was imminent.

Of course. This was inevitable. It had always been a foregone conclusion.

Isabella tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear, her earlier confidence melting into demure shyness. "My father has already discussed it with Mr. Roscente Sr. We’ll finalize the details with Ethan when we return, then start preparations."

I followed her gaze to the garden. Under the moonlight, red roses bloomed vibrantly. Beside them stood a familiar tall figure—Ethan, deep in conversation, yet his eyes kept drifting in this direction.

The only people here were Isabella and me, concealed behind foliage.

My hiding spot wasn’t exactly discreet. If even Isabella hadn’t noticed me, there was no way Ethan had. So his attention was solely on her.

How touching. He couldn’t bear to be apart from her for even a moment.

At the mention of their wedding, the juice in my mouth turned bitter.
###Chapter 313

"Isabella, Mr. Roscente truly dotes on you like a precious jewel." The socialite beside her giggled behind her hand, eyes brimming with envy.

Sophia Lowell traced the rim of her champagne glass with delicate fingers, but her gaze remained fixed on the tall figure outside the floor-to-ceiling windows. A faint blush colored her cheeks as she murmured, "Don't tease me..."

She turned to leave, only to be blocked by a familiar silhouette.

"Can't handle it already?" Dominic Valrose swirled his wine glass, amusement glinting in his eyes. "What will you do when they actually get married? Faint from crying?"

Sophia met his gaze coldly. "If you're so free, Mr. Valrose, perhaps you should go donate to charity."

His smile faltered momentarily before returning with a roguish tilt. "I'm just concerned about you, darling. With me, you'd have far more... excitement than with Ethan Roscente."

"Save your kindness for those who need it," she replied evenly. "Like your dear Isabella."

Dominic's expression darkened. "How did you—"

"Lucky guess." Sophia arched a brow. "Who else could make you so smug?"

"Clever girl." He leaned in, voice dropping to a whisper. "She's much more obedient in bed than she lets on..."

Sophia took a deliberate step back and clapped slowly. "Impressive skills, Mr. Valrose."

"Well?" He smirked, tilting his chin up. "Join me, and I'll show you paradise."

"No, thank you." She shook her head. "I'd rather not risk an STD."

Rage flashed across his face. As he reached for her arm, a frigid voice cut through the tension.

"What exactly are you doing to my secretary, Mr. Valrose?"

Ethan Roscente stood at the end of the hallway, his suit jacket draped over one arm, tie slightly loosened. He strode forward, the night's chill clinging to him.

Before Dominic could respond, Ethan pulled Sophia firmly against his side. She stiffened, but his low command halted her resistance: "Don't move."

Dominic's face cycled through several shades before settling on a strained smile. "A misunderstanding, Mr. Roscente. Sophia and I were just having a pleasant chat."

Ethan's fingers tightened imperceptibly at her waist, his smile razor-thin. "Really? Because my secretary looks about three seconds from tears."
###Chapter 314

"Is that so?" Ethan Roscente's icy gaze swept over Dominic Valrose like a blade. "Mr. Valrose should be careful. Too much agitation might cause sudden death."

Dominic's back broke out in cold sweat as he suppressed his fury. "Your advice is noted, Mr. Roscente."

Once Dominic left, Sophia Lowell immediately pulled away from the arm around her waist. "Thank you for stepping in, Mr. Roscente. I'll take my leave now."

"Quick with gratitude, quicker with rejection." Ethan's lips curled into a cold smile. "Ms. Lowell, your talent for burning bridges is truly unparalleled."

Sophia pressed her lips together and turned to leave.

Ethan grabbed her slender wrist. "Did I say you could go?"

"Stay?" Sophia arched a brow mockingly. "To watch you and Ms. Valentine canoodling?"

He suddenly leaned in, his warm breath brushing her ear. "Jealous?" His fingers lightly pinched the tip of her nose. "I didn't say anything when you were busy attracting admirers."

Sophia turned her face away. "Have some self-respect, Mr. Roscente."

She struggled, but he only tightened his grip, pulling her closer. "I'll take you home."

"No need—"

"Ethan!"

Isabella Valentine's voice rang out from nearby. Sophia's heart twisted. She dug her nails into Ethan's side, making him wince and loosen his hold. Seizing the chance, she slipped free and ran off without looking back.

Ethan moved to follow, but Isabella had already latched onto his arm. "I've been looking everywhere for you."

He coldly pulled away. "What is it?"

"Your coat has been sent to the dry cleaners." Isabella smiled sweetly.

"Throw it out."

Several business partners approached, surrounding Ethan. Isabella watched Sophia disappear down the hall, a flicker of malice in her eyes.

In the hotel corridor, Zachary Evans stood waiting with luggage.

"Everything's here. Thank you." Sophia checked the items, her tone distant.

Zachary peered behind her. "Mr. Roscente isn't coming back with you?"

"Mr. Evans." Sophia paused. "Ethan and I ended long ago. Now it's just a matter of debt. Remember that."

"But Mr. Roscente doesn't actually love—"

"I saw her." Sophia cut him off. "They're getting married. Why drag me into this?" She wearily closed her suitcase. "It's all so pointless."

Zachary hurried to explain, "Mr. Roscente doesn't—"

The door slammed shut in his face, cutting off his words.
###Chapter 315

"I want nothing more to do with them." Sophia Lowell gripped her suitcase handle until her knuckles turned white. "You understand how it feels to be gossiped about, don't you, Zachary?"

Zachary Evans studied her for a long moment before nodding slowly. "Understood, Ms. Lowell."

"Thank you."

After packing, Sophia took a hot shower. She was drying her hair when she noticed three missed calls from Vivian Ashcroft.

She dialed back immediately. Vivian's furious voice exploded through the phone: "That two-faced Isabella Valentine! She hasn't even officially announced her engagement, but she's already flaunting it all over social media!"

"Flaunting what?" Sophia twisted open a bottle of hair serum.

"What else? Her wedding to that scumbag Ethan!" Vivian hissed. "Now everyone's buzzing about their ceremony. Bullshit! Didn't Ethan just take you on a business trip?"

"It's true." Sophia applied the serum calmly. "Isabella confirmed it today."

Silence.

"Sophia..."

"Don't look at me like that." She chuckled. "Their marriage is good news. Finally, I'm free."

"Exactly!" Vivian perked up. "We'll set off fireworks to celebrate! I'll invite all those young heartthrobs from my agency for an all-night party!"

Sophia glanced down at her slightly rounded abdomen. "You think I can party?"

"Absolutely!" Vivian declared. "Last week, a woman danced at a club while nine months pregnant and went into labor right there. Her baby came out knowing how to DJ—tiny hands moving like lightning! Our little one will be the nightclub prince!"

Sophia laughed. "Nightclub prince? Only you could come up with that."

"It's called getting a head start!" Vivian chirped. "What time's your flight tomorrow? I'll pick you up."

"The earliest one." Sophia paused. "I don't want to travel with them."

"Got it! I'm free tomorrow morning."

"Okay."

A knock interrupted them.

Sophia eyed the door. "Room service is here. Talk later."

After hanging up, she checked the peephole cautiously. Seeing the hotel uniform, she opened the door.

"Just put it on the table—" She stepped aside, then froze.

Dominic Valrose removed his service cap with a knowing smile. "Long time no see, Ms. Lowell."
###Chapter 316

"Room service. Your dinner is here." A flippant voice called from outside.

Sophia peered through the peephole. Dominic Valrose stood there in a waiter's uniform, his face twisted into a revolting smirk.

"Not interested." Her voice was ice.

The door burst open. Dominic shrugged off the uniform jacket, revealing party attire beneath. "My property, my rules." He locked the door behind him, his gaze crawling over her like oil.

She retreated until her back hit the cold wall.

"You dare touch Ethan Roscente's woman?" She forced steadiness into her voice.

Dominic snorted. "He's too busy sharing wedding cups with Isabella Valentine." He advanced step by step. "After I'm done with you, you think he'll want spoiled goods?"

Her pupils contracted.

"Isabella?" The name clicked like a bullet in a chamber.

Dominic realized his slip but shrugged. "Right. She sent me. Shouldn't have pissed off the wrong people."

Frost climbed her spine.

Now she saw the whole game. Isabella was eliminating rivals through a willing pawn.

"Choose me instead." Dominic reached for her face. "Better than that Roscente bastard."

"Don't touch me!" She slapped his hand away.

With a roar, Dominic yanked her hair and slammed her head against the coffee table. Pain exploded behind her eyes. Darkness pulsed at the edges of her vision.

"Help..." The plea was a whisper.

Fabric tore. Despair flooded her lungs. Then her fingers brushed cold glass.

Thud.

The sound of blunt force meeting skull echoed through the room.

Dominic collapsed. Dark blood seeped from his scalp, staining the carpet.

Her hands shook as the ashtray shattered on the floor.

Sirens wailed in the distance.

Tires screeched as a black sedan skidded to a stop outside the police station.
###Chapter 317
I raised my glass sincerely. "Fish, I was out of line before. I apologize. You and Sister Spring have my genuine blessings."

Fish's eyes reddened as he downed his drink in one gulp.

"Yunfeng, we've been through hell together all these years." He slapped my shoulder heavily. "Unless the Boss says otherwise, I'll never leave the team."

Bean Sprout suddenly banged the table. "Well said! I, Lu Ziming, swear my loyalty too! Unless the Boss kicks me out, I'm sticking with you all forever!"

Tongtong propped her chin on her hand, the bruise still visible on her forehead. "What's with all the secrecy? What exactly do you guys do? And what's this 'Northern School' business?"

"Foot masseurs!" Bean Sprout blurted out shamelessly. "The Northern School techniques are unmatched. Want a demonstration?"

"Bullshit!" Tongtong rolled her eyes. "I'll ask Sister Xishi later."

Bean Sprout smirked. "Hey beautiful, if we get drunk later..."

"And what if you do?" She tilted her chin defiantly. "Want me to strip right now? I dare you to lay a finger on me!"

When we fell silent, she lit a cigarette and blew smoke rings at me. "Sister Xishi was right. You're a real oddball."

"How so?"

Seeing my expression darken, she quickly apologized.

Bean Sprout suddenly lowered his voice. "You're from the Lower Nine Gates, aren't you?"

"The what now?"

"You know - Phoenix Gate, Red Silk, Orchid Gate..."

I tapped my bowl to cut him off. Tongtong didn't even know about the Northern School - clearly an outsider.

Unexpectedly, her interest was piqued, and she pressed for details.

"The underworld factions are complex," I explained. "Just remember these eight words: Thief, Gu, Fence, Phoenix, Con, Witch, Show, Kill. You and Sai Xishi both belong to the 'Phoenix' branch."

"So prostitution equals Phoenix Gate?"

"Wrong!" I shook my head. "Like university majors, Phoenix has subdivisions. Your type would be the Water Gathering branch."

Tongtong waved impatiently. "What nonsense! I say we should just call it the Jade Gate!"

"Jade Gate?"

Her eyes twinkled mischievously as she recited: "The Han court never took Yan Zhi Mountain, yet year after year our soldiers march through northern sands. Galloping our sweat-blood steeds beyond the frontier, we charge straight through the Jade Gate Pass."

I froze, then couldn't help applauding. "Brilliant! Truly Zhuji's most talented poetess!"
###Chapter 318

Yuki Wang huddled in the corner, clutching his head with trembling hands. His lips moved in a broken whisper. "Don't hit me... please don't hit me..."

Before the plea faded, a designer sneaker slammed into his back.

"You deserve this!" The boy loomed over him, voice dripping with contempt. "Just like your whore of a mother. A disgrace to the Wang family. A maid seducing the young master? And birthing this idiot with no rightful name?"

"Exactly!" Other boys jeered in agreement. "They should've been kicked out years ago."

A red-haired teen sidled up to the ringleader. "Hey, Ethan. Grandma's napping. Should we teach this retard a proper lesson?"

Ethan Wang arched a brow, amusement curling his lips. "What'd you have in mind?"

"I think he's faking it," the redhead murmured. "Let's make him drink piss. A real idiot wouldn't know the difference."

Ethan's eyes gleamed. He clapped the boy's shoulder. "Brilliant. Get it ready."

Minutes later, the redhead returned with a soda bottle filled with yellow liquid.

"Here, stupid. Special drink for you." He thrust it at Yuki.

The boy stared blankly at the bottle, making no move to take it.

"See? Told you he's pretending!" The redhead turned away smugly. "Let's report this to Grandma—"

"Is it sweet?" Yuki suddenly giggled.

The redhead froze. He spun back with a coaxing smile. "Super sweet. Try it."

As Yuki raised the bottle, a gaunt figure lunged forward, knocking it to the ground.

"Don't drink that!" A woman wrapped Yuki in a desperate embrace, her voice shaking.

Yuki blinked up at her. "But Mommy, they said it's good..."

"It's poison!" Tears streaked her face as she dropped to her knees before Ethan. "Young Master, please. We'll stay out of your way. Just leave my boy alone..."

Ethan kicked her aside. "Filth! Who said you could touch me?"

She staggered up, pulling Yuki toward the exit.

"Stop!" Ethan barked. "Nobody leaves until he finishes that drink!"

The woman paled. "You... you can't mean..."

"Refuse?" Ethan's smile turned vicious. "Then you'll regret it."

A nod sent the pack swarming. They pinned mother and son to the ground. Someone retrieved the half-spilled bottle with a cruel grin.

The woman's scream tore through the courtyard. "NO—!"
###Chapter 319

Sophia's hands trembled as she clutched her documents. She didn't dare recall what had just happened—only the memory of blood splattering onto her fingertips when the ashtray struck Dominic's head.

What did those expensive skincare products and clothes matter now? She couldn't stay another second.

"Brought all your documents, I see." Sebastian's tone was casual, as if commenting on the weather, as he glanced at her white-knuckled grip.

Sophia forced a smirk. "Just instinct."

Back in the Hot Springs Resort, Dominic had rushed back to the room the moment the doctor finished bandaging his wound.

Lydia's call came right on cue: "Mr. Valrose, the police have left."

Standing amidst the wreckage, Dominic lit a cigarette. The smoke curled around his narrowed eyes. "No loose ends?"

"Don't worry. Everyone involved is loyal."

He took a harsh drag. "And that woman?"

"Surveillance shows she left the resort. After that—"

"Find her!" Dominic kicked over a suitcase. "I want her found—alive or dead!"

The door burst open.

Dominic turned, his cigarette clattering to the floor.

"Mr... Mr. Roscente..."

Ethan's gaze swept over the chaos before settling on the bandage around Dominic's head. Slowly, he removed his wristwatch and handed it to Zachary behind him.

"Care to explain, Mr. Valrose?"

Beads of sweat formed on Dominic's forehead. "It was Secretary Lowell who invited me! She suddenly went mad—"

"Oh?" Ethan rolled up his shirt sleeves, revealing toned forearms. "Go on."

"When her seduction failed, she tried to kill me! Just check the footage—"

Ethan smiled.

That smile sent chills down Dominic's spine.
###Chapter 320

"I suppose I owe you a proper apology."

Dominic Valrose forced a hollow smile. "No need. You've traveled far and just signed a billion-dollar contract. We'll be working together—"

"What's trivial to you is everything to me."

Before Dominic could react, Ethan Roscente's boot connected with his chest.

The impact sent Dominic crashing through the floor-to-ceiling window. Glass shattered as his body slammed onto the ground, blood spraying from his lips.

Crimson droplets bloomed across the carpet.

Ethan advanced slowly, dress shoes crunching over broken glass. Dominic's terrified gaze darted to Zachary Evans by the door—only to watch him shut it with icy indifference.

"I told you Sophia Lowell is mine." Ethan's heel ground into Dominic's ribs with enough force to snap bone. "Did you think I was joking?"

Dominic writhed, eyes rolling back in agony. Finally understanding he'd provoked a sleeping dragon, he shook his head frantically, choking on incoherent whimpers.

"Which hand touched her?"

Trembling, Dominic raised his right hand.

A sickening crack echoed as Ethan snapped his wrist.

Outside, Zachary shuddered at the bloodcurdling screams. When he reentered, Ethan's eyes burned with murderous rage.

"Mr. Roscente, he'll die at this rate!"

"Let him."

Surveying the mangled figure on the floor, Zachary blurted: "Miss Lowell is still missing. A young woman alone at night—"

Ethan's pupils contracted. Sanity returned. He tossed aside a bloodied handkerchief. "Turn Hong Kong upside down."

"Surveillance footage is being reviewed. We'll—"

Five minutes later at the police station, officers informed them Sophia had just been picked up.
###Chapter 321

Ethan Roscente loosened his tie, the ashtray overflowing with cigarette butts.

"She has no one in Hong Kong." He crushed the last ember between his fingers, the glow flickering. "Except Sebastian Valdemar."

Zachary Evans' phone vibrated abruptly.

"Mr. Roscente!" His brow smoothed as he ended the call. "The airline confirmed—Ms. Lowell purchased a ticket back to New York. Departure in ten minutes."

"With whom?"

"Sebastian Valdemar."

Ice crystallized in Ethan's eyes as he spun his phone. Thirty-seven unanswered calls swallowed by silence.

Crack!

The latest smartphone shattered against the wall.

"Useless." He tore open two shirt buttons, veins pulsing along his collarbone. "I wasn't there when she needed me most. Now I can't even locate her."

Zachary bent to collect the debris. "Perhaps she's boarding—"

"Failure." Ethan's laugh was razor-edged, eyes bloodshot. "I'm a goddamn failure."

Wind hurled dead leaves against the car window.

"The Zhuangs." He yanked the door open, moonlight glinting off the steel frame. "I'll make them beg for death."

Tires screeched.

Watching the taillights vanish, Zachary dialed Legal. "Prepare the Zhuang Group's bankruptcy filings." He glanced at the churning sky. "Storm's coming."

Vivian Ashcroft woke to a phone slamming into her face.

10:07 PM.

"Airport pickup!" She bolted upright, knocking over pill bottles. White tablets scattered as her calico cat fled into the closet.

Her phone buzzed three times on the vanity before the automated voice announced, "The subscriber is unavailable." Midway through squeezing foundation, she suddenly opened WeChat.

"Viv..." Sophia's voice trembled in the audio message. "I think... I killed someone..."

The sunscreen tube burst in her grip, white cream splattering her silk nightgown.

The elevator doors parted to reveal Jason Roscente whistling, breakfast soup leaking through the container in his arms.

"Attempted murder?" He dabbed at his stained shirt before noticing Vivian's red-rimmed eyes.

"Sophia's in Hong Kong—" Her nails bit into her palms. "Something terrible happened!"

As the doors slid shut, Jason jammed his arm through the sensor.

"Give me sixty seconds." He peeled off the soaked shirt. "I'm driving."
###Chapter 322

"That bastard Ethan Roscente!" Vivian Ashcroft trembled with rage, her fingers clenching the phone. "Too busy pampering his unattainable love while Sophia's in trouble!"

Her eyes were bloodshot, voice shaking. "Sophia must be terrified right now..."

Jason Roscente frowned. "Calm down. Let me hear Sophia's voice message."

The elevator doors opened. He pulled Vivian toward the parking garage.

Vivian fumbled with her phone, fingers trembling as she played the recording.

"Viv... I-I think I killed someone..."

Sophia's tearful voice crackled through the speaker, background noise chaotic.

Jason's face darkened. He yanked the car door open. "Get in."

The sports car roared to life, tires screeching against asphalt.

Vivian gripped the seatbelt, nails digging into leather.

"Relax." Jason kept his eyes on the road, hands steady on the wheel. "If it was self-defense, she'll be fine."

"You sure?" Her voice wavered.

Jason nodded. "I know penal code by heart. Let's call my uncle first."

The moment the call connected, Vivian exploded.

"Ethan Roscente, you deserve to die! If anything happens to Sophia, I'll bury you with her!"

Jason cleared his throat. "Focus."

"Get to the police station now!" Vivian hissed. "She must be scared out of her mind alone!"

A lighter clicked on the other end.

"She's not in Hong Kong." Ethan's voice sounded ragged.

"What?"

In a dim hallway, Ethan leaned against Sophia's apartment door. Cigarette butts littered the floor, his dress shirt crumpled beyond recognition.
###Chapter 323

The airport was deserted at 3 AM. Ethan Roscente strode briskly through the terminal, dragging his suitcase behind him. The night wind carried a biting chill as he tightened the collar of his trench coat, his bloodshot eyes scanning the empty arrivals hall.

The doorknob of Sophia's apartment felt icy against his skin. He pressed the doorbell repeatedly, met only with silence.

The roar of an engine shattered the stillness. A black Maybach sped through the vacant streets. Ethan's knuckles whitened around the steering wheel as his gaze darted between every passing silhouette. Neon lights flickered across his sharp profile.

Sebastian Valdemar's apartment was equally dark. The security guard confirmed no one had been home for three days.

An ashtray overflowed with cigarette butts. Ethan stared at the flight details on his phone screen. New York was just a layover—where had they really gone?

"Vivian Ashcroft, you'd better know something." He crushed his last cigarette and dialed.

A groggy voice answered. "Do you know what time it is, Ethan?"

"Sophia's missing." His voice was raw. "With Sebastian."

A glass shattered in the background. Vivian's tone turned razor-sharp. "What do you mean missing? Weren't you taking her to Hong Kong?"

"She never boarded." He massaged his temples. "They've vanished without a trace."

"Ethan Roscente!" Vivian's scream nearly shattered the receiver. "If anything happens to her, I'll bury you with my bare hands!"

The line went dead. Ethan stared at the darkened screen, his mouth twisting into a bitter smile. Outside, dawn crept across the horizon.

Vivian kicked off the blankets and grabbed her jacket. Jason Roscente blocked her path, rubbing sleep from his eyes. "It's the middle of the night—"

"We're finding Sophia!" She shoved past him. "This has Ethan's fingerprints all over it."

Jason snatched his car keys. "Where?"

"Seattle." Vivian buckled her seatbelt, eyes glinting. "There's only one place she'd go."

Highway signs gleamed in the morning light. Jason glanced at Vivian's clenched fists. "You think she and Professor Valdemar—"

"Drive!" she snapped.

The Maybach and sports car raced toward the breaking dawn, unaware of the sunrise tearing through the night behind them.
###Chapter 324

The aging apartment complex near Seattle First High School showed its years under the sunlight, with peeling paint revealing layers of time.

Most residents here were parents accompanying their children or students preparing for college entrance exams.

For Sophia's three years of high school, her mother Emily had bought this two-bedroom apartment just to give her daughter an extra thirty minutes of sleep each morning.

A red sports car screeched to a halt at the complex entrance, tires screaming against the pavement.

Vivian Ashcroft leapt out and rushed to the security booth. "Is there a resident named Emily Laurent or Sophia Lowell here?"

The guard eyed the two well-dressed young people suspiciously. "What business do you have with the residents?"

Jason Roscente yanked Vivian back before she could explain. "She's my sister," he blurted, voice urgent. "She has depression—just sent a suicide text!"

"Oh god!" The guard fumbled with the registry. "Unit 3, Apartment 502! Hurry!"

Vivian shot Jason a glare as they ran. "That's the story you went with?"

"Rather than getting interrogated for half an hour?" Jason took the stairs three at a time.

Sophia was curled under her blankets catching up on sleep when thunderous pounding jolted her awake.

Rubbing her eyes, she grabbed a brass figurine from the entryway shelf. Taking a deep breath, she yanked the door open.

Whoosh—

The figurine grazed the intruder's nose before smashing into the opposite wall with a deafening crash.

"Sophia!" Ethan Roscente wiped his face with a snarl. "Trying to become a widow already?"

Sophia's eyes widened, her pajama collar slipping to reveal one collarbone. "You...how did you find this place?"

Ethan braced his hands on his knees, gasping for air, his sweat-drenched bangs clinging to his forehead. When he looked up to see the girl standing unharmed in cartoon-print pajamas, the tension drained from his shoulders.

Then he yanked her into a crushing embrace.

The mingled scents of tobacco and sweat assaulted her senses. Sophia wrinkled her nose and shoved at his chest. "You reek!"

"Ungrateful brat." Ethan pinched her nose. "I turned Seattle upside down while you slept like a log."

Only then did Sophia notice the usually immaculate young master's wrinkled suit, bloodshot eyes, and stubbled jaw.

"You..." Her voice trembled. "Why are you really here?"

Ethan's gaze darkened as he pinned her against the wall. "What do you think?"
###Chapter 325

Sophia Lowell felt her eyelids grow heavy as if weighted with lead. She blinked hard, wondering if she was hallucinating.

The man who always carried himself with unshakable arrogance now stood at her doorstep, his eyes shimmering with something inexplicably wounded.

"Damn it," she muttered under her breath, rubbing her temples.

She hadn't slept since her exhausting journey from Hong Kong back to Seattle. First, a five-hour flight to New York, then being driven overnight by that workaholic Sebastian Valdemar. She'd only stumbled into this dust-choked old house at 3 AM, her last ounce of energy spent scrubbing it clean.

And today—visiting the cemetery, collapsing in tears before her mother's and grandparents' graves—had drained her completely.

All she wanted now was to sink into bed and sleep for eternity.

"Move," she rasped, reaching to shut the door.

Ethan Roscente's palm slammed against the doorframe, veins bulging. "Sophia, you owe me an explanation."

"For what?" She leaned wearily against the frame. "My phone got crushed by a car. Didn’t have time to replace it. Happy now?"

The man scoffed. "Convenient."

"Believe what you want." She was too tired to argue. Last night, when that out-of-control sedan had grazed her, her phone had slipped from her grip. The memory still sent chills down her spine.

Ethan stepped closer abruptly. "Why did you suddenly come back to Seattle?"

The familiar scent of his woody cologne hit her, stealing her breath. It was achingly familiar—enough to make her heart tremble.

"I missed home," she said, turning her face away.

"Liar." His voice sharpened. "You promised to attend tomorrow’s board meeting!"

Sophia's head snapped up. She had forgotten about that.

A flicker of hurt crossed his eyes. "Am I really someone you’d go this far to avoid?"

Her lips parted, but no words came. The motion-sensor light in the hallway chose that moment to die, plunging them into darkness where only their breaths intertwined.

"Let me in," he said suddenly, his voice softening. "I drove ten hours."

Her heart clenched. From New York to Seattle—that was indeed the distance.

When the light flickered back on, she saw the dark circles under his eyes. Against her better judgment, she stepped aside.

"Ten minutes," she warned. "Then you leave."

The corner of Ethan's mouth lifted. As he crossed the threshold, his fingers brushed her wrist—so lightly it might have been accidental.

In that instant, Sophia realized with a sinking heart—

She might have just fallen into this man’s trap again.
###Chapter 326

The elevator doors slid open, and Vivian Ashcroft burst out like a whirlwind.

She grabbed Sophia Lowell's wrist, scanning her up and down. "Are you okay? You scared me to death!"

Sophia stumbled back half a step from the sudden movement. "I'm fine..."

"Thank God!" Vivian's eyes were red-rimmed, her voice trembling. "When I got your message, I almost dropped my phone."

Ethan Roscente stood nearby, his face dark as storm clouds.

Vivian finally noticed his presence and immediately shielded Sophia behind her. "What are you doing here?"

"That's my question." Ethan's voice was icy.

"I'm Sophia's best friend!" Vivian squared her shoulders. "Unlike you, who has no business being here."

Ethan narrowed his eyes. "I'm her husband."

"Ex-husband!" Vivian corrected sharply. "The divorce papers are signed. Stop pretending!"

Sandwiched between them, Sophia felt a throbbing pain in her temples.

"Vivian..." She gently tugged her friend's sleeve.

Vivian turned to glare at her. "Don't defend him! None of this would've happened if not for him!"

Ethan stepped forward abruptly. "Danger? What danger?"

Vivian bit her lip, realizing her slip.

Sophia sighed. "It's over now."

"Not for me!" Vivian whirled around. "Do you know how terrified I was reading those messages?"

She pulled out her phone with shaking hands and played a voice memo.

Sophia's tearful voice crackled through the speaker: "Viv...I'm so scared...someone's following me..."

Ethan's face turned ashen.

"When was this?" He seized Sophia's shoulders.

Vivian slapped his hand away. "Now you care? Where were you when she needed you?"

The elevator dinged open again.

Jason Roscente emerged laden with shopping bags, freezing at the tense scene.

"Uh...bad timing?"

Vivian immediately redirected her fury. "Traitor! Did you tip him off?"

Jason raised his hands in surrender. "I didn't even bring my phone!"

"Then how did he find her?" Vivian jabbed a finger at Ethan.

Ethan smirked. "You think you're the only one who can track her down?"

"Enough!" Sophia raised her voice sharply.

Silence fell.

She rubbed her forehead. "Let's take this inside."

Vivian instantly linked arms with her. "Yes, let's go. Ignore these useless men."

Ethan's gaze turned dangerous as he watched their intertwined arms.

Just as Vivian triumphantly moved to shut the door, a polished leather shoe blocked the threshold.

"I'm coming in." Ethan's tone brooked no argument.
###Chapter 327

Ethan Roscente curled his lips in disdain. "The louder they protest, the guiltier they feel."

"You!" Vivian Ashcroft stomped her foot. "You're just jealous of Sophia!"

Sophia Lowell tugged her friend's arm. "Don't waste your breath. Let's go inside."

"Hmph! Like talking to a brick wall!" Vivian linked arms with Sophia and moved to shut the door.

Ethan suddenly gripped Sophia's wrist. "I drove three hours for this. Is this how you treat guests?"

"Serves you right!" Vivian rolled her eyes. "Let go!"

Ignoring her, Ethan stroked the delicate skin of Sophia's wrist. "We need to talk business."

Sophia struggled but couldn't break free. "We have nothing to discuss."

"Really?" He leaned in, warm breath grazing her earlobe. "Not even about your friend's reality show deal..."

Vivian lunged forward. "Stop threatening her!"

"Vivian," Sophia interrupted, "could you get me some water?"

"But—" Vivian hesitated, frustration evident.

Sophia squeezed her hand. "Trust me."

Jason Roscente seized the moment to drag Vivian into the elevator. "I could use a drink too."

"Drop dead!" Vivian flipped Ethan off. "Over my dead body will you get your way!"

As the elevator doors closed, the hallway plunged into uneasy silence.

Sophia finally yanked her hand free. "Changed your mind?"

Ethan's gaze lingered on her rumpled pajama collar. "Let's continue inside."

"Here's fine." She stood her ground.

A low chuckle escaped him as he twirled a strand of her hair. "Standing out here dressed like this—want to give the neighbors a show?"

She glanced down, realizing her collar had slipped to reveal a sliver of collarbone. Ethan's eyes darkened, his throat bobbing visibly.
###Chapter 328 

Ethan Roscente braced one arm against the doorframe, looking down at her with an imperious gaze.

"Let me in." His voice was low, laced with undeniable authority.

Sophia Lowell tightened her grip on the doorknob. "Say what you need to say right here."

He suddenly leaned in, his breath warm against her ear. "Are you sure you want to have this conversation here?"

Her ears burned, and she instinctively took a step back.

Seizing the opportunity, Ethan pushed past her into the apartment and shut the door behind him.

"You—!" Sophia stamped her foot in frustration.

The man had already strode into the living room, his eyes sweeping over the cozy space. Potted plants lined the balcony, and a half-finished cup of floral tea sat on the coffee table.

"Nice place," he remarked, his tone loaded with implication.

Sophia watched him warily. "What do you want?"

Ethan moved to the balcony, where he could see the playground of a nearby high school. A group of girls in uniforms laughed under the trees.

"Did you go to school here?" he asked abruptly.

She frowned. "What does that have to do with you?"

An image flashed through Ethan's mind—Sophia as a teenager, her hair in a high ponytail, wearing a blue-and-white uniform, radiant in the sunlight.

The thought of countless boys slipping love letters into her locker made his expression darken.

"Stay away from Sebastian Valdemar from now on," he ordered, turning back to her.

Sophia scoffed. "Since when do you get to dictate who I see?"

Ethan grabbed her wrist. "Why didn’t you tell me about Dominic Valrose?"

"Tell you?" She tried to pull free, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "What good would that do? Isabella Valentine just has to call, and you come running."

His grip tightened. "That was an exception."

"An exception?" Her eyes reddened. "I almost—"

Before she could finish, Ethan yanked her into his arms.

"It won’t happen again," he said hoarsely. "Dominic will pay for what he did."

Sophia caught the faint metallic scent of blood and noticed the fresh bruises on his right knuckles.

"You—"

"It’s nothing." He released her, casually adjusting his cuff.

She turned her face away. "When will you give me the money?"

Ethan’s eyes darkened. "In such a hurry to cut ties with me?"

"There were never any ties between us," she said coldly.

A slow, dangerous smile curved his lips, sending a chill down her spine.

"No ties?" He advanced step by step. "Should I refresh your memory?"

Sophia retreated until her back hit the wall.

Ethan caged her in with one arm, his gaze dropping to her trembling lashes.

"Sophia," he murmured, his voice soft but unyielding. "You can’t run from me."
###Chapter 329

Ethan Roscente's eyes darkened as his knuckles rapped against the desk.

"Soft embraces and sweet whispers?" His laugh was cold. "With you gone, should I whisper to the air?"

Sophia Lowell turned her face away, nails digging into her palms.

"I heard you're getting married." Her voice was icy. "Congratulations."

Ethan stiffened.

"Isabella told you?"

"Does it matter?" Sophia's lips twisted. "We ended things long ago."

Rain slanted outside, tracing winding paths down the windowpane.

"About Dominic Valrose..." She hesitated. "Consider it repayment for your last favor."

Ethan shot to his feet, his shadow engulfing her.

"Repayment?" His voice tightened. "You think that settles it?"

Sophia met his gaze.

"I'll return the money." Each word was deliberate. "But honor your promise to Vivian."

The air turned brittle.

"Because of the marriage?" Dark currents churned in Ethan's eyes. "Is this your way of cutting ties?"

Sophia suddenly laughed.

"Poor memory, Mr. Roscente." She tapped her temple. "I've said it a thousand times—I won't be the other woman."

Raindrops drummed harder against the window.

"Tiffany was right." She adjusted her collar. "I deserve this."

"Enough!" Ethan seized her wrist.

Sophia struggled but couldn't break free.

"Let go." Her voice was quiet. "Don't make me despise you more."

Ethan's pupils contracted.

"Despise?" A low chuckle escaped him. "Who was it that pursued me first?"

Sophia's face paled.

"And I've paid the price." Her gaze fixed on his tie clip. "The car accident... the falling flowerpot... nearly drowning..."

"Sophia!" Ethan cut in sharply.

She looked up, her eyes barren.

"Stay away from me." Her voice cracked. "I'm begging you."

Ethan suddenly released her, stepping back.

"Too late." He adjusted his cuff. "The moment you tangled with me, escape became impossible."

Through the rain, his silhouette blurred.

"The marriage..." Ethan paused. "I'll handle it."

Sophia turned to leave.

"Stop!" Fury laced his command.

She halted at the door, back still turned.

"Sophia." Ethan's voice softened unexpectedly. "Trust me this once."

The slamming door was her only reply.
###Chapter 330

The air conditioning in the high-speed train carriage made me drowsy.

Vivian Ashcroft handed me a peeled orange. "So you're really cutting ties with Ethan Roscente for good?"

"Mhm." I took the orange, my fingertips sticky with juice.

Outside the window, the scenery blurred past—just like my relationship with Ethan.

Vivian suddenly leaned in. "But from the way that bastard's acting, he doesn't seem ready to let go."

"He doesn't get a choice." I popped an orange segment into my mouth, the sweet-tart burst flooding my tongue. "I'm returning to Seattle after my internship."

"Right." Vivian counted on her fingers. "In two weeks, he won't be able to reach you."

My hand drifted to my abdomen. The little one was unusually quiet, as if knowing Mommy needed peace.

"This baby's so well-behaved. Nothing like their father," I murmured.

Vivian poked my belly playfully. "Listen up, little one! It'll just be us three living our best life!"

Back in New York, the final payment from Luming Architectural Studio arrived on schedule.

I stared at the numbers in my mobile banking app, then transferred the entire sum to Ethan without hesitation.

Stepping out of the bank, the sunlight made me squint.

Wait—

I froze, then dialed Vivian's number.

"What about the resources Ethan promised you?"

Confusion laced her voice. "What resources? My agent booked all my recent gigs."

My knuckles whitened around the phone.

Ethan Roscente, you sly bastard. Playing me like this.
###Chapter 331

"He promised me those resources, and now he's backing out. What kind of man does that?"

Sophia Lowell stomped her foot in frustration.

At the vanity, Vivian Ashcroft was carefully lining her brows. She burst into laughter. "A weasel, that's what."

Sophia's anger deflated instantly. "You're absolutely right. Total weasel behavior."

"Relax, my schedule's packed anyway." Vivian set down her brow pencil and took Sophia's hands. "I don't need those resources. And don't go confronting him—who knows if he's just stringing us along?"

Sophia frowned. "But those opportunities were yours. With them, you could transition into serious acting instead of relying on variety shows."

If Ethan Roscente hadn't interfered, Vivian would be filming right now. A hit variety show coupled with solid acting credits would have cemented her status.

Instead, she was stuck hopping between reality shows. Without substantial roles, her popularity would fade as quickly as it came.

Though Vivian always claimed she had a knack for entertainment and didn't mind quick cash grabs, Sophia knew the truth—this girl lived for acting. Even for minor roles, she'd meticulously craft character backstories. How could she be content as just a variety star?

Sophia dialed Ethan's number without hesitation.

"When are you delivering those promised resources to Vivian?"

Silence stretched for several seconds before his deep voice responded, "Pause the meeting."

Sophia rolled her eyes. Of course she knew he was in a meeting—so what? He'd broken his word first.

Footsteps echoed, followed by the click of a lighter. She could practically see him standing by the floor-to-ceiling windows, exhaling smoke.

Go ahead, smoke yourself to an early grave.

"I've been swamped these past few days." A slow exhale. "This isn't a phone conversation. Come to the office."

"What's so complicated? Just have the producers contact Vivian's agent."

"You think it's that simple?" Amusement colored his tone. "The directors need to conduct risk assessments."

"What risk assessments?"

"Evaluating whether an artist carries liabilities. No one hires problematic talent, no matter how perfect the fit." He rarely explained things so patiently. "Business is business."

Sophia immediately vouched, "Vivian's completely clean."

"Who knows?" His voice turned teasing. "She's unhinged."

"That's prejudice!" Sophia's voice rose sharply.

Ethan chuckled low. "In your eyes, am I really that despicable?"

"Aren't you?"

After a beat, he sighed in resignation. "Fine, you're my祖宗. Whatever you say goes."

Sophia's ears burned. "W-who's your祖宗..."

"I say you are."

The indulgent tone made her heart skip a beat.
###Chapter 332

Sophia's fingers unconsciously twisted the hem of her blouse.

"Will the deal be finalized if I go?" Her voice trembled slightly.

A soft chuckle came through the phone. "Almost certain."

The vague answer made her temples throb.

But opportunities were fleeting.

"I'm on my way." She bit her lower lip. "No more tricks."

"Who would dare deceive a clever fox like you?"

The call ended abruptly. Sophia tossed her phone into her bag and yanked the car door open with more force than necessary.

Ethan Roscente stared at the darkened screen, a faint smile playing on his lips.

"Her temper's grown." He turned to Jessica, who had just entered. "When Sophia arrives, greet her."

Jessica's eyes lit up. "She's coming back?"

"Yes."

"I'll prepare right away!" Jessica turned to leave but was stopped.

"You're close with Isabella's agent?"

Jessica paused. "You mean Zoe? She's my cousin, but we're not particularly close."

Ethan nodded thoughtfully. "You're better than her."

Jessica stood frozen, only snapping out of it after the office door clicked shut.

Thirty minutes later, in front of Roscente Tower.

Sophia adjusted her mask in the rearview mirror. Returning after being kicked out was beyond awkward.

"Sophia!"

The familiar voice sent a jolt through her. Jessica waved at her from beside the revolving doors.

"Jessica." Her smile under the mask was strained.

"My god!" Jessica squeezed her wrist. "You've lost so much weight! Any thinner and you'll float away."

Morning sickness and work stress had taken their toll. Sophia deftly changed the subject. "Just proof of my discipline."

As the elevator ascended, she noticed many empty desks in the office area.

"Purge." Jessica lowered her voice. "After you left, Mr. Roscente fired all the slackers." She added meaningfully, "Coincidentally, they were the same ones who targeted you."

Sophia's nails dug into her palms.

"Don't joke." Her laugh was hollow. "I was publicly accused of leaking company secrets. Everyone knows that."
###Chapter 333

"You didn't know?" Jessica's face twisted in surprise.

Sophia blinked in confusion. "Know what?"

"The company already cleared your name regarding the trade secret leak. It was Isabella's mistake, not yours." Jessica lowered her voice. "And you resigned voluntarily—you weren't fired. Mr. Roscente had Zachary issue a company-wide announcement."

Sophia froze.

She had no idea.

"Mr. Roscente didn't tell you?" Jessica looked even more shocked.

Sophia shook her head, bitterness rising in her throat.

What did it matter now?

The damage was done. No after-the-fact fixes could erase it.

"Oh," Jessica suddenly remembered, "a few people from Logistics got fired too."

"Logistics?"

"That elevator incident." Jessica leaned in conspiratorially. "Mr. Roscente discovered it was a setup between the Executive Office and Logistics. He terminated everyone involved last week."

Sophia's breath caught.

After that elevator malfunction, she'd passed out from claustrophobia.

She never expected Ethan to reopen the investigation.

"Mr. Roscente was furious. The whole company's been walking on eggshells." Jessica shuddered at the memory.

Sophia pressed her lips together.

Her eyes suddenly burned.

Like someone had finally stood up for her after enduring injustice for so long.

They reached the CEO's office entrance.

Lost in thought, Sophia collided with an employee carrying files.

Papers scattered across the floor.

"Sorry!" She immediately knelt to help gather them.

"No worries." The woman smiled.

As Sophia organized the documents, her gaze snagged on a signature—"Gregory Wu."

"Golden Gate Securities?" she murmured.

Jessica peeked over. "Gregory oversees Mr. Roscente's bank loan portfolio. He's transferring to headquarters soon."

"Bank?" Sophia's head jerked up. "Ethan owns a bank?"

"Bayview Financial Group." Jessica whispered. "I only found out recently. Mr. Roscente keeps things close to the vest."

Sophia felt like lightning had struck her.

Bayview Financial!

That was the loan shark institution Emily had borrowed from!

So when Ethan repaid her debt... he'd just transferred money between his own accounts?

She'd been played.

Completely and utterly played.

Rage turned her vision red.
###Chapter 334

Jessica pushed open the office door and saw Sophia standing by the window, her face deathly pale, knuckles white from gripping too tight.

"Sophia?" She hurried forward. "Your hands are freezing."

Sophia yanked her hand away, forcing a smile. "I'm fine. Perfectly fine."

That smile sent a chill down Jessica's spine.

Ethan Roscente was in a quarterly review meeting when Sophia stormed into his office. Zachary Evans walked in with coffee just as her icy gaze locked onto him.

"Ms. Lowell..." His hand trembled, the cup clinking against the saucer.

Sophia tapped her fingers on the desk. "Busy lately, Zachary?"

A cold sweat broke out on his back. "What do you mean—"

"Forget it." She suddenly laughed. "Bring me ice water instead. I need to cool off."

The glass creaked ominously in her grip. Zachary nearly bolted from the room, almost colliding with Ethan as he exited the meeting.

"What's the rush?" Ethan frowned.

Before Zachary could answer, the office door swung open. Sophia leaned against the frame, drawing a finger across her throat in a silent threat.

"Mr. Roscente..." Zachary swallowed hard. "Jessica said Ms. Lowell found out about—"

The words died as Ethan was yanked inside. The door slammed shut with enough force to make the potted plant tremble.

Ethan loosened his tie. "Who pissed you off?"

Sophia drained the ice water in one gulp and slammed the glass down. "Playing dumb?"

Drops slid down her chin, staining her white blouse. Ethan's eyes darkened as he reached to wipe them away—only to have his hand slapped aside.

"The loan sharks," she hissed. "Explain."

Outside, the sunset vanished behind storm clouds, plunging the office into shadows. Ethan paused while undoing his cufflinks. A metal button hit the hardwood floor with a sharp click.

"Let me explain—"

"So you can lie to me again?" She grabbed his suit jacket and hurled it at him. "Ethan Roscente, what the hell do you take me for?"

Signed checks spilled from the pockets, each bearing his flamboyant signature.
###Chapter 335

"Wu Gang, Roscente Securities, Prosperity Bank." Sophia's lips parted slightly as she uttered three key names.

Ethan's fingers tightened around his glass, condensation forming on the crystal surface.

"You found out?"

"If I hadn't stumbled upon it, I'd still be in the dark." Her lips curled into a mocking smile.

He swirled his drink, ice cubes clinking. "What difference does it make?"

"Ethan Roscente!" She shot to her feet, nails digging into her palms. "You're despicable!"

His gaze darkened. "You think I'm playing games with you?"

"Aren't you?" Sophia's eyes reddened. "Watching me scramble for 45 million, forced to beg you—was that entertaining?"

"Seeing me desperate for solutions but powerless—was that fun?"

"Ethan, did fooling me give you some sick satisfaction?"

Her voice trembled with each accusation.

"I wasn't fooling you." He set his glass down with a thud.

"Then explain," she sneered. "Why did my aunt owe you? Why were you always 'coincidentally' there?"

His brow furrowed. "You think I orchestrated this?"

"What else?" Her laugh was icy. "After pulling that bedroom stunt, what lines won't you cross?"

Ethan's expression turned stormy. "Is that really how you see me?"

"Cancel the debt, and I'll believe you."

"Impossible." His voice hardened. "A signed contract is binding. No exceptions."

Sophia's pupils constricted. "What did you say?"

"Business is business." He held her gaze. "Those are the rules."

She laughed suddenly, the sound brittle. "How convenient. Then tell me—why was the interest rate triple the norm?"

His fingers tapped the armrest. "The terms were clear. Your aunt signed willingly."

"Bullshit!" She hurled a cushion at him. "You preyed on her financial ignorance!"

It grazed his shoulder before tumbling to the floor.

Ethan's eyes turned dangerous. "Watch your language."

"I'll say what I want!" She shook with rage. "You're a ruthless profiteer!"

The air froze.

His jaw clenched as he closed the distance. When his shadow engulfed her, she caught his familiar cedar scent.

"Fine. I had ulterior motives." He gripped her chin, voice rough. "Happy with that answer?"
###Chapter 336

Ethan Roscente admitted he had ulterior motives. When Emily Laurent came to borrow money, his first thought was that this was an opportunity.

A chance to keep Sophia Lowell firmly by his side.

The method might be despicable, but he didn’t care—as long as it kept her close.

"Disgusting!" Sophia’s temples throbbed with anger. She suppressed her fury, glaring warily at the dangerous man before her.

Those pitch-black eyes were unfathomable, making her hesitate to act recklessly.

"Fine, we don’t have to terminate the contract." She took a deep breath. "But the terms must be revised."

She had thought she could walk away freely once the three-month probation ended. But now that she knew this was all his scheme, how could she naively believe escape would be so easy?

"You’re in no position to negotiate." Ethan adjusted his cuffs leisurely, his tone brooking no argument.

"Ethan Roscente!" Sophia grabbed a throw pillow and hurled it at him.

It hit his handsome face squarely, tousling his meticulously styled hair.

The air froze.

"Sophia." His voice was icy.

"What?!" She glared back defiantly.

Ethan suddenly closed the distance, pinning her to the couch. He trapped both her wrists with one hand, looking down at her with a cold smirk. "So eager to act like my elder?"

"Be a good boy and call me 'Daddy,'" Sophia taunted, tilting her chin up.

His eyes darkened dangerously.

She abruptly headbutted his chest. Hearing his grunt of pain, she smirked. "Let go, or I’ll make sure you leave here on a stretcher!"

"You’ve learned a lot from Vivian Ashcroft." He released her, his tone laced with warning.

Sophia wiped her wrists in disgust and grabbed her bag to leave. This man had redefined shamelessness for her.

But as she pulled open the door, she froze.

Outside the CEO’s office, a group of people was escorting a familiar figure toward them.
###Chapter 337

Mr. Roscente Sr. stood in a deep red mandarin jacket, his dragon-headed cane thudding heavily against the floor. Behind him trailed seven or eight Roscente executives in tailored suits, all hunched and silent, not daring to breathe too loudly.

"Please watch your step, sir," the butler murmured, steadying the elderly man. His gaze flickered to the figure by the office door, and he quickly leaned in to whisper.

Sophia Lowell tried to retreat, but it was too late.

Her nails dug into her palms as she forced a thin smile. "Good afternoon, Grandfather."

Ethan Roscente rose from behind his desk, his broad shoulders and long legs accentuated by the black suit. He strode forward to take the old man's arm, his voice low. "What brings you here so unexpectedly?"

The patriarch's sharp eyes swept over Sophia before shifting to Ethan. "Am I not welcome?"

The cane struck the floor with a resounding thud.

A cold sweat prickled Sophia's back. She kept her head bowed, barely breathing.

"The meeting just ended," Ethan said smoothly, positioning himself slightly in front of her. "You should have informed me. I would have arranged for your transportation."

The old man snorted, his expression easing slightly. "You haven't come home in two weeks. I thought you'd died out here."

Suddenly, he turned to Sophia, his gaze turning razor-sharp. "What are you doing here?"

Sophia's heart skipped.

Those piercing eyes seemed to strip away every layer of her composure. She remembered Ethan's words—Your face betrays everything.

"I—" she began.

"Emily asked her to deliver some herbal medicine," Ethan cut in. "A prescription from that old physician in Hong Kong."

The patriarch narrowed his eyes. "Are there no doctors in New York?"

The cane tapped three times, each strike vibrating through Sophia's chest.

"Your aunt has always been troublesome," the old man said, staring at Sophia. "Don't follow her example."

Sophia's nails bit deeper into her palms. "Yes, Grandfather."

"Since you've resigned," the patriarch continued abruptly, "stop lingering around Roscente Holdings. Ethan is busy. He has no time for distractions."

The dragon-headed cane hovered in the air, pointing directly at Sophia's face.

She lowered her head, her voice barely audible. "Understood."
###Chapter 338

Ethan's jade ring spun between his fingers. His voice was glacial. "You're old enough to know better. Keep your distance from Jason."

A pause. His gaze sharpened like a blade. "Especially from your uncle. His wedding to Isabella is imminent. Though you're family, gossip would disgrace the Roscentes."

Sophia's nails dug into her palms.

The words slapped her across the face—publicly, brutally.

The patriarch was warning her: every Roscente man was off-limits.

Even Jason, the family's black sheep, wasn't hers to covet.

Worse, the subtext chilled her: the Roscentes monitored her every move.

Her throat tightened. "Understood."

The old man's piercing stare shifted to the tall figure beside her. "Ethan. Do I make myself clear?"

That look could flay a man's pretense bare.

Sophia's breath hitched.

This was a warning for Ethan.

She kept her head down, only hearing his bored retort: "Clear about what? I'm swamped with work, not riddles."

A derisive chuckle. "If you're bored, recall Aunt Jiang from her tour. Maybe she'll gift me a baby brother."

"Insolent!" The patriarch glared, yet his expression softened inexplicably. "Jiang Wu's occupied with her performances."

Jiang Wu.

The name sent a jolt through Sophia.

The Roscentes' enigmatic third mistress.

A thirty-year-old opera star who'd become the patriarch's companion four years ago—unofficially, yet untouchable.

Her aunt Emily had cautioned her during her first Roscente dinner.

Jiang's career had skyrocketed, keeping her from the estate. Sophia had never met her.

She'd dismissed the rumors—until now, witnessing the tycoon's unguarded tenderness.

Even the mighty Mr. Roscente Sr. bent for beauty.

From her periphery, Ethan smirked cryptically, steering the patriarch toward his office.

Sophia was deciphering that smile when the closing door released the old man's final decree:

"Your wedding to Isabella—next week..."

Her blood turned to ice.

Next week.

Seven days.

Good. This farce would finally end.

"Ms. Lowell?"

Zachary's voice snapped her back.

"Mr. Roscente asked me to escort you out."

She shot him a frosty glance. "Unnecessary."

He wisely stayed silent.

Of all days for her to visit Roscente Holdings—she'd stumbled upon their loan shark dealings.
###Chapter 339

Sophia had just left Ethan's office when Mr. Roscente Sr. emerged from the elevator, leaning heavily on his cane.

He paused at the entrance of Roscente Tower, tilting his head to study the cold glare reflecting off the glass facade. His thumb absently traced the dragon engraving on his walking stick.

"Sir?" The butler spoke softly.

The old man's gaze sharpened as he turned. "Something's off between Ethan and that Lowell girl."

The butler's pulse jumped. "You mean—"

"That face is too striking." Mr. Roscente snorted. "Since when has my grandson lacked female company?"

The butler hesitated. Everyone knew Ethan Roscente avoided women like the plague—he'd even dodged the Valentine family's marriage proposal. Sophia's sudden appearance was indeed suspicious.

"Dig deeper." The patriarch slid into the car. "I want her entire background."

The butler immediately made calls as the black sedan pulled away. The rearview mirror captured the old man's stormy expression.

——

Inside the executive suite, Ethan tapped his phone screen with dangerous rhythm.

"Why was he here unannounced?"

Zachary wiped his brow. "My oversight. We received no advance notice."

The air turned glacial. Ethan's voice dropped below freezing. "Consider your bonus forfeited."

Zachary's heart twisted, but he kept silent. Leaning closer at Ethan's gesture, his eyes gradually brightened at the whispered instructions.

——

The next afternoon, Sophia was intercepted by her academic advisor outside the lecture hall.

"Congratulations!" The advisor whispered excitedly. "You're on the tenure list!"

Sophia blinked. Three months of grueling work had finally paid off—she'd secured her foothold in New York.

"But watch out for Professor Langley." The advisor glanced around nervously. "With his connections, he won't take this rejection lightly."

Sophia nodded, tightening her grip on the lesson plans. She remembered the elevator encounter yesterday—that suited man's gaze had made her feel like merchandise on display.

Around the corner, Professor Langley ended a call with a scowl. "Well? Who's backing Sophia Lowell?"
###Chapter 340

An image of Professor Zhang flashed through Sophia Lowell's mind. She nodded slightly. "Thanks for the heads-up, Margaret. I'll treat you to dinner after the promotion."

Margaret Kemnis, the academic advisor, was a few years older than Sophia. Outgoing and straightforward, she never put on airs as a faculty member. Students affectionately called her "Margaret," and Sophia was no exception. Both hailing from Seattle, Margaret had always looked out for her, making her the closest colleague Sophia had at the university.

Margaret was always the first to keep Sophia informed about campus affairs.

The news of her impending promotion had lifted Sophia's spirits these past few days. Becoming a full-time faculty member meant she could return to Seattle—one step closer to breaking free from Ethan Roscente. Even with the $45 million debt still looming, at least she wouldn't have to constantly brace for Ethan's sudden appearances.

Today was the day the promotion list would be announced. Sophia arrived at work brimming with anticipation, only to find the office atmosphere strangely tense. Colleagues' gazes lingered on her before darting away the moment she met their eyes.

The odd tension persisted until after class, when she ran into Margaret in the hallway—and the discomfort peaked.

"Did something happen on the campus forum?" Sophia pulled Margaret aside. "Everyone's looking at me weirdly."

Margaret hesitated. "Well..."

She gritted her teeth. "You'll find out sooner or later. Your name isn't on the promotion list."

"What?" Sophia's pupils constricted. "But you said I was on it last time."

Margaret dragged her into a corner, lowering her voice. "Dylan Langley pulled strings and bumped you off."

"That's against protocol." Sophia frowned. "His attendance records and student evaluations are far worse than mine."

Margaret sighed helplessly. "With the job market so tight this year, these positions are all prearranged. That Dylan didn't even meet the hiring criteria—he graduated from a second-tier college. But who made the dean his uncle? The department head wants that promotion, so of course he'd curry favor."

"I see." Sophia's lips curled into a cold smile.

"Pure nepotism," Margaret muttered with disdain.

Just then, a figure sauntered into view. Margaret shot Sophia a meaningful look. "Speak of the devil."

Dylan Langley strolled over, cradling a thermos. He paused at the sight of them, took a deliberate sip of his goji berry tea, and raised an eyebrow smugly. "Talking behind my back? Too bad the promotion's still mine."

His gaze swept over Sophia with contempt. "I told you when I asked you out—being my girlfriend comes with perks. But you had to get cozy with Professor Orlando. Where's he now when you need him?"
###Chapter 341

At the start of the semester, Dylan Langley had pursued Sophia Lowell relentlessly, only to be gently rejected.

He turned hostile on the spot, sneering, "You'll regret this."

Sophia brushed it off. Since their paths rarely crossed, she soon forgot about the incident.

She never expected him to stab her in the back at a critical moment.

Margaret Kemnis couldn't stand his smug expression. Deliberately, she remarked, "You've got spinach stuck in your teeth."

Dylan frantically checked his phone camera, only to realize he'd been tricked. His face darkened with fury.

"That woman is nothing but bad luck!" He jabbed a finger at Sophia. "Anyone close to her ends up ruined. You'd better stay away unless you want to lose your job."

Margaret scoffed. "Who are you trying to scare? My husband would love nothing more than for me to quit and be a lady of leisure. At least I wouldn’t have to put up with certain disgusting people here."

Her wealthy background gave her words undeniable weight.

Dylan deflated instantly. Then he turned to Sophia with a sleazy grin. "It’s not too late to change your mind. Be my girlfriend, and I’ll put in a good word with the dean. You might just keep your position."

Disgusted, Sophia wrinkled her nose and tugged Margaret away.

"Everyone knows he only got his permanent position through connections," Margaret whispered. "But no one dares cross his powerful backers."

Sophia pressed her lips together and nodded.

"If you fail the internship evaluation at month-end, you’re out," Margaret fretted. "Why not ask Professor Orlando for help? He has the dean’s ear."

"No." Sophia shook her head. "I’ve already owed him too many favors."

Margaret sighed. "You’re too proud for your own good. Take a page from Dylan’s book—thicken your skin a little."

"I’d rather stay true to myself," Sophia said with a light laugh.

After afternoon classes, Sophia headed straight to the dean’s office.

Even if the odds were slim, she would fight for herself one last time.
###Chapter 342

"Director Aldridge, my internship evaluation score was clearly the highest. Why isn't my name on the final admission list?"

Sophia stood before the office desk, her fingertips turning white from gripping too tightly.

Frederick Aldridge slowly unscrewed his thermos. Steam rose as he offered a benign smile. "Sophia, the competition was quite fierce this time—"

"My name was on last month's public notice." Sophia cut him off. "Why was it replaced with Dylan Langley's?"

The thermos slammed onto the desk with a thud.

"Who showed you that list?" Aldridge's expression darkened instantly. "That violates protocol!"

Sophia smirked. She certainly wouldn't reveal that Margaret from the academic office had tipped her off.

"Dylan missed three shifts, took four personal leaves, and has five student complaints about his inappropriate jokes." She pulled a folder from her bag. "Should I submit this evidence to the disciplinary committee?"

A bead of sweat trickled down Aldridge's temple.

"Young people shouldn't be so inflexible." He lowered his voice. "Dylan's uncle is President Rubinstein. Surely you understand my position?"

Sophia's pupils constricted. So that was it.

"Here's what I'll do," Aldridge suddenly adopted a conciliatory tone. "I'll approve three extra months' salary for you, plus a recommendation letter—"

"No need."

As Sophia turned to leave, a cold laugh followed her. "Don't think being close to Professor Orlando makes you special. He's being transferred soon."

Her hand froze on the doorknob.

So this scheme had been targeting her all along.
###Chapter 343
The office air turned to ice.

Director Frederick Aldridge's greasy face flushed crimson as his fingers drummed impatiently on the desk. "Professor Lowell, don't push your luck. I'm giving you an out here. Understand?"

Sophia Lowell slammed her lesson plans onto the desk, papers rustling sharply.

"I've taught for three years with the highest exam scores every semester." She met his gaze unflinchingly. "And now you're telling me none of that matters compared to someone's uncle being the principal?"

Cicadas screeched outside the window.

The director's Adam's apple bobbed as he gulped tea noisily. "Young people should learn to read the room. Dylan Langley's uncle is about to become deputy director of the education bureau. What do you have to compete with that?"

Murky swirls formed in the teacup.

"So the teaching evaluations were just for show?" Sophia suddenly laughed. "You should've said so earlier. I wouldn't have stayed up preparing lessons till 2 AM every night."

The doorknob turned abruptly.

Dylan Langley leaned against the doorframe, three shirt buttons undone to display his gold chain. "Well, well, if it isn't our star professor Sophia Lowell." He whistled. "Came to cry to the director?"

Sunlight sliced through the blinds, painting alternating light and shadow on the floor.

Sophia turned slowly. "No classes today, Professor Langley?"

"My uncle suggested I... bond with leadership." Dylan sauntered to the director's side and grabbed imported chocolates from the desk. "Someone always covers my classes. Unlike certain people who take things too seriously."

Director Aldridge chuckled nervously, pushing the entire box toward him.

Sophia's nails dug into her palms. "You plagiarized my lesson plan for last week's open class."

"So what?" Dylan tore the wrapper. "You should feel honored. Do you know how many people would kill to have my attention?"

Sparrows scattered outside the window.

Sophia suddenly raised her phone. "Professor Langley, I recorded everything you just said." She waved the screen. "Imagine how surprised your deputy director uncle would be if this went viral?"

Dylan's expression froze.

Director Aldridge shot up, his chair scraping loudly. "Sophia Lowell! Do you realize what you're doing?"

"Perfectly." She tapped the save button. "Documenting our model professor's pearls of wisdom."

Dylan's gold chain glinted harshly in the sunlight. "You fucking bitch!" He raised a fist.

Sophia stepped back deliberately under the surveillance camera. "Go ahead." She pointed at her face. "Let the whole school see how nepotism works."

The office fell silent except for the AC's hum.

Beads of sweat formed on the director's forehead. "Professor Lowell, let's discuss this reasonably—"

"Nothing to discuss." Sophia pocketed her phone. "I want the promotion list corrected by tomorrow. Otherwise, this recording goes to the education bureau's whistleblower email."

As she turned, she heard Dylan hurl chocolates against the wall.

A draft in the hallway lifted her blouse hem.

Behind her, the director's furious curses and Dylan's tantrum faded. Sophia pulled out her vibrating phone—Professor Theodore Orlando's name flashed onscreen.

The sunlight suddenly seemed blinding.
###Chapter 344
"Snap!"

Dylan Langley was in the middle of berating Sophia Lowell when the sharp sound of a camera shutter cut him off.

Sophia turned to see Jason Roscente leaning against the hallway corner, phone raised and aimed directly at Dylan.

"Professor Langley, that was quite the inspiring speech." Jason waved his phone. "I got the whole thing on video. Can't wait to share it with all those hardworking seniors—let them know studying is pointless when connections get you ahead."

Sophia's pulse jumped. Jason had clearly overheard everything.

Dylan's face drained of color. In this university filled with first-generation students, his words were career suicide.

"You misunderstood!" Dylan flapped his hands in panic. "That's not what I meant—"

"Then enlighten me." Jason's smile turned icy. "Did you or did you not say the promotion was rigged? That education is worthless?"

"I only meant—"

"Oh, and one more thing." Jason raised his voice. "Didn't you mention your uncle being the dean?"

"That's bullshit! My aunt's husband is the dean!" Dylan blurted before realizing his mistake.

Jason's lips curved. "Ah. That explains how you stole someone's promotion so easily."

Dylan finally recognized the trap, his face twisting with rage. "You set me up!"

"Took you long enough." Jason scoffed. "And you're supposed to educate young minds?"

A crowd of students had gathered. Jason made a show of checking his phone. "Three million followers on Twitter. This video will make you famous overnight."

Department Chair Frederick Aldridge arrived, his expression darkening at the scene. "What's going on here?"

His glare landed on Sophia. "Miss Lowell! How dare you cause trouble with students!"

Jason stepped between them. "Ah, the chair who covers up nepotism. Perfect timing—you're in the video too. Should we launch your influencer careers together?"

Frederick looked bewildered. "What video? What nepotism?"

Dylan stomped his foot in frustration, unable to form a coherent response.
###Chapter 345

Dylan Langley's face twisted like melted wax. He opened his mouth to defend himself, but Jason Roscente cut him off first.

"Still playing dumb to cover for your buddy?" Jason waved his phone. "Your musclehead here already spilled everything. Want me to play the video of you stealing the promotion spot right now?"

Frederick Aldridge paled. He rushed forward in three quick strides. "Nonsense! The evaluation process was completely fair! Keep spreading lies, and I'll make sure you regret it!"

"Lies?" Jason tilted his head, spinning his phone on his palm. "Perfect. I'll just report this to the disciplinary committee right now. If I'm wrong, expel me. But if I'm right..." His playful smirk vanished, replaced by a razor-sharp glare. "Your careers won't survive this."

Before anyone could react, he pressed the call button.

Frederick lunged, slapping the phone from Jason's hand. His polished shoe crushed the screen with a sickening crack. Shards of glass glittered under the sunlight like ice.

"Try me," Frederick snarled.

"Destroying evidence?" Jason's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper.

"Bullshit!" Dylan puffed out his chest. "This is the administration building! You can't cause trouble here! One more word and you're expelled!"

"Expel me?" Jason scoffed. "Who the hell do you think you are?"

"Who are you calling out?!" Dylan's face turned crimson.

"You. Trash."

Jason lifted his chin, his gaze dripping with contempt—like he was staring at a rat in a sewer.

"Outrageous! What department are you from? Who's your advisor? You're getting disciplinary action today!" Frederick slammed his fist on the desk.

"And who the hell are you?" Jason slammed the desk harder, making the furniture shudder. "Old man!"

Sophia Lowell: "..."

Are these two having a pissing contest?

Frederick trembled with rage before rounding on Sophia. "This is all your fault!"

He knew exactly who to bully. His finger jabbed toward her face, stopping just short of her nose.
###Chapter 346

Sophia's lips curled into a mocking smile. "Got caught with your own dirty laundry by a student, and now you're blaming me? With that talent for shifting blame, you should join the circus."

Frederick Aldridge clutched his chest, gasping for breath, his face deathly pale.

Jason Roscente lazily kicked the shattered phone on the ground. "So, accomplice, how are we settling the score for smashing my phone?" He dangled the broken device with a wicked grin. "Thought destroying evidence would save you? I set up auto-upload. The whole internet gets a front-row seat to your little show the second this phone dies."

"You're dead!"

Dylan Langley saw red, swinging a fist straight at Jason's face.

"Move!"

Sophia yanked Jason's arm, pulling him aside.

The punch grazed Jason's ear, but Sophia's momentum sent him stumbling into her. They stood at the top of the stairs, and the collision threw Sophia off balance. She teetered backward, the sudden weightlessness making her grip the railing instinctively.

At the last second, a tall figure descended the stairs in quick strides. Strong arms encircled her slender waist, the crisp scent of cedar enveloping her. Sophia looked up, shaken, into Ethan Roscente's fathomless eyes.

He braced one hand on the railing, half his body suspended over the stairwell, yet shielding her completely. The veins on his exposed wrist beneath his suit sleeve stood taut with unyielding strength.

"Must every reunion be this dramatic?" His low voice brushed her ear.

Sophia pushed out of his embrace, stepping back to straighten her clothes. "All thanks to you."

"Mr. Roscente!" The principal hurried over, sweat beading on his temples. "Are you hurt?"

Sophia gave a slight nod. "Principal Rubinstein."

The principal barely acknowledged her before turning to the chaos, his expression darkening. "What is the meaning of this? Explain yourselves!"

Ethan dusted off his sleeve casually. "Jason, enlighten them."

Instantly, Jason pounced on the opportunity, his voice dripping with grievance. "Uncle! They ganged up on me! I'm done with this dump of a school!"

The principal's pupils dilated—this troublemaker was the seventh son of the Roscente family?

He forced an obsequious smile. "Now, Jason, let's talk this through. Dropping out is—"

"Since when do you call the shots?" Jason cut him off with a cold laugh, his gaze sharp as a blade.
###Chapter 347

"Of course we can handle this."

The principal's obsequious bowing made Dean Frederick Aldridge and Professor Dylan Langley exchange nervous glances. Before they could speak, Jason Roscente cut in.

He pointed at Dylan. "If you're so capable, start by dealing with this professor. He's been preaching that education is worthless, claiming underprivileged students like us are born to serve silver-spoon elites like him—"

"Principal, don't listen to his lies!" Dylan interrupted in panic.

His defense sounded feeble against Jason's accusations.

Jason raised his voice. "Oh, and he also said you only got your position through nepotism. That's why he dared steal Sophia Lowell's tenure spot right under your nose."

Clutching his chest dramatically, Jason added, "I have a weak heart. If Ms. Lowell hadn't caught me, I'd be hospitalized by now."

The principal's face darkened as he glared at the ashen-faced dean and professor. "Laying hands on a student? Smashing phones? Is this how you uphold professional standards?"

Beads of sweat formed on Frederick's forehead. "Principal, Jason started—"

"Started what?" The principal snapped. "Apologize to him immediately!"

Fuming but cornered, the two men muttered reluctant apologies.

Jason scoffed. "What about Ms. Lowell's tenure?"

Ethan Roscente chose that moment to speak, his tone laced with mockery. "So promotions here depend on connections, not merit?" His sidelong glance caught Sophia's tightened brow.

This woman. Even when wronged, she resented his interference.

He yanked the retreating Sophia to his side. "Apparently the Roscente name carries no weight here if we can't even secure a tenure position."

"The Roscentes?"

"Your niece?"

Frederick and Dylan froze as if struck by lightning. Their surreptitious scrutiny of Ethan quickly confirmed the identity of the Roscente family's heir.

Ethan Roscente—the crown prince of the Roscente dynasty.
###Chapter 348

Sophia shot Ethan Roscente a warning glare, silently urging him to stop talking.

She just wanted to be an ordinary teacher without any connection to the Roscente family.

Ethan ignored her, ruffling her hair with a fond chuckle. "Silly girl, why refuse a ready-made advantage? I donated an entire building to this school. Can’t I even get you a spot?"

"Roscentes never settle for less." He pinched her cheek. "Remember that, little niece."

Dylan Langley’s gaze darted between them.

As a man, he instantly recognized the look in Ethan’s eyes—it wasn’t the way an uncle should look at his niece.

It was more like...

He quickly lowered his head, not daring to watch further.

Sophia flushed at Ethan’s sudden intimacy. Even if he wanted to back her up, did he have to be so hands-on in public? She wished the ground would swallow her.

Under Ethan’s forceful intervention, the position was returned to Sophia. Dylan opened his mouth to protest, but a sharp look from the principal silenced him.

"Don’t push your luck," the principal muttered in warning.

Frederick Aldridge immediately caught on, dragging Dylan away.

The principal turned to Sophia with an ingratiating smile. "Professor Lowell, this was an administrative oversight. Thank you for catching it before it became a scandal."

Sophia knew it was favoritism disguised as a mistake, but she played along. "You’re too kind, Principal Rubinstein."

"Mr. Roscente, does this resolution meet your approval?" the principal asked cautiously.

Ethan smirked. "You’ve handled it fairly. I trust with your leadership, my niece won’t face further… inconveniences."

Beads of sweat formed on the principal’s forehead. "Of course! Professor Lowell can come directly to me with any concerns!"

Once they were alone, Sophia jerked her hand away. "Are you out of your mind?"
###Chapter 349

Ethan Roscente frowned deeply. "I stood up for you, and this is how you repay me?"

His voice carried a hint of hurt.

Sophia Lowell curled her lips into a cold smile. "Did I ask for your help?"

She shook off his grip. "All I want is to work in peace. I don’t want anything to do with the Roscentes."

With her internship ending soon, his interference would only bring chaos.

Ethan's expression darkened. "Is being associated with me that unbearable?"

"Yes." Sophia met his gaze directly. "The Roscentes are out of my league."

She turned to leave.

Ethan grabbed her wrist. "Don’t take my grandfather’s words to heart."

"I think he was right." She yanked her hand free. "You crossed a line just now."

His eyes narrowed.

"For you, it’s just a casual remark." Her voice turned icy. "But have you considered the consequences?"

She pointed toward the dean’s office. "You called me your niece, yet you manhandled me. What will they think when they realize the truth?"

Ethan’s face stiffened.

"A slut seducing her uncle?" Sophia sneered. "Or a homewrecker breaking up an engagement?"

She enunciated each word. "Rumors can destroy lives."

His Adam’s apple bobbed. "I’ll handle it."

"How?" She gave him a mocking look. "Can you silence every gossip?"

Her gaze shifted to Jason Roscente cowering in the corner. "One more tip-off, and Vivian Ashcroft will never speak to you again."

Jason wailed, "That’s not fair—"

Sophia strode away without looking back.

Ethan blocked her path again. "We need to talk."

"Not interested." She shoved past him and left.
###Chapter 350

The resolute figure walking away pierced Ethan Roscente's eyes like shards of glass. His fists clenched until his knuckles turned white, the fury in his chest with no outlet.

"She's utterly heartless," he muttered under his breath, though a flicker of helplessness crossed his gaze.

Jason Roscente cautiously approached, his voice barely above a whisper. "Uncle Ethan... I think Sophia's rejecting you because of your upcoming marriage..."

Ethan whipped his head around, his glare sharp as a blade.

Jason shrank back but mustered his courage. "You can't give her commitment, yet you keep clinging to her. That's pretty messed up—"

A sharp crack cut through the air.

Jason paled as he watched Ethan's phone screen shatter in his grip. Glass shards embedded deep into his palm, blood dripping between his fingers.

"That Bugatti Veyron..." Ethan suddenly spoke, his voice terrifyingly soft.

Jason's eyes lit up—until he heard the rest.

"—I'm selling it for scrap metal."

"No, Uncle Ethan!" Jason wailed, lunging forward. "I was wrong! I'll go reflect on my mistakes right now!"

Ethan shoved him aside. Before leaving, he tossed over his shoulder, cold as ice:

"Your Porsche is next."

Meanwhile, Sophia Lowell was absorbed in reviewing project files on her laptop. This was her last chance to secure a position at Luming Architectural Studio.

As dusk settled, she rubbed her stiff neck. The empty fridge stared back at her. Sighing, she grabbed her jacket to head out for groceries.

The moment she stepped downstairs, she froze.

Ethan strode toward her, his black trench coat billowing in the night wind.

"Come with me," he demanded, reaching for her wrist.

Sophia jerked back, wariness flashing in her eyes. "Mr. Roscente, maintain your dignity."

"Just this once." His voice was low, brooking no argument.

"I said no." Her grip tightened on the grocery bag, nails digging into her palms.
###Chapter 351 

"You're going."

Ethan Roscente's tone brooked no argument.

Sophia Lowell turned her face away, lips pressed into a stubborn line.

He suddenly leaned in, warm breath brushing her ear. "Consider it a farewell dinner." His voice dropped lower. "Unless you're having second thoughts?"

The phrase "farewell dinner" made Sophia's heart skip.

She whirled around to meet his fathomless gaze.

"After this meal, we're even." A ghost of a smile played on his lips. "I won't bother you again."

Sophia studied him suspiciously.

This wasn't Ethan's usual style.

Without warning, his arm snaked around her waist, pulling her flush against him. "Walk there yourself, or I'll carry you."

Sophia collided with his chest, drawing knowing glances from passersby.

Her ears burned with embarrassment as she surrendered.

The restaurant was an understated gem—a private Suzhou-style garden estate.

Following a winding corridor, a cheongsam-clad hostess led them to their private dining room.

Beyond the latticed windows, an artfully arranged rock garden with flowing water created a serene atmosphere. Sophia felt her tension ease despite herself.

After ordering, Ethan suddenly made a call. "Bring her in."

Sophia's head snapped up.

"Relax." He scoffed. "I keep my promises."

The door opened to reveal his bodyguard. "Mr. Roscente, she's here."

Ethan nodded.

The door swung open again, and Tiffany Roscente stumbled inside.

The once-pampered socialite now looked disheveled, her eyes unfocused.

Spotting Sophia, she lunged with a shriek. "You bitch! This is all your fault!"

Bodyguards restrained her flailing limbs.

"Uncle's bewitched by you!" Tiffany screamed hysterically. "Just like Isabella said—you're nothing but a cheap seductress!"

Ethan's expression turned glacial.

"Apparently solitary confinement didn't teach you manners."
###Chapter 352

The bodyguard's fingers clamped around Tiffany Roscente's shoulder like iron pincers. His knee drove viciously into the back of her legs.

Tiffany let out a muffled groan as she crashed onto the marble floor.

Ever since Zachary Evans had dragged her back to New York, she'd been imprisoned in this lightless basement. Hunger and thirst gnawed at her, pushing her to the brink of madness.

Now, seeing Sophia Lowell, raw hatred burned in her eyes. Her nails dug deep into her palms.

"Uncle!" she shrieked hysterically. "I'm your blood niece! This... this promiscuous woman who sleeps around—how dare she—"

Ethan Roscente rose slowly. The crisp tap of his Oxfords echoed through the chamber.

He leaned down, his whisper venomous as a serpent's hiss. "Guess which will reach the Roscentes first—news of your death, or your corpse?"

Tiffany shuddered violently. Her pupils contracted in shock.

She couldn't believe what she'd just heard.

"I..." Her throat was too parched to form words.

Ethan straightened, looking down at her with icy disdain. "Now. Do you understand what's required?"

Trembling like a leaf in a storm, Tiffany crawled on hands and knees to Sophia's feet.

"Forgive me..." Her forehead pressed against the cold floor. "I was delusional... I overstepped..."

Sophia took half a step back, brows furrowed.

She hadn't expected Ethan to exact revenge on her behalf like this.

Nor had she imagined the haughty Roscente heiress would ever grovel before her like a beaten dog.

Ethan stood beside her, his gaze unfathomably dark.

"Satisfied?" he murmured.
###Chapter 353

Tiffany Roscente knelt on the floor, her nails digging deep into her palms.

Never in her life had she felt such humiliation.

"Sorry..." The word was forced through gritted teeth.

Sophia Lowell took half a step back, her skirt brushing against Tiffany's knee.

"Get up. You look like I'm bullying you."

Tiffany's head snapped up, hatred flashing in her eyes before she could hide it.

Ethan Roscente stood by the window, his silhouette imposing against the backlight.

"Not sincere enough." His voice was soft, but it made Tiffany tremble.

"Uncle!" Her voice turned shrill. "I'm already on my knees—what more do you want?"

Sophia suddenly found it absurd.

She turned to Ethan. "Let it go. Forced apologies mean nothing."

Tiffany seized the lifeline, scrambling to her feet. "See? Even she said—"

"Silence." One glance from Ethan, and the bodyguard clamped a hand on Tiffany's shoulder.

Sophia rubbed her temples, exhausted by the farce.

"Just let her leave."

Ethan studied her for a few seconds before asking, "Afraid she'll retaliate?"

The room fell dead silent.

Tiffany's face paled.

Sophia chuckled. "What's there to fear? It's just tiresome."

She stepped close to Tiffany until their breaths mingled.

"Remember. This is your last chance."

After Tiffany was escorted out, Ethan handed Sophia a cup of steaming tea.

"Your hands are freezing."

Sophia ignored it, picking up her bag instead. "Dinner's over, the show's done. I'm leaving."

Night enveloped the neighborhood, streetlights stretching their shadows long.

"Sophia."

He suddenly called her full name.

She paused mid-step.

Ethan's voice carried on the night breeze. "If I could resolve all the problems... would you consider—"

He didn't finish, but she understood.

Her back still turned, she smiled bitterly.

"Ethan, you can't even control Tiffany."

The words stabbed straight through his chest.

He strode forward, gripping her shoulders.

"Give me three months."

Under the moonlight, the determination in his eyes burned fiercely.

"Just three months. I'll show you a different Roscente family."

Sophia searched his gaze—there was a sincerity she'd never seen before.

The wind tangled her hair, scattering her barely audible reply.

"Fine."
###Chapter 354

His voice was feather-light, laced with tentative uncertainty, yet it pierced the silence of the car with startling clarity.

Sophia's fingers tightened abruptly on the door handle. She whipped her head around to face him. "What did you say?"

He lifted his gaze, eyes burning with intensity. "I said, give me a chance. Let me give you a future."

"What future?" Her voice trembled.

"Marriage." The word dropped between them, solid and unshakable.

Sophia's pupils contracted sharply. Her heart stuttered to a halt.

Was he drunk?

Or was this some dream?

Ethan Roscente, heir to the Roscente empire, wanted to marry her?

A thousand questions exploded in her mind, yet those two words ignited like wildfire, melting the frozen surface of her heart in an instant.

She forced a brittle smile. "That's not funny."

"I don't joke." His gaze never wavered.

Her fingertips shook. "What about your engagement to Isabella? How am I supposed to believe you now?"

"Give me time." His voice lowered. "I'll handle it."

Handle it.

She let out a cold laugh and withdrew her hand. "Come back when you've actually handled it."

He stared at his empty palm, voice rough. "You don't trust me?"

"I don't dare." Her tone was eerily calm.

For one reckless moment, she'd almost nodded. But reason had won out in the end.

She had too much to lose.

The car plunged into heavy silence. Finally, Ethan sighed. "Go home."

Sophia stepped out mechanically, her silhouette disappearing into the elevator.

Ethan loosened his tie, lit a cigarette, and dialed a number. "Speed things up. I can't wait any longer."

Two sleepless nights passed.

Sophia tossed and turned, despite telling herself not to take his words seriously. That damn proposal looped endlessly in her mind like a cursed incantation.

"Sophia?" Vivian waved a hand in front of her glazed eyes. "What's wrong with you lately?"

For days, Sophia had been distracted—pausing mid-call, staring blankly at meals, zoning out just like this.

Vivian pressed a worried hand to her forehead. "Are you sick?"
###Chapter 355

Sophia snapped out of her thoughts and shook her head lightly. "It's nothing."

She stood up and walked toward the bathroom.

Vivian eyed her retreating figure suspiciously, her gaze landing on the phone left on the coffee table. A mischievous glint flashed in her eyes as she snatched it up and deftly entered the passcode.

The search history was filled with keywords like "Ethan Roscente's wedding" and "Isabella Valentine's wedding dress."

Vivian's heart clenched.

News of the Ethan-Isabella union had been everywhere these past two days, impossible to avoid even if one tried. But Sophia deliberately searching for it went beyond casual interest.

She hadn't cared about this wedding before. Why the sudden change?

The bathroom door clicked open. Sophia emerged to find Vivian staring blankly at the phone in her hands.

"What are you looking at?" She reached out to pinch her friend's shoulder.

Vivian turned the screen toward her. "You've been distracted these past few days. Is it because you can't let Ethan go?"

Sophia's lashes fluttered. She leaned back against the couch, the chandelier above making her eyes sting.

"It's not that I can't let go," she murmured, her voice feather-light. "It's that I finally did, and now he's stirring things up again."

Vivian immediately sprang up. "What do you mean?"

"Promise me you won't overreact."

After extracting the promise, Sophia briefly recounted that night's events.

True to form, Vivian exploded. She jumped onto the couch, shouting, "That's bullshit! That bastard just wants to have his cake and eat it too! If he really wanted to fix things, why wait until now? Only when the whole city's talking does he suddenly play the devoted lover?"

Sophia tugged her back down. "I didn't believe him."

"But you didn't completely disbelieve him either," Vivian countered. "Otherwise, why would you secretly search for all this?"

A bitter smile touched Sophia's lips. "Am I pathetic?"

"It's called being human," Vivian said, unusually serious. "If emotions could be turned on and off, the world wouldn't be full of heartbroken fools."

She suddenly lowered her voice. "But this time, I advise you not to get your hopes up. Calling off the wedding now would be a slap in the face to both the Roscente and Valentine families. Ethan doesn't have the guts for that."

"I know," Sophia said, watching the darkening sky outside. "I just want to see how this ends."

That ending came sooner than expected.

To celebrate becoming a full-time employee, she invited Margaret and a few colleagues to dinner. Afterward, someone suggested going to a bar, and the group happily agreed.

Strangely, after Ethan publicly acknowledged her identity at the university, the expected gossip never materialized. Even Frederick, who loved spreading rumors, avoided mentioning her.

This eerie silence felt like an invisible hand was at work.

Sophia traced her fingers over her phone. That name in her contacts remained un-dialed.
###Chapter 356

The private lounge buzzed with lively discussions about Ethan Roscente and Isabella Valentine's upcoming wedding. Sophia Lowell felt suffocated. She excused herself to the restroom, escaping the noisy crowd.

The bar's labyrinthine corridors disoriented her. A familiar potted plant by a door made her mistake it for her own lounge. She pushed it open.

The sight stole her breath.

Ethan's social circle filled the spacious lounge. Some shook dice cups, others danced wildly, a few belted love songs into microphones.

Ethan leaned casually against the poker table in an unbuttoned white shirt and gray vest, his sleeves rolled up to reveal toned forearms. A suit jacket draped carelessly over a chair. A cigarette dangled between his slender fingers.

The real gut punch was the girl beside him—a fresh-faced college graduate with doe eyes, blushing as she stole glances at him. Sophia saw her younger self reflected in that timid gaze.

"Mr. Roscente, which card should I play?" The girl's sugary voice pierced the air.

Ethan chuckled, covering her hand to guide her choice. Felix Roland protested from across the table: "Cheating!"

Raucous laughter erupted.

Sophia stood frozen in the doorway. She should leave. Yet some unseen force rooted her in place.

"New girl?" Someone whistled.

Ethan looked up. His cigarette crumpled when their eyes met.

"Damn," Felix muttered under his breath.

The music played on, but the atmosphere turned glacial. Sophia watched Ethan's Adam's apple bob. The girl beside him followed his gaze, confused.

Cigarette ash drifted soundlessly onto the poker table.
###Chapter 357

Why did Miss Sophia suddenly appear?

Zachary Evans felt cold sweat bead on his forehead.

In a flash, Ethan Roscente stood and strode toward the door.

Every gaze in the private room locked onto the unexpected arrival.

Sophia Lowell frowned slightly by the doorway, her eyes sweeping over the unfamiliar woman beside Ethan.

He stopped before her, voice flat. "Looking for me?"

Sophia's throat tightened. "Wrong room," she lied.

Leaning lazily against the doorframe, he smirked. "Thought you came to catch me cheating."

"A junior shouldn't meddle in elders' private affairs." Her nails dug into her palms.

His gaze burned. "Nothing to ask?"

She wanted to demand if his promise that night had been a lie—but this scene answered everything.

"Nothing," she lifted her chin.

"How convenient." Ethan's laugh was icy.

Her eyes frosted over. "Who gave you the right to act like this?"

She was the one whose feelings had been toyed with.

As Ethan opened his mouth, the woman suddenly clung to his arm. "Mr. Roscente, shall we continue?"

The blatant provocation drew a soft laugh from Sophia.

"Anything else?" Ethan's tone turned impatient.

Her heart constricted. Turning sharply, her stiletto nearly twisted beneath her.

Only when her figure vanished did Ethan shake off the woman's grip and light a cigarette.

Felix Roland approached, swirling his drink. "Sophia's eyes were red."

"Her?" Ethan exhaled smoke. "That heartless creature."

He jerked his chin at Zachary. "Find out why she was here."

The dismissed woman bit her lip in frustration.

Around the corridor's bend, Sophia slid down the wall, knees giving way.

Tears blurred her vision. She scrubbed at them furiously, only for more to fall.

Her phone rang abruptly.

Seeing Margaret's caller ID, she hung up with a shaky breath. Her fingers trembled as she typed a reply.
###Chapter 358

The phone screen went dark as Sophia Lowell took a deep breath.

She turned to find a waiter for directions, but collided abruptly with a solid chest.

"My apologies..." She stepped back hastily.

"Miss Lowell?"

That voice froze her in place.

Kevin Heilbronn leaned casually against the corridor's ornate wall, his suit jacket slung over one shoulder and tie loosened. He studied her through half-lidded eyes like she was some amusing specimen.

"What a coincidence." His lips curled in a mocking smile. "Running somewhere in such a hurry?"

Sophia maintained her composure while increasing the distance between them. "Mr. Heilbronn."

He suddenly closed the gap, the mingled scents of tobacco and cologne assaulting her senses. "See something you shouldn't have?" he murmured.

Her nails dug into her palms.

"Heard Mr. Roscente brought some starlet tonight." Kevin whistled low. "Tsk. Has our dear secretary fallen out of favor?"

The corridor lights suddenly seemed too bright.

"Move." Her voice could have frosted glass.

Instead of retreating, he advanced until his polished shoes nearly touched her gown's hem. "My buddy's still in ICU. Valrose Group's stock crashed three times straight. Know who's responsible?"

Sophia's head snapped up.

"Ethan Roscente." Kevin's grin turned savage. "Just because someone touched your hand, he nearly crippled Dominic Valrose."

Her blood turned to ice.

"Impossible," she heard herself say.

Kevin whipped out his phone, displaying a photo of Dominic Valrose intubated in a hospital bed.

"Stop pretending." He suddenly seized her wrist. "Ethan went berserk for you, then turned around to have fun with someone else—"

Crack!

The sharp slap echoed down the hallway.

Kevin licked the blood from his lip and laughed wildly. "Guess why he targeted Dominic? Because the idiot tried to poach you as his secretary!"

Sophia staggered back until the cold浮雕 pressed against her spine.

A包厢 door swung open, releasing laughter and perfume. Ethan Roscente emerged with a popular actress on his arm, lipstick smudged on his collar.

His gaze swept the corridor, lingering for one heartbeat on Sophia's ashen face before dismissing her with indifference.

Kevin whispered in her ear, laughter lacing his words: "Look. Your sugar daddy's here."
###Chapter 359

By targeting Sophia, Dominic Valrose had essentially slapped Ethan Roscente across the face.

Since when did Ethan tolerate disrespect?

The idea was laughable.

The fact that Dominic was still breathing was nothing short of mercy.

This wasn't about defending Sophia—it was about protecting his own pride.

Sophia smirked coldly. "You're overthinking it, Kevin. Business is war. Winners and losers are decided by strategy, not by blaming women. Maybe Dominic simply crossed Ethan. Only weak men make excuses."

Men like him always shifted blame onto women to mask their own incompetence.

"You—!"

Kevin Heilbronn's face darkened before twisting into a mocking grin. "You act so bold only because Ethan backs you. Too bad he'll replace you soon. Did you really think you were special?"

Sophia stiffened.

Satisfied by her reaction, Kevin scoffed and walked away.

Ethan leaned against the car seat, eyes closed, the faint scent of alcohol lingering around him.

As the car entered Bayview Residences, Zachary Evans called.

"Mr. Roscente, we've confirmed it was Kevin who deliberately led Ms. Lowell to your private room."

Ethan lazily adjusted his position. "Who?"

"Dominic's childhood friend."

A derisive chuckle escaped him. "Since he's here, make sure he stays. Give him a proper welcome."

This was payback.

Zachary understood immediately. "Understood."

The man had a death wish, playing games under Ethan's nose.

Tonight's incident was no accident. Kevin had spotted Sophia at the bar and set the trap—switching the decorations outside the room to lure her in.

Crude, but effective. Even Zachary had winced at Sophia's shattered expression when she left.

"Sir, should we explain things to Ms. Lowell? She seems to have misunderstood..."

"Misunderstood?" Ethan's voice dripped with disdain. "Only those who care misunderstand. Does she care about me?"

Zachary fell silent.

But when Sophia left, she'd looked utterly broken.

"Don’t spare anyone who meddles where they shouldn’t."

Ethan ended the call irritably—only to hear a timid voice.

"Mr. Roscente...?"

He frowned. It was the girl from the private room—the one who looked like a frightened rabbit.

Bianca Savigny. Twenty. Still in college.

The younger sister of his late comrade.
###Chapter 360

Bianca's fingers tightened around the suit jacket. The expensive fabric still carried Ethan Roscente's signature icy scent, mingled with a faint trace of alcohol that made her pulse quicken.

"You were drunk..." Her voice trembled, eyes glistening. "I couldn't leave you alone."

He was like an untouchable alpine flower—aloof, aristocratic, devastatingly handsome. Just glimpsing him from afar always stole her breath.

Tonight was her golden opportunity.

She was certain Ethan harbored feelings for her. Why else would he have funded her all these years? Despite his cold demeanor, the endless financial support and indulgent favors could only mean one thing—repressed affection.

The elevator doors slid shut. Bianca held her breath, watching his tall reflection in the mirrored walls. He hadn't sent her away.

The penthouse blazed with light. As she bent to remove her shoes in the foyer, a pair of women's slippers caught her eye—strands of long hair still clinging to them.

"Don't touch." Ethan's voice was glacial.

Bianca bit her lip. Isabella Valentine couldn't possibly monopolize this man. After tonight, everything here would belong to her.

By the floor-to-ceiling window, the ember of Ethan's cigarette pulsed like a heartbeat. Smoke curled around his razor-sharp profile. Bianca stared, mesmerized.

"Mr. Roscente..." She deliberately softened her tone, mimicking that woman's coquettish lilt from the private booth. "Have some water."

When she offered the glass, Ethan finally looked up. His shirt collar was slightly open, his Adam's apple bobbing with each breath. Bianca's mouth went dry.

"Who told you to imitate her?"

His quiet question plunged her into an icy abyss. Only then did she notice the drunken haze had vanished from his eyes, replaced by something terrifyingly lucid.

He stubbed out his cigarette in the crystal ashtray and stood, his shadow engulfing her completely.

"I funded you out of respect for your brother." He methodically undid his cufflinks. "Not so you could covet what isn't yours."

Bianca staggered back until the cold wall stopped her retreat. The magnitude of her miscalculation crashed over her.
###Chapter 361

The night was ink-black, neon lights flickering outside the floor-to-ceiling windows.

Bianca Savigny's gaze involuntarily trailed downward. Even through his dress shirt, she could imagine the taut muscle definition beneath. A body like that would be devastating in bed.

Her cheeks burned just as the man looked up.

His dark eyes were fathomless, cold as glacial ice.

"Copying Sophia's mannerisms?"

Ethan Roscente's voice was even icier than his stare.

Bianca's pulse jumped. So that woman's name was Sophia.

"I wasn't—" Her voice trembled.

His mocking laugh made her hand jerk. The water glass tilted, spilling onto his shirt.

"Sorry!" She dropped to her knees, frantically dabbing at the stain until his iron grip seized her wrist.

"Stop imitating her." His disgusted frown twisted her insides. "Disgusting."

Tears welled instantly. "Mr. Roscente, I really—"

"Get out." He flung her hand away.

She collapsed onto the floor, tearful eyes lifting. "Mr. Roscente, it was an accident—"

"And stop mimicking her expressions." He wiped his hands with a tissue. "Pathetic."

Bianca paled.

Had she misread the situation? But she was already committed...

Biting her lip, she angled her most flattering profile, eyes glistening. "Mr. Roscente, you've had too much to drink. Let me take care of you?"

When he stayed silent, she dared add: "Anything you want..."

Ethan studied her. At this angle, the resemblance to Sophia was uncanny.

But Sophia would never look at him like this. That woman was all thorns, piercing him relentlessly.

"My driver's waiting downstairs." He stood to dismiss her.

Bianca panicked. "Ethan—"

"Take care of me?" His laugh was razor-sharp. "With what exactly?"

Flushing, her fingers crept toward his trousers. "I can do everything Sophia does. And things she wouldn't..."

Her fingertips grazed his belt buckle when excruciating pain shot through her wrist.

Ethan's grip was vise-like, squeezing until cold sweat broke across her skin.
###Chapter 362

Bianca trembled as she lifted her tear-filled eyes. "Ethan, why?"

Why wouldn't he even touch her?

Why wasn't she worthy enough to offer herself to him?

Her voice shook. "I've never been with anyone else. I'm pure..."

A flicker of mockery flashed in Ethan Roscente's eyes. "Your brother gave his life so you could live, and this is how you repay him?"

"This isn't disgraceful!" She lunged forward, clutching his leg. "I love you! I'd give anything to stay by your side! I don't care about status, or how many women you have..."

His gaze turned icy. "For your brother's sake, I'll pretend I didn't hear that."

Bianca let out a hysterical sob. "Why won't you take me?"

He leaned down, gripping her chin. "Looking at you doesn't even stir the most basic physical reaction in me."

The words struck her like a slap.

She staggered back, her face drained of color.

Ethan shoved her away. "Get out."

When she didn't move, disgust filled his eyes. "Disappear in three seconds, or I'll cut off all your funding."

Bianca flinched. She scrambled to her feet and fled.

That funding was her last shred of dignity.

Without it, she'd be reduced to a pitiful joke again.

Once the door closed, Ethan strode to the bathroom.

The water stopped. He emerged, towel-drying his hair, and tossed his discarded clothes—along with the suit jacket—into the trash.

Lighting a cigarette, he poured himself a glass of whiskey.

Amid the swirling smoke, he emptied the entire bottle into the trash bin, drenching the carpet Bianca had touched.

The lighter traced an arc through the air.

Flames erupted, illuminating his sharp profile.

The memory of Sophia Lowell walking away without a backward glance made him yank his robe collar open in irritation.

Firelight danced in his dark eyes.

Tonight, he'd force her to reveal her true colors.

Only when the carpet had burned to ashes did he stub out his cigarette and call Zachary Evans. "Send a construction crew here tomorrow."

Zachary was baffled.

What madness had seized his boss now?

Sophia couldn't shake her unease all evening.

By the time she left the bar, it was nearly midnight.

The cold wind whipped at her coat as she hurried into her apartment building.

The elevator doors slid open—

A large hand yanked her into the emergency stairwell.

The familiar scent of cedar enveloped her.

Ethan pinned her against the wall, his burning palm locking around her wrist.

He leaned in, his obsidian eyes churning with danger.
###Chapter 363

His fingers clamped around her wrist like iron shackles. She struggled, but couldn't break free.

Sophia looked up and met Ethan Roscente's bottomless dark eyes.

Her heart had long gone numb. Even anger felt excessive now.

"What are you doing, Mr. Roscente?" Her voice was glacial.

Ethan remained silent, his heated breath fanning across her face. The flickering stairwell light stretched their shadows into elongated silhouettes.

Suddenly, his lips curved. "Don't you have anything to ask me?"

This was the second time tonight.

A mocking smile tugged at Sophia's lips.

Did he expect her to scream hysterically about that woman? To put on a dramatic scene for his amusement?

Too bad. She wouldn't give him that satisfaction.

"Nothing," she said softly.

"Nothing?" His laugh was cold. "You don't care at all about the woman who appeared beside me?"

"Your private affairs are none of my concern."

"'None of my concern,'" he echoed bitterly. "What was I even hoping for?"

So in her heart, he'd already become insignificant.

"Let go," she said calmly. "This is inappropriate."

"What if I refuse?"

"Then I'll call the police." Her response was immediate. "For sexual harassment."

Ethan's eyes darkened. He suddenly pinned her against the wall.

"Since you've already accused me, shouldn't I make it worth your while?"

Her pulse jumped. "Ethan Roscente! Don't you dare!"

"Watch me."

He leaned in, the strong scent of alcohol enveloping her. Sophia's mind blanked momentarily, her fingers unconsciously clutching his sleeve.

Just as their lips were about to meet, she jerked her head aside.

His smirk deepened as his mouth found the curve of her neck instead, sucking harshly.

"Ah!" A shudder ran through her like an electric shock.

"Ethan! Have you lost your mind?"

"For you," he rasped, finally releasing her.

Sophia's eyes burned with fury.

Ethan studied her vivid expression, some of the tightness in his chest easing.

"She's my friend's younger sister," he suddenly explained.

"I said I don't want to know!"

"But I want to tell you." His gaze was intense.

Sophia bit her lower lip and stayed silent.

Ethan released his grip, gave her one last lingering look, then turned and walked away.
###Chapter 364

The night wind cut through Sophia as she stood trembling beneath her apartment building, her fingertips numb with cold.

She glanced down at her disheveled coat, the collar torn open to reveal a glaring red mark on her collarbone.

The elevator doors reflected her pale face.

Ethan Roscente's words echoed in her ears—"She's just a friend's sister." She had almost believed him.

The elevator dinged open.

Vivian Ashcroft was lounging on the couch with a face mask on. At the sound of the door, she turned so abruptly the mask slipped off with a plop.

"Holy shit!" She sprang up like a fish leaping from water. "Did Ethan Roscente pull another stunt?"

Sophia tossed her bag by the entryway and collapsed onto the sofa.

"That girl at the bar..." Her voice was hoarse. "He said she was his friend's sister."

Vivian snorted, stabbing a piece of apple from the fruit bowl.

"When men say 'sister,' nine times out of ten, it's code for backup option." She crunched loudly. "The tenth? That's the one they're actively chasing."

Sophia clenched the throw pillow.

She remembered how Ethan had bent his head to listen to that girl under the bar lights. He had never shown her that kind of patience.

"He even mentioned marriage..." Sophia's throat tightened.

Vivian suddenly leaned in, lowering her voice conspiratorially. "You know what the emperor says to his concubines in my new drama? 'You're my favorite'—to thirty-eight different women."

Sophia shot to her feet.

Under the scalding shower, she scrubbed furiously at the mark on her neck. The burning pain didn't dull the ache in her chest.

The fogged-up mirror reflected her red-rimmed eyes.

"Liar," she whispered to her reflection.
###Chapter 365

Vivian Ashcroft stared at the bathroom door as it closed. Her phone screen suddenly lit up with a message from Jason Roscente.

She silenced it with one glance and flipped the phone face down on the table.

The TV played a variety show, but she couldn’t focus on a single word. Her fingers tapped absently against the armrest, her gaze drifting toward the phone.

A sharp slap echoed through the room as she struck her own cheek.

"Vivian, get a fucking grip!"

The next morning, Sophia Lowell’s eyes stung as soon as she woke to a news notification. The headline blared: "Ethan Roscente Spends the Night with Isabella Valentine."

The accompanying photo showed the same doe-eyed girl from last night following Ethan home.

Sophia smirked at the image. The paparazzi had mistaken the girl for Isabella. That socialite princess would be livid when she saw this.

Men’s promises were nothing but lies.

On the day of her prenatal checkup, Sophia went to the hospital alone. Vivian had wanted to accompany her but was tied up with filming.

"The baby is healthy, but you’re too thin," the doctor said, flipping through the report. "Eat more nutritious meals. Exercise will help with a smooth delivery."

Sophia took the ultrasound printout, her expression softening at the blurry little figure.

"I’ll take care of it."

As she stepped out of the examination room, Vivian called.

"The doctor says the baby’s healthy, just that I need to eat more," Sophia said, walking while talking. Suddenly, someone blocked her path.

She sidestepped left, but the person mirrored her movement. Looking up, she met Isabella’s triumphant smile.

"Can I help you?" Sophia ended the call.

Isabella crossed her arms, grinning smugly. "Ethan and I are getting married this weekend. You must come."

Sophia’s heart lurched.

So soon?
###Chapter 366

Sunlight streamed through the glass window. Sophia Lowell raised a hand to shield her eyes. It suddenly struck her—three months had passed since she last saw Ethan Roscente.

"Rumor has it Miss Valentine is becoming Mrs. Roscente?" she murmured to herself, a faint smile playing on her lips.

Isabella Valentine approached in stilettos, her skirt swaying with each step. "What, jealous?"

"Congratulations." Sophia met her gaze, her eyes eerily calm. "You finally got what you wanted."

Isabella narrowed her eyes. "Stop pretending!"

"I mean it." Sophia tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear. "If not for you, how could I have been freed so quickly?"

Isabella grabbed her wrist. "What are you implying?"

Sophia coldly eyed the hand with its crimson manicure. "Let go."

"Who do you think you are?" Isabella tightened her grip instead. "Scared now? You should've considered the consequences when you were spreading lies in front of Ethan!"

Sophia laughed suddenly and slapped her across the face.

The sharp crack echoed as Isabella stumbled back, clutching her cheek.

"That was for the flowerpots you smashed." Sophia flexed her stinging palm.

"You bitch!" Isabella trembled with rage. "The Roscentes are my territory now. Who do you think you are?"

Sophia leisurely adjusted her sleeve. "Secured your position as Mrs. Roscente yet? I heard..." She deliberately drew out the words. "Someone saw Ethan taking a college girl to a hotel last night?"

Isabella's face paled.

"So it's true." Sophia chuckled. "Well, men always crave novelty. That face of yours..." Her gaze swept over Isabella meaningfully. "Too many touch-ups, don't you think?"

Isabella's nails dug into her palms.

"Rather than wasting time with me, you should focus on saving your wedding." Sophia turned to leave but paused. "Oh, the girl's last name was Lin, wasn't it? Quite the fresh beauty."

Isabella's shriek followed her: "Sophia Lowell! You'll pay for this!"

Sophia waved without looking back, sunlight casting her elongated shadow behind her.
###Chapter 367

Sophia Lowell paused mid-step, a mocking curve lifting the corner of her lips before she walked away without looking back.

Isabella Valentine trembled with rage, her stiletto slamming into a metal trash bin with a deafening clang.

Her venomous gaze suddenly locked onto the maternity ward doors, suspicion flickering in her eyes.

Why was Sophia coming out of the maternity ward?

A horrifying thought struck her. Isabella's face paled as she rushed toward the examination room in her heels.

"I'm Sophia's best friend. What's wrong with her?" She shoved the door open with a bang.

The female doctor didn't glance up. "Patient confidentiality. I can't disclose anything."

Isabella flung a black card from her Hermès bag. "One million for one sentence."

"Get out." The doctor pressed the call button with an icy expression.

Cursing under her breath, Isabella snatched the card and stormed out, slamming the door behind her.

At the corridor's turn, she dialed a number with shaking fingers. "Pull Sophia Lowell's maternity ward records immediately!"

Her nails dug deep into her palms. Ethan Roscente's recent strangeness, Sophia's unnatural calm—everything pointed to the worst possibility.

If that bitch was carrying the Roscente heir...

A serpentine glint of malice swirled in Isabella's eyes.

Outside the hospital, Sophia's composure finally shattered. She quickly sent an encrypted message to her hacker contact, double-checked the reliability of the doctor Sebastian Valdemar had recommended, then hailed a cab.

At the family estate, Emily Laurent was humming while arranging flowers.

"I'm going back to Seattle." Sophia cut straight to the point.

The crystal vase crashed to the floor.

"Have you lost your mind?" Emily's sharp nails clamped around Sophia's wrist. "Your mother died in that godforsaken place! And now you—"

"My flight's already booked." Sophia pulled free, a rose petal clinging to her sleeve.

Emily suddenly laughed, the sound bordering on hysterical. "Fine! Leave! Just like all the Lowell women—throwing your lives away for some ridiculous design dream!"

She overturned the coffee table in a violent motion, shards of glass reflecting her distorted face. "Your mother died on that runway. Are you trying to follow in her footsteps?"
###Chapter 368

Sophia jerked her hand away with a cold laugh. "You married well, but are you truly happy trapped in this gilded cage? That small business you secretly started—even though you got scammed, you were glowing during that time."

Her gaze was resolute. "Design is my life. No matter how hard it gets, I'll embrace it."

"So you're determined to leave?"

Sophia nodded without hesitation.

Emily studied her for a long moment before letting out a bitter chuckle. "You hate it here, don't you? The Roscentes, even this entire city."

Sophia's lashes fluttered slightly. Her voice was barely audible. "You know better than anyone what it's like to live under someone else's roof."

Emily's eyes reddened. She thought of all the humiliation Sophia had endured because of her these past two years. Her fingers tightened unconsciously. "It's my fault..."

Her princess should have been cherished, but because of her useless aunt, she'd tasted the bitterness of the world.

A pang of sorrow struck Sophia. "Come back to Seattle with me. I can take care of you."

Emily froze, then slowly shook her head. "Your uncle's spirit is here. I won't leave."

Her tone turned sharp. "Besides, what can your salary even cover? At least here, you don't have to worry about food or clothes."

Sophia's lips curled in mockery. "So in the end, you can't let go of this luxurious life."

When faced with wealth and comfort, her niece meant nothing.

Emily turned away. "Think what you want."

"Then I wish you all the best." Sophia turned to leave.

Emily grabbed her arm in panic. "Is there really no other way?"

"None."

Defeated, Emily sighed. "You're as stubborn as your mother."

"Then stop trying to change my mind."

Emily clutched her hand tightly. "Call me if anything happens."

"Mm."

"Where are you going?"

Mr. Roscente Sr.'s voice cut in from behind. Sophia stiffened, recalling Ethan's warning in his office that day. Her breath grew shallow.

Emily instantly put on an ingratiating smile. "Sophia's job is relocating her back to Seattle." Her voice was laced with cautious flattery, nothing like Victoria Langley's composed demeanor in front of the patriarch.
###Chapter 369

In the gilded cage of a wealthy family, a woman without maternal support must tread carefully with every breath.

Sophia gazed at the fragmented sky through the ornate window lattice, finding the situation bitterly ironic.

"Oh?" Mr. Roscente Sr.'s rheumy eyes shifted, his gaze slicing through her slender frame like a blade. "Still planning to return?"

Her nails dug into her palms, but her voice remained steady. "Probably not."

The old man's brow relaxed almost imperceptibly. "Seattle is nice. One should know their place."

The words were a blunt knife, slowly flaying away her last shreds of dignity.

She knew the entire Roscente family was relieved by her compliance.

"You're right, Grandfather." She lowered her lashes, casting twin shadows across her porcelain face.

The patriarch's scrutinizing gaze swept over her. Satisfied by her docility, he finally showed a hint of approval.

"If you're leaving, clean up your mess." His teacup clattered sharply against the rosewood table. "Don't cause trouble at the university."

Sophia's pulse jumped.

Had he discovered something?

But if he truly knew about her and Ethan, she'd have been thrown out long ago.

"I understand," she replied hollowly.

As he stood, his dark silk robe brushed her hand, leaving a trail of coldness.

"Stay for dinner tonight." It wasn't a request. "You've been with the Roscentes for two years, after all."

She parted her lips, only managing a faint "Okay."

Just as he turned, he paused. "Did you take the medicine Ninth Uncle brought?"

Her blood turned to ice.

She saw Emily's confused expression and dug her nails deeper into her palms.

"What medicine?" Emily blinked blankly.

The air froze.

"Herbal medicine from Hong Kong." Each of the old man's words dripped venom. "Didn't I ask Sophia to fetch it?"

Emily's eyes flickered to Sophia's pallid face before laughing lightly. "Oh, how forgetful of me. Yes, that's right."

Mr. Roscente sneered. "Then why haven't I seen you brewing it?"

"They pre-packaged it these days." Emily remained unflustered. "Just heat it up before drinking."

Sophia stared at the intricate arabesque patterns on the carpet, as if willing them to swallow her whole.
###Chapter 370

"Is this true?" Old Mr. Roscente tapped his fingers lightly on the desk.

Emily Laurent stood with her head bowed. "Every word."

"Preposterous!" The old man slammed his palm on the table and rose abruptly. "Ethan handles crucial matters daily, and you bother him with such trivialities? Are Hong Kong's physicians superior to others?"

Emily's shoulders trembled slightly. "I acted thoughtlessly."

Seeing her submissive demeanor, the old man snorted and stormed out.

As he rounded the corridor, he suddenly paused and glanced back. Shadows moved in the pavilion, and a glint flashed in his eyes. "Summon Margaret from the fourth household."

The butler's heart skipped a beat. "You suspect the fourth young madam..."

"Investigation will tell." The old man twisted his prayer beads with a cold smile.

Margaret knelt nervously in the study.

"Has the fourth young madam taken any medicine recently?" the butler demanded sharply.

"Your Honor, she has been drinking tonic soups to regulate her health."

"Where did the medicine come from?"

Beads of sweat formed on Margaret's forehead. "I... I vaguely recall her mentioning Hong Kong."

The old man's frown eased slightly, and he waved her away.

The butler handed him a teacup with a bow. "It seems Mr. Ethan and Miss Emily have a personal connection?"

"Just a plaything." The old man took a sip. "Better than that Sophia girl."

On the desk lay a photo of Ethan Roscente standing beside a delicate young woman. The old man had already verified she was merely the sister of a deceased friend, kept for amusement.

As long as it didn't interfere with the Roscente family's marriage alliance, he was content to turn a blind eye.

"What about Sophia..."

"Withdraw the surveillance." The old man rotated his jade ring. "She knows her place. Saves me the trouble."

The butler understood. That face, so reminiscent of the past, was a liability. Her voluntary departure spared them a scandal.

"Add sweet and sour mandarin fish to tonight's menu." The old man suddenly instructed. "Isabella enjoys it."

Behind a pillar, Margaret dialed a number with trembling hands. "Mr. Ethan, I said everything as instructed."

The faint tap of a pen against a desk came through the line.

"Good." Ethan Roscente gazed at the twilight outside his window, his lips curving into a frosty smile.
###Chapter 371

"Good job." Ethan Roscente tapped the desk with his slender fingers. "Do you know how to handle Fourth Aunt?"

"Understood, Mr. Roscente."

Zachary Evans responded respectfully but couldn't resist stealing a glance at the imposing man behind the desk. "Sir... is something wrong?"

The man's lips curved slightly, but his eyes remained icy. "The old man summoned Margaret."

Margaret was Ethan’s informant at the Roscente estate, assigned to watch over Fourth Aunt. The sudden summons was suspicious.

"Good thing you anticipated this." Zachary immediately understood.

"Cancel tonight's engagement." Ethan closed the file. "We're heading back to the estate."

"Is it because Miss Lowell returned?"

The moment the words left his mouth, a sharp gaze pinned him in place. "Since when do I need permission to go home?"

Zachary broke into a cold sweat and forced a smile. "Of course, you can return whenever you wish."

Ethan snorted and reopened the file. Zachary discreetly wiped his forehead.

His boss’s unpredictable temper was harder to read than June weather.

The moment the elder Roscente left, Emily Laurent dragged Sophia Lowell into the bedroom.

"Tell me the truth." She frowned. "What’s really going on between you and Ethan? When did I ever ask him to bring medicine? And when did I send you to pick it up?"

Emily wasn’t stupid. The sudden concern for her health, especially the mention of herbal medicine, was clearly a test.

Sophia’s heart skipped a beat, but her expression remained calm. "I ran into Grandpa at Roscente Group the other day. He didn’t like me, so I made up an excuse."

She deliberately omitted Ethan’s involvement, mixing truth with lies.

"Why were you at Roscente Group?" Emily seized the inconsistency. "And you just happened to run into the old man?"

Her gaze bore into Sophia. "What are you hiding? You and Ethan—"

Sophia’s breath hitched.

"—when did you get so close?"

Hearing the cautious probe, Sophia relaxed slightly. "It’s because of Isabella Valentine." She feigned nonchalance. "She accused me of leaking company secrets and got me fired. I went to Jessica for help clearing my name."

"Isabella Valentine?" Emily was stunned. "The Valentine heiress engaged to Ethan?"

Sophia nodded.

"How did you offend her?"

"Women’s grudges don’t need reasons." Sophia brushed it off lightly.

Emily’s frown deepened. "If she marries into the family, won’t that mean—"

"I’m hardly ever at the Roscente estate anyway." Sophia smiled carelessly, though a shadow flickered in her eyes.
###Chapter 372

"The rich girls have hearts smaller than a needle's eye." Emily Laurent scoffed. "Isn't your third aunt a perfect example? I misspoke once, and she’s held a grudge ever since."

The memory of Isabella Valentine falsely accusing Sophia Lowell of leaking company secrets made her blood boil. "That woman is vicious. Framing you for corporate espionage? She wanted to send you to prison! And I actually thought she was cultured and reasonable."

"Did you resolve it?" Emily suddenly lowered her voice.

"Ethan cleared it up." Sophia stirred her coffee. "He restored my reputation at the company."

Emily hesitated, then squeezed her hand. "The way the old man acted today…" She sighed in relief. "Since there’s really nothing between you and Ethan, I’m at ease. A man like him is out of our league."

The words stabbed Sophia straight through the heart.

She forced a laugh. "Aunt Emily, what nonsense are you talking about?"

"Better safe than sorry." Emily’s gaze sharpened. "You’re young and beautiful. He’s in his prime. If the old man suspects anything between you—" She drew a finger across her throat. "Go back to Seattle. It’s best for everyone."

Sophia’s fingers turned icy.

Even her closest aunt believed she wasn’t good enough for Ethan Roscente. Worlds apart—the phrase burned into her chest like a branding iron.

At dinner, Ethan returned.

Sophia shrank into the corner, wishing she could vanish. She picked at her food while Isabella gushed about wedding plans in a saccharine voice. The Roscentes laughed and chatted, leaving her an outsider.

Ethan wore a navy-blue suit, his cufflinks glinting coldly. Seated at the head of the table, he looked like a flawless statue. When his gaze flickered toward her, Sophia’s hand trembled. Her spoon clinked against the bowl.

"Ethan, I want the new Vera Wang for my wedding dress," Isabella cooed.

Ethan gave an absentminded hum, but his eyes locked onto the figure pretending to be invisible. Sophia felt the chill in his stare, a thin sweat breaking out on her back.

"Sophia, why so quiet?" The third aunt suddenly called on her.

Sophia froze. Every eye at the table turned to her like spotlights. Before she could speak, Ethan let out a cold laugh. "Silence during meals shows good upbringing."

The remark slapped her like a physical blow, her ears ringing.
###Chapter 373

Sophia wished to fade into the background, but Isabella Valentine refused to let her.

"Miss Lowell, why aren't you eating?" Isabella's voice dripped with honeyed sweetness. "Does the food not suit your taste?"

Every pair of eyes at the long dining table turned toward Sophia.

Her fingers trembled slightly as she forced a polite smile. "Thank you for your concern. I'm just feeling unwell."

"Stop pretending!" Victoria Langley slammed her chopsticks down. "Who are you trying to impress with this act?"

"Aunt Victoria!" Emily Laurent cut in sharply. "Sophia hasn't said a word. Unlike you—"

"Enough!" Mr. Roscente Sr. struck the table with a heavy hand, his expression darkening. "Must every meal be ruined by this nonsense?"

The air turned to ice.

Isabella, unfazed, calmly served the patriarch another dish, her soothing words coaxing a smile from him within moments.

"If you're unwell, see a doctor," the old man suddenly addressed Sophia. "I won't have anyone claiming the Roscentes neglect their guests."

Sophia clenched her napkin. "Thank you for your concern, Grandfather."

"How dramatic!" Victoria rolled her eyes. "Must the entire table know how delicate you are?"

Emily trembled with anger, but Sophia pressed a warning hand against hers beneath the table.

"Could it be... pregnancy?" Victoria's tone turned sly.

Sophia's spine went rigid.

"If loss of appetite means pregnancy," Ethan Roscente dabbed his lips with a napkin, "then congratulations are in order for Third Uncle."

He raised his glass toward the elder Roscente brother. "Another child on the way. Impressive vigor at your age."

Third Uncle's face flushed crimson as he shot his wife a venomous glare. "Shut up and eat!"

Victoria's expression twisted.

The patriarch's gaze shifted to Ethan.

"Third Aunt transferred fifty million to her nephew last month," Ethan murmured, just loud enough for the old man to hear.

The patriarch's face transformed instantly.

"Third Son!" He threw his chopsticks down. "My study. Now."

Bewildered, Third Uncle followed, leaving the rest of the table in stunned silence.
###Chapter 374

Ichio Furukawa's wrinkled face flushed crimson in an instant.

As a towering figure in his country's medical field, when had he ever suffered such humiliation?

Lena actually dared to claim his skills were inferior to some wet-behind-the-ears Chinese boy!

His burning glare locked onto Fengyun Ye. This unremarkable young man couldn't possibly be his match.

Xiao Yifan immediately grasped Lena's intentions.

The corner of her lips curled into a knowing smile. This foreign woman certainly knew how to play her cards.

Lena gave Fengyun Ye a subtle wink.

She wanted nothing more than to provoke this arrogant old man. Who asked him to look down on traditional Chinese medicine?

"Preposterous!"

Wells slammed the table, glowering at Lena.

"Master Furukawa's medical prowess is unparalleled! How dare you compare him to some charlatan?"

Olite sneered in agreement. "Miss Lena, you should weigh your words carefully. This Mr. Ye probably isn't even fit to polish Master Furukawa's shoes."

Suddenly, Ichio Furukawa burst into laughter.

Stroking his graying beard, he looked down at Fengyun Ye with condescension.

"Miss Lena, did you really think such cheap provocation would work on me?" He shook his head disdainfully. "Does an elephant care about an ant's challenge?"

His words made the entire room tense.

Only Fengyun Ye remained composed, as if completely unaffected.

Wells gloated as he chimed in, "Someone of Master Furukawa's stature would never stoop to acknowledging such insignificant riffraff."

"Exactly!" Olite urged impatiently. "Master, let's go check on my sister first."

Furukawa lifted his chin arrogantly and was about to stride away when—

"Wait, please."

Fengyun Ye suddenly spoke.

Every eye turned toward him.

"What trick are you trying to pull now, boy?" Wells demanded suspiciously.

Calmly, Fengyun Ye approached Furukawa and bowed respectfully.

"I've long admired your exceptional skills, Master. Having the honor of meeting you today, might I humbly request permission to observe and learn from you?"

Olite immediately objected. "Absolutely not! Who knows if you're just trying to steal his techniques?"

But Furukawa narrowed his eyes, amused.

"How interesting." He stroked his beard. "Chinese medicine does share origins with our island's healing arts. Though your tradition has clearly declined..."

He deliberately drew out his words, savoring Fengyun Ye's deferential posture.

"Still, since you're so eager to learn, I'll make an exception this once."

A glint flashed in Xiao Yifan's eyes.

She knew her cousin too well. This performance was only just beginning.
###Chapter 375

The air of Los Angeles carried an unfamiliar perfume. Shen Man stood at the hotel entrance, her stilettos clicking sharply against the marble floor. No one here knew she had once been married to Ethan Roscente.

Seattle and Los Angeles were worlds apart, their currency exchange rates differing by half. Who would remember a bankrupt heiress from the Shen family?

As she surveyed her surroundings, Liam Sterling abruptly extended his arm. Shen Man arched a brow. "Meaning?"

"Basic etiquette for an escort."

"So?"

Liam withdrew his arm with a cold smirk. "How ungrateful."

Seeing him turn to leave, Shen Man quickly linked her arm through his, her lips curving into a flawless smile. "Don't be hasty, Mr. Sterling. Just a joke. Tonight, I won't leave your side."

"My patience has limits." Liam kept his gaze forward. "Play games again, and you'll spend the night in the freezing ocean breeze."

Her smile twitched.

She'd never admit she'd been distracted.

At the revolving door, Victor Shu hurried over. "Mr. Sterling, this is Ethan Roscente, CEO of Roscente Group."

Their eyes locked. Ethan stood in a black suit, his features sharper than she remembered. His gaze flickered to their linked arms before he sneered. "So vanishing meant climbing to higher branches."

Shen Man's fingers tightened imperceptibly, her smile unwavering. "Where's your companion today, Mr. Roscente? Did Ms. Lowell not meet your standards?"

Ethan turned to Liam. "A word of advice—stay away from women like her. When it comes to chasing profit, no one outdoes her."

"Funny." Liam suddenly gripped Shen Man's hand. "I enjoy taming wild horses."

She couldn't pull free. In front of everyone, she couldn't embarrass Liam.

Ethan scoffed. "The last man who said that—Simon Xiao—is still locked up in the Xiao family estate. Rumor has it he hasn't even cleaned up the mess from being dumped at his own engagement party."

Shen Man's pupils constricted.

Simon had been in Los Angeles just last night!

Ethan adjusted his cufflinks. "Excuse me. I look forward to our discussion later."

Once his figure disappeared down the hall, Liam squeezed her hand. "Heartbroken?"

"For whom?"

"That imprisoned fiancé of yours." Liam guided her toward the banquet hall. "Judging by your expression, are you having second thoughts?"

Shen Man smirked. "What kind of man can't even protect his woman? Rest assured, Mr. Sterling, I know better than anyone that relying on others is futile."

"Good."
###Chapter 376

Sophia stared at the unfinished chess game, her fingers absently tracing the pieces. The elder Mr. Roscente was clearly losing, and she was considering how to gracefully end the match.

"Sir, breakfast is ready," the butler interjected at just the right moment.

The old man pushed the chess pieces aside and slowly rose with the butler's assistance. He glanced at Sophia. "One last meal before you go."

"Of course," she murmured, her gaze lingering on the board. The butler's timing was impeccable—saving the elder's pride while giving her an easy out.

Only the most tactful could survive in the Roscente mansion.

The dining room was already full when Sophia entered. Her breath hitched when she spotted Isabella Valentine. The presence of Ethan's fiancée at breakfast spoke volumes.

Her fingers clenched the fabric of her sleeve, nails digging into her palm.

The elder Mr. Roscente took his seat at the head of the table. Breakfast was more casual than dinner, so Sophia chose a corner seat. Ethan arrived last, slipping into the only empty chair beside her.

"You never eat breakfast at home," the elder remarked with a frown.

"All-night meeting. I'm hungry," Ethan rasped, dark circles under his eyes.

Sophia caught a glimpse of his exhausted profile from the corner of her eye. The tightness in her chest eased inexplicably.

"Take care of yourself," the elder said before signaling the meal to begin.

Just as Sophia reached for her fork, a warm hand covered hers beneath the table. She froze, trying to pull away, but his grip tightened. His fingers traced hers before interlacing firmly, refusing to let go.

Jason Roscente looked up and nearly spilled his coffee. His eyes widened at the sight of their entwined hands under the table. When had these two gotten back together? Flirting right in front of his fiancée—his brother really had no shame.

Sophia's ears burned. She sat rigid as a statue, hyperaware of Ethan's thumb drawing slow circles against her palm. A shiver ran up her spine. Was he insane? Isabella was sitting right across from them!
###Chapter 377 

Sophia Lowell sat stiffly at the dining table, unaware of Ethan Roscente's grip tightening around her wrist beneath the tablecloth.

From the opposite end, Isabella Valentine observed them with narrowed eyes.

She forced a saccharine smile. "Sophia, I need help choosing my wedding reception dress. Come to the bridal boutique with me today? We have similar tastes."

Sophia winced as Ethan's fingers dug into her flesh. She picked up a spoon with her free hand. "I'm covering a colleague's lecture today."

"What about tomorrow?" Isabella pressed. "Tiffany mentioned you only have morning classes on Thursdays."

"I'm moving back to Seattle next month." The moment Sophia spoke, Ethan's grip turned crushing.

She yanked her hand free, spotting angry red marks. Under the table, she kicked out in retaliation.

"Jesus!" Jason Roscente hissed, drawing everyone's attention.

Sophia froze. Wrong target.

Ethan's voice cut through the silence. "Well played, Sophia."

His chair screeched as he stood, abandoning his untouched breakfast.

Mr. Roscente Sr. frowned. "Leaving already?"

Without a word, Ethan strode out.

The patriarch turned to his grimacing grandson. "What's your problem now?"

Jason shot Sophia an annoyed look before smirking at Isabella. "Who invited the buzzing fly to breakfast?"

Isabella's lips trembled. "I'm sorry for disturbing—"

"Then shut up."

"Outrageous!" The old man slammed the table. "Is that how you speak to your future aunt?"

Jason pushed back his chair. "Let's see if she actually makes it down the aisle."

Tears welled in Isabella's eyes as Jason sauntered out.

"Pay him no mind," Mr. Roscente Sr. huffed. "That wild boy needs discipline after years abroad."

Sophia hid her smirk behind lowered lashes. Neglect your grandson for years, then blame his manners?

Outside, Jason summoned the family driver.

His confiscated sports car left him deflated—a plucked peacock without his prized feathers. Each step felt heavier without the roar of an engine.
###Chapter 378

Jason Roscente had just pulled out his phone when a faint whiff of tobacco drifted into his nostrils.

He whipped his head around.

"Sophia's returning to Seattle. Did you know?"

A deep, icy voice exploded beside his ear.

"Holy shit!" He flinched and instinctively threw a punch in the praying mantis style.

Recognizing the figure, he clutched his chest, panting. "Uncle Ethan! You scared the hell out of me!"

Ethan Roscente stood beneath the silk tree, his tall frame stretched long by the streetlamp. His dark eyes were bottomless, sharp as fractured ice.

"Answer me."

Jason glanced around before leaning in, lowering his voice. "You really don't know?"

"Would I ask if I did?" The man's tone turned dangerous.

Jason's eyes darted. He stretched his limbs theatrically. "Uncle, business is war. Intelligence requires—"

"Bugatti Veyron." Ethan cut him off.

"Deal!" Jason's face lit up instantly. "Sophia's internship ended. She's transferring back to Seattle U's main campus. The full-time offer came from you, so doesn't that mean—"

"I personally sent her away?" Ethan's lips curled into a cold smile, shadows churning in his gaze.

Jason retreated two steps. "Pretty much..."

"Good. Very good." Ethan stared into the distance, his knuckles whitening. "Sophia Lowell, you've got nerve."

The air plunged below freezing.

Jason shivered, wishing he could vanish on the spot.

Meanwhile, Isabella Valentine had just settled into her car when her phone rang.

"Isabella, we found out. Sophia visited OB-GYN for irregular periods."

"Are you certain?" Isabella frowned.

"It's clearly stated in her medical records."

Her fingers tapped the steering wheel. That day in the executive office, Sophia's gagging reaction had been too suspicious.

"Dig deeper. I need concrete evidence."

Hanging up, she hit the gas. Neon lights flickered across her face through the window.

Sophia hadn't lied. Her final days before leaving were a whirlwind of nonstop work.

By the time she exited campus, night had fallen.

A breeze brushed her neck, and she shuddered. That sensation of being watched returned.

She quickened her pace, relaxing only slightly at the sight of her apartment complex gates.

Then—

Thud.

Her handbag hit the ground, contents scattering.

A shadow loomed before her, materializing out of nowhere.
###Chapter 379

People like Wang Qin always assume the whole world shares their selfish nature.

Yet this same selfish woman would endure humiliation for Lin Xi.

Human nature is full of contradictions.

Qiao Xing didn’t want to dwell on the topic any longer. She was only here to find out Wang Qin’s next steps.

"But Xingxing, about the tutoring—"

"I have work. No time." Qiao Xing cut her off. "Two years' worth of material can’t be covered in two or three months. Besides, she might not even be able to focus."

She couldn’t bring herself to suggest cram school. The better ones cost tens of thousands per semester—far beyond her means.

"Then what do we do?" Wang Qin panicked. "Should she just follow me to the factory? Marry some random man when she’s old enough? At her age, factories won’t even hire her!"

"Xingxing, you’re a woman too. You know how important education is for girls. If you hadn’t gone to college, would you have met someone as good as Qin Ce?"

A bitter smile touched Qiao Xing’s lips. Even with a degree, finding a man like Qin Ce wasn’t guaranteed.

She’d just been lucky to cross paths with Grandpa Qin.

It wasn’t until Wang Qin reappeared that she truly grasped the gap between her and Qin Ce. This marriage was making her increasingly uneasy.

"Xingxing?"

She snapped out of her thoughts, pushing down the turmoil inside. "I’m only free on weekends. I can tutor her, but I can’t promise how much she’ll learn."

Wang Qin’s worry instantly melted into relief. "Good, good! As long as you’re willing to teach. Anything helps. If nothing else, vocational school is still an option."

Qiao Xing nodded. "I’ll go now. I’ll find you again once I’ve secured a place."

"Alright… Be careful on your way."

As she stepped out of the room, Qiao Xing glanced at Lin Xi one last time.

The little girl was engrossed in a cartoon, as if she’d never seen TV before. It reminded Qiao Xing of her own childhood, sneaking glimpses of shows at Wang Ye’s house.

Outside the hotel, damp cold air hit her face. She tightened her coat and was about to leave when a familiar electric bike pulled up in front of her.

Qin Ce swung his long leg off the seat.

Qiao Xing instinctively tried to retreat, but he caught her wrist.

"What are you running from?" His voice was sharp with anger.

"I’m not." She kept her eyes down, avoiding his gaze.

That kiss last night had completely unsettled her.

"Not running? You won’t even cook for me now—is this your version of the silent treatment?"

"...That’s not it."

"Then what do you want?"

After a pause, she whispered, "I think we need time to cool off. To really think about the future—"

"Qiao Xing!" His voice cracked like a whip. "How many times do I have to say it?"

"It’s just a few relatives! You think they’ll drag me down?" His anger made his voice tremble. "I can afford you. I could afford ten more like you! Even if I had to support your entire family, I could do it!"

He yanked her into his arms. "If you dare mention those two words again, I’ll pave your ancestors’ graves in gold right now!"
###Chapter 380

"Don't recognize me?" Ethan Roscente's lips curved slightly, amusement glinting in his eyes.

Vivian Ashcroft's voice screeched through the phone. "Am I hallucinating? Why do I hear that bastard Ethan?"

Sophia Lowell's fingers trembled. She hung up abruptly.

When she looked up again, the man had already sprawled in the seat opposite her. His long fingers tapped the table, his gaze burning into her.

She immediately stood to move.

"Running away?" A low chuckle followed her.

Sophia clenched her phone, pretending not to hear. But his stare felt tangible—like a serpent coiling around her.

"Stop staring!" She whirled around.

Ethan arched a brow. "Finally acknowledging me?"

"Air should know its place." She sneered. "Stop being so obnoxious."

"My eyes, my choice." He suddenly leaned in, his lashes nearly brushing her nose. "Like what you see?"

Sophia's pupils dilated.

Since when did the notoriously taciturn CEO become this shameless flirt?

"Speechless?" He inched closer.

"..."

"Tch. Playing mute again."

Her temple throbbed. Scanning the surroundings, realization struck. "Why are you here?"

"Collecting debts."

"Who'd dare owe you money?" The words tumbled out before she could stop them.

"Emotional debts." His eyes dropped to her flushed lips. "Someone's trying to skip town without paying."

Her ears burned.

The three-billion-dollar bet flashed through her mind.

"I...I wasn't running." Her voice dwindled as her fingers unconsciously picked at the armrest.

He scoffed. "A mere 45 million? Then pay up, Ms. Lowell."

"It's just a job transfer!" She lifted her chin. "I'll clear it in two months."

"With what?" Ethan suddenly gripped her chin. "Your eight-thousand-dollar monthly salary?"

His warm breath fanned her neck. Every muscle in her body tensed.

"Maybe..." His thumb grazed her collarbone. "You should think about how to please me instead."

"Disgusting!" She slapped his hand away. "You're engaged—"

A shrill voice cut through the station:

"Ethan!"
###Chapter 381

Sophia was packing her luggage when she caught sight of two familiar figures in her peripheral vision.

Isabella clung to Zachary's arm, pulling her suitcase toward them.

Sophia's fingers stilled.

So Ethan wasn't here to collect debts—he was traveling for business, with Isabella in tow.

"Ethan, why are you walking so fast?" Isabella pouted, settling beside him and casually draping her hand over his arm.

Ethan's gaze flicked to Sophia, his lips curling in amusement. "Did I ask you to keep up?"

"You could at least wait for me," Isabella whined.

Their banter resembled that of a couple deeply in love.

Sophia's grip on her suitcase handle tightened, her knuckles turning white.

"Oh, Miss Lowell is here too?" Isabella feigned surprise, covering her mouth with a delicate hand.

Sophia forced a smile. "Miss Valentine."

"What a coincidence, running into you here." Isabella's smile was saccharine, her eyes raking over Sophia. "Where are you headed?"

"Back to Seattle."

"Oh—" Isabella drew out the syllable. "I heard you were transferred back?"

Sophia nodded.

"Will you be returning?"

Unaware of Ethan's piercing stare, she murmured, "No."

The man's expression darkened instantly.

"What a shame," Isabella sighed theatrically. "I was hoping to invite you to our wedding. The timing is so unfortunate—people might think you're avoiding us."

Sophia's lips curved into a faint smile. "You're overthinking it, Miss Valentine. Whether an outsider attends or not makes no difference."

She stood and walked toward the restroom, her back rigid.

Another second in their presence, and she might have suffocated.

Behind her, Ethan's low voice carried. "So eager to have her at the wedding?"

"Of course," Isabella cooed. "I still need a bridesmaid. Someone as beautiful as Miss Lowell would be perfect."

She playfully shook his arm. "You wouldn't object, would you?"

Ethan chuckled. "Beautiful women should be brides, not bridesmaids. What if I accidentally held the wrong hand?"

Isabella's face paled.

"Y-you're joking," she stammered, forcing a laugh.

The man regarded her with a smirk. "Test me."

Isabella's fingers trembled.

Sophia lingered near the platform until the boarding announcement echoed overhead. As she turned back, Isabella blocked her path.

"Something wrong?" Sophia eyed her warily.

Isabella's stare dropped to Sophia's abdomen, her lips twisting into a sneer. "Must be exhausting, running around in your condition."

Sophia's pulse spiked. Instinctively, she moved to shield her stomach.

"I don't know what you mean," she said evenly.

"Stop pretending." Isabella stepped closer. "Women like you always use cheap tricks to seduce men. Too bad Ethan won't even spare you a glance."

Seduce?

Sophia barked a laugh.

"Your imagination is impressive, Miss Valentine." She turned to leave.

Isabella seized her wrist. "Don't think I don't know your filthy schemes!"

Sophia wrenched free, her voice icy. "Control yourself."
###Chapter 382

Sophia had no patience for Isabella's antics anymore. She turned to leave without another word.

"Instead of wasting time with me, Miss Valentine, perhaps you should focus on pleasing Ethan Roscente. What if he decides to swap brides at the last minute? You'd be the laughingstock of the century."

The words struck Isabella like a dagger.

Her face paled instantly. Her nails dug deep into her palms.

Swap brides?

Over my dead body, Sophia!

This time, I'll make sure you disappear for good.

Exiting the restroom, Sophia's heart pounded. She immediately texted her hacker contact.

Only after receiving confirmation did she finally exhale in relief.

When Isabella returned to the waiting area, she had already regained her composure. She looped her arm through Ethan's with practiced ease.

"Ethan, I want to sit with you."

He raised a brow. "Your seat isn't here."

"But I want to be next to you," she cooed, batting her lashes.

Ethan's gaze slid meaningfully toward Sophia. "You'll have to ask Sophia. You're trying to take her spot."

Sophia seized the opportunity. "I don't mind switching."

The temperature in the room seemed to plummet the moment she spoke.

Ethan's dark eyes bore into her.

She pretended not to notice, busying herself with adjusting her bag strap.

"How generous of you," Isabella said, tilting her chin up triumphantly.

On the train, Sophia sat alone by the window.

Ethan and Isabella occupied the seats across from her.

As the scenery blurred past, her thoughts churned.

Isabella's earlier behavior had unsettled her.

Though the hacker assured her the hospital records were secure, she resolved to be even more cautious moving forward.

At their destination, Sophia strode briskly toward the exit.

Ethan suddenly grabbed her wrist. "Why did you give up your seat?"

"Wasn't that what you wanted?" Sophia scoffed.

Isn't it nice to cuddle with your fiancée?

"My want?" His jaw tightened. "Since when did you become an expert on my desires?"

"Then enlighten me," she challenged, meeting his gaze head-on.

Ethan faltered under her direct stare.

"Never mind," Sophia yanked her arm free. "I'm not interested."

"Let me drive you," he insisted, grabbing her again.

"No need." She walked away without looking back.

Another minute in that toxic atmosphere, and Isabella's glare would have turned her to Swiss cheese.

Watching their heated exchange from behind Ethan's assistant, Isabella's eyes burned with jealousy.

She stared daggers at Sophia's retreating figure, silently vowing revenge.
###Chapter 383

Sophia instinctively cradled her abdomen as she stepped out of the train station. The protective gesture was unmistakable.

Cold eyes tracked her movements from a distance. A smirk twisted the observer's lips.

Pregnant? That didn't guarantee a living child. Fate would decide.

Her ride arrived promptly. Sophia hurried inside without hesitation.

As the car merged onto the freeway, the driver frowned. "That Audi's been tailing us since the station."

Sophia turned. A black sedan with local plates followed at a steady pace. Ordinary. Unremarkable.

"Are you sure?"

"Took the same on-ramp. Still back there." The driver hesitated. "Want me to take a detour?"

She nodded.

At the next intersection, they swerved left. The Audi vanished from the rearview mirror.

"Maybe I'm paranoid." The driver chuckled nervously. "Too many crime shows lately."

Sophia stayed silent. Her fingers tightened around the seatbelt. That prickling unease lingered—just like when the stranger had asked for directions.

The tension didn't ease until she reached her apartment.

With time before work, Sophia decided to explore the neighborhood. Years away had transformed the city beyond recognition.

An empty fridge demanded groceries. As she reached the gate, drizzle misted the air.

A scream shattered the rain.

Steel flashed.

Sophia twisted aside. The blade grazed her arm. White-hot pain stole her breath.

Blood dripped from her fingertips.

Her attacker—a scarred man in his fifties—snarled with pure hatred. A stranger. Yet his eyes promised murder.

He stumbled when the knife clattered to the pavement. Cursing, he lunged again.

Sophia spun to flee—and collided with a solid chest.

A cry of pain erupted behind her.

Ethan Roscente locked her in a crushing embrace while his kick sent the assailant sprawling.

"It's over, Sophia." His palm smoothed down her trembling back. "I've got you."

The familiar scent of cedar enveloped her. Sophia opened her mouth. No sound emerged.

Fear crystallized in her widened eyes, forming a silent question.
###Chapter 384

When Ethan Roscente's lips brushed Sophia Lowell's forehead, she caught the metallic tang of blood in the air.

"Don't be afraid. I'm here."

His voice was as gentle as a spring breeze, yet it made her eyes sting. How many times had this man appeared like a guardian angel during her darkest moments, soothing her trembling soul with those same words?

Sophia looked down at her bloodied sleeve. The crimson stain bloomed like a macabre spider lily.

"You bitch! I'll kill you!"

The deranged scream came from the ground. The attacker staggered to his feet, sunlight glinting off the knife in his hand. His bloodshot eyes locked onto Sophia with feral hatred.

Ethan stood motionless as a fortress before her. She could only see the rigid line of his back, unyielding as a castle wall.

As the man lunged, Ethan pivoted with lethal grace. His fingers closed around the assailant's wrist like steel traps. A single fluid motion—the sickening crack of breaking bone echoed through the air.

"Ahhh—!"

Amidst the screams, Ethan picked up the fallen knife. When the blade pressed against the man's throat, Sophia saw the storm of violence in his eyes—a sight more terrifying than any demon from hell.

"Ethan!"

The moment she called his name, he turned. Those usually tender eyes now burned crimson, like moons drenched in blood.

Her trembling fingers closed around his hand. Through their connected skin, she felt the boiling fury beneath his surface.

"He's not worth it," she whispered. "Don't dirty your hands for trash like this."

Blood dripped from the knife onto the man's face like grotesque raindrops. Ethan's arm remained suspended, veins bulging with restrained power.

Finally, the metallic clang of the discarded blade shattered the frozen silence.

Ethan frantically wiped his bloodied hands on his ruined designer suit. As he tore off his tie, Sophia noticed the barely perceptible tremor in his fingers.

"Make another sound and you're dead."

His movements were methodical as he bound the whimpering madman to a tree, but his voice carried Arctic frost. The would-be killer instantly fell silent.

The sunlight still danced across the scene, but Sophia knew—some fractures could never be mended.
###Chapter 385

Sophia remained silent.

Ethan's disheveled appearance reminded her of an agitated wolfhound.

"How bad is it? We're going to the hospital." He hung up Zachary's call, his brow furrowed.

Sophia glanced at her bloodstained sleeve. "Just a scratch. I can bandage it at home."

Without a word, he scooped her into his arms and strode toward the apartment complex. Onlookers raised their phones, flashes popping like fireflies.

"Those videos—"

"Zachary will handle it." He cut off her concern.

Sophia squirmed. "Put me down. I can walk."

Ethan tightened his grip. "Keep struggling and see what happens."

The moment her feet touched the ground, the world tilted violently.

"Stubborn." He hauled her back against his chest, voice sharp. "And you thought you could avoid me?"

She turned away. "This was an accident."

"How many 'accidents' does that make?" His laugh was cold. "At this rate, you'll get yourself killed." A pause. "You're coming back to New York with me tonight."

"No!" Her thrashing tugged at the wound, drawing a hiss of pain.

Ethan pretended to release her. Instinctively, she locked her arms around his neck, eyes watering.

"Your own fault." Though his tone was dismissive, his hold gentled.

In the elevator, harsh lighting washed her face ghostly pale. His Adam's apple bobbed. "This isn't over."

"What if Isabella orchestrated this?" Her smirk was sardonic.

Darkness pooled in his eyes. "If proven true, she'll kneel to apologize."

Sophia feigned sleep. Last time, he'd shielded Isabella during the flowerpot incident. Why would this be different? This was just damage control to prevent her from calling the police.

Blood seeped through her sleeve, staining his tailored suit. He stared at the crimson bloom, knuckles whitening.

###Chapter 386

Sophia leaned against the cold elevator wall, her fingernails digging unconsciously into her palms.

Ethan's embrace was warm, but it couldn't thaw the ice in her heart.

This man would always stand by Isabella's side. She should have accepted that truth long ago.

The memory of the recent assassination attempt flashed through her mind. Sophia shuddered. That knife had been aimed straight at her abdomen...

"What's wrong?" Ethan noticed her trembling.

She suppressed her fear and shook her head slightly. He couldn't know about the baby. That was her final boundary.

"Stomachache?" He frowned, placing his hand on her belly.

The contact made her tense instantly. She grabbed his wrist. "Just shaken up."

The elevator's chime saved her.

When Ethan effortlessly entered the passcode, Sophia's pupils contracted. She'd changed it to the most complex combination—even Vivian needed multiple attempts to remember it.

"How do you know this?" Her voice tightened.

He chuckled, his expression utterly confident. "All your passwords follow the same pattern."

She bit her lower lip. This feeling of being completely exposed was suffocating.

With stubborn determination, she reset the code, slamming her fingers against the keypad. But when Ethan opened the lock effortlessly for the third time, defeat washed over her.

"Stop wasting your energy." His fingertip traced her tense lips. "You'll never escape me."

The words stabbed like a knife, piercing her weakest spot.

Suddenly she remembered the attacking blade, remembered that Isabella might already know about this child. Cold dread crawled up her spine, making breathing difficult.

Ethan's gaze darkened as he noticed her distress. "Tell me what's really wrong."

Sophia turned away, hiding the panic in her eyes. In this deadly game, she had to protect the life growing inside her—even if it meant standing against the entire world.
###Chapter 387

The door burst open with a bang.

She kept walking without turning around, only to be swept off her feet by a pair of strong arms.

"Put me down!" She struggled.

Ethan Roscente ignored her, kicking the door shut with his heel before gently depositing her onto the couch.

The familiar scent of home finally eased the tension in Sophia Lowell's nerves.

"Where's the first aid kit?" His voice was low, his palm smoothing over her hair in a soothing motion.

She pointed toward the TV cabinet.

He retrieved the kit quickly, then went to the kitchen to pour a glass of warm water.

"Drink." He handed it to her.

The warmth slid down her throat, and only then did she notice her hands trembling slightly.

Ethan took the empty glass and knelt before her on one knee.

His long fingers reached for her collar.

"What are you doing?" She jerked back, eyes wary.

"Treating your wound." He frowned. "The shirt has to come off."

"Just cut the sleeve," she insisted, clutching her collar protectively.

"It'll get infected." His tone brooked no argument. "Are you a doctor?"

Sophia fell silent.

She knew he was right, but beneath the shirt was only her bra. She tried to stand. "I'll do it myself."

"Don't move." He pressed a hand to her knee. "You'll reopen the wound."

"I won't die," she muttered stubbornly.

"Prefer to bleed out?" His laugh was cold.

As he reached for her again, she grabbed her collar in panic. "How do I know you won't—"

"If I wanted to do anything," he cut in, "could you stop me?"

One by one, the buttons came undone.

His fingertips occasionally brushed her skin, sending shivers down her spine.

The moment the shirt slipped off, the cold air made her shudder.

Ethan swiftly wrapped a thin blanket around her, his Adam's apple bobbing visibly.

The sharp scent of antiseptic filled the air.

Rolling up his sleeves, he revealed well-defined forearms. A cotton ball soaked in iodine dabbed gently at the wound.

"Tell me if it hurts." His brow was furrowed.

The gash stretched angrily across her pale arm, stark and glaring.

She bit her lower lip, nails digging into her palms.

"Still holding back?" He glanced up.

Sophia shook her head, beads of sweat forming at her temples.

His movements grew even lighter, as though handling something fragile and precious.
###Chapter 388

"Would it kill you to admit you're in pain?"

Ethan Roscente glared at her stubborn profile, his thumb roughly brushing over the wound on her arm.

Sophia Lowell trembled violently but clenched her jaw.

"It doesn't hurt."

She forced back her tears, nails digging into her palms.

Ethan's eyes darkened. Without warning, he leaned down and pressed his lips to the furrow between her brows.

"Why put on this act with me?"

His warm mouth traced the tension in her forehead. Sophia's lashes fluttered wildly.

A tear splashed onto his knuckle.

"I'm sorry." His Adam's apple bobbed as he kissed the wet trails on her cheeks. "I failed to protect you."

Those words broke the dam.

Sophia's composure shattered.

Ethan cupped her chin and captured her mouth in a searing kiss.

It was unbearably tender.

Her mind went blank, the pain in her arm fading into nothingness.

Only when she gasped for air did she shove him away.

"Seems..." Ethan panted against her forehead, "kissing works better than painkillers."

Sophia jerked back, yanking a blanket around herself.

"Does Mr. Roscente pamper all his women like this?"

Her voice was ice, but her pulse hammered wildly.

Ethan's expression turned stormy.

The woman who'd melted in his arms moments ago now bristled with hostility again.

"Let me dress your wound."

He twisted open the ointment tube, but she grabbed his wrist.

"I'm allergic."

Ethan narrowed his eyes. "Since when?"

"Do you care?" Sophia's lips curled mockingly. "Mr. Roscente only pays attention to bedroom matters, no?"

The tube slammed onto the coffee table.

"Sophia." His grip tightened on her nape. "Must you always provoke me?"

She turned her face away, evading his scorching gaze.

"Am I wrong? Your fiancée sends assassins after me, and her devoted fiancé swoops in to play hero—"

Ethan crushed her into the couch before she could finish.

His punishing kiss swallowed her words.
###Chapter 389

"It's done. You can leave now." Her voice was icy, eyes distant.

Ethan Roscente ignored her, carefully wrapping the bandage around her arm. "Not finished yet."

Sophia Lowell let him work, her gaze drifting to her rain-soaked hem. Wet strands of hair clung uncomfortably to her neck.

"Keep the wound dry." His fingers moved deliberately slow, as if handling something fragile.

She scoffed, fingers absently twisting the fabric of her shirt.

Ethan suddenly stood and walked to the kitchen. The sound of plastic wrap being torn pierced the quiet room. "This will let you shower." Kneeling before her, his focus was unwavering.

Sophia arched a brow. This wasn't like him. Normally, he would've carried her to the bathroom without a word.

Even as warm water cascaded over her, she couldn't shake the strangeness of his unexpected gentleness.

The scent of tobacco drifted from the balcony. Ethan leaned against the railing, cigarette glowing between his fingers. In the distance, the university buildings blazed with light—for a fleeting moment, he imagined a younger Sophia hunched over textbooks there.

The burn of ash jolted him back. The shower had stopped long ago, yet she hadn't emerged.

"Sophia?" His knock echoed in the empty bathroom. Silence.

His heart stalled when he pushed the door open. Only when he saw her asleep in the tub did his muscles unclench. Droplets trembled on her lashes with each breath.

The water had gone cold. Cradling her slippery shoulders, he watched soap suds slide down her curves. The steam carried the floral scent of jasmine shampoo. His movements were featherlight, as if afraid to wake her from a dream.

The hairdryer hummed. She instinctively leaned toward the warmth, strands tangling around his fingers like silent bonds.

Beneath the bandage, her wound flushed pink. Ethan brushed his thumb over her furrowed brow, remembering how she'd once tugged his sleeve, whining over a scraped knee.

When his lips met hers, he tasted rain and jasmine. The kiss was soft—so soft it felt like touching a dream that might shatter.
###Chapter 390

The steam in the bathroom gradually dissipated as Sophia Lowell slowly awoke under the warm water.

She didn’t dare open her eyes.

Ethan Roscente’s slender fingers combed through her hair with an uncharacteristic gentleness. The shampoo lather dissolved into her strands, carrying a faint hint of jasmine.

This was so unlike him.

Sophia held her breath, terrified of revealing she was awake. She knew this man too well—if he caught her pretending to sleep, she’d never hear the end of his teasing.

But the next second, warm lips suddenly brushed her forehead.

"Ah!" She nearly leapt out of the bathtub in shock, only to be firmly restrained by his strong arms.

"Awake?" Ethan’s deep voice held unmistakable amusement. "Miss Lowell’s acting skills could use some work."

Sophia’s eyes flew open, meeting his mocking gaze.

Only then did she realize her hand was clenched around the second button of his shirt, her fingertips white with tension. The obsidian button gleamed darkly under the light, mirroring the turbulent emotions swirling in his eyes.

"I—I was just..." she stammered, but no excuse came to mind.

Ethan leaned closer, his hot breath grazing her ear. "Like this button?" He undid it slowly. "It’s yours."

A water droplet trailed down his jawline, landing on her collarbone. Sophia shivered, instinctively shrinking back, but his hand cradled the back of her head.

"Don’t move," he rasped. "Your wound will get wet."

The towel was suddenly yanked away. Sophia gasped, scrambling for the edge of the tub, but Ethan had already wrapped her in a large towel and lifted her into his arms.

"Ethan Roscente!" Her face burned. "Put me down!"

Ignoring her, he carried her straight to the bedroom. She could feel the heat of his chest, the taut muscles beneath his damp shirt.

He set her gently on the bed. The moment she reached for the covers, his hand closed around her wrist.

"Running away?" He bent down until his nose almost touched hers. "Weren’t you bold just now?"

Sophia finally noticed the obsidian button resting in her palm, its cold hardness pressing painfully into her skin.

Just like the restrained desire in his eyes.
###Chapter 391

Ethan leaned over, casting her in his shadow. His warm lips brushed lightly against her forehead. "Rest first. I'm going to shower."

Sophia glanced at his sweat-drenched shirt, recalling the earlier tension between them. Her ears tinged pink as she gave a small nod.

He chuckled lowly, his long fingers grazing her flushed cheek before turning toward the bathroom.

The sound of running water filled the air. Sophia finally relaxed, the tightness in her nerves easing.

If they stayed alone like this any longer, she feared she might lose control.

She burrowed under the covers, pressing her face into the soft pillow. The distant chime of a school bell made her feel as if she’d slipped back into her high school days. Exhaustion washed over her like a tide, pulling her swiftly into sleep.

Ethan stepped out of the bathroom, drying his damp hair. His gaze settled on the sleeping figure.

Moving quietly, he retrieved the first-aid kit and carefully peeled back the slightly damp bandage on her arm.

Just as the antiseptic swab touched her wound, a soft knock sounded at the bedroom door.

"Come in," he murmured without looking up, keeping his voice hushed.

Zachary pushed the door open—and froze.

He had never seen Mr. Roscente like this: kneeling on one knee beside the bed, gently blowing on the wound.

This was the same ruthless man who made cutthroat decisions in the boardroom. Yet here he was, impossibly tender.

A pity this tenderness had come far too late.

"Did you find anything?" Ethan asked without lifting his head, his hands deftly wrapping fresh gauze around her arm.

Zachary lowered his gaze. "It was Isabella’s assistant who orchestrated it."

Ethan’s fingers stilled. A cold glint flashed in his eyes.

"The attacker was an obsessive stalker with mental health issues," Zachary continued. "His reward was supposed to be private photos of Isabella Valentine."

A cigarette sparked to life between Ethan’s fingers. He let out a humorless laugh. "How clever of her."

Smoke curled around his striking features, his expression darkening dangerously.

The last time he’d dealt with Dominic Valrose, it had been a warning. Yet this woman hadn’t backed down—instead, she’d escalated.

"The attacker is already detained, but..." Zachary hesitated.

"Mental illness?" Ethan exhaled a slow stream of smoke, his gaze icy. "Then send him where he belongs."

Zachary’s spine stiffened. The place Mr. Roscente meant was no ordinary psychiatric facility.

"As for Isabella..." Ethan crushed out the cigarette, his tone casual, as if discussing the weather. "Let her experience what it’s like to be hounded by a stalker."
###Chapter 392

"If he's insane, send him to the psychiatric hospital." Ethan Roscente's voice was icy. "Assign him a 'thoughtful' caretaker."

Zachary Evans understood immediately.

A psychiatric hospital was far more terrifying than prison.

There were no laws there. No dignity. Only endless torment and despair.

"What about Isabella Valentine?" Zachary asked.

Ethan gazed out the window, his eyes dark. "She still has her uses. We can't touch her yet. But anyone who dares hurt what's mine will pay."

Late at night, Isabella was jolted awake by a shrill phone ring.

Annoyed, she grabbed her phone and saw her agent Jessica Piente's name. Suppressing her irritation, she snapped, "Calling in the middle of the night like it's an emergency?"

"Zoe's been in a car accident! She's in critical condition!" Jessica's voice was urgent.

Isabella examined her freshly manicured nails, indifferent. "So what? Why the fuss?"

On the other end, Jessica frowned and glanced toward the operating room. She lowered her voice. "Why aren't you shocked? Did you know about this?"

Of course she wasn't shocked.

She had orchestrated the accident herself.

That assistant knew too many of her secrets. How could she let her live?

She'd been waiting all night for news of Sophia Lowell's death, but there was none. Ethan's room had been empty—probably off chasing that bitch.

Sacrificing her assistant was the only way to protect herself.

"That useless girl disappeared all night. Hearing about her accident is just satisfying." Isabella fabricated an excuse.

Jessica sighed in relief. "As long as you're not involved. The crash was severe—she might not make it. Return to New York first thing tomorrow. Don't linger here and cause trouble. I'll handle Zoe's family with some compensation."

Isabella hung up and knocked on Ethan's door again.

Still no answer.

Furious, she dialed his number.

The call rang endlessly.

"That bitch!" she cursed through gritted teeth, immediately ordering her bodyguards to investigate Sophia's whereabouts.

Ethan saw the caller ID but ignored it.

Sophia was burning up with fever.

Her temperature had spiked to 102°F. Her body was scorching, yet she shivered violently. Ethan tried to coax her into taking medicine, but she refused.

"Bitter..." she mumbled deliriously, spitting out the pills again and again.
###Chapter 393

Ethan Roscente's knuckles turned white as he crushed the fever-reducing pills in his palm.

"These are for fever." His voice was tight as his gaze dropped to her swollen abdomen. "You can't take them while pregnant."

Sophia Lowell's cheeks burned crimson with fever, her lashes fluttering like butterfly wings. She instinctively curled deeper into the blankets, a sheen of sweat glistening on her forehead.

"So hot..." she murmured, fingers twisting the sheets.

Ethan knelt on the edge of the bed, wringing out an ice-cold towel. With careful movements, he dabbed her scorching neck, pausing when his thumb brushed her collarbone.

"Don't touch me..." Sophia suddenly thrashed, her voice breaking. "You're getting married..."

The towel fell onto the carpet with a damp thud.

Ethan's eyes darkened. He captured her flailing wrists and pulled her against his chest. "I never agreed to that arranged marriage." His lips brushed her earlobe. "There's never been anyone else."

Through feverish delirium, Sophia heard his words. Tears spilled instantly. She dreamed of hospital corridors at seventeen, the sting of antiseptic in her nose.

"Mom..." She curled into herself. "Don't leave me..."

Ethan's heart wrenched. He pushed sweat-dampened hair from her forehead, pressing a kiss to her trembling eyelids. "I'm here." His voice was raw. "Always."

Rain lashed against the windows.

In her haze, Sophia clutched his wrinkled dress shirt like a lifeline. Burning with fever, she couldn't distinguish reality from dreams but instinctively sought his warmth.

"Ethan..." She sobbed his name. "It hurts..."

His muscles tensed, Adam's apple bobbing. Ripping off his tie, he wiped her palms with alcohol pads. "I know." He kissed her hairline. "Just a little longer."

By 3 AM, her fever dropped to 38°C. Ethan changed sweat-soaked sheets, tucking her back into the down comforter. Sophia finally stilled, breathing evening out.

At the window, he lit a cigarette. The ember's glow highlighted bloodshot eyes. His phone screen illuminated—the eighteenth missed call from the Roscente estate.

When the ashtray overflowed, rustling came from behind. Sophia pushed up weakly, squinting at his silhouette against the dawn light.

"...Water." Her voice was sandpaper-rough.

Ethan stubbed out the cigarette and lifted a glass to her lips. The rim clinked against her teeth, making her flinch. Suddenly, she focused on his red-rimmed eyes.

"You..." Her pupils contracted. "Why are you here?"

He gripped her chin, thumb grazing cracked lips. "That's my question." Ice laced his words. "Pregnant, and you dared to walk in the rain?"
###Chapter 394

"I'll never let you go."

Ethan Roscente's voice was hoarse with desperation, like a wounded beast. His fingers dug into Sophia Lowell's wrist with bone-crushing force.

"Sophia, you were the one who started this..." He bent down, teeth grazing her earlobe as scorching breath fanned across her neck. "You're never escaping me."

Darkness edged Sophia's vision as consciousness slipped through her feverish haze. She wanted to fight back, but her limbs felt leaden.

His kiss was a wildfire—devouring her lips, trailing down to her collarbone. Each mark he left seared into her skin like a brand.

"You're mine." Ethan's voice dripped with pathological obsession. "The moment you smiled at me, your fate was sealed."

Dawn light filtered through the curtains when Sophia jolted awake.

She stared at the crystal chandelier above, chest heaving. Fragmented memories flooded back—scorching palms, the sting of alcohol, that suffocating embrace.

"Awake?"

The deep voice made her flinch. Ethan leaned against the doorway, his black shirt slightly unbuttoned to reveal faint scratches along his collarbone.

Sophia instinctively clutched the sheets. The silky texture startled her—this wasn't her usual cotton pajamas.

The black lace negligee barely covered her thighs, its plunging neckline bordering on scandalous. She suddenly remembered—this was the "battle armor" Vivian Ashcroft had gifted her, buried deep in her closet.

"You..." Her ears burned, voice raw.

Ethan approached the bed. When his fingers brushed her forehead, Sophia shrank back.

"Still feverish." He frowned, thumb tracing her flushed cheek. "Porridge or noodles?"

The uncharacteristic gentleness disoriented her. Without thinking, she pinched his cheek.

"Not a dream." Ethan chuckled, capturing her hand to press a kiss to her fingertips. "Need me to prove it again?"

Electric tingles shot up her arm. Sophia yanked her hand back, staring at the embroidered bedsheets. Her throat ached like she'd swallowed glass. "What time is it?"

"5:40." He picked up the mercury thermometer. "Take your medicine after breakfast."

At the word "medicine," Sophia stiffened. "No."

The air turned glacial. Ethan gripped her chin, forcing her to meet his narrowed gaze. "Explain."

He remembered how readily she'd taken pills during past illnesses. Last night, she'd fought like it was poison, knocking over the water glass three times.

Sophia avoided his scrutiny. "Too bitter..."

His thumb stroked her trembling lips before he suddenly leaned down to taste them. "The fever reducer I gave you was strawberry-flavored."
###Chapter 395

Ethan Roscente's slender fingers gripped her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze.

"Sophia, you're lying."

His piercing eyes seemed to see through every layer of her facade.

Sophia Lowell's lashes fluttered, her throat tightening. She was hiding something from him—a secret that could change everything between them.

"I..."

Before she could speak, her phone rang sharply.

Ethan frowned at the caller ID—Isabella Valentine. He gave Sophia's hand a reassuring squeeze before rising to answer by the window.

"Yes. Noon."

Three words. That was all it took to freeze Sophia's blood. She hugged her knees, nails digging into her palms.

So close.

She'd almost confessed the secret that would ruin her.

When Ethan returned, she'd curled into herself like a wounded animal.

"What were you going to say earlier?" He leaned down.

Sophia forced a brittle smile. "The medicine tastes bitter. I don't want it."

His brow furrowed as he reached for her forehead. "You're still feverish. Take it."

She jerked away. "I know my own body. You've done enough babysitting for one night, Mr. Roscente."

His eyes darkened. "Because of that call?"

"Don't flatter yourself." Her laugh was ice. "I just realized something."

"What?"

"That we should've never been anything more than debtor and creditor."

She met his stare head-on. "After all, who could love a creditor who treats them like a plaything?"

Ethan's expression turned dangerous. He seized her wrist. "Say that again."

She struggled uselessly against his grip.

"I said you disgust me." Each word was a dagger. "Now. Let. Go."

The air turned to glass.

Ethan studied her defiant glare—and suddenly smiled. "Sophia Lowell, you're a terrible actress."

He closed the distance, breath hot against her ear. "The harder you push me away, the more I will uncover what you're hiding."
###Chapter 396

Ethan Roscente's eyes turned icy, his long fingers tightening on the edge of the table.

"Sophia, stop this."

Her lips curled into a mocking smile. "When have I ever?"

His heavy gaze settled on her pale face. "So eager to draw a line between us?"

Sophia Lowell's fingers unconsciously twisted the bedsheet. Her voice was feather-light. "The line was always there."

He was the moon in the sky. She was dust beneath his feet.

These two years of absurd entanglement were nothing but her delusion.

Ethan studied her for a long moment before speaking. "That call earlier was about last night."

Her head snapped up. "And?"

"Curious?" He arched a brow leisurely.

"Obviously!" She gritted her teeth. "I have the right to know."

He adjusted his cuffs with deliberate slowness. "Finish your breakfast first."

"Not hungry."

She turned away, her stomach knotted like cotton.

"Fine."

As he turned to leave, Sophia blurted out, "I'll have the porridge!"

Ethan didn't look back. "Wait."

Minutes later, he returned with a tray.

Steam rose from the plain congee, accompanied by two small side dishes. Despite her earlier lack of appetite, the aroma made her stomach growl.

After washing up, she settled back in bed, sipping from the bowl.

The porridge was perfectly cooked, the sides refreshing. She hadn't expected Ethan to have such good taste.

He stood by the bed, watching her eat.

"Done."

"That's all?" His brows furrowed. "Birds eat more than you."

She wiped her mouth. "The stray downstairs finishes two cans per meal. That's why it's round as a ball."

"......"

The calico cat stumbled mid-jump onto the bed.

Rude much, human?

Meeting the cat's indignant stare, Sophia quickly scooped it into her arms, scratching its head. "Our Calico isn't fat. She's voluptuous, the Marilyn Monroe of cats."

The cat immediately purred, tail held high.

Watching this, Ethan felt an inexplicable tightness in his chest. He'd stayed up all night, only to be met with coldness. This fat cat did nothing but eat and sleep, yet got all the cuddles and kisses.

At twenty-eight, it was his first time feeling upstaged by a feline.
###Chapter 397

What was Mrs. Roscente's medical miracle?

The answer was cooking.

To be precise, cooking for her granddaughter, Luna.

On the seventh morning after surgery, Mrs. Roscente managed to sit up on her own.

"Doctor, can I be discharged today?" she asked eagerly.

The doctor flipped through her charts and smiled. "Your recovery is faster than expected, but we need at least ten more days of observation."

"But I need to go home and cook for Luna..." The old woman's eyes pleaded.

The doctor chuckled. "Your wound requires three months of rest. Cooking is out of the question."

"How is cooking strenuous?" Mrs. Roscente argued stubbornly.

Mr. Roscente quickly intervened. "Margaret can handle the cooking. Just focus on recovering."

His wife shot him an irritated glare.

After the doctor left, Mrs. Roscente collapsed onto the bed, looking utterly defeated.

What was the point of old age if she couldn't feed her granddaughter?

Margaret, ever perceptive, handed her a notepad. "I'll do the cooking, and you can supervise. We'll make sure Miss Luna eats well."

The old woman's eyes lit up instantly.

"Start with steamed egg custard and pan-fried buns..." She scribbled furiously. "Abalone noodles, fish tofu congee, crystal shrimp dumplings..."

Mr. Roscente blinked in astonishment.

"That's just the appetizer," she said without looking up. "For the main course, we'll have sticky rice chicken with steamed ribs..."

He swallowed hard.

Margaret added thoughtfully, "Should we include blueberry yogurt for digestion?"

"Yes! Balanced nutrition is key!" Mrs. Roscente closed the menu with satisfaction.

Meanwhile, Luna was devouring her breakfast like a starved wolf.

Since returning from the underworld, her appetite had skyrocketed—yet she never gained weight. Every bite converted into spiritual energy.

This only strengthened Mrs. Roscente's determination to feed her.

After breakfast, Luna bounded back to the Roscente estate.

"Dad, any updates?" She immediately sought out Gabriel.

Gabriel stared at the surveillance screen, then narrowed his eyes. "Look. Here she comes."

The footage showed Yuanyuan sneaking around the Feng residence.

"Her again..." Luna wrinkled her nose, disliking the self-proclaimed "cousin."

"Walter." Gabriel's voice turned cold.

A black-clad bodyguard materialized instantly. "Sir!"

"Track her movements over the past month."

Thirty minutes later, Walter handed over a USB drive. "She's visited the Wang, Sun, Li, and Zhao families..."

Gabriel marked the locations on a map, his expression darkening.

The pattern formed a perfect circle around the Roscente estate.

"Plastic wrap formation!" Luna pointed angrily at the sky. "Dad, let's tear it down!"

**

Yuanyuan hummed cheerfully as she approached the Feng residence.

"One more house, and the Roscentes will be mine!" she thought gleefully.

A female ghost floated beside her, lips curled in a mocking smirk.

This foolish girl was so easy to manipulate.

Those so-called "evil spirits" were actually her prearranged pawns.

"Mrs. Feng!" Yuanyuan put on her sweetest smile.

The woman welcomed her warmly. "Come in! My son suddenly developed a high fever..."

She lowered her voice. "Strange things have been happening to all the families nearby. It's like we've been cursed..."

Yuanyuan gloated internally, unaware of the two figures watching coldly from a nearby rooftop.

"Dad, should we move now?" Luna cracked her knuckles.

Gabriel rested a hand on her head. "Wait. Let's catch her in the act."

His eyes glinted dangerously.

Anyone who dared target the Roscentes would pay.
###Chapter 398

Ethan Roscente's slender fingers lightly brushed the tip of her nose, his eyes filled with helpless amusement.

"You little heartless thing," he murmured.

He turned and walked into the bathroom, returning with a warm towel. Gently, he wiped her flushed cheeks, then carefully cleaned every inch of her skin.

By the bedside, his deep, rich voice hummed a lullaby as his palm rhythmically patted her back.

Sophia Lowell's furrowed brows gradually relaxed. Like a kitten, she nuzzled against the hem of his shirt and drifted into sleep.

The crystal chandelier in the upscale restaurant cast dazzling reflections.

Isabella Valentine sat poised by the window, her fingertips tracing the rim of her wine glass. She had deliberately postponed her return to New York this morning, all for this rare lunch date.

Her phone vibrated, and a sweet smile curved her lips.

"Ethan is finally coming..."

The click of high heels approached from a distance. She turned eagerly, but her smile froze instantly.

"Zachary?" Her voice turned icy.

Zachary Evans took a seat across from her, placing his briefcase aside. "Mr. Roscente is currently tending to Miss Lowell, who's fallen ill. He asked me to attend in his stead."

"Ill?" Isabella's nails dug into her palm, though her face showed concern. "Is it serious? Does she need a doctor?"

Her mind raced—if they went for a medical checkup, that secret would be exposed...

"Just a common cold," Zachary said sharply. "Mr. Roscente is personally looking after her. She'll recover soon."

Isabella exhaled in feigned relief. "That's good. Since Ethan is occupied, I won't trouble you further."

She made to stand, but Zachary stopped her.

"Miss Valentine, please stay." He slid a document toward her. "Mr. Roscente has something he'd like you to review."

Her chest tightened, but she forced composure as she opened the file. The moment her fingers touched the paper, her expression changed.
###Chapter 399

The folder slammed onto the table, scattering a stack of photographs.

Isabella Valentine recoiled as if burned the moment her fingers grazed the edge of a photo. Her pupils contracted violently, lips trembling uncontrollably.

The woman in the photos was unmistakably her.

The grotesque images churned her stomach. Men of different races and nationalities, twisted in repulsive positions—while she wore an expression of sickening pleasure.

"This... can't be real." Her voice cracked. "These are all fakes!"

She grabbed the photos in a frenzy, shredding them with her nails. The screeching sound of paper tearing filled the room.

Zachary Evans watched coldly before pulling a USB drive from his suit pocket. "Tear them all you want, Ms. Valentine. The originals are here."

"Who gave these to you?" She lunged at him, nails digging into his arm. "Was it that bitch Sophia Lowell?"

He shoved her away in disgust, wiping his sleeve with a handkerchief. "Mr. Roscente has known your true colors for a while. Why do you think he sent you to Hong Kong?"

He flicked the last photo forward. In a dimly lit private room, Isabella was greedily inhaling white powder, surrounded by naked men sprawled across the floor.

"You know the penalty for this in our country."

Her legs gave out, collapsing into the chair. The gravity of the threat finally sank in.

Zachary tossed another file onto the table. "Shall I remind you about last night's hit-and-run?"

The papers fanned out, capturing the moment her assistant was sent flying by the impact. Isabella's entire body shook, nails scraping the tabletop.

"What... do you want?" Her voice splintered.

"Mr. Roscente gave you chances." His gaze bore down on her. "Starting from your first attempt on Ms. Lowell."

Isabella erupted into hysterical laughter. "I'm about to become Mrs. Roscente! You dare touch me? The Roscente family will burn with me!"

Expressionless, Zachary collected the evidence. "Try it, Ms. Valentine. Let's see if the Valentines can protect a drug-addicted murderer."

As he turned to leave, she hurled a teacup at him. Porcelain exploded against the wall, shards scattering like shrapnel.

"Tell Ethan Roscente," she screamed, voice raw with madness, "I'll drag Sophia Lowell to hell with me!"
###Chapter 400

"Ms. Valentine, whether I'm doing well or not isn't for you to judge." Zachary adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses, his gaze sharp as a blade behind the lenses. "As for threats? This is simply a fair transaction."

Isabella clenched the napkin in her hand, her knuckles turning white. "What exactly are you trying to say?"

"You'll find out when you return to New York." Zachary took a slow sip of coffee. "Mr. Roscente will speak with you personally. But I advise you not to play games—" He leaned forward abruptly. "The backups of those documents are far more extensive than you think."

Her pupils constricted.

"Oh, and one more thing," Zachary added with a faint smirk. "I suggest you stay away from Ms. Lowell. Mr. Roscente has taken note of all your little schemes."

"What schemes?" Isabella's voice rose before she forcibly lowered it. "I don’t know what you’re talking about."

"Need a reminder?" His fingers tapped lightly on the table. "The car accident. The near-drowning—did you really think Mr. Roscente wouldn’t uncover the truth?"

It was a bluff. Those two incidents had been executed flawlessly, leaving even Ethan temporarily without leads. But Isabella’s reaction was telling—

"That’s nonsense!" She shot to her feet, her knife clattering to the floor. "I only had someone throw a flowerpot! And that coward ran off with the money! Sophia has plenty of enemies—why pin it on me?"

A glint of triumph flashed in Zachary’s eyes.

So the flowerpot incident had indeed been her doing. But the hired help had backed out, allowing the real culprit to slip in. That meant the car accident and near-drowning were someone else’s handiwork...

"Whether it’s you or not, Mr. Roscente will find out." Zachary stood, straightening his suit. "No one escapes."

Isabella suddenly grabbed his wrist, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. "I’m his fiancée..."

"Fiancée?" He yanked his hand free with a cold laugh. "This was always a mutually beneficial arrangement. You were the one who crossed the line." Turning away, he delivered his final warning: "Stay in your lane, and these files will never see the light of day."

The moment the door closed, Isabella overturned the table with a crash of shattering porcelain. Trembling, she dialed an encrypted number. "Ethan knows everything! You have to help me!"

A mechanized voice answered. "At what cost?"

"Sophia is pregnant." Her manicured nails dug into her palm. "I want her—dead."

Sophia awoke to sunlight flooding the room. Her fever had broken, leaving her mind clearer, though her throat still felt raw. Instinctively, she reached for the other side of the bed—only to find the sheets smooth and cold.

Of course. It had been a dream. That gentle version of Ethan coaxing her to take medicine couldn’t have been real.

She staggered to her feet, bracing herself against the wall as she left the bedroom—then froze.

In the open kitchen, a tall figure in an apron was tasting soup. Hearing her approach, he turned. Ethan’s hair was still damp. "You’re awake. Perfect timing—the congee is ready."
###Chapter 401

Sophia Lowell shuffled toward the kitchen, rubbing sleep from her eyes.

A tall silhouette was outlined against the frosted glass.

She froze.

Her pulse quickened.

This couldn't be real.

She pinched her arm hard.

The sharp pain confirmed she wasn't dreaming.

Ethan Roscente stood in her kitchen.

His broad frame looked comically out of place in the cramped space.

He had to hunch slightly to avoid the low ceiling.

The muscles beneath his dress shirt flexed with each movement.

A cheap floral apron—probably from a discount store—was tied around his waist.

Strangely, it suited him.

Morning sunlight streamed through the window, gilding him in soft gold.

Sophia held her breath.

She'd assumed he'd left hours ago.

Last night's tenderness as he'd lulled her to sleep hadn't been a fever dream after all.

"Awake?"

Ethan turned.

His lips curved when he saw her rooted in the doorway.

"Come here."

As if under a spell, she obeyed.

Cool fingers pressed against her forehead.

"Fever's gone."

He nodded, satisfied.

His familiar sandalwood cologne wrapped around her.

For a disorienting moment, Sophia didn't recognize this version of Ethan.

Yet her traitorous heart fluttered.

"Still groggy?"

He ruffled her bedhead.

That uncharacteristically gentle tone made her stomach flip.

Sophia jerked backward.

"Why are you still here?"

"Never left."

One dark brow arched.

"Patients require supervision."

The words sent an electric jolt through her chest.

She looked away.

"I'm fine now."

"Kicking me out so soon?"

Amusement laced his voice.

"At least let me finish breakfast."

The porridge on the stove bubbled softly.

The rich aroma filled every corner of the tiny kitchen.
###Chapter 402

Ethan scooped a spoonful of steaming soup, blew on it carefully, and brought it to her lips. "Black chicken soup. Good for blood circulation."

Sophia stared at the golden broth, its aroma filling her nostrils. She pursed her lips. "After this sip, am I meeting my maker?"

"You finished the porridge just fine this morning," Ethan arched a brow. "If I wanted to harm you, would I go through all this trouble?"

Sophia froze.

That sweet, perfectly cooked porridge—he made it himself?

She suddenly remembered the poorly presented dishes on the table after she woke up from being drugged. Back then, he'd stubbornly denied cooking them, claiming they were takeout.

Who knew his culinary skills had improved so much in such a short time?

"My arm's tired," he said, shaking the spoon slightly.

Reluctantly, she took a sip. The rich flavor exploded on her tongue, making her eyes narrow in pleasure.

"Well?" His eyes gleamed with anticipation.

"Passable." She turned her face away.

Ethan chuckled and ruffled her hair. "Go wash up. Dinner's ready."

Sophia glared at him. How could he act so casual?

"Need me to carry you?" He started to rise.

"..."

The bathroom door slammed shut with enough force to shake the walls.

Ethan rubbed his nose. Another tantrum.

Ten minutes later, Sophia emerged, emotions under control. If he insisted on playing housekeeper, so be it.

The dining table was laden with dishes. Fish congee steamed gently, noodles perfectly separated, and an array of sides—emerald shrimp, silken tofu, a vibrant fruit platter.

"I wanted to make dessert," he pulled out a chair, "but you're still on dietary restrictions."

Sophia stirred the fish congee. "This is enough. Don’t come again. Your fiancée might get the wrong idea."

"Wrong idea?" He sat across from her. "Who?"

"The wedding's tomorrow," she met his gaze. "Shouldn’t the groom be busy?"

Ethan methodically shredded the fish and pushed the bowl toward her. "Last night, when you clung to me begging, you didn’t seem to mind."

His lips curled coldly. "So I’m only useful at night?"
###Chapter 403

"..."

Some people never change their stripes.

This man could turn even the most innocent remark into something suggestive.

The corner of his mouth curled into a teasing smirk. "What? Am I wrong? Isn't burning bridges your specialty?"

Sophia kept her head down, focusing on her meal and ignoring him.

Ding-dong—

The doorbell rang abruptly.

She barely had time to set down her chopsticks before Ethan was already on his feet, pressing a hand to her shoulder. "Keep eating. I'll get it."

She didn't argue, already guessing who it was.

If someone was determined to stir up trouble, why stop them?

Ethan expected Zachary with updates about Isabella. Instead, Vivian's scowling face greeted him the moment the door opened.

"Holy shit! You again?" Vivian bristled like an angry cat. "Can't you take a hint? My Sophia's hiding here to get away from you! Do I need to hire an exorcist to banish your creepy ass?"

She rolled up her sleeves, ready to charge past him. "What the hell did you do to my Sophia this time—"

Her tirade cut off abruptly when her eyes landed on the pink apron tied around Ethan's waist. Her jaw dropped. "What fresh hell is this? Domestic roleplay?"

"Your Sophia?" Ethan's eyes narrowed dangerously. "Since when?"

"None of your damn business! Where is she?"

Vivian shoved past him and froze in relief at the sight of Sophia unharmed at the dining table. "Thank God this bastard didn't hurt you. I'd have to chop him into pieces otherwise."

Then she noticed Sophia's pallor. "You look terrible. And why is your arm bandaged—"

Ethan moved like lightning, shielding Sophia. "Wash your hands first. You're covered in germs."

"Sick?" Vivian blinked in confusion.

Sophia nudged him aside with a shrug. "Just a fever last night."

"This is your fault!" Vivian jabbed a finger at Ethan's chest.

His gaze turned glacial. "Keep pointing and you'll lose that finger."

Vivian instantly recoiled, pouting at Sophia. "Sophia, he's bullying me."

Sophia shot Ethan a warning look before leading Vivian to the bathroom.

"What the hell happened?" Vivian demanded while scrubbing her hands. "One night apart and you're sick and injured?"

Sophia gave her the abbreviated version.

"That bitch Isabella!" Vivian stomped her foot.

Sophia nodded. "Her."

"And this bastard just protected her?"

Sophia's expression darkened. "He shut me out. Made it clear he's covering for her."

"Those two deserve each other!" Vivian seethed. "I could strangle them both!"

"Let it go. We can't win against them." Sophia's laugh was bitter. "Best to just stay out of their way."

Vivian bit her lip. "But can you really avoid them?" She lowered her voice. "He tracked you down here. This twisted relationship is far from over."

Sophia stayed silent, the weight in her chest like a stone.
###Chapter 404

Sunlight filtered through the sheer curtains, casting a warm glow over the dining table. Sophia Lowell stared blankly at the steaming bowl of chicken soup in front of her.

Even a city as vast as Seattle had no place for an unmarried pregnant woman. She needed to make plans—soon.

"Eat while it's hot." Sophia pushed the bowl of shredded chicken noodles toward Vivian Ashcroft.

Vivian swallowed hard. Her stomach growled with hunger, but she nudged the soup back. "You're the one who's sick. Take care of yourself first."

The kitchen door swung open. Ethan Roscente stepped out, carrying a fresh bowl of soup. He set it gently in front of Sophia.

"You made this?" Vivian's eyes widened, her chopsticks nearly slipping from her fingers. She turned to Sophia. "He let you cook in this condition?"

Ethan didn't even glance up. "The fish congee has astragalus. The soup has angelica root." He lifted a spoonful and blew on it. "Better than medicine."

Vivian eyed the golden broth warily. Since when did the Roscente heir know how to cook? Was it poisoned?

"Sick people need real medicine," she blurted. "What if it turns into pneumonia? You'd need IV drips—" She cut herself off, nearly biting her tongue.

Sophia's chopsticks clattered onto the table.

"I hate needles," Vivian laughed nervously, a sheen of sweat forming on her forehead. "Childhood trauma, right, Soph?"

Ethan placed a piece of fish in Sophia's bowl. "You always took your medicine when you had a cold before."

The dining room fell deathly silent.

Vivian slammed her palm on the table. "Because of what you did last time—" Her face flushed crimson. "You drove her to the hospital! Three days of IVs! She cried at the sight of pills!"

Sophia's ears burned scarlet.

Ethan paused. The memory of Sophia burning with fever last month darkened his gaze.

"Don't eat it if you don't want to." He ladled more congee into a bowl. "Tell me what you'd prefer."

Under the table, Vivian squeezed Sophia's icy fingers. They exchanged a knowing glance.

Sophia lowered her head over the soup, steam blurring her vision. She had to leave—before her pregnancy showed.
###Chapter 405

Vivian Ashcroft devoured every last bite of food before gulping down two bowls of chicken soup. Only then did she finally catch her breath.

Slumping into her chair, she rubbed her distended belly while twirling a toothpick between her fingers. She mentally calculated how many extra cardio sessions she'd need tonight to burn off this binge.

"Ethan," she smacked her lips, "your cooking still needs work. The flavor was mediocre at best."

Ethan Roscente emerged from the bathroom adjusting his tie. His gaze swept over the spotless dishes—clean enough to see his reflection—before curling his lips into a cold smirk.

"Hey, what's with that attitude?" Vivian glared. "I'm giving you constructive criticism. Don't be ungrateful."

Shrugging into his suit jacket, Ethan walked toward Sophia Lowell, who was sipping soup with deliberate slowness. He pressed a hand to her forehead, voice softening. "There's an emergency meeting in New York. Take your medicine on schedule since your fever just broke. Keep the wound dry and change the dressing daily."

Sophia's spoon stilled. She didn't look up. "Go ahead. Don't come back."

This marked the fourth time she'd dismissed him. Ethan's Adam's apple bobbed as he leaned down, eyes boring into her. "Do you really hate seeing me that much?"

"Yes." Her answer came swift and sharp.

The air turned glacial. Vivian shrank into her shoulders, darting nervous glances between them. The oppressive atmosphere radiating from Ethan wisely sealed her lips.

A phone ring shattered the silence. Ethan glanced at the screen and declined the call. Moving toward the foyer, his mouth twisted into a mocking curve. "As you wish."

The door slammed shut with enough force to make Vivian flinch.

"Sophia..." She scooted closer with concern.

Sophia pushed the soup bowl away and rose unsteadily. "I'm fine."

Vivian intercepted her attempt to clear the table. "Sit down, patient!" She efficiently stacked the dishes while stealing glances at her friend's pallid profile.

Outside, tree shadows danced across the window. Sophia stared blankly at the shifting patterns. Vivian wiped the table with a sigh. Others might not know, but she understood—the more decisively Sophia pushed people away, the deeper it cut her.

How could anyone endure watching the love of their life marry someone else?

Especially someone like Sophia, whose loyalty ran bone-deep. After Ethan's betrayal years ago, it had taken her two years to barely function again. They say when guarded hearts finally love, they love catastrophically. The saying held painfully true.

Vivian remembered Sophia's childhood—an absent father, a jet-setting mother. Though her grandparents provided warmth, it couldn't replace parents. By middle school, even that comfort vanished when she boarded away from home. By the time her mother noticed the emotional distance and quit her job to reconnect, Sophia's personality had already hardened beyond repair.
###Chapter 406

Beneath Sophia Lowell's gentle facade lay an unyielding soul.

Her graceful demeanor was merely a protective wall. Only those who truly knew her heart could glimpse her real self.

Vivian Ashcroft was that rare exception.

Years ago, Vivian had clung to Sophia like stubborn gum, pestering her relentlessly.

Exasperated, Sophia finally relented and accepted her friendship. That decision forged a bond that would last a lifetime.

Ethan Roscente was the indelible mark on Sophia's heart.

Her first love's flutter had once made her naively believe they'd grow old together. Reality delivered the cruelest blow.

Had they not reunited two years ago, perhaps fate wouldn't feel so mocking.

Vivian still remembered that night vividly.

Sophia had just arrived in New York, her voice bubbling with excitement over the phone. She'd met the one she'd longed for.

That joy eclipsed even her elation at getting into her dream university.

In that moment, Vivian understood—this man had taken root too deeply in Sophia's heart.

If she'd known her ill-conceived advice that night would cause such agony now, Vivian would've sewn her own lips shut.

"Mr. Roscente."

Zachary Evans approached as Ethan descended the stairs.

"The meeting's postponed thirty minutes. We can still make the high-speed train."

Ethan gave a slight nod and entered the car.

When Zachary moved to report on Isabella Valentine, Ethan raised a hand to stop him.

The man's slender fingers tapped his knee. "Pull Sophia Lowell's complete hospital records from two months ago."

"Is Ms. Lowell unwell?"

"Something feels off." Ethan narrowed his eyes. He recalled acute gastritis, yet Vivian mentioned high fever. The discrepancy set off alarms.

Today's casual probing had yielded unexpected results. Sophia's resistance to medication had always puzzled him—now he'd found his lead.

"Also check her medication allergy history."

"Understood." Zachary noted it down before briefing on Isabella.

Ethan's lips curled coldly. "Now she's scared? She hasn't begun to suffer."

"Ms. Valentine will certainly contact you upon returning to New York."

"Let her wait." Ethan leaned back into the leather seat, a glint flashing in his eyes.

Vivian finished clearing the table and tidied the kitchen.

Finding Sophia slumped on the couch, she anxiously touched her friend's abdomen. "Sure you don't need the hospital? Between the injury and fever, could the baby—"

"It's fine." Sophia gently cradled her stomach. "I didn't take any meds."

"You endured it raw?" Vivian frowned at the bandages wrapping Sophia's arm.

Sophia nodded. "For the baby, I had to."

"God knows what you went through." Vivian's voice trembled.
###Chapter 407

"Honestly, I was terrified too." Vivian Ashcroft bit her straw, fingers absently tapping the table. "That person was clearly targeting your belly."

Sophia Lowell traced the rim of her cup, a cold glint flashing in her eyes. "How did Isabella Valentine find out about my pregnancy? Zachary handled all the prenatal records."

She suddenly looked up. "Could it be the medicine?"

Vivian frowned. "What medicine?"

"At the mall two days ago, a woman bumped into me while asking for directions." Sophia recalled. "When I got home, my prenatal vitamins were missing."

Vivian straightened abruptly. "You think... she sent someone?"

"Most likely." Sophia pressed her lips together. "I ran into her at the OB-GYN department before. She must have gotten suspicious."

"So she took your pills for testing!" Vivian slammed the table. "That woman has a bloodhound's nose!"

Sophia gave a bitter smile. "My mistake for being careless."

"How is this your fault?" Vivian grasped her hand. "No one expected her to be this relentless."

Sunlight filtered through the leaves outside, casting dappled shadows on the ground. Sophia watched quietly. "I might have to leave Seattle."

Vivian's heart skipped. "You're going into hiding?"

"Ethan won't let go, and Isabella is watching like a hawk." Sophia caressed her abdomen. "For the baby's sake, I have to go."

"But Ethan's methods..." Vivian trailed off.

"There's always a way." Sophia's gaze hardened with determination. "Even if it costs me my life, I'll protect this child."

Vivian gently tapped Sophia's belly. "Be good, little one. Come safely into this world."

She hesitated before asking cautiously, "Tomorrow's wedding... Are you sure you don't want me there with you?"

Sophia forced a smile. "Don't worry, I'm not that fragile. This is just the beginning. If I hide and cry every time they flaunt their love or have children, what kind of life is that?"

"Call me anytime." Vivian mimed a phone with her fingers. "It's just an hour's drive from the studio."

"Okay." Sophia lifted her teacup. Steam curled between them, her eyes unusually clear.
###Chapter 408

A black luxury van idled outside the Roscente Tower, its windows reflecting the city's neon glow.

Isabella Valentine clenched her skirt, her nails digging into her palms.

Gazing up at the steel-and-glass monolith, she felt a flicker of hesitation for the first time.

Every minute from the airport had been torture. Countless calls went unanswered.

"I have to see him..." she murmured, biting her lip.

She'd agree to anything—just to salvage tomorrow's wedding. The photos, the scandal—all of it could be pinned on someone else.

"It was all my assistant's idea..." The rehearsed lie played on loop in her mind.

Two bodyguards trailed her, carrying elegant afternoon tea gift boxes.

"Ms. Valentine here to visit again?" The receptionist beamed. "Mr. Roscente is so lucky."

"With the wedding tomorrow, you're still delivering treats? What a perfect fiancée."

"We can't wait for the celebration!"

The syrupy praise eased her tension slightly. She gestured for the bodyguards to distribute red envelopes.

The elevator doors slid shut, mirroring her meticulously applied makeup.

The executive floor staff had gotten the memo, lining up at the elevator bank.

"Welcome, Mrs. Roscente!" The chorus of greetings rang out—except for Jessica, who kept typing without looking up.

Jessica smirked, recalling that pretty girl always summoned to the CEO's office alone.

Who knew she'd turn out to be a Roscente niece?

Shaking her head, Jessica refocused on her files. At least she hadn't mocked the girl like those fired colleagues.
###Chapter 409

Jessica Piente watched the whispering colleagues with a knowing smirk.

These youngsters were still too naive.

She had witnessed Ethan Roscente pinning Sophia Lowell against the desk in a passionate kiss.

That forbidden, electric tension was true chemistry.

Isabella Valentine?

Jessica scoffed.

Isabella basked in the flattery, cheeks flushing pink.

"The wedding isn't until tomorrow..." She feigned shyness, lowering her gaze.

"Mrs. Roscente suits you perfectly!"

"You might as well get used to it now!"

The chorus of "Mrs. Roscente" made Isabella's heart soar.

She playfully scolded them while efficiently distributing red envelopes and desserts.

"You're impossible..."

Laughter died abruptly.

A cold voice cut through the air. "Is this a social club or a workplace?"

Ethan Roscente strode forward, expressionless, with Zachary Evans glowering behind him.

The entire floor fell silent.

Isabella twisted her fingers together, eyes welling up.

She never expected Ethan to humiliate her publicly.

"Who authorized your presence here?" His gaze was glacial.

Isabella's lips trembled. "I just—"

"Mrs. Roscente?" Ethan's laugh was icy. "You're not qualified."

The words slapped her like a physical blow.

Her nails dug into her palms.

"Zachary." Ethan didn't turn.

"Find out who let her in. Fire them immediately."

Isabella's face drained of color.

Employees who'd accepted her bribes exchanged nervous glances.

"Everyone's bonuses are canceled this month."

Ethan walked away without a backward glance, leaving a tomb-like silence in his wake.
###Chapter 410

Zachary Evans scanned the stunned employees with a sigh before quickly following Ethan Roscente.

The penalized staff exchanged bewildered glances.

A few flattering words had cost them their bonuses.

No one could comprehend it.

What was happening?

Tomorrow was Ethan's wedding to Isabella Valentine.

Why had he publicly humiliated her?

As if the wedding didn't exist at all.

What had changed?

Regardless of the reason, no one dared to keep the coffee, desserts, or red envelopes now.

They hastily returned the items to the table and scattered, stealing glances at Isabella still standing there.

Isabella bit her lip hard, nails digging into her palms.

Her face was deathly pale, still reeling from Ethan's brutal rejection.

The employees' pitying stares made her wish the ground would swallow her whole.

The office door swung open.

Zachary emerged. "Miss Valentine, Mr. Roscente will see you now."

Relief flooded her.

If he was willing to meet, there was still hope.

She forced a smile and strode inside.

Ethan sat elegantly on the sofa, legs crossed.

He scrolled through his phone with a slight frown, displeased by whatever he saw.

"Ethan, let me explain—"

He raised a hand, voice glacial. "Take a seat, Miss Valentine."

The formal address hit like ice water.

Her eyes instantly welled up. "Ethan, please—"

"Enough." He set his phone down, gaze sharp as a blade. "Zachary has already clarified everything."

"Those were lies! I was forced!" she pleaded desperately.

"Isabella."

His fathomless eyes lifted, chilling her to the bone.

Tears spilled uncontrollably.

"I warned you," he enunciated each word. "Play your role quietly, and you'd get everything you wanted."

She looked up sharply, tears rolling down.

"Pity," Ethan sneered. "You kept testing my limits."

"It wasn't like that—"

Her trembling hand reached for him but recoiled at his arctic stare.
###Chapter 411

Ethan Roscente lit a cigarette, the pale smoke curling in the air.

"This morning was just the appetizer." He flicked the ash. "If there's a next time, all of New York will hear about Miss Valentine's 'glorious achievements.'"

Isabella Valentine's face turned deathly pale, tears welling in her eyes. "You can't do this..."

"Can't?" His lips curled into a cold smirk, his gaze sharp as a blade. "I have far worse methods waiting."

Her legs gave out, and she collapsed to the floor, trembling. "Is this... because of Sophia?"

"If I wanted revenge," he leaned down, his voice icy, "you'd already be in the morgue."

She shrank back, looking up at him. "Then what do you want?"

Ethan straightened, staring down at her with disdain. "You know exactly what I want."

She bit her lip hard enough to draw blood before forcing out the terrible thought: "...Call off the engagement?"

"No." His tone was indifferent.

A flicker of hope lit her eyes. "Really?"

"But I don't intend to marry you either."

The hope died instantly. Realization dawned. "You want to postpone it."

He crushed the cigarette, a faint smirk playing on his lips. "Smart girl."

"That's impossible!" She shot to her feet, voice shaking. "The invitations are sent! The guests are notified!"

"That's your problem." His tone was detached, as if it meant nothing to him.

Isabella suddenly laughed.

So that was it. He wanted to delay the wedding—and make her take the blame. That way, he could protect Sophia while keeping his hands clean.

"Why?" Her voice trembled. "Why should I sacrifice for you two?"

Ethan's eyes turned glacial. "Because you're William Valentine's daughter."

"What does that mean?" She froze.

"You don't need to know." He turned toward the window.

Isabella chased after him, unwilling to let it go. "Sophia doesn't love you! She's just using you! She went back to Seattle, didn't she?"

"But I'm different—I truly love you! All this time, the way you treated me... I refuse to believe it was all fake! You scolded her for me, humiliated her in public, even blacklisted her best friend..."

She believed in love that grew over time. In all those romance novels, didn't the male lead always realize his true feelings too late?

"Enough." His voice cut like ice. "If you weren't a Valentine, I wouldn't even spare you a glance."

The words stabbed like a knife. She staggered back, tears streaming. "No... that's not true..."

Ethan frowned impatiently. "I've said my piece. Do what you will."

Her fists clenched her skirt so tightly her knuckles turned white. Then she looked up, voice breaking. "Ethan Roscente... you love Sophia, don't you?"
###Chapter 412

Ethan Roscente's eyes darkened as his long fingers tapped rhythmically on the desk. He hadn't intended to engage with Isabella Valentine, but the question compelled him to answer.

"Yes, I love her."

His voice was low, shadows swirling in his gaze. "From the moment I first saw her, I wanted to possess her. Seeing her with another man makes me want to kill him."

Isabella clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms.

"Sophia Lowell belongs to me." Ethan's expression turned obsessive. "No matter where she runs, I'll drag her back. Even if she hates me, I'll keep her locked away forever."

Isabella bit her lip hard, chest heaving. She lowered her head to hide the venom in her eyes before speaking hoarsely, "I understand."

Bending to pick up her fallen purse, she forced a brittle smile despite her tear-streaked face. "I'll behave from now on. I won't cause Sophia any more trouble."

The moment she stepped out of the office, her smile twisted into something ugly.

Ethan stood before the floor-to-ceiling windows, gazing at the city skyline. Memories flooded back—the first time he'd seen Sophia.

He'd just dealt with a traitor, returning to the Roscente mansion reeking of blood. The grand hall buzzed with虚伪 laughter. There she stood beside Emily Laurent, a rose with thorns.

At twenty, she'd been radiant, peach-blossom eyes shimmering with life. Though visibly厌倦 by the hollow pleasantries, she'd played the obedient girl perfectly.

One moment sweetly addressing elders, the next rolling her eyes when they turned away.

That duality had ignited something primal in him.

From that instant, he'd wanted to pluck this rose and trap it in his palm.

"Zachary." Ethan pressed the intercom. "Keep close watch on Isabella. If she steps out of line—"

"Understood." Zachary needed no further explanation.

Meanwhile, violent crashes echoed from Isabella's limousine.

"That bitch!" She smashed objects wildly, face contorted. "He actually loves that whore!"

A down pillow lay in shreds, feathers swirling as she slashed it with a dagger.

Exhausted, she collapsed amidst the wreckage, panting. She had to delay the wedding—or all her secrets would—

Suddenly, her eyes locked onto an ambulance speeding past. A grotesque smile spread across her face.

"Stop the car!" she shrieked.
###Chapter 413

The driver's hands trembled on the steering wheel. In the rearview mirror, Isabella Valentine's bloodshot eyes sent chills down his spine.

"Pull over." Her voice was ice-cold.

The moment he hit the brakes, the car door flew open. Isabella yanked him from the driver's seat like an enraged lioness.

"Miss!" A bodyguard rushed to intervene.

She ignored him. The sports car roared like a beast as she slammed the accelerator. The speedometer needle jerked violently to the right. The scenery outside blurred into streaks of color.

"Sophia..." She bit her lower lip until blood filled her mouth. "I'll make you wish you were dead."

Meanwhile, in Ethan Roscente's office at Roscente Group headquarters...

Zachary Evans entered just as Ethan signed a document. The fountain pen left sharp, angular strokes on the paper.

"Did you find anything?"

"Ms. Lowell was hospitalized for gastroenteritis two months ago." Zachary handed over the medical records. "At your family's hospital."

Ink suddenly blotted the document. Ethan stared at the diagnosis, his gaze turning glacial.

"Vivian said it was just a fever."

"The records clearly state acute gastroenteritis."

Ethan's knuckles rapped the desk. Each tap sounded like a ticking countdown.

"Continue."

"No evidence of drug allergies was found." Zachary flipped through the files. "All her medical reports show no adverse reactions to common medications."

Silence filled the office. Ethan suddenly remembered that morning—Sophia curled up in bed, clutching her stomach.

"A healthy woman..." His voice tightened. "Why would she fake a drug allergy?"

Zachary's eyes widened.

"Unless..." He swallowed hard. "Unless she's pregnant."

The pen snapped in Ethan's grip. Black ink dripped between his fingers onto Sophia's medical records, spreading like a grotesque flower.

"Impossible." His voice turned hoarse. "Every time I..."

A memory flashed—that rainy night. The hotel room. Sophia's pale face and tangled sheets. He'd been too drunk to remember details.

Zachary hesitated. "When she fainted last time—"

"Investigate." Ethan stood abruptly, his suit button popping off. "Bring in every doctor on duty that day."

Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, a red sports car sped toward the hospital. On Isabella's phone screen, Sophia's pregnancy test results glared back at her.
###Chapter 414

Ethan Roscente stared at the documents in his hand, his thoughts drifting far away.

His slender fingers tapped absently against the desk.

When Zachary Evans pushed open the door, this was the scene that greeted him.

"Mr. Roscente, the files you requested." Zachary placed them on the desk, unable to resist stealing another glance at his boss.

Ethan snapped back to attention, his gaze dropping to the papers.

"By the way, sir," Zachary hesitated, "Ms. Lowell went for another checkup today."

Ethan's fingers stilled.

"How is she?"

"The doctor said everything's normal." Zachary studied his boss's expression. "It's just... Ms. Lowell asked about preconception care."

Ethan's head jerked up.

"What did you tell her?"

"I said you've been busy with work." Zachary chose his words carefully. "But sir, Ms. Lowell seems eager to have a child..."

Ethan's eyes turned icy.

"Drop it."

Zachary opened his mouth, then closed it.

"Something else?" Ethan frowned.

"Ms. Valentine came by again." Zachary lowered his voice. "She said she has something important to tell you."

Ethan let out a cold laugh.

"Tell her to get lost."

Zachary nodded and turned to leave when Ethan suddenly asked:

"Has she... been happy lately?"

It took Zachary a moment to realize he meant Sophia.

"Ms. Lowell seems in good spirits, but..." He weighed his words. "She often stares at other people's children."

Ethan's fist clenched unconsciously.

"Get out."

Once the office door closed, Ethan walked to the floor-to-ceiling window.

Sunlight streamed through the glass, but couldn't dispel the shadows in his eyes.

He remembered Sophia's peaceful profile as she slept last night.

His fingers drifted to his chest.

A dull ache throbbed beneath them.

When Zachary rushed back in, his face was tense.

"Sir! Ms. Valentine is making a scene downstairs!"

Ethan's gaze sharpened.

"Security?"

"They stopped her, but she..." Zachary swallowed. "She threatened to tell Ms. Lowell something."

Ethan's expression darkened.

"Bring her up."

Five minutes later, Isabella Valentine strutted in on stiletto heels.

"Ethan, you finally agreed to see me." Her smile was triumphant.

Ethan regarded her coldly.

"Speak."

She stepped closer, lowering her voice.

"I know why you won't let Sophia get pregnant."

Danger flashed in Ethan's eyes.

"You investigated me?"

"That's irrelevant." She smirked. "What matters is what happens when Sophia learns the truth—"

"Get out." His voice was glacial.

Isabella moved closer instead.

"I can keep quiet, if you—"

"Zachary!" Ethan barked.

The door flew open as Zachary and security rushed in.

"Remove her." Ethan turned his back. "She's banned from the premises."

Isabella shrieked as they dragged her away:

"You'll regret this! Sophia will find out eventually!"

Silence reclaimed the office.

Ethan watched from the window as Isabella was forced into a car below.

His phone vibrated.

A message from Sophia:

[What would you like for dinner? I'm cooking tonight.]

Ethan stared at the screen, fingers hovering.

After a long pause, he replied:

[Anything.]

Setting the phone down, he rubbed his temples.

Zachary slipped back in quietly.

"Sir, should I handle the Isabella situation?"

Ethan shook his head.

"She's harmless."

Zachary hesitated.

"Something else?"

"Sir..." He gathered his courage. "Have you really considered letting Ms. Lowell—"

"Out." Ethan's tone was lethal.

With a sigh, Zachary left.

Once the door clicked shut, Ethan pulled a file from the depths of his drawer.

Inside was a medical report.

His eyes locked onto the "Genetic Risk Factors" section.

His grip tightened, crumpling the paper.

Outside, the sunset bled across the sky.
###Chapter 415

Zachary Evans stared at the video on his computer screen, his brow furrowed. He replayed the footage of Ethan Roscente sitting alone in his office, gazing at a photo of Sophia Lowell. The man’s usually cold profile looked uncharacteristically soft in the glow of the monitor.

"If I don’t send this, it’s a crime against nature," he muttered to himself.

His finger hovered over the send button before he finally pressed it. The video zipped into Sophia’s inbox like a digital grenade.

"Boss, your mouth is tighter than a vault," Zachary sighed, shaking his head. "Guess I’m not just your assistant—I’m your damn Cupid now."

The office clock struck six. His phone remained silent. Zachary drummed his fingers on the desk, nerves coiling in his gut.

Buzz.

He snatched up his phone—only to see a message from the informant tailing Isabella Valentine.

"What? Isabella got into a car accident?" Zachary shot to his feet, papers scattering everywhere.

He bolted for Ethan’s office and nearly collided with the man as he strode out. Ethan’s face was stormy, his phone pressed to his ear. Mr. Roscente Sr.’s frantic voice crackled through.

"Meet me at the hospital," Ethan clipped before hanging up and marching toward the elevator.

Zachary scrambled after him, muttering, "Isabella’s playing dirty—street racing right before the wedding?"

Meanwhile, in Sophia’s apartment.

Her long-dead phone blinked to life, flooding with notifications. She absently scrolled until Zachary’s video caught her eye.

Just as she reached for it, Emily Laurent’s call hijacked the screen.

"You brat! Was your phone broken for a week?" Emily’s voice blasted through the speaker, forcing Sophia to hold the phone away.

"Aunt Emily, I—"

"Listen first!" Emily crowed. "Isabella Valentine crashed her car! The wedding’s postponed! Ha!"

Sophia’s finger froze mid-air. "What?"

"The idiot was street racing and rear-ended someone. Broke her damn leg!" Emily gloated. "It’s all over the news. How’d you miss it?"

Sophia turned to the window. The sunset bled crimson across the clouds. Ethan’s words echoed in her mind: The wedding won’t happen. Her pulse spiked.

The video from Zachary still glowed on her screen—a silent bomb waiting to detonate.
###Chapter 416

"I've been too busy lately, and my phone broke. I didn't notice any of this."

Emily Laurent's laughter crackled through the phone, dripping with schadenfreude. "You should've seen the scene. Reporters swarmed the hospital like vultures. Security couldn't clear them out for two days straight. In the end, Ethan Roscente had to step in personally to handle it."

She paused, her tone growing even more gleeful. "Isabella Valentine's car accident couldn't have been better timed. The wedding's completely derailed. The entire elite circle is laughing at her now. Karma's a bitch—she's getting exactly what she deserves after how she framed you."

Sophia Lowell's fingers tightened around her phone. "What about... Ethan?"

The question died on her lips. They were nothing to each other now. Why bother asking?

"Ethan?" Emily drew out the name with deliberate amusement. "He stayed by Isabella's bedside all night until she woke up. Looked absolutely miserable. I bet he's fuming."

She clicked her tongue. "Can't blame him. All that wedding prep down the drain. Now he has to start from scratch. Anyone would be pissed."

Sophia stopped listening. The words "wedding postponed" echoed in her mind.

Isabella only injured her leg. Logically, that shouldn't affect the wedding. Knowing Isabella, that woman would crawl to the altar even with two broken legs.

Unless...

Sophia pictured Ethan's cold, sharp features.

Did he do this?

Her fingers absently swiped across her phone screen—then froze. A call had been placed. The contact name flashed, and her hand jerked in panic, hastily ending the call.

Ethan Roscente.

Damn it.

Before she could think, she'd already blocked his number.

Ethan stared at the abruptly terminated call log, his brow furrowing.

He redialed. A robotic voice informed him he'd been blocked.

He laughed darkly.

Perfect. Just perfect.

He'd been drowning in work these past days, barely sleeping four or five hours a night, cleaning up the mess from postponing the wedding. And now, after waiting for her call—this was what he got?

Zachary Evans cautiously studied his boss's expression. "Maybe Miss Lowell dialed by accident—"

"Shut up," Ethan cut him off coldly.

Zachary swallowed hard but pressed on. "She probably realized it was a mistake and blocked you immediately to avoid... unwanted follow-ups."

Before he could finish, a death glare silenced him.

Ethan set down his coffee cup with deliberate calm. "Do you know what I want to do right now?"

"What?" Zachary asked reflexively.
###Chapter 417 

Zachary Evans, the ever-meddling assistant, clamped his mouth shut with a pout.

He secretly pulled out his phone, double-checking the video message he'd sent Sophia Lowell. Three days had passed, yet the chat remained eerily silent.

Had it gotten buried under other notifications?

Refusing to accept defeat, Zachary sent a cutesy sticker her way.

The screen stayed lit, but no reply came. He heaved a dramatic sigh, his face crumpling in despair.

This was it. His favorite ship was sinking.

Two messages ignored—clearly, Miss Lowell wanted nothing to do with Ethan Roscente.

The CEO's love life was doomed.

"One more sigh and you're getting off this plane," Ethan snapped, cutting off Zachary's fourth lament.

A flight attendant glided over with a polite reminder. "Sir, we're preparing for takeoff. Please power down your electronic devices—"

Zachary reluctantly pocketed his phone, shooting Ethan a look of profound pity.

By the time the CEO returned from his month-long business trip, Sophia would probably forget his face.

Ethan frowned at the bizarre sympathy. "???"

Unbeknownst to them, Sophia hadn't ignored the message intentionally. Just as she reached to open it, her calico cat launched itself at her arm.

Thunk.

The phone arced gracefully through the air before plunging into her foot-soaking basin.

The screen flickered twice... then died.

Sophia and the calico stared at each other.

"..."

"Meow!"

Realizing its crime, the cat bolted into hiding.

Sophia fished out the dripping device, her brow furrowed.

This was the second phone to meet a watery grave.

The foot soak contained medicinal herbs from Vivian Valdemar's prenatal care package. The dark brown liquid reeked of pungent herbs, the scent now embedded in her phone.

Vivian had delivered the pregnancy-safe herbal blend yesterday. Who knew its first use would end in tragedy?

Too irritated to continue soaking her feet, Sophia cleaned up and retreated to bed early.

The ceiling became a movie screen, replaying every moment with Ethan. She yanked the covers over her head in frustration.

Whether his wedding got postponed or not—it didn't concern her.

With 110 miles between them, plus Isabella Valentine and that sweet-faced girl keeping him company, time would erase everything.

Her focus now? Work steadily, save for the baby. Once her child arrived, it would be a fresh start.

Everything in New York would fade into distant memory.
###Chapter 418

Sophia Lowell's life moved with clockwork precision. She woke at seven each morning, left by eight, and stood before her lectern by nine. Returning to her apartment at six, dinner was always served at seven. This regimented routine brought her an unfamiliar sense of peace.

Thirty pages had flipped from the calendar. The gentle curve of her abdomen had begun to show beneath her clothes, like a small moon hiding in fabric. During her prenatal checkup, the doctor assured her the baby was developing perfectly, though her bump was smaller than typical for this stage.

That afternoon, Sophia hung laundry on her balcony. A breeze brushed against her rounded stomach, carrying a hint of coolness. Her fingers absently traced the swell as a smile tugged at her lips.

The apartment door burst open with a bang.

"Surprise!" Jason Roscente stood in the doorway, sunglasses dangling from his fingers. His grin froze when his gaze landed on Sophia's midsection.

Her fingers clenched the fabric of her shirt. She hadn't imagined her secret being exposed this way—least of all by Jason.

For a month, Ethan Roscente had vanished. No calls. No texts. No sudden appearances. Their tangled past might as well have been a dream, leaving only a faint ache upon waking.

"You...gained weight?" Jason tilted his head, circling her like she was some exotic creature. "Seattle's food must be amazing. Though you've got this artistic weight distribution—all concentrated in one spot."

Sophia exhaled. The clueless playboy hadn't even considered the obvious.

"Sophia!" Vivian Ashcroft charged in with a crate of coconut water. "The prenatal hydration haul is—" Her voice died when she spotted Jason.

The air turned to ice.

"Prenatal?!" Jason's voice jumped an octave, eyes widening. "You're pregnant?!"

Vivian lunged to clamp a hand over his mouth. "Shut your trap!"

Too late. Jason wrenched free, jabbing a finger at Sophia's stomach. "That's my uncle's baby, isn't it?!"

Sophia glared at her fitted tee—the convenient choice that had betrayed her. She instinctively cradled her belly, as if shielding the life within from the chaos.

Jason's expression cycled through shock, glee, then concern. He yanked out his phone. "I'm calling Uncle Ethan—"

"No!" Sophia and Vivian shouted in unison.

Sunlight streamed through the windows, casting tangled shadows across the trio. Sophia knew it then—the carefully constructed peace she'd guarded had shattered beyond repair.
###Chapter 419

Jason Roscente stood frozen at the base of the apartment complex, as if struck by lightning.

His gaze locked onto Sophia Lowell's slightly rounded abdomen, pupils contracting violently.

"You—" His voice trembled as his finger jerked toward her stomach.

Sophia's face paled. Instinctively shielding her belly, she grabbed Jason's arm with icy fingers.

"Upstairs. Now." Her whisper was sharp.

Vivian Ashcroft came barreling from the parcel lockers and kicked Jason square in the shin.

"What the hell are you doing here?" she hissed through clenched teeth.

Jason grimaced in pain but kept staring at Sophia's stomach.

"I looked for you all day." His puppy-dog eyes turned to Vivian. "You ignored my calls and texts..."

He'd planned to surprise her on set, only to find she wasn't there. Remembering Sophia was Vivian's closest friend, he'd come straight here.

Never expecting to stumble upon this secret.

Jason's mind reeled.

Sophia was pregnant.

Whose child was it?

The answer was obvious.

He stole another glance at her abdomen before quickly looking away.

Does Uncle Ethan know?

He couldn't.

Otherwise, why would he let Sophia return to Seattle alone while he calmly went on a business trip?

"Keep staring and I'll gouge your eyes out!" Vivian snarled.

Jason ducked his head and obediently scrambled to gather the scattered packages.

The living room air hung thick with tension.

Sophia handed Jason a glass of water, her fingers shaking slightly.

Vivian sauntered over with coconut water, her demeanor suddenly sugary sweet.

"Jason darling~" She pressed the bottle to his lips. "Try this?"

Jason stiffened.

When had this woman ever been nice to him?

Half his body went numb.

He sat ramrod straight, Adam's apple bobbing.

"You two..." He swallowed hard. "Don't want me telling Uncle Ethan?"

Vivian's smile vanished.

She locked him in a chokehold with terrifying strength.

"Smart boy." Her laugh was cold. "So—will you talk, or stay quiet?"

Jason's face turned crimson as he frantically slapped at her arm.

"L-let go..." he wheezed.

Sophia rushed forward. "Vivian, don't kill him!"

Vivian loosened her grip slightly but maintained her hold.

"Last chance." She narrowed her eyes. "What's your choice?"
###Chapter 420

Jason Roscente's eyes rolled back as Vivian Ashcroft's chokehold tightened. His Adam's apple bobbed violently before he coughed out, wrenching her slender but surprisingly strong wrist aside.

"Trying to kill me, woman?" He gasped, his dress shirt collar twisted askew.

The fruit knife in Vivian's hand glinted coldly under the light, its tip pressing against his carotid artery. "One word about this, and I'll make today your death anniversary."

Jason arched an eyebrow, his throat moving against the blade. "Funny. Most women would announce a Roscente heir to the world. Yet here you are, hiding it?"

"This child was an accident." Sophia Lowell's fingers absently brushed her abdomen, her eyes clouding. "Ethan Roscente made it clear he'd never let me bear his child."

"Bullshit!" Jason jerked upright, the blade nicking his skin red. "If Uncle Ethan knew—"

"Knew what?" Vivian sneered, tapping the flat of the knife against his cheek. "Would he drag her to an operating table like last time?"

The air turned glacial. Jason's mouth opened, then shut, remembering Ethan's ruthless methods.

"So," Vivian yanked his ear, "either shut up, or I'll shut you up permanently."

Jason winced, eyeing the apple split in two on the coffee table. "Fine. But I want something in return."

"Bargaining now?" Vivian raised the knife toward the table.

"Wait!" He caught her wrist. "I'm risking my neck here. At least reply to my messages from now on."

Vivian glanced away. "I'm...busy."

"Liar! Last month, you left twenty-seven of my thirty-six texts on read!"

After Sophia mediated, Vivian reluctantly agreed. Once Jason left, Sophia stared at the darkening sky outside. "I'm leaving."

"Where?" Vivian spun around, sending cherries scattering.

Sophia traced the snow-capped mountain on her phone wallpaper. "Somewhere far away."
###Chapter 421

Sophia crooked her finger at Vivian.

Vivian immediately leaned in closer.

There were construction issues at the Luming project that required both Sophia and Theodore Orlando to inspect the site. Just as they entered, they unexpectedly ran into Sebastian Valdemar.

"Professor Valdemar?" Sophia's eyes widened in surprise.

Sebastian stood amidst steel beams and concrete in his crisp white shirt, looking utterly out of place. He adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses, the lenses glinting in the sunlight.

"Father accompanied Vivian to Lingyin Temple," he explained. "I'm here to oversee things in his stead."

Sophia suddenly remembered that Vivian Valdemar had been struggling with insomnia during her third trimester. Her mother, a devout Buddhist, had taken her to the temple for peace. But Theodore had gone with them too—he hadn't mentioned a word about it during their call last night.

"How have you been?" Sebastian's gaze lingered on her.

"Quite well," Sophia smiled. "Professor Orlando and his wife visit often, and Vivian keeps in touch too."

Since returning to Seattle, the Valdemars had treated her like family. Mrs. Orlando frequently brought homemade dishes, while the professor sent nourishing supplements, filling the void in her heart.

Sebastian's eyes dropped to her flat stomach. "You shouldn't overexert yourself during pregnancy."

Sophia wore a loose sun-protective jacket and wide-leg pants for mobility. At a glance, no one would guess she was four months along.

"How were your last prenatal results?" He recalled recommending the doctor himself.

"Everything's normal," Sophia instinctively cradled her abdomen. "Just some appetite issues."

After exchanging pleasantries, silence settled between them. Fortunately, the site supervisor arrived just then, breaking the awkwardness.

The inspection revealed more severe problems than anticipated. Sophia frowned at the blueprint. "This load-bearing column can't be altered—it'll compromise the entire structure."

She made an immediate decision. "I'll stay to supervise the construction. We'll address any issues as they arise."

Under the scorching sun, heat waves rippled across the site. Sophia stood beneath a makeshift canopy, discussing solutions with the workers. Sweat trickled down her cheeks, her back already drenched.

The initially skeptical crew gradually grew respectful. This seemingly delicate woman far surpassed those theoretical experts who only knew how to talk.

Sebastian watched from a distance, his gaze unconsciously following her. Bathed in sunlight, Sophia seemed to glow as she worked.

"Is there something on my face?" She suddenly turned, meeting his stare.
###Chapter 422

Sophia had just finished discussing construction details with the foreman when she turned and met Sebastian's intense gaze. His eyes burned through her, making her skin prickle.

"Something on my face?"

"Yes."

She instinctively touched her cheek.

"What is it?"

"Adorable."

Sophia nearly choked on her water. She screwed the cap back on and glared. "Nice joke, Mr. Valdemar."

Sebastian rubbed his nose, his ears turning pink. "Terrible, I know."

The sun baked the concrete, heat waves distorting the air. He studied her sun-flushed face. "Didn't expect you to endure conditions like this."

"That doesn't sound like praise." She narrowed her eyes.

"It wasn't."

He remembered her in that five-figure gown at the gala. Now she stood in a dusty construction site debating concrete ratios with workers.

"Lunch time."

A line already formed at the food trucks. Workers squatted in shaded corners, devouring $2 boxed meals.

Sebastian spread his suit jacket over the steps. "Sit here."

Greasy stir-fried greens glistened in Sophia's box. She poked at them before setting her chopsticks down. Sebastian barely touched his food either.

"Has Ethan contacted you?"

Sophia swirled her water bottle, light fracturing through the liquid. "Took you long enough to ask."

She'd noticed his restrained curiosity all morning.

"Are you done with him?"

"Probably." She watched a crane's shadow stretch across the site. "If he stays away."

Sebastian said abruptly, "He postponed the wedding."

"And?" Sophia laughed lightly. "You think that means he cares?"

Cicadas screamed suddenly.

Sebastian studied her profile. "At least it shows hesitation."

"Hesitating whether to keep torturing me?" She stood, dusting off her pants. "That kind of care I can live without."

Her shadow contracted under the noon sun, coiled tight like a wary cat.
###Chapter 423

Sophia's fingers paused mid-air as she lifted her gaze to meet Sebastian's. "You think he postponed because of me?"

"Most likely." Sebastian handed her the insulated tumbler.

This thought had crossed Sophia's mind occasionally over the past month.

But she always dismissed it as ridiculous.

If Ethan truly cared, he wouldn't have repeatedly sided with Isabella.

Life had continued its predictable rhythm for Sophia—designing blueprints, inspecting construction sites, attending industry seminars. Only in the silent hours of night did memories of that man resurface.

She sometimes searched for news about Ethan Roscente online.

But all traces had been scrubbed clean. His current whereabouts, his relationship status with Isabella—everything remained a mystery.

On sleepless nights, she still remembered the crushing intensity of his embrace.

A decade of emotions couldn't be severed overnight.

Perhaps it would take a year. Three years. Maybe longer...

Until one day, she could face him with perfect composure.

"Does this arrangement work for you?"

Sebastian's voice pulled her back to reality. Sophia blinked. "What?"

"I said we should go to a proper restaurant." He pointed at her barely touched takeout box. "You're eating for two now. This isn't enough."

"Too far." She shook her head. "The nearest decent place is three kilometers away."

Round trip would take at least half an hour.

"Then order delivery." Sebastian pulled out his phone. "I'll pay extra for express service."

"Don't." Sophia placed a hand over his. "The workers will feel uncomfortable. Just two more weeks."

"You can endure it, but what about the baby?" His brow furrowed. "With this heat and your low blood sugar—"

As he started dialing, Sophia intervened. "How about this—I'll bring homemade meals tomorrow. Nutritious and discreet."

"I'll handle it." His tone brooked no argument. "Letting a pregnant woman cook? What kind of man would that make me?"

Sophia chuckled. "Since when are we so formal?"

"It's a matter of principle." Sebastian straightened with mock seriousness. "If my mother heard I let you near a stove, she'd break my legs."

To Sophia's surprise, Sebastian arrived the next day with an elaborate bento box, fresh fruit, and even portable furniture—a folding table with chairs, a sun umbrella, cooling packs and a mini fan.

For the remaining two weeks, his meticulous care made the grueling site visits almost pleasant.

The construction crew noticed. On their final day, a young worker approached. "Ms. Lowell, is Mr. Valdemar your boyfriend?"

"No." Sophia rolled up her blueprints. "We're just friends."
###Chapter 424

The construction worker grinned. "Mr. Valdemar definitely has feelings for you. That look in his eyes doesn’t lie."

Sophia’s fingers twitched.

She wasn’t oblivious. Ever since the incident at the Hong Kong police station, Sebastian’s behavior had crossed the line of ordinary friendship. Their later encounters at the construction site carried an unmistakable air of intention.

She had just been avoiding it.

The scandal exploded without warning.

The hashtag #GentleProfessorVsCharmingDesigner trended with a red "Boom" label, and the comments section was in chaos.

It all stemmed from a recent project interview. In a candid shot taken during their lunch break, Sebastian was captured bending down to hand her a tissue, sunlight glinting softly off his glasses. The afternoon work footage was even more suggestive—he stood persistently by her side, even their fingertips brushing as he passed her blueprints, all captured in slow motion.

The most damning clip was from after work. Sebastian shielding her head as she stepped into the car had been dissected frame by frame, with netizens concluding he "must have practiced that move a hundred times."

"Sophia and Mr. Valdemar go everywhere together!" A coworker with the username "SteelStraightGuy" topped the comments with photographic evidence—their backs turned as they ate takeout at the site yesterday.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Sebastian appeared: "I’m at the construction site’s back gate."

Beneath the shade of a tree, the man stood with his white sleeves rolled to his elbows. He removed his glasses as she approached. "I’ve already contacted the reporters," he said, polishing the lenses with his usual grace. "But I thought I should explain this to you in person first."

In the distance, the whistles and cheers of their coworkers erupted.
###Chapter 425

Sebastian Valdemar turned his head, his gaze settling on Sophia Lowell. "No need to apologize. This has nothing to do with you."

He secretly wished the rumors would spread.

Sophia lowered her head, scrolling through her contacts for Vivian Ashcroft. "I'll call Vivian and ask how to remove the trending topic. This kind of publicity could affect your chances of finding a girlfriend."

"Then why don't you be my girlfriend?"

Sebastian's voice was soft, drowned out by the roar of construction machinery. Sophia looked up, puzzled. "What did you say?"

He forced a bitter smile. "Don't bother. The hype will die down soon."

"Are you sure?" Sophia frowned. "You're a well-known professor. Your reputation matters. Unlike me—I'm used to these scandals."

She insisted on dialing Vivian's number.

Sebastian hesitated, swallowing his words. He wanted nothing more than to be tangled in these rumors—maybe one day, they could turn real.

Just as the trending topic was taken down, Sebastian's phone rang. It was Arthur Ellison, the dean.

"Professor Valdemar, are you still in Seattle? Come back immediately. There's trouble."

Sebastian's chest tightened. "What happened?"

"A female student staged a public confession for you at the campus gates. It's causing an uproar. Combined with your recent scandal, if this escalates, the education board will get involved."

"How is that possible?" Sebastian's brows furrowed.

"I don't understand it either. The moment you trended, this happened. The girl brought a megaphone, making it seem like you led her on and abandoned her. Teacher-student relationships are already sensitive, and on top of that—"

Sebastian glanced back at Sophia sitting on the steps and suddenly understood. "What's the student's name?"

"Tiffany Roscente. Your first-year grad student. The Roscente heiress." The dean sighed. "Rumors about her crush on you have been circulating. Now it's blown up. We can't afford to offend the Roscentes. Handle this quickly."

Sebastian withdrew his gaze, staring into the distance. "Understood."

As he was about to hang up, he added, "Dean, I want to switch students."

"You mean—"

"Transfer Tiffany Roscente to Professor Mackillop. I can't supervise her."

The dean paused. "Fine."

After ending the call, Sebastian kicked a pebble at his feet.

This was undoubtedly Ethan Roscente's doing. Seeing Sebastian and Sophia in the headlines had made him act.
###Chapter 426

"Junior sister."

Sophia was engrossed in scrolling through social media. The trending topic had just been removed, and public attention was clearly waning. Sebastian's voice suddenly sounded beside her.

He leaned in, his long fingers lightly tapping the table. "There's an urgent matter at the university. I need to go back and handle it."

She immediately set down her phone and stood up. "Is it serious? Do you need help?"

"Just a minor issue." Sebastian smiled, reaching out to adjust her crooked sun hat. "Don't believe anything you see online."

His fingertips accidentally brushed against her hair, carrying a familiar warmth.

"Don't push yourself while I'm gone." He paused. "You're not alone anymore. If anything comes up, contact the site supervisor."

With that, he turned and left, his figure soon disappearing into the dust kicked up at the construction site.

Sophia watched him go, an inexplicable unease rising in her chest. Something told her this wasn't as simple as it seemed.

Three days later, Theodore returned from Lingyin Temple. Sophia accompanied him to inspect the final two construction sites, confirming all six main beams had been successfully poured.

"Finally finished." The moment they got home, Sebastian's call came through.

"Mm, we can finally catch our breath," Sophia replied while refilling Calico's food bowl.

"Good timing with finals week. Even someone as tough as you couldn't keep up this pace indefinitely."

"Exactly." She chuckled. "With students busy studying, I can steal some downtime."

Before hanging up, Sebastian suddenly said, "When we're back in Seattle for break, let me treat you to dinner as an apology."

"So formal?" Sophia teased Calico's ears. "You took care of me plenty those two weeks."

A low laugh came through the phone. "Then it's settled."

Her fingers tightened slightly around the device. This time, certain things needed to be made clear.

Meanwhile, at New York Airport.

Ethan had just settled into his car when his phone began vibrating incessantly. Seeing the caller ID, his brow furrowed.

"Dr. Xavier." He answered.

An energetic roar immediately came through. "You brat! Eighteen messages and not a single reply!"

Ethan massaged his temple. Ever since he left the medical field, his mentor had never given him an easy time.

"Just landed." He gave a brief explanation while opening the unread messages, then froze. "You're back in Seattle?"

In the passenger seat, Zachary discreetly perked up his ears. The only person in the world who could command such respect from Mr. Roscente was Dr. Xavier.
###Chapter 427

Ethan Roscente's phone buzzed incessantly the moment he stepped off the plane.

"Hey, old man." He answered lazily.

"You brat!" Dr. Xavier Heilbronn's booming voice crackled through the receiver. "I'm back in the country! And only for that special case—certainly not to breathe in this smog!"

Ethan chuckled. "Where are you now?"

"Seattle General!" Xavier huffed. "I'm flying to Africa tomorrow. I must meet that little girlfriend of yours tonight!"

Ethan paused mid-step. "This urgent?"

"Obviously!" Xavier's volume spiked. "I've waited two years! If I don't see her today, consider our master-disciple relationship over!"

The line went dead.

Rubbing his temples, Ethan turned to his assistant. "Change my flight to Seattle."

Zachary hesitated. "But the board meeting this afternoon—"

"Postpone it." Ethan strode toward the departure gate without looking back.

Three hours later, Seattle Central Station.

Ethan's phone rang again as he boarded the car.

"Moving at a snail's pace?" Xavier's voice pierced his eardrum. "Where are you?"

"Just got off the train." Ethan checked his watch. "Half an hour to the hospital."

"And the girl?" Xavier pressed eagerly.

The image of that stubborn face flashed in Ethan's mind, his lips quirking. "She's... a bit hard to persuade."

"I don't care!" Xavier turned petulant. "If I don't meet her today, I'll tell her about your childhood bedwetting incidents!"

Ethan's expression darkened. "You wouldn't dare."

"Try me!" Xavier crowed victoriously. "Oh, and bring flowers. Girls love that."

Another abrupt disconnect.

Ethan stared at his phone, thoughts drifting to the woman currently entangled in Sebastian Valdemar's overseas scandal. His gaze turned stormy.

"Stop by a florist," he instructed the driver.

Thirty minutes later, Seattle General's VIP suite.

Xavier lounged with a newspaper when the door burst open.

"Where is she?" He craned his neck toward the empty space behind Ethan.

Hand in pocket, Ethan waved his phone. "On her way."

"You'd better not be lying." Xavier eyed him suspiciously.

Ethan smirked. "Weren't you just threatening to disown me?"

"Hmph!" Xavier tossed the newspaper aside. "If this is a trick, I'll take that Valdemar boy as my apprentice tomorrow!"

A glacial glint entered Ethan's eyes. "Go ahead. Try it."

His phone rang. Seeing the caller ID, Ethan's mouth curved. "She's here."

He turned to open the door while Xavier hastily straightened his lab coat, fidgeting like a nervous schoolboy meeting his crush's parents.

The door swung open.

Ethan's face darkened at the empty hallway.

A cool female voice floated from the phone. "Mr. Roscente? You needed me? I'm on set."

Xavier leaned in and exploded. "You didn't bring her?!"

Ethan's grip tightened on the phone, his tone deceptively gentle. "You have thirty minutes to get to Seattle General. Or else—"

"Or else what?" The woman shot back defiantly.

Ethan's chuckle sent chills down the spine. "Or else I'll tell the press why Mrs. Roscente spent last night away from home."

Dead silence.

Xavier's eyes lit up, ears practically perking.

Three seconds later, through gritted teeth:
"...I'm on my way."
###Chapter 428

The call ended abruptly. Ethan's fingers tightened around his phone.

The device creaked under the pressure in his palm.

He stared at the darkened screen, his eyes stormy.

"Hung up on me again," he muttered under his breath.

His long fingers scrolled through his contacts until he found that familiar number.

Beep—

The robotic tone confirmed he'd been blocked. Again.

Ethan hurled his phone onto the leather couch with a dull thud.

He loosened his tie, the fire in his chest burning hotter.

"Sophia, you're something else."

Meanwhile, Sophia lay sprawled on her apartment couch.

Her calico cat purred contentedly in her lap.

She stared blankly at the ceiling, fingers absently stroking the cat's fur.

Ding—

A notification snapped her out of her daze.

An unknown number flashed on her screen: [Come down.]

Two simple words that froze her blood.

Her fingers trembled uncontrollably.

She stumbled to the window and yanked open the curtains.

Below, a familiar black Maybach sat silently.

The car window rolled down.

A cigarette glowed crimson between Ethan's fingers, stark against the night.

Sophia's breath hitched.

He looked up, his gaze locking onto her window with terrifying precision.

Her phone vibrated again.

[Three minutes.]

The cold countdown sent chills down her spine.

Sophia bit her lip and bolted for the elevator.

The night wind slapped her with icy fingers.

Only then did she realize she was still in thin pajamas.

Ethan stood beside his car, his tailored suit blending into the darkness.

He watched her frantic approach, his lips curling into a mocking smirk.

"Finally decided to show up?"

Sophia clenched the hem of her shirt, nails digging into her palms.

"What do you want?"

Ethan's expression darkened instantly.

He strode forward and seized her wrist.

"Is that how you greet me?"

Sophia staggered from the force.

A sharp twinge shot through her abdomen.

Her face paled.

"Let go!"

Ethan noticed her discomfort, his gaze dropping to her slightly rounded stomach.

His pupils constricted.

"You're—"

Sophia wrenched free and stepped back.

"If you're done, I'm going back up."

She turned to leave, but a strong hand yanked her back.

Ethan pinned her against the car, his voice rough.

"Explain."

Under the streetlight, his eyes were terrifying.

Sophia averted her gaze, her heart pounding.

"Nothing to explain."

Ethan gripped her chin, forcing her to look at him.

"My child?"

The words stabbed through her.

She laughed bitterly.

"Don't flatter yourself, Mr. Roscente."

His gaze turned glacial.

"Fine."

He released her and pulled a check from his pocket.

"Whoever's it is, get rid of it."

The check fluttered to the ground.

Sophia stared at it, shaking.

"Get lost."

She fled into the building, tears blurring her vision.

Ethan stood motionless, his fists clenched so tight his knuckles cracked.

His driver hesitantly asked, "Should we follow her, sir?"

"Don't."

He bent down, picked up the check, and methodically tore it to pieces.

The night wind carried the shreds away into the darkness.
###Chapter 429

Sunlight slanted across the car window, casting blinding reflections. Ethan Roscente's slender fingers gripped the steering wheel, knuckles whitening.

The rearview mirror reflected a hesitant figure approaching.

Sophia Lowell wore faded jeans, her disheveled hair clinging to flushed cheeks. Each step seemed painful, as if she might turn and flee at any moment.

Ethan smirked coldly and pushed the car door open.

The sharp click of dress shoes made Sophia freeze. She instinctively retreated half a step, fingers twisting her shirt hem.

"To what do I owe this rare visit, Mr. Roscente?" Her forced smile trembled as badly as her voice.

Ethan narrowed his eyes, his gaze slicing over her. Barely a month apart, yet she looked transformed—healthy color in her cheeks, even her perpetually evasive eyes now shone brilliantly.

"Seems you're thriving without me." His icy tone contrasted with the cigarette butt crushed between his fingers.

Cold sweat dampened Sophia's back. She knew that expression too well—it always preceded someone's misfortune.

"Thanks to your generosity." She forced a laugh, edging backward. "If there's nothing else—"

"Stay." Ethan closed the distance abruptly, his scent of tobacco and bergamot overwhelming. "When do you plan to repay your debt?"

Her breath hitched. That astronomical sum weighed like a boulder.

"Next month..." Her voice faded. "I swear—"

"Next month?" He sneered, suddenly gripping her chin. "I heard you've grown close to Sebastian Valdemar."

Sophia's pupils contracted. Now she understood—this wasn't about money, but interrogation.

"You had me followed?" Fury made her shake.

Ethan's eyes darkened as his thumb roughly grazed her lip. "You overestimate your importance."

The words doused her like ice water. She laughed, eyes reddening. "Right. An ant like me isn't worth your attention."

She slapped his hand away. "The money will be repaid. Now leave."

Ethan's expression turned thunderous. He seized her wrist with bone-crushing force. "Who permitted that tone?"

"Let go!" Sophia struggled wildly, then stilled when she saw his eyes.

Storm clouds churned in those dark depths.

"Sophia." His voice turned gravelly. "You think aligning with the Valdemars frees you?"

Distant footsteps approached. Before she could react, Ethan yanked her against his chest. His breath scorched her ear: "The game has just begun."

The black sedan vanished in a cloud of dust, leaving Sophia alone with a lurid bruise circling her wrist.
###Chapter 430

Ethan Roscente bristled at Sophia Lowell's condescending gaze.

"Care to explain?" She smirked.

He closed the distance, trapping her against the wall. His fingers tilted her chin, lingering on her soft skin. The faint floral scent clinging to her made his pupils dilate. Without warning, he seized her waist.

"Let go!" Sophia's voice trembled.

His mouth crashed down before she finished speaking. The punishing kiss ravaged her lips, his masculine presence overwhelming her senses. She gasped for air, clawing at his chest.

Ethan twisted her arms behind her back. His lips ghosted over hers now, teasing like a predator toying with prey.

She contemplated biting him.

He withdrew first, thumb brushing her swollen mouth. "Two months are up. You belong to me now."

"Disgusting!" She scrubbed her lips violently.

"The contract's legally binding." He caught her raised wrist effortlessly. "Still want to fight?"

Sophia's chest heaved, eyes glistening with unshed tears.

This man was her personal curse.

Noticing her shaking, Ethan moderated his tone. "Behave, and I won't make this difficult."

"In your dreams."

"Got a better option?"

If looks could kill, he'd be riddled with holes.

Checking his watch, Ethan frowned. "We're meeting someone."

"No!" She spun toward the exit.

He scooped her up bridal-style.

"Put me down!" She thrashed wildly.

"Keep struggling," he warned coldly, "and the baby gets hurt."

Sophia froze mid-kick. "You bastard."

Depositing her in the car, he noted her wrinkled sleepwear with distaste. "Change those rags."

"Touch me and I'll jump out." She clutched her collar defensively.

Ethan yanked his tie loose. "We're seeing my mentor. You'll embarrass me dressed like this."

"What do I care about your teacher?"

"Enough." The engine roared to life. "Don't embarrass me there."
###Chapter 431 

The car glided through the night, neon lights flickering across the windows like liquid color.

"You'll understand when we arrive." Ethan Roscente's voice brooked no argument.

Sophia Lowell turned away, refusing to indulge this lunatic.

"Change your clothes." He loosened his cufflinks. "I won't touch you."

"You want me to change?" She let out a bitter laugh. "With what spare outfit?"

Ethan paused, his tie hanging askew. The oversight made him look utterly ridiculous.

As they passed a shopping center, he signaled the driver to stop.

"Don't even think of running." He leaned in, breath hot against her ear. "I'd tear this city apart to find you."

Sophia clenched her fists, nails biting into her palms.

Watching him head toward the stores, she suddenly called out, "Get the dress one size larger."

The extra room would better conceal her pregnancy.

Ethan braced an arm against the car roof, scanning her frame. "You're skin and bones. Why would you need a bigger size?"

"I've gained weight recently." She kept her expression neutral. "My waist is thicker now."

He chuckled darkly, feigning movement toward her. "Should I measure it myself?"

"Get lost!" Sophia hurled her handbag at him.

He dodged with feline grace, slamming the door shut with an amused smirk.

Twenty minutes later, Ethan returned with shopping bags.

"Put this on." He handed her an impeccably tailored dress.

Sophia unfolded it—this season's latest design. The size was standard, but the waistline had clever detailing that hugged without constricting.

"Shoes." He passed her a box containing nude heels, elegant and understated.

She had to admit, the man had impeccable taste.

"Pull over," she told the driver. "I need to change."

"Do it here." Ethan checked his watch. "We're out of time."

Sophia tossed the items aside. "Then I'm not going."

Change in front of him? Only if she'd lost her mind.

"Afraid?" He sneered. "There's not an inch of you I haven't seen."

"Desperate much, Mr. Roscente?" Her smile was glacial. "Should I strip right now and sprint down the street? The scandal would stain your name, not mine."

Ethan's eyes narrowed to slits. "You wouldn't dare."

"Try me." Her hand closed around the door handle. "Mutually assured destruction. Let's see who blinks first."

"Grandfather has a weak heart."

"Not my problem." She held her ground. "Either stop the car, or I jump right now."

Tension crackled between them like live wires.

Then Ethan smiled. "Ten million."

Sophia's fingers twitched.
###Chapter 432

"Ten million. Accompany me to meet my mentor." Ethan Roscente's slender fingers tapped against the car window. "Play your part well."

Sophia Lowell's red lips curved as she held up two delicate fingers. "Make it thirty."

"Quite the opportunist." A mocking glint flashed in the man's eyes.

"Legitimate business, fair and square." She waved her phone. "Wire transfer or check?"

Ethan pulled out his phone. Thirty million appeared in her account instantly.

Sophia stared at the new balance, eyes crinkling like crescent moons. Miscalculation. Should've asked for fifty.

She swiftly dispersed the funds across multiple accounts. The money could clear her debts immediately, but the interest rates made her reconsider.

Her phone buzzed again.

Another ten million deposited.

Sophia's head snapped up, wary eyes locking onto the man beside her. "What's this for, Mr. Roscente?"

"Remove me from your blocklist." His voice was ice.

She rolled her eyes and tapped her screen. Ten million just for contact privileges. Typical Roscente extravagance.

"Block me again," he adjusted his cufflinks leisurely, "and I'll freeze every account you own."

Sophia gritted her teeth silently.

Rich people privileges were infuriating.

While changing, she unceremoniously kicked Ethan out of the car. Only when the black Maybach stopped before a vintage villa did she remember the crucial question.

"What role am I playing this time?"

"Girlfriend." His expression didn't flicker.

Sophia nearly choked on air. "What about Isabella Valentine?"

"She's not in Seattle."

"So I'm the understudy?" Her laugh was bitter.

Ethan gave her a dismissive glance. "Obviously."

She kicked the car door in frustration.
###Chapter 433

His palm suddenly covered the back of her hand, his long fingers slipping between hers with undeniable insistence.

"Dr. Xavier was my mentor in medical school," he said in a low voice, leaving no room for argument. "He's over seventy and flew back from his mission just to meet my girlfriend."

Sophia's breath hitched at his unexpected move.

"So he's a doctor?" She forced her tone to remain steady.

"A Doctors Without Borders physician. He's saved thousands in war zones."

Her heart clenched. A man his age still healing the wounded amid gunfire—such devotion commanded reverence.

"I'll make a good impression," she promised softly.

Ethan gave her fingertips an approving squeeze. "You've always been good at charming elders."

As the car door opened, Sophia wobbled in her heels.

His strong arm steadied her waist. Amusement flickered in his eyes. "Can't even stand properly. Want me to carry you in?"

Before she could retort, she spotted the housekeeper approaching from the villa entrance.

Instantly, she pitched her voice into a sugary tone. "I'm just not used to wearing heels~"

The corner of Ethan's mouth lifted as he pulled her closer.

Their intimate posture made the housekeeper beam. "Mr. Roscente brought his girlfriend!"

"Margaret." Ethan nodded in greeting.

A booming shout came from inside: "You brat! Did you crawl here?"

Without missing a beat, Ethan replied, "If you're in a hurry, I can book you a prime burial plot right now."

"You little—!" Dr. Xavier's beard quivered with indignation before he turned to Sophia with grandfatherly warmth. "Don't mind him, dear. This rascal's needed discipline since childhood."

Sophia stifled a laugh. The spirited old man before her bore no resemblance to the stern medical authority she'd imagined.

"Hello, Dr. Xavier. I'm Sophia Lowell." She offered a demure greeting, presenting a gift box. "A small token of my respect."

The doctor accepted it cheerfully. "Such a thoughtful girl! Unlike certain people who show up empty-handed and still call themselves my student!"

The "certain person" massaged his temples in resignation.

Sophia shot Ethan a smug blink.

Dr. Xavier suddenly frowned. "Dear, your complexion is off." His sharp gaze scanned her. "Have you been fatigued lately?"

Her pulse jumped. The old physician's eye was frighteningly acute.

"Just work stress," she demurred, ducking her head shyly. "I was so nervous about meeting you, I barely slept this week."

Dr. Xavier immediately glared at Ethan. "How are you taking care of her?"

Ethan smoothly drew Sophia against his side. "I'll be twice as attentive from now on."

"Better be!" Satisfied, the doctor tugged Sophia toward the sitting room. "Come keep an old man company."

Over her shoulder, Sophia stuck out her tongue at Ethan, earning a warning look. The warmth of their interlaced fingers still lingered—this performance was only beginning.
###Chapter 434

Dr. Xavier pulled Sophia's hand eagerly. "Come, my dear, let's play a game of chess with this old man. Pay no mind to that rascal."

The obsidian chess set Ethan had brought gleamed softly under the light, its black and white pieces warm to the touch—clearly a rare treasure.

Sophia glanced at her empty hands, cheeks flushing with embarrassment.

Dr. Xavier caressed the chessboard lovingly, his eyes crinkling with delight. "You've truly warmed this old man's heart with such a thoughtful gift, my dear."

Ethan stood nearby, a faint smile playing on his lips.

Sophia's ears turned pink. "Actually, it was Ethan who reminded me—"

"Hmph. At least he still has some conscience."

The chessboard was quickly set up. Sophia took the white pieces, moving swiftly. Though she had learned from her grandfather since childhood and had solid fundamentals, Dr. Xavier soon had her on the retreat.

"Your skill is unmatched, Professor. I concede defeat." Sophia placed down her last white piece, admiration shining in her eyes.

Dr. Xavier stroked his beard with a hearty laugh. "You little rascal, you deliberately let me take three moves. Did you think this old man wouldn't notice?"

Sophia pressed her lips together, amused. "Nothing escapes your sharp eye."

"Your playing style..." Dr. Xavier mused. "Who taught you?"

"My grandfather."

Dr. Xavier's eyes brightened. "He must have been a master. To have raised such a skilled granddaughter, he must have been a man of great wisdom."

At the mention of her grandfather, Sophia's gaze softened. "He adored me. My mother was always busy with work, so he and my grandmother raised me."

"I'd love to meet this gentleman someday."

Sophia's fingers stilled. "He... has passed."

Dr. Xavier's expression faltered. "And your grandmother?"

"Gone as well."

"Poor child..." Dr. Xavier sighed, patting her hand gently.

Sophia shook her head. "Talking about them with you makes me happy."

In the bathroom, Sophia studied her reflection in the mirror and exhaled softly.

Back in the living room, the housekeeper poured tea for Dr. Xavier and whispered, "What do you think of Miss Sophia, sir?"

Dr. Xavier rubbed a chess piece between his fingers, his eyes warm. "That boy has good taste."

"So you approve?"

"He's had a hard time all these years. It's good that he has someone who truly cares for him now."

The housekeeper nodded knowingly.

When the next game began, Sophia held nothing back. After two rounds, Dr. Xavier couldn't stop marveling at the prowess of the younger generation.

Ethan watched from the staircase landing, an unfamiliar warmth blooming in his chest.

At the dinner table, the three raised their glasses, sharing a quiet moment of joy.
###Chapter 435

Sophia stared at the lavish spread before her. Most dishes were her favorites.

She had never mentioned her food preferences to anyone.

"He sent your favorites to the kitchen on the way here," Dr. Xavier revealed with a chuckle. "Cold on the outside, warm on the inside—that boy pays special attention to those he cares about."

Those he cares about?

Her fingers trembled slightly.

The one he truly cared for was someone else.

She lowered her gaze to hide the bitterness in her eyes, feigning shyness.

"Try this."

Ethan pushed a plate of perfectly deboned fish toward her. "Who spoiled you so much that you love fish but hate picking bones?"

Dr. Xavier teased, "Isn’t this your chance to shine?"

Ethan sighed with a wry smile.

His mentor had been needling him since they arrived.

"What else would you like?" He picked up serving chopsticks, emphasizing, "Girlfriend?"

Sophia’s chest tightened as she looked at the mountain of food in her bowl.

She knew this was all an act, yet when his slender fingers meticulously removed every bone, her heart still fluttered.

"You should eat too." She glanced at him playfully, serving him stir-fried vegetables. "What would my boyfriend like?"

Ethan suddenly leaned in, his warm breath brushing her ear. "What I want... isn’t on the table."

The last word dissolved into a whisper, scorching her earlobe.

This bastard!

She slapped away his wandering hand and hissed, "Behave."

"Shy now?" His low laugh sent shivers down her spine as his fingers traced her waist.

"Ethan Roscente!" She glared, cheeks burning.

He ruffled her hair affectionately, eyes brimming with fondness. "Fine, I’ll stop."

Dr. Xavier watched their banter with delight. "Ah, youth!"

The butler chimed in, "Miss Lowell and Mr. Roscente are a match made in heaven."

"Since you’re so close," Dr. Xavier suddenly shifted tone, "why not set a wedding date? This old man longs to toast at your celebration."

Sophia’s chopsticks froze mid-air.

"Ethan may be reckless sometimes, but he’s dependable." Dr. Xavier spoke earnestly. "My only wish is for him to settle down, not wander alone forever."

Silence engulfed the dining room.
###Chapter 436 

Moonlight spilled like liquid silver across the courtyard. Sophia stood beneath the osmanthus tree, her fingernails digging unconsciously into her palms. Dr. Xavier's words—"You should marry soon"—cut through her like a blunt knife.

She'd known for weeks that Ethan Roscente was engaged to Isabella Valentine.

"Sophia? Why are you out here alone?" His deep voice came from behind.

She quickly wiped her damp lashes before turning with a practiced smile. "Just needed air."

Ethan's gaze lingered on her red-rimmed eyes. Without warning, he pulled her against his chest. Sophia stumbled into him, her nose filling with his familiar sandalwood scent.

"Dr. Xavier is insistent," he murmured against her ear. "I told him I'd marry this year."

Her body stiffened. Her heart skipped.

"Once he returns to Switzerland, it won't matter who I marry—or if I marry at all." His next words doused her like ice water.

Just another performance.

Sophia shoved away, nails biting deeper into flesh. "Your acting is impeccable, Mr. Roscente. I almost believed you."

Inside, Dr. Xavier poured tea. Seeing Ethan return alone, the old man sighed. "That girl's eyes were red as a rabbit's. Did you hurt her?"

Ethan watched tea leaves swirl in his cup, silent.

"Ethan." Dr. Xavier set down the teapot. "Isabella isn't right for you. If you care for Sophia, don't make her suffer."

Darkness flashed in Ethan's eyes. "She'll never escape me."

"Forced fruit tastes bitter." Dr. Xavier shook his head. "That child carries wounds. If you're serious, clarify your intentions."

Outside, moonlight glowed on Sophia's trembling fingers as they brushed her abdomen. Silent tears fell.

How pathetic—her heart had leapt when Ethan mentioned marriage. Even knowing his engagement, his lies still ensnared her.

"Am I worthless, Mama?" she whispered to the empty night.

Wind scattered dead leaves. No answer came.

Footsteps approached. Sophia hastily dried her cheeks. Ethan stood silhouetted in the doorway, his expression unreadable.

"Come inside. It's cold." His voice chilled her more than the night air.

She nodded, passing him—and caught the faintest trace of roses. Isabella's signature scent.

In that moment, clarity struck.

Some dreams were meant to die.
###Chapter 437 
The car glided through the night, neon lights flickering across the windows like liquid color.

Sophia Lowell sat with her arms crossed, her cold gaze fixed on the passing scenery.

"Where exactly are you taking me?" She asked for the third time.

Ethan Roscente's long fingers tapped rhythmically against the armrest. "You'll see when we get there."

"Psychopath," she muttered under her breath.

He suddenly leaned in, the faint scent of his cologne enveloping her. "Change your clothes."

"Why should I?" She recoiled slightly.

"For the gala." His eyes narrowed. "Don't worry, I won't touch you."

Sophia scoffed. "I don't even have spare clothes. How am I supposed to change?"

Ethan paused, realizing his oversight.

As the car passed a shopping mall, he signaled the driver to stop.

Before exiting, he leaned close to her ear. "Don't even think about running. You know the consequences."

Sophia clenched her fists.

"I need a dress one size larger," she said abruptly.

Ethan raised an eyebrow. "Why?"

"I've gained weight," she deadpanned. "My waist is two inches thicker now."

His hand darted toward her waist. "Let me measure it myself."

"Get off!" She slapped his hand away.

Ethan chuckled darkly before striding into the mall.

Twenty minutes later, he returned with an elegant shopping bag.

"Put this on." He handed it to her.

Inside was an exquisitely designed dress with perfectly tailored waistline.

"And these." He passed her a shoebox containing diamond-encrusted heels that glittered under the interior lights.

"Pull over. I need to change," she told the driver.

"Do it here," Ethan checked his watch. "We're out of time."

Sophia threw the items onto the seat. "Then I'm not going."

"What's there to hide?" His lips curved mockingly. "There's not an inch of you I haven't seen."

She yanked the car door open. "I'll jump out right now if you don't back off."

Ethan's expression hardened as he seized her wrist.

"Five million," he said suddenly.

Sophia froze.

"Ten," he upped the offer.

Slowly closing the door, she smiled coldly. "Twenty. Cash."

After several tense seconds, Ethan laughed. "Deal."

He pressed a button, raising a black partition between the front and back seats.

"Now. Get changed."
###Chapter 438

Sophia's chest heaved violently. "My body, my choice. No one can force me."

Ethan's eyes turned icy. "Too bad you don't have the right to refuse me. Whether it's one child or a dozen, you'll obey." His lips curled in disdain. "Spare me the feminist nonsense."

Her fingers trembled.

Of course. A man like Ethan Roscente was above the law.

She smirked bitterly. "What's wrong? Can't Isabella Valentine bear your children? Or is your technique that pathetic?"

"Enough." His voice darkened. "We start trying tonight. With my virility, you'll be pregnant within three months."

"You?" Sophia scoffed. "A stray dog would do better."

Rage flashed in Ethan's eyes. He gripped her chin, knuckles whitening. "You're asking for death."

She tilted her head defiantly. "Comparing you to a dog insults the dog."

"Sophia!"

"Call me 'Your Majesty' and it still won't help!"

Red marks bloomed on her pale skin. Seeing the tears welling in her eyes, Ethan's grip loosened.

"Sorry," he muttered. "Don't cry."

The words broke the dam. Tears streamed down her face.

Ethan sighed. "Must you always oppose me?" He reached for her. "About the baby—"

"Get away!" She shoved him, wiping her cheeks furiously. "I'd never carry your child! A heartless monster like you doesn't deserve to be a father!"

"I'm doing this because—"

"Shut up!"

Footsteps interrupted the tense silence.

"What's going on?" Dr. Xavier Heilbronn hurried over, spotting Sophia's red-rimmed eyes. He glared at Ethan. "You idiot! I told you to comfort her, not make it worse!"

Patting Sophia's shoulder, he softened. "Don't worry, child. I'll handle this."

The rare kindness made her nose sting. "I'm fine."

"Fine?" Dr. Xavier huffed. "Tears wasted on this brat aren't worth it."

Sophia pressed her lips together and nodded. "I know."
###Chapter 439

"It's getting late. You should stay the night. We've prepared a guest room upstairs."

Sophia's fingers trembled slightly as she avoided Ethan Roscente's gaze. She clutched the hem of her shirt, her voice barely audible. "That's too much trouble..."

"Nonsense!" Dr. Xavier Heilbronn waved dismissively. "Margaret, show Miss Sophia to her room."

Margaret Lefèvre hurried over, and Sophia had no choice but to rise. As she passed Ethan, she quickened her pace as if fleeing some unseen danger.

The moment the door closed, Dr. Heilbronn struck Ethan's shin with his cane.

"You insolent brat! How dare you sit there after making her cry?"

Ethan's expression darkened. "I asked her to have my child. She refused."

"What exactly did you say?"

After hearing the retelling, Dr. Heilbronn's beard quivered with anger. "Using a child as leverage? How could you say such a thing?" The cane came down again with a sharp crack. "If I were Sophia, I'd pack my bags and run as far as I could!"

Ethan rubbed his numb leg, muttering under his breath, "No one asked you to be my mentor anyway..."

"Still talking back!"

Dr. Heilbronn panted with rage. Seeing his disciple's stubbornness, he sighed deeply. "A child should be the fruit of love, not a bargaining chip. Especially given your current relationship..." He glanced meaningfully upstairs. "She'll only think you're objectifying her."

"That's exactly what it is." Ethan smirked coldly. "If I weren't afraid she'd run, I'd never want a child in this lifetime."

"When you were a child—"

"Precisely because of that." Ethan cut him off abruptly, his eyes swirling with darkness. "Do you think someone like me deserves to be a father?"

Dr. Heilbronn shook his head. "Don't let the shadows of your past trap you. Look at Sophia—she grew up with her grandparents' love, yet she—"

"It's not the same." Ethan turned to the window where the moonlight was swallowed by dark clouds. "Some wounds never heal."

Downstairs, Sophia sat in the living room, lost in thought as she cradled a cup of tea.

"Dear child, are you still upset?" Dr. Heilbronn gently covered her trembling hands.

Sophia forced a weak smile. "I'm sorry you had to see that."

"That fool has no tact!" Dr. Heilbronn glared at Ethan, who stood rigid by the doorway. "Tools? How could he reduce something so sacred to—"

The teacup clinked softly. Sophia stared into the rippling liquid, her lashes casting shadows over her cheeks.

"There's no rush." Dr. Heilbronn patted her hand. "When you're certain this man is worthy of your lifetime, when you're sure he'll be a good father—then you can reconsider."
###Chapter 440
Mr. Xavier pulled Ethan aside and whispered, "Ethan has never been good with words since childhood. The fact that he married you and wants children proves how much he cares. He's just unsure about fatherhood and speaks without thinking. Don't take it to heart."

Sophia smirked inwardly.

Care? This was nothing but a transaction.

Yet the charade must continue.

She nodded obediently. "I understand."

"That's my girl." Mr. Xavier patted her shoulder approvingly before glaring at Ethan. "Take your wife upstairs already! If I see her cry again, I'll break your legs!"

Without hesitation, Ethan swept Sophia into his arms. "I'm sorry, darling. Let's talk in our room."

Sophia stiffened.

The endearment made her skin crawl.

Catching Mr. Xavier's knowing wink, she realized—the old man must have coached him again.

As Ethan reached the stairs, Mr. Xavier suddenly called out, "Wait! Sophia, be honest with me—is the boy impotent? Don't be shy! I'm a doctor. If there's an issue, I'll prescribe something immediately!"

Sophia buried her face against Ethan's shoulder, trembling slightly.

Ethan narrowed his eyes. "Your concern is unnecessary. Seven times a night, two hours each—more than adequate."

"Rubbish!" Mr. Xavier scoffed. "Then why no pregnancy?"

"I've been considerate of her youth. Otherwise, we'd have twins by now."

"Hmph. I'd better not catch you sneaking to me for Viagra!"

"Never!" Ethan glanced down at the woman in his arms. "Isn't that right, sweetheart?"

Sophia remained a silent ostrich.

With a cold snort, Ethan carried her upstairs.

The moment the door closed, Sophia collapsed onto the bed in laughter.

"Hahaha... I can't... Mr. Xavier actually thinks you're impotent..."

"So the mighty Ethan Roscente is seen as weak by his mentor?"

"Oh God, my stomach hurts..."

Tears streamed down her face, all pretense of distress gone.

Ethan loomed over the bed, his gaze darkening. "Amusing?"

"Hilarious!" Sophia wiped her eyes. "Especially when you claimed seven times—ah!"

Before she could finish, Ethan pinned her down.

He easily dragged her beneath him with one hand around her ankle.

"Sophia," he warned dangerously, "you're playing with fire."
###Chapter 441

Sophia pressed her fingertips against Ethan Roscente's chest, tilting her head to meet his darkened gaze.

"Just a joke. Can't you take it?"

"You call that a joke?" He sneered, gripping her chin between his fingers. "That was mockery."

The corners of her eyes lifted in a placating smile. "Fine, I was wrong. Happy?"

"Think an apology fixes it?" His palm slid down the curve of her waist. "Who's going to compensate me?"

Sophia abruptly caught his wandering hand.

"You—"

"Me what?" He leaned in, his breath scorching. "Well? Baby?"

The endearment burned the tips of her ears.

"Ethan!" Her voice trembled. "We're at Dr. Xavier's house—"

"So?" His fingers traced idle circles at her hip. "I want you right here—"

He broke off mid-sentence.

Ethan frowned suddenly, his palm rubbing slow circles over her abdomen.

"Sophia," he said slowly, "have you... gained weight?"

She slapped his hand away and rolled to the far edge of the bed, dragging the comforter with her.

"None of your business!" The flush spread to the roots of her hair. "Don't you know it's rude to comment on a woman's weight?"

Ethan stared at his palm, perplexed.

That texture... wasn't right.

"Come here." He reached for the blanket. "Let me check again."

"Pervert!" Sophia clung to the covers. "One more touch and I'll tell Dr. Xavier you assaulted me!"

He scoffed. "Marital intimacy isn't assault."

"Who's married to you?" She turned her back. "Go find your precious Isabella!"

Only when the shower turned on did Sophia exhale in relief.

Her fingers drifted to her stomach, worry flickering in her eyes.

Too observant...

Ethan emerged drying his hair to find her curled on the sofa.

"Explain." He nudged the sofa leg with his foot.

"Sleeping." She didn't look up.

"There's a bed."

"All yours." She burrowed deeper. "Wouldn't want you accusing me of scheming again."

A vein pulsed at Ethan's temple.

"Playing martyr?" His laugh was cold. "When Dr. Xavier sees this, he'll say I bullied you."

"Overthinking it." She rolled over. "I just don't want to share a bed."

"You're banishing me to the guest room?" He braced his hands on the sofa arms, caging her in. "Shameless."

Sophia thought: When have you ever had shame?

"Then I'll sleep here." She tightened her grip on the blanket.

Ethan studied her for a long moment before abruptly scooping her up, blanket and all.

"Ah!" Sophia gasped. "Put me down!"

"Quiet." He dumped her back onto the mattress. "If word gets out I made a woman sleep on the sofa, how would that look?"

As she opened her mouth to retort, he turned toward the wardrobe.

"You—"

"Sleep." He yanked out a spare blanket and spread it on the floor. "One more word and you're out the door."
###Chapter 442

Ethan Roscente braced one hand beside her pillow, looking down at her with a mocking curl of his lips. "Sleeping on the couch? You think that'll stop me?"

Sophia Lowell's breath hitched.

She knew it was futile, but at least it gave her some peace of mind.

The tension between them thickened, the room silent except for their breathing.

"Let's make a deal," Ethan suddenly said.

Sophia opened her eyes, wary.

He tossed a towel at her. "Dry my hair, and I promise not to touch you tonight."

"How much is your promise worth?" she scoffed.

His expression darkened. "Do you have a choice?"

Jerk.

"Calling me names in your head again?" His eyes narrowed dangerously.

She forced a smile. "Of course not. I was just considering your offer."

"Keep thinking, and my hair will air-dry on its own."

"With hair this thick? Not likely." Reluctantly, she crawled out of bed and yanked the towel from his hand. "This volume—must be great kidney function."

Ethan smirked. "Didn’t you already confirm that?"

Ugh, shameless. She bit back the retort and focused on running her fingers through his jet-black strands, surprised to find not a single split end.

The hum of the hairdryer filled the room as she absentmindedly studied his flawless hairline.

"Keep staring, and you’ll rub me bald," he teased.

Sophia paused, then leaned down to meet his gaze. "Uncle Ethan, serious question."

"Uncle?" He arched a brow.

She corrected herself instantly. "Mr. Roscente."

"Call me whatever you like." The title suddenly held an odd appeal.

Her eyes lit up. "What hair oil do you use? Any recommendations?"

Ethan gave her a knowing look. "Internal balance."

"What’s the secret?"

His gaze trailed over her. "Harmony of yin and yang."

"..." Sophia threw the towel down and stormed off.

"Where are you going?" he called after her.

"To shower!"

"For harmony?"

"Shut up!"

The bathroom door slammed shut.

Ethan chuckled.

When Sophia returned, a fortress of pillows divided the bed. "Cross this line, and you’ll lose your future heirs," she warned.

"What if you cross it?"

"Never!"

"Better remember that." He turned off the light with a cold laugh.

Rain tapped against the window. Sophia stared into the darkness, then turned.

Ethan lay motionless on his side, his breathing steady, as if already asleep.
###Chapter 443

"Spit it out."

His deep voice cut through the darkness just as she turned away.

Sophia's fingers unconsciously tightened around the bedsheet.

"Fine, I'll ask." Her voice was barely above a whisper.

"Hmm."

Ethan's response carried a lazy indifference.

"Your wedding with Isabella Valentine..." She bit her lip. "Why was it postponed?"

The air turned icy.

Ethan opened his eyes and turned to study her.

"What do you think?"

Sophia averted her gaze. "How would I know..."

"Then keep thinking." His tone was flat.

"I can't figure it out."

"Then think harder."

Her fists clenched in frustration.

This man and his riddles again.

Rumors claimed the postponement was due to stock fluctuations, but clearly, that wasn't the truth.

So what was the real reason?

Exhaustion crept in, her eyelids growing heavy.

The sound of steady breathing filled the room.

Ethan propped himself up, his long fingers lightly brushing her lashes.

"Fool," he murmured.

At dawn, Ethan escorted Dr. Xavier to the hospital.

Sophia stood at the villa's entrance, the morning breeze tangling her hair.

Watching the car disappear, a strange thought struck her—

It felt like a wife seeing her husband off to work.

She shook her head violently.

Too deep into the role.

Pulling out her phone to call a cab, a black Maybach rolled to a stop before her.

The window lowered, revealing Zachary's cheerful face.

"Miss Lowell, Mr. Roscente asked me to drive you."

Her heart skipped, then settled.

"No need, I'll just—"

"Taxis take thirty minutes here." He winked. "The fare could buy you three hotpot meals."

Her lips twitched.

He knew exactly how to press her buttons.

"Also..." Zachary gestured to the rising sun. "Any longer in this heat, and you'll turn into a little black cat."

Sophia glared but slid into the car.

As they left the gated community, she finally blurted out,

"Zachary, do you know about the wedding postponement?"

His grip on the wheel tightened.

"What do you think, Miss Lowell?"

"You and your boss share the same infuriating trait," she muttered.

Through the rearview mirror, Zachary's expression grew complicated.

"If you'd seen that video..."

"What video?" She straightened abruptly.

His head snapped toward her. "You haven't watched it?"

"What are you talking about?"

Silence thickened in the car.

Zachary's hands trembled slightly on the wheel.

Damn. He'd messed up.
###Chapter 444

Yan's eyes turned to ice.

Her fingertips trembled slightly as her nails dug deep into her palms.

"Jian Bai." She enunciated each word with lethal precision. "Dare to lay a finger on my children, and you'll regret it."

The air froze instantly.

Jian Bai's face paled as he frantically raised his hands. "Yan, you've got it all wrong!"

His Adam's apple bobbed nervously. "I'm their uncle. How could I ever hurt them?"

A cold laugh escaped Yan's lips.

She knew this act all too well.

"I just wanted you to know," Jian Bai took a shaky breath, "no matter what happens, I'll always stand behind you."

Red veins surfaced in his eyes. "All these years... I owe you so much."

Yan turned her face away.

Dappled shadows from the window danced across her profile.

"Don't you find this pathetic?" Her whisper carried the chill of winter.

Jian Bai's chest heaved violently.

Suddenly, he pulled a document from his inner suit pocket.

"These are share transfer agreements for three Lu Corporation subsidiaries." His hands shook slightly. "Consider it... compensation."

Yan narrowed her eyes.

"Finally showing your true colors?" Her mocking laugh cut through the room. "All this theater just for that blood jade?"

The papers slipped from Jian Bai's grip and hit the floor with a slap.

"That's not—" His voice cracked. "I only—"

"Enough!" Yan shot to her feet. "I'm done with the Lu family's games."

She looked down at him with icy disdain. "The moment you abandoned me, we became strangers."

Jian Bai suddenly grabbed her wrist.

"Yan!" His eyes reddened. "Give me one chance—"

She wrenched her arm free with brutal force.

"Mr. Lu," she smiled bitterly, "save the performance."

As she turned, the sound of shattering glass erupted behind her.

"I'll wait." Jian Bai's voice strained through clenched teeth. "Until the day you forgive me."

Yan paused mid-step.

"Then wait." She didn't look back. "Until the next lifetime."
###Chapter 445

Jason Roscente stood at the base of the Roscente Group skyscraper, staring up at the glass facade that disappeared into the clouds. His palms were damp with sweat.

He tightened his grip on his phone. Vivian Ashcroft's text still glowed on the screen: "Betray the organization, and I'll tell everyone about you stealing my snacks!"

The elevator doors opened and closed three times. Jason couldn't bring himself to step inside.

"Got it!" He smacked his forehead.

If he couldn't be the traitor, why not let his uncle discover the truth himself?

The door to the CEO's office flew open.

Ethan Roscente was signing documents when his fountain pen skidded across the page, leaving an ink stain.

"Uncle!" Jason rushed to the desk. "Sophia's pregnant!"

The pen clattered onto the paperwork.

Zachary Evans fumbled, dropping an armful of folders.

"What did you say?" Ethan's voice was glacial.

Jason swallowed hard. "It's... exactly what it sounds like. If you two get back together, you'll be parents soon."

He watched Ethan's expression carefully before adding, "Sophia told me herself."

Ethan's eyes darkened.

Yesterday, that woman had insisted she didn't want his child. And now...

"What else did she say?"

"Well..." Jason's eyes darted. "She said she might consider it... if you called off your engagement to Isabella."

The office air conditioning suddenly felt arctic.

Zachary retreated to a corner, pretending to be part of the furniture.

"How much?" Ethan asked abruptly.

"Huh?"

"Allowance." Ethan already had his phone in hand.

Jason's face lit up. He held up five fingers.

Three minutes later, as Jason skipped out of the office, Zachary couldn't resist asking, "Mr. Roscente, are you—"

"Get the car ready." Ethan straightened his cuffs as he stood. "We're going to Lowell Enterprises."

Zachary's eyes widened. "You're going to tell Ms. Lowell the good news in person?"

Ethan's lips curved slightly. "If she dared to send Jason as her messenger, she should have anticipated the consequences."

Meanwhile, Sophia Lowell sneezed in the middle of a board meeting.

"Strange," she murmured, rubbing her nose. "Why do I suddenly have a bad feeling about this?"
###Chapter 446

Ethan Roscente's lips curved slightly, approval flashing in his eyes.

"Good performance. Triple your bonus this month."

"Thank you, Mr. Roscente!"

"Leave more flexibility in my schedule going forward. Prioritize trips to Seattle." His slender fingers tapped the desk. "And keep a close eye on the old man."

Zachary Evans understood immediately. This was to create opportunities for frequent visits to see Miss Sophia Lowell—while evading Mr. Roscente Sr.'s surveillance.

"Understood. I'll adjust the arrangements." He hesitated. "Tonight's dinner with Peak Construction Group is unavoidable. The old man personally brokered the deal."

Ethan waved dismissively.

"Handle it as you see fit."

As Zachary turned to leave, Ethan called him back.

"Bring Bianca Savigny tonight."

Zachary caught on instantly. "You're concerned about..."

Ethan's gaze turned icy.

"If the old man suspects foul play in delaying the wedding, let him investigate."

Zachary suppressed a wince. Bianca was being thrown to the wolves.

Mr. Roscente Sr. was shrewd. Though Isabella Valentine had requested the postponement, he’d likely suspect Ethan’s involvement. With Ethan back in the country now, scrutiny was inevitable.

If the old man suspected Ethan had someone else, let him find "evidence."

As long as Sophia remained untouched.

Jason Roscente hummed a tune as he exited the Roscente building when his phone rang.

"You promised me dinner. Where are you?" Vivian Ashcroft's impatient voice crackled through.

Startled by guilt, Jason jumped.

"On my way! Almost there!"

"Ten minutes or I'm leaving."

"Wait! Traffic's terrible—" He theatrically honked twice. "Hear that? The whole street's gridlocked!"

"Spare me the act. I don't have time for games."

"Coming!"

Jason leapt into his sports car and sped off.

At the restaurant, he fidgeted. In his eagerness to secure funds, he'd forgotten to coordinate stories with his uncle.

When Vivian video-called Sophia, he nearly bent his fork in half. Seeing Sophia's calm demeanor, he exhaled in relief.

Clearly, his uncle hadn't confronted her yet.

Given how Sophia had been avoiding Ethan, she'd have been furious otherwise.

He absently stabbed his steak, stealing glances at Sophia on the screen.

Good. She clearly didn't know he'd spilled the secret.

Divine intervention! There was still time to fix this!

Excusing himself to the restroom, Jason hastily called Ethan.

"Uncle, it's me! When are you planning to talk to Sophia about the baby? Could you—"

Ethan, en route to the dinner, frowned.

"We settled this last night. Didn’t she agree to have my child before telling you?"

"What?"

Jason froze.

That phrasing... Had his uncle known longer than him?

A horrifying realization struck.

"Uncle, are you saying... you want to have a baby with Sophia? Or... there already is one?"

Ethan's expression darkened.

"Obviously the former. We decided yesterday—you think she’d be pregnant today? Magic, is it?"

Jason: "..."

Disaster.

He'd meant Sophia already had a child. His uncle thought they were planning one.
###Chapter 447

My hand trembled slightly as I gripped the phone.

Ethan Roscente's icy voice came through the line. "Get to the point."

Before I could speak, the call ended abruptly.

Jason Roscente stood on the balcony, beads of sweat forming on his forehead.

Suddenly, he grinned.

Perfect misunderstanding.

Now he was finally free.

He'd said everything he needed to. If his uncle misinterpreted it, that wasn't his fault. Even if the truth came out later, no blame could fall on him...

Humming a tune, Jason returned to the dinner table with renewed appetite.

Sophia Lowell set down her phone and stared blankly at her computer screen.

An entire day had passed without even a rough draft of her design.

Her thoughts kept circling back to one question—why had Ethan suddenly postponed the wedding?

Zachary Evans' cryptic remarks and Ethan's ambiguous attitude had planted seeds of doubt in her mind.

Her old phone was still at the repair shop. Whether they could recover that crucial video remained uncertain.

If this really involved her, why was Isabella Valentine staying so quiet?

Outside, the sky darkened.

Frustrated, Sophia ran a hand through her hair before picking up her phone again.

"Ethan," she said bluntly, "did you and Isabella postpone the wedding because—"

"He's showering." A sweet female voice interrupted her.

The sound of running water echoed through the line.

Sophia's fingers froze.

She hung up silently, her lips twisting into a self-deprecating smile.

She recognized that voice—the girl from the private room who looked as pure as jasmine.

At this hour, they were together. Ethan was showering.

The answer couldn't be clearer.

Sophia pinched her arm hard.

How pathetic that she'd still held onto hope.

Cold water streamed over her flushed face in the shower.

Meanwhile, in a hotel suite...

Bianca Savigny toyed with Ethan's phone, a sweet smile playing on her lips.

With practiced ease, she deleted the call log.

"Sophia..." She murmured the name, a shadow flickering in her eyes.

After being kicked out of Bayview Residences, she'd had this woman investigated.

All the reports painted the same picture—a gold-digger who climbed her way up using men.

Bianca's slender fingers traced the phone screen.

She would never let anyone steal her Ethan away.
###Chapter 448

Bianca Savigny's fingers trembled as she scrolled through the photos on her phone.

The screen displayed intimate pictures of Luna Fairsprene and Ethan Roscente.

She bit her lower lip until she tasted blood.

"What a cunning little fox..."

She had thought Ethan postponed his wedding with Isabella Valentine because of the car accident. But this bitch had interfered.

The tenderness in Ethan's eyes as he looked at Luna was something Bianca had never received.

Her nails dug deep into her palms.

The bathroom door suddenly opened.

Ethan stepped out in a bathrobe, water dripping from his hair.

"Who let you in?" His gaze turned icy.

Bianca quickly locked her phone and shoved it into her pocket.

"Mr. Evans asked me to deliver your clothes." She lifted an elegant paper bag with a demure smile. "The set you stained at the dinner."

Ethan glanced at the phone on the sofa.

Bianca's heart skipped a beat.

But he merely picked it up and dialed Zachary Evans.

"Where are you?" He pushed open the balcony door, his voice colder than the night wind.

Noisy toasting sounds came from Zachary's end.

"Mr. Yu won't let me leave..." He lowered his voice. "The old man might be testing you."

Ethan lit a cigarette, the ember glowing in the dark.

"Play along."

After hanging up, he turned to face Bianca's infatuated stare.

"Mr. Roscente..." She deliberately tugged her collar lower. "Shall I help you change?"

"Leave it." Ethan's cold eyes swept past her. "Get out."

Bianca paled but persisted. "I can wait until you're dressed—"

"Must I repeat myself?"

She had no choice but to set down the bag and slowly retreat.

Under the hallway lights, she pulled a pill bottle from her purse, lips curling into a smirk.

"Since you're giving me the opportunity..."

In the bathroom, Ethan studied his reflection.

His phone lit up with a message from Luna.

His gaze softened as he quickly replied before slipping it back into his pocket.

A faint noise came from outside.

Ethan's eyes sharpened. He yanked the door open—

Bianca stood frozen in shock, a pill bottle clattering to the floor.
###Chapter 449

Bianca Savigny let the last drop of clear liquid fall into the humidifier, a satisfied smirk curling her lips. This expensive aromatic oil was said to drive men wild all night.

Her fingers trailed over her freshly spa-treated skin. Beneath the silk nightgown, her body burned with anticipation. After tonight, Ethan Roscente would finally realize who truly belonged in his arms.

One successful night was all she needed—just one night to conceive the Roscente heir.

Ethan emerged from the shower, his tie hanging loosely around his neck. He checked his watch. Two hours until the gala. Settling onto the sofa, he began sorting through emails.

The AC was set low, yet heat prickled under his skin. Sophia Lowell’s face flashed in his mind—those liquid eyes gazing up at him.

"Ethan?"

A sultry voice purred in his ear. His fingers clamped around a delicate wrist, the skin beneath his touch soft and feverish.

"Say it again," he rasped.

"Ethan..." Bianca melted against him, lashes damp with faux tears. "I feel... strange."

His grip tightened on her chin, dark desire flaring in his eyes. "Tell me what you need."

Her trembling fingers loosened his tie. "Be gentle with me..."

Moonlight filtered through the sheer curtains, painting fractured shadows across the carpet.

At 3 AM, Bianca stirred awake. Every aching muscle filled her with triumph. She had claimed the man of her dreams.

In the dim glow of her phone, she snapped a photo of their entangled bodies—his face half-buried in the pillow, but unmistakable. Proof.

Her thumb hovered over Sophia’s contact. Just as she tapped send, Ethan rolled over, pinning her beneath him.

The phone clattered to the floor, forgotten. In the whirlwind that followed, she never noticed the scheduled message counting down.

Across town, Sophia adjusted her drafting lamp, blue light flickering across her focused expression. Her phone buzzed.

An unknown number. An auto-loading image.

Ethan’s profile, crystal clear.
###Chapter 450

Ethan Roscente's eyes snapped open in the presidential suite's bathtub.

Bloodshot veins spiderwebbed across his irises like a ravenous beast's.

"Mr. Roscente is awake!" Zachary Evans immediately pressed the call button.

The medical team rushed in, attaching monitors to Ethan's body.

"The sedative wore off?" Zachary clenched his fists.

The lead physician wiped his brow. "Thankfully Mr. Roscente has exceptional constitution. An ordinary man would've—"

Zachary exhaled sharply.

Water sloshed as Ethan rose from the ice bath.

"How do you feel?" Zachary offered a towel.

Ethan waved him off, droplets rolling down his chiseled torso.

"Draw a hot bath." His voice was gravelly with strain.

Ten minutes later, Ethan emerged in a robe.

"Where's Bianca?"

Zachary's lips curled. "In Hugo's room."

The elusive body double had been forced out of hiding tonight.

Ethan's knuckles bleached white, murder swirling in his gaze.

"Foolish bitch."

"If not for the Savigny family..." Zachary ground his teeth.

Ethan strode to the floor-to-ceiling windows, lighting a cigarette.

"Put her under surveillance."

"Understood." Zachary hesitated. "Sir, during the preconception period—"

Ethan froze mid-motion before crushing the cigarette.

...

At 1 AM, Sophia Lowell tossed her paintbrush aside.

Her bedside phone lit up.

"Come down."

She lunged for the window. A black Maybach lurked in the shadows below.

A second message arrived with a photo—Bianca nestled against a man's chest, her neck littered with love bites.

That achingly familiar profile—

Sophia's phone clattered to the floor.
###Chapter 451

Her fingers tightened abruptly around the doorknob.

The image on the screen made Sophia's pupils constrict. Her fingertips trembled uncontrollably.

Ethan Roscente.

The man who had sworn just last night how much he missed her was now intimately embracing another woman.

The glow of her phone screen cast a pale light across her face.

The familiar black Maybach sat parked downstairs.

She suddenly found it laughable.

Couldn't even wait to come straight from another woman's bed?

Such impeccable time management.

Sophia took a deep breath and closed the door again.

Screenshot. Save. Delete chat history.

All done in one fluid motion.

When the bedroom light went out, the atmosphere in the Maybach downstairs plummeted.

"Mr. Roscente, perhaps—" Zachary Evans barely got the words out before the light disappeared.

He awkwardly shut his mouth.

A cold laugh came from the backseat.

"Seems she doesn't want to see me."

Zachary ventured cautiously, "Did you... upset Ms. Lowell again?"

Everything had been fine this morning.

Ethan irritably loosened his tie. "I've been working all day. When would I have had time to upset her?"

Unless...

At the thought of that man with the surname Orlando, his expression darkened further.

"Take me back."

Ten minutes later.

Lights flickered on in the building across the way.

Ethan stood before the floor-to-ceiling window, glaring at the darkened apartment opposite.

The liquor swirled in his glass, reflecting his brooding expression.

This apartment had been a worthwhile purchase.

Now it served as the perfect vantage point for surveillance.

His phone screen lit up, then went dark again.

In the end, he didn't make the call.

The corner of his mouth lifted in self-mockery.

She wouldn't answer anyway.

Why humiliate himself?

Lately, everyone at Roscente Group's executive office walked on eggshells.

"Redo it!"

Documents slammed against the floor.

The secretary retreated shakily, nearly colliding with Zachary at the door.

"Another outburst?"

The secretary looked ready to cry. "All because the coffee wasn't the right temperature..."

Zachary sighed.

This wasn't about coffee.

It was about a certain someone's unrequited frustrations being taken out on the staff.
###Chapter 452

Zachary Evans stood in the center of the office, his six-foot frame hunched like a scolded Great Dane.

Ethan Roscente's tirade had lasted two full minutes.

Files slammed against the desk with sharp cracks.

Zachary stole a glance at his phone. The distress text to Sophia Lowell remained unread.

Three days now.

At this rate, he'd be requesting a transfer to the African branch.

"Mr. Roscente, the resort project permits came through." Zachary forced himself to offer the new documents. "With Mr. Roland traveling, should we proceed with the groundbreaking—"

Ethan's fingers froze mid-page.

The designer signature line glared with two characters: Sophia Lowell.

Thud.

The folder snapped shut.

"Tell her to crawl back here and take responsibility." Ethan's voice could frost glass. "Abandoning projects like some amusement park ride?"

Zachary swallowed hard. "This afternoon's schedule—"

"Figure it out." A razor-edged glare.

Zachary snapped upright. "I'll prepare the car immediately!"

Seattle University.

Sophia had just collected the last exam when her phone buzzed.

"Ms. Lowell, your presence is required for the resort groundbreaking today." Vincent Laurent's voice carried through the receiver.

"Is Roscente Group attending?" Her grip tightened on the device.

"Naturally, it's a joint venture." A chuckle. "But don't worry—Mr. Roland's away. They're sending the project team."

Sophia exhaled.

As long as he wasn't coming.

The bullet train station swarmed with travelers.

Sophia stared at the flickering "New York" on the departure board. Her pulse stuttered.

When she'd left this city, she'd sworn never to return.

As the train accelerated, the scenery blurred past the window.

Like the memories she'd fought so hard to erase.

Roscente Tower, penthouse.

On Ethan's fifth tie adjustment, Zachary finally ventured, "Sir, perhaps try the new men's skincare line?"

"Meddlesome." A glacial side-eye.

Zachary smiled placatingly. "I heard Ms. Lowell particularly appreciates well-maintained—"

"Who said I'm waiting for her?" Ethan's voice spiked. The fountain pen in his hand snapped with a crisp crack.

The office plunged into lethal silence.

Zachary retreated three paces, shoulders hunched.

Beyond the floor-to-ceiling windows, a black sedan glided into the executive parking lot.
###Chapter 453

Ethan Roscente stood before the full-length mirror, fingertips lightly tracing the corners of his eyes.

"Zachary, do I look older lately?" he asked abruptly.

Zachary Evans nearly dropped the tie pin in his hand.

"Mr. Roscente, you're in the prime of your life. How could you be old?" He forced a smile.

Ethan stared at his reflection, brow furrowed.

During last night's video conference, he'd caught Sophia Lowell secretly screenshotting him. Zooming in, that faint wrinkle on the screen had kept him awake all night.

"Buy me ten boxes of face masks," he ordered coldly.

Zachary's eyes widened. "Ten boxes?"

"Problem?"

"N-no! I'll get it done immediately!"

Meanwhile, Sophia stood in the underground garage, absently rubbing her phone case.

"Director Laurent, weren't you leading the site inspection today?" she whispered.

Vincent Laurent looked equally confused. "Mr. Roscente made a last-minute decision."

A black Maybach glided up, the window lowering to reveal Ethan's sharply defined profile.

Sophia's breath hitched.

He looked unusually... polished today? Even his hair gleamed with meticulously styled perfection.

"Get in," the man said tonelessly.

Sophia opened her mouth to refuse when Zachary cut in, "Miss Lowell, all the project documents are in Mr. Roscente's car."

Reluctantly, she slid into the backseat.

The cabin carried a faint cedarwood scent mixed with some expensive skincare product.

Ethan kept his eyes fixed on the tablet, long fingers swiping across the screen.

Sophia stole a glance and noticed the thin sheet mask beneath his eyes.

"See something interesting?" he said suddenly.

She jerked her gaze away. "N-nothing."

Ethan gave a quiet hum, peeling off the mask to reveal skin more radiant than usual.

"We're here," the driver announced.

Sophia practically bolted for the door when Ethan caught her wrist.

"Stay close to me," he murmured. "Someone's been eyeing this project."

Her pulse jumped.

So... that's why he came personally?

Before she could process it, he released her, his expression reverting to its usual icy detachment.

"Stop dawdling," he said without turning back, striding toward the construction site.

Sophia hurried after him, missing the fleeting curve of his lips.
###Chapter 454

Vincent Laurent blinked in confusion, unable to fathom what important matter Zachary Evans needed to discuss with him privately.

Only when the assistant frantically winked did realization dawn. He slapped his forehead. "Ah! I just remembered the project timeline hasn't been finalized. Sophia, why don't you ride with Mr. Roscente?"

Sophia Lowell narrowed her eyes suspiciously. This hadn't been mentioned during the meeting.

She'd bet anything they were putting on an act.

The car door slammed shut. She shuffled toward Ethan Roscente's black Maybach. As her fingers brushed the passenger door handle, a frosty voice cut through the interior: "That seat's taken."

Sophia froze.

The driver quickly explained, "Mr. Evans' reserved spot. Mr. Roscente's specific order."

Her lips twitched. Who knew the mighty Roscente Group CEO had such eccentric rules?

Visions of cliché romance novel tropes flooded her mind—reserved seats, special privileges, inseparable companions...

"Drop the ridiculous fantasies." Ethan's piercing gaze X-rayed her thoughts. "Keep daydreaming and you'll walk to the construction site."

The rear door slid open automatically. His eyes commanded her to enter.

Sophia dawdled.

Ethan didn't rush her, simply watching in silence. The atmosphere thickened until even the driver shrank into his collar.

Defeated, she reluctantly climbed into the backseat.

As their car exited the underground garage, a red sports car screeched to a halt nearby.

Isabella Valentine stepped out clutching an elaborate lunchbox, just in time to see the Maybach glide past. The familiar profile in the window made her grip the thermos until her knuckles whitened.

"Miss, wasn't that Mr. Roscente's car—" a bodyguard ventured.

"Shut your mouth!" Isabella's nails dug into her palms.

Stiletto heels clicked furiously across the lobby as she slammed her hands on the reception desk. "Where did Ethan go?"

The receptionist recoiled. "Ms. Valentine, Mr. Roscente's schedule is confiden—"

"Useless!" Isabella's tirade halted at the crisp tap of approaching heels.

Jessica Piente approached with an armful of files, smiling brightly. "Didn't Mr. Roscente tell you? He's inspecting the northern resort this afternoon." She raised her voice pointedly. "Specifically requested Ms. Lowell's company too."

Isabella's face drained of color. The thermos crashed to the floor.
###Chapter 455

Isabella Valentine's face turned deathly pale in an instant.

Jessica smirked disdainfully and strode away in her stilettos.

How dare this nameless woman put on airs in front of her?

Thud!

The thermos crashed onto the floor, splattering soup everywhere.

Isabella dug her nails deep into her palms and let out a hysterical scream. "Sophia Lowell! I hope you die a horrible death!"

The receptionist rolled her eyes discreetly.

This spoiled heiress must be out of her mind.

"Delete the surveillance footage now!" Isabella shot a venomous glare at the bodyguard before storming out of the lobby.

Inside the car, Sophia stole a glance at the man beside her.

Ethan Roscente remained engrossed in his documents, not even sparing her a glance.

Images from that night flashed through her mind, making her chest tighten. She turned away to stare out the window.

The driver peeked at the rearview mirror.

Though less than half a meter apart, an invisible wall seemed to separate them.

As the partition slowly rose, Sophia's breathing grew uneven.

In the confined space, Ethan's presence became overwhelming.

The edges of the documents crumpled under his grip.

Out of the corner of his eye, he studied Sophia's profile. The peach-toned lip gloss made her skin glow like snow.

Three days.

He'd waited until dawn for a text that never came.

Now she was right beside him, yet further away than ever.

When the car hit a speed bump, Sophia's head lightly bumped against the window.

Exhaustion weighed her down.

Back-to-back exam invigilations had drained her. Without realizing, she drifted off, her head tilting sideways.

Ethan carefully cradled her cheek.

As her warm breath brushed against his shirt, his Adam's apple bobbed. Gently, he pulled her onto his lap.

His thumb traced her cool fingertips before he pressed a kiss to her engagement ring.

"Drive slower," he murmured to the driver, wrapping his suit jacket around her.

In her sleep, Sophia instinctively nestled closer to the warmth. Her hair tickled his wrist like a whisper.
###Chapter 456

The car glided smoothly through the night. Ethan Roscente gazed down at the woman resting on his lap.

Sophia Lowell slept soundly, her long lashes casting delicate shadows beneath her eyes. She nuzzled unconsciously against his thigh, strands of hair framing her snow-pale cheeks.

He reached to brush the stray locks from her face.

Suddenly she turned, wrapping an arm around his waist. The warmth of her breath seeped through his dress shirt. Ethan's Adam's apple bobbed as his hovering hand froze midair.

Despite the car's chilled AC, she radiated heat like a furnace.

His pupils darkened, fingers curling slightly. In sleep, Sophia looked utterly defenseless—parted lips, collar slightly open to reveal delicate collarbones.

He shut his eyes briefly, forcing his gaze away.

"We've arrived, Mr. Roscente," the driver murmured.

Ethan raised a hand for silence. Outside, Zachary Evans and Vincent Laurent approached but halted upon glimpsing through the half-open window. They tactfully turned away.

Sophia stirred in his arms.

Her drowsy eyes fluttered open, meeting his smoldering gaze. Both froze in that electric moment.

"I..." Her voice carried sleep-softened sweetness.

Belatedly realizing she was sprawled across Ethan, she scrambled to sit up. Her knee accidentally grazed a sensitive area. He gritted out a groan.

Sophia went rigid.

"Had your fill?" Ethan's voice roughened as his palm anchored at the small of her back, preventing escape. "Time to pay up."

"Pay for wh—"

His scorching kiss swallowed the protest.

Sophia's eyes flew wide, hands braced against his chest. He easily captured her wrists, lifting her fully onto his lap with one arm beneath her hips.

"Let go—" The fragmented plea dissolved between them.

Ethan kissed with pent-up ferocity, as if unleashing weeks of restraint. Sophia's resistance gradually melted, her hands sliding up to clasp behind his neck.

Amid tangled breaths came the metallic click of a belt buckle.

Cool fingers slipped beneath her blouse. Sophia jolted awake, shoving him away. "Ethan Roscente!"

Desire still darkened his eyes as he chuckled at her reaction. "Problem? You seemed to enjoy it moments ago."

"You—!" Flushed with fury, she fumbled with her disheveled clothes.

Ethan leisurely adjusted his tie, gaze never leaving her. At approaching footsteps outside, he leaned close to whisper, "We'll continue tonight."
###Chapter 457

"3, 2, 1—Action!"

The clapperboard snapped shut, its sharp sound echoing across the set. The camera lens slowly focused on the sleek black cat.

The cat remained motionless.

A ruler of the underworld, reduced to performing for humans?

Its golden slit eyes narrowed as it shot a cold glance at Grace standing nearby.

Tiffany Versta, playing the supporting role, held the cat with sweaty palms.

Why did this feline radiate more presence than an A-list actor?

She just wanted to wrap up this scene and binge-watch short videos.

"Little majesty, give us something!"

Beads of sweat formed on the director's forehead. Luna had sworn this cat could act, and he'd foolishly agreed.

"Director, wait!"

Luna rummaged through her bag and pulled out half a can of fish treats, her eyes lighting up.

"Wu Cang, you can do it!"

She held a treat near the cat's mouth.

The cat turned its head away with disdain. "This king would never—"

A second treat appeared.

"..."

The irresistible aroma filled its nostrils. Against its will, the cat swallowed hard.

"Just this once." It snatched the treat and devoured it in three bites.

Luna grinned, stroking its head. "More after filming!"

The cat huffed but reluctantly obliged.

"Action!"

Tiffany cradled the cat, her eyes flashing malice. "Once we're inside, scratch that woman's face!"

The cat lazily turned its gaze toward Grace, golden pupils contracting slightly.

As the camera zoomed in, the cat leaped from Tiffany's arms and strolled gracefully across the lawn.

Luna dangled another treat, whispering, "Wu Cang, look—a butterfly!"

The cat glanced at the snack and resigned itself to the performance.

It pounced toward the flowers, rolled playfully in the grass, then sprang lightly onto a trellis.

When the butterfly fluttered away, the cat seized the moment—

Grace's pupils dilated.

Those golden eyes seemed to paralyze her. She could almost hear claws unsheathing.

"Grace!" Oliver rushed forward.

The cat's paw swiped toward Grace's face—

At the last second, razor-sharp claws retracted.

Pat.

A soft paw pad gently tapped her cheek.

Oliver collided with Grace, sending them tumbling to the ground.

Their lips met. Time froze.

The set fell silent.

Luna's eyes widened, her mouth forming a perfect "O."

So the romance novels Mom read were based on truth!
###Chapter 458 

Ethan Roscente glanced at the ominous sky.

Zachary Evans lowered his voice. "Mr. Roscente, the weather service issued a storm warning. We should wrap up the inspection soon."

Ethan's gaze swept across the leaden clouds, his brow furrowing slightly. Without acknowledging Sophia Lowell, who had just emerged from the restroom, he turned and strode deeper into the construction site.

Sophia paused at Zachary's words. Watching Ethan's retreating figure, an uneasy feeling settled in her chest.

"Let's go," she said, taking a deep breath before addressing Vincent Laurent beside her.

As they walked side by side, Vincent hesitated several times, clearly wanting to speak.

"Just say what's on your mind," Sophia prompted.

Vincent hesitated a moment longer. "You and Mr. Roscente—"

"We're strictly professional," Sophia cut in, her smile faint but firm.

Vincent nodded understandingly and quickened his pace to catch up with the group.

Halfway through the inspection, a fierce wind kicked up, and the clouds darkened further.

"The rain might come earlier than predicted," Zachary murmured, eyeing the sky with concern.

Vincent handed Sophia a bottle of water, noticing her distant gaze fixed on the steep cliffs ahead.

"That's Lovers' Leap," he explained. "Precarious terrain with dangerous undercurrents—even shark sightings. It's technically part of the development zone, but current engineering can't handle it yet."

"Lovers' Leap?" Sophia repeated softly.

"Legend says heartbroken souls would end their lives there," Vincent said in a hushed tone. "Over time, the name stuck."

Sophia twisted open the water bottle with a quiet laugh. "Fitting."

"Zachary mentioned Phase Three will develop the area, but not for another two years." Vincent's eyes suddenly brightened. "I think it'd make a perfect observation deck—ideal for sunrises and sunsets."

"Add some extreme sports facilities," Sophia added. "It'd be a major tourist draw."

Vincent grinned. "Felix Roland already decided you'll design Phase Three too—keeps the aesthetic consistent."

Sophia froze. She knew once the baby arrived, all ties with Ethan would be severed. This project wouldn't be hers. But she simply smiled and said nothing.

As the inspection concluded, raindrops began to fall. Just as the group prepared to leave, a worker came running in panic.

"Foreman! Daniel Mackillop collapsed—he's having seizures!"

The foreman paled, hastily apologizing to Ethan before rushing off with the worker.

"Mr. Roscente, should we—" Zachary started, but Ethan was already striding after them.

"Let's go," Ethan ordered tersely.

Zachary hurried to follow as the group disappeared into the thickening rain.
###Chapter 459

Sophia and Vincent exchanged a glance before quickly following Ethan Roscente.

The cafeteria was in chaos.

A middle-aged man covered in rust lay convulsing on the floor, his face turning blue. Three or four coworkers hovered around him, shouting his name in panic.

"Daniel!"

"Wake up!"

"Don't scare us like this!"

The man's eyes suddenly flew open. His fingers curled into claws as his entire body jerked violently. A woman in the same work uniform collapsed beside him, wailing uncontrollably.

Workers dropped their utensils and backed away in fear.

A foreman rushed forward. "Call an ambulance!"

"Already did!" someone yelled.

Sophia clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms.

"Sophia."

Ethan's voice brushed her ear.

She snapped out of it, meeting his dark gaze.

"Want me to save him?" His fingers closed around her wrist, firm but not painful.

"Save him," she answered without hesitation.

His cool fingertips grazed her cheek as his lips curved. "Don't regret this."

Before she could react, his cold lips pressed against hers. Then he released her and strode toward the crowd.

Sophia stood frozen, fingers touching her tingling lips.

The foreman was trying to lift the patient when Ethan barked, "Don't move him!"

"Mr. Roscente?" The foreman jerked back.

Ethan knelt beside the man, pressing two fingers to his neck. His brow furrowed. "Zachary, the med kit."

Sophia watched from a distance.

The polished businessman had vanished. In his place was a composed physician radiating quiet authority. This version of him was impossible to look away from.

The crowd parted automatically.

"Family?" Ethan glanced at the sobbing woman.

"My...my husband," she choked out.

"History of heart disease?"

"Since childhood, but it hasn't flared in decades..." Her words tumbled out. "He just collapsed while eating..."

Ethan had already loosened the man's collar, expertly checking his pupils and pulse. Every command he issued was crisp and reassuring, carrying an almost hypnotic calm.
###Chapter 460

Ethan Roscente's icy gaze swept over the foreman.

His eyes were sharp as blades.

Beads of sweat formed on the foreman's forehead as he kept his head bowed.

Every construction crew had signed agreements prohibiting workers who failed medical exams. This heart patient slipping through was a clear oversight.

If an accident occurred, both the Roscente and Roland corporations would be held accountable.

Public sentiment toward capitalists was already volatile. A safety incident like this could trigger an uproar.

Sophia Lowell clenched her fists, grateful Ethan was present.

Zachary Evans swiftly retrieved the first aid kit.

Ethan unfastened the worker's collar, his long fingers checking the carotid pulse. He leaned close to listen before applying precise pressure to specific points.

When the man remained unconscious, Ethan dropped to his knees without hesitation and began CPR.

His strong hands pressed rhythmically against the worker's chest.

After several compressions, he bent down to administer rescue breaths.

Sweat dripped from his tense jawline.

The overhead lights cast a halo around him, divine in that moment.

Sophia gently touched her slightly rounded belly, whispering in her heart: "That's your father, little one."

A faint flutter answered beneath her palm.

Her eyes widened. "Baby?"

Another distinct kick followed.

Tears welled instantly.

For the first time, she truly felt the miracle of life.

Nearby, Ethan continued his desperate efforts. His shirt clung to him with sweat as the crowd watched breathlessly.

"Keep going," Sophia mouthed silently.

Ethan suddenly looked up.

Their eyes met—electricity crackled between them.

New life stirred in her womb while he wrestled with death.

Sirens shattered the tension.

As the worker was loaded onto the stretcher, his wife kowtowed. "Our savior!"

Ethan sidestepped the gesture. "Just doing my duty."

He turned toward the restroom, his posture unwavering.

"Mr. Roscente hasn't fought this hard to save someone in years," Zachary murmured. "And he's severely germaphobic."

Sophia watched his retreating figure. "He would've made an excellent doctor."

"Of course," Zachary said proudly. "He was wielding scalpels at sixteen—the youngest surgeon ever at Mass General."

The sound of running water echoed from the restroom.

Ethan was scrubbing his mouth raw, his knuckles bone-white.
###Chapter 461

Sophia blinked. "Then why did he suddenly switch to business?"

"Well..." Zachary hesitated, his lips curling into a knowing smile. "That's Mr. Roscente's private matter. If you're really curious, you should ask him yourself."

Sophia scoffed. "If even you won’t tell me, he definitely won’t."

Zachary only smiled in response.

Twenty minutes later, Ethan returned, his expression stormy. "Get me coffee," he ordered, his voice rough.

"Only instant here..." Zachary said apologetically.

"Doesn’t matter. Hurry up."

"Yes, sir."

A steaming cup of instant coffee was quickly handed to Ethan. He stared at the dark liquid, his brow furrowed, then took a large gulp—only to immediately spit it back out, his face twisting in disgust.

His lips were red and glossy from repeated rinsing, clearly revolted by the taste. As he turned toward the restroom again, Sophia pulled a tissue from her bag and held it out. "Here."

Ethan narrowed his eyes. "Shouldn’t you be wiping my mouth for me?"

"Dream on." She rolled her eyes. Even if he’d just saved a life, it didn’t erase the fact she was still furious with him.

"Sophia." His voice stopped her.

"What?"

"It’s disgusting."

"And?"

"I feel awful." There was an uncharacteristic note of petulance in his tone.

"Then?"

Suddenly, he stepped closer, his long fingers tilting her chin up. His lips brushed lightly against hers. "Now I don’t."

With so many workers watching!

Sophia’s face burned crimson to her ears. She stomped her foot in outrage. "You—!"

He licked his lips shamelessly. "Cleansed. Much better now."

"..."

She wasn’t some damn air freshener!

This bastard was just finding excuses to take advantage.

Sophia was seething.

Just as she was about to explode, Zachary approached quickly. "Mr. Roscente, the site supervisor is waiting in the conference room."

Ethan’s expression sharpened. He turned to Sophia. "Coming with me, or staying here?"

"Like I’d wait for you!" She stormed off toward the conference room.

Zachary watched her furious retreat before whispering, "Sir, did you upset Ms. Lowell again?"

Ethan’s lips curved faintly as he savored the memory of that kiss. "She’s like a firecracker—one spark and she explodes."

"..."

Zachary sighed inwardly. What a way to describe a woman.
###Chapter 462

The rain poured down in torrents, fat droplets hammering against the corrugated metal roof with deafening force.

Ethan Roscente's slender fingers tapped rhythmically against the conference table, unhurried and controlled.

Lawrence Rosedale's forehead glistened with sweat, his dress shirt soaked through at the back.

"Mr. Roscente, I'll arrange the dormitory right away," he said, bowing slightly, his voice trembling.

Zachary Evans shot him a warning glance.

"That couple won't be needed tomorrow," Ethan suddenly declared, his voice as cold as ice.

Sophia Lowell looked up sharply.

In the dim light, the sharp angles of his profile appeared even more severe.

"Their son is still in the hospital—"

"What does that have to do with me?" Ethan cut her off, his gaze razor-sharp. "This is a construction site, not a charity."

A flash of lightning outside illuminated the frost in his eyes.

Lawrence's legs nearly gave out beneath him.

"I'll handle it immediately!"

The storm grew fiercer.

The makeshift prefab building groaned under the howling wind, its metal frame creaking ominously.

"Mr. Roscente, the mountain road's been washed out by a mudslide," Zachary reported grimly after hanging up the phone.

Vincent Laurent wiped the condensation from his glasses. "Looks like we're staying the night."

Lawrence seized the reprieve. "The dorms are ready! Mr. Roscente can take the east unit, and Mr. Evans and Mr. Laurent can stay in the west—"

"She's with me," Ethan interrupted, pointing at Sophia.

The air turned to ice.

Sophia clenched her fists. "I'll stay in the women's dorm."

"Are you sure?" Ethan smirked. "Twenty workers crammed in there. They can barely turn around."

"I'd rather squeeze in."

The man rose abruptly, his towering frame casting a shadow over her.

He leaned down, his whisper meant only for her ears: "Or would you prefer everyone knows about us?"

Sophia's pupils contracted.

Rainwater dripped through the roof's seams, pooling at her feet.

"Lead the way," Ethan commanded, his tone brooking no argument.

Lawrence scrambled to guide them.

At the end of the hallway, the so-called "dorm" was little more than a ten-square-meter shipping container.

A narrow bed. A desk and chair. Nothing else.

Ethan shut the door, sealing out the storm.

"Happy now?" Sophia asked bitterly.

The man leisurely undid his cufflinks. "Compared to twenty women sharing bunks, at least here..." He paused. "It's quiet."

Another lightning strike flashed.

In that split second of illumination, Sophia saw the turbulence in his eyes—

Like a calm sea hiding a coming tempest.
###Chapter 463

"I'll ride with Director Laurent." Sophia's ears turned pink as she turned to leave.

Ethan's long arm blocked her path, trapping her between the car door and his body. "Who'd dare give you keys without my permission?"

"You're impossible!" She stamped her foot in frustration.

His lips curved slightly, eyes glinting dangerously. "Just realizing that now?"

Sophia clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms.

In the end, she couldn't escape sharing a room with Ethan.

"These two units are temporary lodgings for executives, fully equipped with air conditioning and private bathrooms. Please make yourselves comfortable." Supervisor Lawrence introduced respectfully.

Sophia examined the prefabricated metal hut. Though basic, it was luxurious for a remote construction site. The private bathroom was an unexpected bonus.

"Thank you." She nodded politely.

Ethan dragged her into the innermost unit without explanation. Rain had soaked half her body, strands of hair clinging to her cheeks.

"Disgusting." He frowned, shoving her toward the bathroom.

Noticing his mud-splattered trousers, she retorted, "You're not much better."

"Care to join me then?" Amusement flickered in his gaze.

"In your dreams!" The door slammed shut.

A deep chuckle sounded outside. Footsteps retreated, followed by the click of another door.

Fifteen minutes later, Ethan returned dripping wet. Carefully extracting a waterproof bag from his jacket, he knocked on the bathroom door.

"Clothes."

"No need." The muffled reply came through the door.

"Planning to come out naked?" He raised an eyebrow. "I wouldn't mind."

A soapy hand emerged from the crack. "Give it here."

"Even royalty isn't this demanding." He handed over the bag.

The door slammed shut again.

"Ungrateful." Ethan snorted, locking the main door behind him.

His soaked shirt hit the floor with a wet thud. The metallic clink of his belt buckle echoed sharply. The defined lines of his torso gleamed under the harsh lighting.

Ding—

Sophia's phone screen lit up.

Ethan's peripheral vision caught the familiar name. His expression darkened instantly. Snatching the phone, he unlocked it effortlessly with her fingerprint.

Four unread messages glared back at him.

His knuckles whitened. The air in the cramped space thickened with barely contained fury.
###Chapter 464

"Sophia, I know you've been wanting to escape Ethan Roscente."

"Seattle is too close. He'll find you eventually."

"My parents own an estate in Switzerland. It's safe there."

"After you leave, I'll quit my job and come for you."

"We can start over, have a beautiful baby together..."

The messages popped up one after another, then vanished just as quickly.

Only one remained: "Sorry, drunk rambling. But the offer stands."

Followed by a flirty heart emoji.

Ethan's knuckles turned white. The phone screen cracked under his grip, spiderwebbing across the glass. Shadows carved deep lines across his sharp features as dangerous currents swirled in his eyes.

The bathroom door opened. Sophia stepped out, towel-drying her damp hair.

Her white shirt barely skimmed her thighs. Droplets trailed down her slender neck. When she saw the phone in Ethan's hand, her pupils shrank.

"Have you lost your mind?" She lunged for it.

He caught her wrist, squeezing hard enough to make her wince. "Guilty conscience?" His voice was glacial.

Sophia struggled uselessly, eyes burning with fury. "Who gave you the right to go through my phone?"

"Your husband did." He slammed her against the wall, breath hot against her ear. "Sebastian's proposal sounds tempting?"

Her collar gaped open during the struggle, revealing a fading love bite on her collarbone. Ethan's gaze darkened. He dragged his thumb roughly over the mark.

"What proposal?" Sophia gasped at the sting. "What are you talking about?"

With a cold laugh, he shoved the phone in her face. Only the retraction notices and that glaring heart remained.

Sophia froze. "What did Sebastian send?"

"Playing dumb?" He gripped her chin. "Quite the elaborate elopement plan."

Realization dawned. She trembled with rage. "You think I'm involved with Sebastian? Ethan, what kind of twisted fantasy is this?"

"Evidence." He released her, yanking open a drawer to fling photos across the floor. Shots of her with Sebastian in the lab—some angles suspiciously intimate.

Her breath hitched. "You had me followed?"

"How else would I uncover your lies?" His glare was venomous. "You're cut off from him starting tomorrow."

"You're insane!" She hurled a pillow at him. "He's just a colleague!"

Ethan caught it effortlessly, advancing like a predator. "Colleagues don't plan runaway schemes? Don't fantasize about having your children?"

"I never—" She stumbled back onto the bed.

He caged her in, shirt buttons straining. "Then prove it."

Outside, thunder shattered the night as the storm unleashed its fury.
###Chapter 465

"Senior brother?" Ethan Roscente's lips curled into a cold smirk, his dark eyes boring into her. "How intimate. If I weren't here, would you two be calling each other 'husband' and 'wife' next?"

His fingers clamped around her chin with crushing force, as if he meant to shatter her bones.

"Sophia Lowell, trying to run?" His voice dropped to a terrifying whisper. "Not unless I'm dead."

Sophia's pupils constricted, tears welling in her eyes. His unreasonable accusations stung, but his obsession left her utterly powerless.

"Ethan Roscente!" Her voice trembled. "You're insane! I hate you!"

"Hate me?" He laughed suddenly, the sound laced with indescribable bitterness. "Good. Then I'll give you every reason to."

He flung her onto the bed.

Sophia instinctively shielded her abdomen, her voice shaking. "What are you doing?"

"Taking what's mine." His tone left no room for argument.

Like a raging beast, he pinned her down, his entire body radiating predatory intent.

"Stop..." Sophia finally broke into sobs. "I'm scared... Please don't..."

Her crying gave him pause. He studied her tear-streaked face, his expression unreadable.

"Scared?" He sneered. "Yet brave enough to betray me?"

"I didn't!"

"Liar." His fingers traced her throat. "If you weren't plotting to escape with Sebastian Valdemar, why plan to have his child in that town? Do you love him that much?"

The last words were ground out between clenched teeth.

Sophia froze. In that split second of hesitation, he tore her clothes apart.

"I don't love him!" she rushed to explain.

"Too late." Ethan sank his teeth into her jugular.

The metallic tang of blood flooded his mouth, sending a perverse thrill through him. He licked his stained lips like a bloodthirsty demon.

He was a madman. So what? Since she'd barged into his world, she wouldn't leave unscathed.

Sophia stared blankly at the ceiling, silent tears streaming down. She felt every excruciating detail—the piercing pain of his teeth, the sickening pull as he drank from her.

Her silence unsettled him.

Reason slowly returned. Releasing her, he took in her hollow gaze and felt an unexpected pang in his chest.

"Being with me," he rasped, gripping her chin, "is this really worse than death?"
###Chapter 466

Ethan Roscente's fingertips traced the dampness at the corner of her eye, his lips curling into a cruel smirk. "Even if you hide at the ends of the earth, you can't escape my grasp." His low voice was like a demon's whisper. "Sophia Lowell, you're destined to be mine in this lifetime."

Every word cut into her heart like a sharp blade.

The phrase "bound to me for eternity" ignited her fury.

Sophia suddenly lashed out, her nails raking across his face. "Ethan Roscente! I hate you!" she screamed hysterically. "Every day with you is torture!"

Her nails left bloody trails down his back, and a wound bloomed on his chin.

"Do you have any idea how happy I've been this past month?" She pounded her fists against his chest wildly. "Sebastian Valdemar is a thousand—no, a million—times better than you! We're together every day, and we're going to have three children!"

A vein throbbed at Ethan's temple, his knuckles turning white.

"Shut up!" he roared, pinning her down.

"You think a rotten man like you has the right to touch me?" Sophia sank her teeth into his hand. "First you sleep with Bianca Savigny, then you come crawling back to me? Disgusting!"

Ethan's pupils constricted sharply. "Who told you I slept with Bianca?"

"She. Sent. Me. The. Photos. Herself!" Sophia spat each word, her eyes filled with revulsion.

His expression darkened dangerously. "Hugo Roscente was the one with her that night." He gripped her chin. "After being drugged, I spent the whole night in an ice bath. Then I went to you—and what did you give me?"

A cold laugh escaped him. "A cold shoulder. The silent treatment."

Sophia scoffed. "Liar. Keep spinning your tales. First Hugo, next you'll invent some 'Shadow Roscente'?"

"You don't believe me?" His voice dropped to a deadly calm.

"Are you worthy of belief?" She glared at him defiantly.

Ethan's gaze turned predatory as his thumb pressed harshly against her lips. "This mouth..." His voice roughened. "It's only cute when you're begging for mercy."

He leaned in, his breath hot against her ear. "Tonight, I'll teach you what it means to be bedridden for three days straight."
###Chapter 467

"Have you lost your mind?"

Her pupils constricted sharply, nails digging deep into her palms.

The man chuckled darkly, his thumb tracing circles at her waist. "Why don't we find out?"

His rough hand slid downward along her curves, and Sophia arched her back abruptly. "Stop... the workers are right outside—"

"Then bite down hard."

"..."

Was that really the issue here?

The scorching heat of his touch burned through the fabric. Her entire body tensed, the tips of her ears flushing crimson. "Ethan Roscente, you're despicable."

He leaned in, capturing her feverish earlobe between his teeth, his voice gravelly. "Who was the one begging me for this before?"

Sophia's breath hitched.

His iron grip tightened around her as his voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "I'll pretend I didn't hear what you said earlier. Apologize now, and I might let this slide."

"I don't care if you're angry."

Defiant flames flickered in her eyes, her nails nearly piercing the muscles of his arm.

Ethan's gaze darkened. He seized her lips in a bruising kiss.

Sophia clenched her teeth.

Then his knuckles brushed against a sensitive spot. A shudder wracked her body, a whimper escaping her throat. "Ah—"

"Beautiful."

He intensified the pressure mercilessly, his lips grazing her trembling mouth. "Last chance. Apologize."

Tears pooled in her eyes, but she lifted her chin stubbornly.

His chest heaved violently before his grip on her waist turned punishing. "I have plenty of ways to make you yield."

Everywhere his fingers traveled, tremors followed.

She shook her head desperately.

He advanced relentlessly.

Until she was sobbing, gasping for air.

"I did nothing wrong! Why should I apologize?"

"Sneaking around with another man? Humiliating me in public? And you dare say you did nothing wrong?"

"I didn’t!"

"Then let’s see which is stronger—" His palm suddenly dipped lower, "your stubborn mouth... or this."

"Don’t!" She scrambled to block him.

But he overpowered her effortlessly. When his hand pressed against her abdomen, his brows furrowed abruptly. His gaze dropped instinctively.
###Chapter 468

Sophia's fingers trembled as she cupped Ethan's chiseled face. A soft whimper escaped her lips. "I was wrong..."

A dark glint flashed in his eyes as his thumb brushed her damp lower lip. "Explain."

"I'm sorry..."

He knew every sensitive spot on her body too well. Sophia's eyes reddened at the edges, overwhelmed. The secret weighed on her like chains, forcing her surrender.

"Can't hear you." His fingers dug into the dip of her waist, cruel and deliberate.

"I'm sorry!" Her voice cracked with tears.

A sharp slap landed on her backside. "What exactly were you wrong about?"

"Shouldn't have talked back... shouldn't have said those things..." Her toes curled in humiliation.

Another smack. "Still thinking of running?"

"Never again..."

"Who do you want to bear children for?"

"Only you..."

"Who owns your heart?"

"Just you..."

He suddenly braced above her, casting a shadow. "Final question." His palm hovered over her rear. "Has anyone else touched you?"

Sophia stared at that threatening hand and frantically shook her head. "No! Only you—always you!"

"Then who pleases you more?"

"You're cheating!" She bit his shoulder in frustration.

"My math teacher was the gym coach." He chuckled darkly before retaliating with a nip of his own.

Sophia's ears burned crimson. "How can I compare when there's no one else to compare to?"

Ethan smirked, kneading the flushed skin before suddenly lifting her thighs. "Good behavior deserves a reward."

"No!" She pressed against his chest in panic. "I'm... on my period..."

"Liar." His fingers slid beneath her skirt. "I already checked."

Tears welled instantly. With a resigned sigh, she looped her arms around his neck and nuzzled close, voice thick. "My stomach hurts... be gentle..."

The prenatal report said intimacy was safe after four months. If she couldn't escape, she might as well bargain for tenderness.

Ethan didn't respond, but his movements turned unusually careful. His scorching lips traced her shivering skin with uncharacteristic patience.

As pleasure crested, he suddenly sucked her earlobe. "Sophia, let's have a baby."

That way, she'd never run again.

Imagining her cradling a rosy-cheeked bundle, he smoothed a hand over her slightly rounded abdomen—

Something kicked against his palm.

Both froze.

"Did you just—" Ethan's eyes narrowed.

Sophia's heart stopped. She hastily sank her teeth into his collarbone. "It hurts... slow down..."

The baby's protesting, she thought secretly.
###Chapter 469

The rain outside the window gradually subsided, but Ethan Roscente's thoughts churned like turbulent waves.

He felt certain he'd overlooked some crucial clue, but each time he nearly grasped it, the thought slipped away like a darting fish.

"Ouch..." Sophia Lowell's delicate whimper interrupted his reverie.

He looked down at the woman in his arms and gave her backside a light tap with his palm. "Such a delicate flower?" His tone was stern, but his movements gentled as he effortlessly scooped her up.

Thunder rumbled through the clouds while the temperature in the room steadily climbed.

When Ethan carried Sophia out of the bathroom, she was pliant as melted wax. His touch had been unusually tender today, leaving no discomfort in her abdomen. Still, she reached for the pill bottle in her bag.

"What's this?" Ethan emerged, towel-drying his hair.

Sophia shook the bottle, locking eyes with him. "Prenatal vitamins. Believe me?"

His gaze flicked to the "Vitamin" label, and the tension in his jaw eased. Pulling her close, he murmured against her ear, "Want prenatal vitamins? Then I'll have to work harder to make your wish come true in two months."

Sophia exhaled discreetly. Her test had succeeded—he hadn't noticed. Though he'd relented about children, his earlier "tool" comment still festered in her heart like a splinter.

"Why the sudden change of heart?" she couldn't help asking.

Ethan's eyes darkened. Their last argument flashed in his mind, but honesty wasn't an option. "Figure it out yourself," he teased.

Sophia huffed and turned her back to him. This man always did this—deflecting every question onto her.

"Really mad now?" Ethan turned her back, finding her eyes suspiciously red. Lately, tears came too easily to her. If she actually got pregnant, would he spend every day comforting her?

The image of a teary-eyed Sophia with a rounded belly softened something in his chest. Fine—his woman, his responsibility to pamper. But the truth could wait.

"Zachary mentioned you asked about postponing the wedding?" he abruptly changed subjects.

Sophia bristled. That traitor Zachary! "Just making conversation," she said through gritted teeth. "With all your scandals, it's generous of Isabella to only delay things rather than cancel outright."

Ethan's expression cooled. "Is that what you really think?"

"What else?" Her laugh was brittle. "Keep this up, and next time it won't be a postponement—it'll be a cancellation."

After a weighted silence, he asked casually, "Which would you prefer—postponed or canceled?"

His tone was light, as if discussing the weather.
###Chapter 470

"Sophia? Are you okay?" Vivian's voice exploded from the phone.

Ethan Roscente reached over and snatched it away.

"None of your business."

Silence filled the line.

"Holy shit—Ethan?" Vivian recovered quickly. "What the hell did you do to her?"

"Legally married." His voice was icy. "Do I need your permission?"

The call ended abruptly.

Sophia Lowell lunged for her phone. "Are you insane?"

"Just stating facts." He caught her wrist with one hand. "Or am I not your husband?"

His shirt rode up, revealing red marks on her pale skin.

Too tired to argue, she bent to text Vivian an explanation.

The moment she stood, his arm yanked her back.

"Where do you think you're going?"

"To change." She grabbed a paper bag.

Ethan shook it open first. A pastel dress fluttered onto the bed.

"Do it here."

"You’re sick."

His fingers trailed her waist, popping two buttons open.

"Every inch of you was mine last night." His lips brushed her ear. "Too late for modesty."

She clutched her collar.

"Just changing clothes." He nipped her collarbone. "Unless you want something more?"

"Get lost."

"Liar." A third button gave way. "You weren’t this shy in the dressing room."

Her body stiffened.

"That was—"

"Was what?" He gripped her chin, forcing eye contact.

Sophia turned her face away. "Don’t push it, Ethan."

"I can push harder." His hand slid under her shirt. "Choose. Dress yourself, or I’ll do it for you."

The rumpled sheets were a silent threat.

She bit her lip and turned. "From the back."

The bra clasp clicked open.

His fingertips ghosted down her spine, drawing a shiver.

"Stop hiding." He pried her hands from her chest. "I’ve touched every part of you."

His breath scorched her neck. A fresh bruise bloomed.

"Are you a dog?" She flinched.

"A wolf." His teeth scraped her ear. "The kind that eats little rabbits."

He slid the dress on slowly, leaving the zipper at her lower back undone.

"Ethan!"

"Patience." His finger traced her spine. "Did I bite too hard here last night?"

The mirror reflected her flushed face.

"I’ll call the police."

"Go ahead." He nipped the nape of her neck. "Let them arrest me for dressing my wife."

As another kiss darkened her collarbone, her phone buzzed.

Vivian’s message flashed: [Girl, you’re doomed. Ethan’s going to devour you alive.]

Sophia glared at her ravaged neck in the mirror and stomped on his foot.

"How am I supposed to go out like this?"

"Perfect." Ethan pulled her back into his arms. "Stay home. Wear nothing but my shirts."
###Chapter 471

Sophia rummaged through her bag and pulled out a concealer, swiftly twisting off the cap.

Since becoming pregnant, she had almost stopped wearing makeup. The few cosmetics she still used had all been switched to pregnancy-safe brands.

The mirror reflected faint red marks on her neck.

Frowning, she dipped her fingertips into the concealer and carefully covered the traces.

"Done." She set the concealer down with satisfaction.

Ethan Roscente suddenly reached over and tossed the tube into the trash.

"Are you insane?" Sophia shoved him hard and bent to retrieve it. "This cost over fifty dollars!"

"Disgusting," he said coldly.

She rolled her eyes. "Without this, the whole company will gossip tomorrow about how desperate I am."

The construction site was already buzzing with noise.

As she left the dormitory, Sophia saw the wife of the worker who'd had a heart attack the night before packing her belongings. The woman's eyes were swollen, clutching a crumpled train ticket in her hand.

Sophia touched the cash in her bag.

"Lawrence." She stopped the passing supervisor and pressed $350 into his hand. "Please give this to her."

Ethan leaned against the car, scoffing. "Sentimental nonsense."

"Better than being heartless." Sophia yanked the car door open and slid inside.

"To the train station," she told the driver.

Ethan arched a brow. "This is my car."

"Then drop me off at the next intersection."

The driver glanced at Ethan through the rearview mirror.

"Train station," Ethan said flatly.

Sophia exhaled quietly in relief.

The station was packed with travelers.

Checking the time, Sophia grabbed her bag and bolted for the ticket gate. She barely made it into the carriage with one minute to spare, panting as she steadied herself against a seat.

The aisle was clogged with passengers stowing luggage.

"Excuse me..." She squeezed forward with difficulty.

A sudden noise came from above.

"Look out!"

A suitcase plummeted straight toward her.

In a flash, someone yanked her into their arms. The familiar scent of cedar enveloped her. Sophia looked up to see Ethan's tense jawline.

"Clumsy fool." He caught the falling suitcase with one hand and effortlessly slid it back onto the rack.

Passengers automatically cleared a path.

Ethan gripped her wrist and strode down the aisle. His tall frame moved with effortless grace as Sophia stumbled after him, her heartbeat skipping unexpectedly.
###Chapter 472

Thunder rumbled outside as lightning split the night sky.

Sophia's fingers trembled, crumpling the page of her book.

"Hmm?" Ethan's deep voice drifted from behind her, laced with drowsy amusement.

She pressed her lips together, her heartbeat pounding like war drums.

"I..."

Before she could finish, a deafening thunderclap shook the building. The lights flickered twice before plunging them into darkness.

Sophia clutched the blanket tightly.

"Don't be afraid." Ethan quickly lit his phone, the dim glow revealing her pale profile.

He moved to the window. "Power's out."

Sophia burrowed deeper under the covers, cocooning herself.

Hurried footsteps approached from the hallway.

"Mr. Roscente?" Zachary's voice cut through the rain. "The backup generator at the construction site failed too. Here are emergency candles."

Two white candles were handed over, their flames dancing in the wind.

Ethan shut the door, casting intertwining shadows on the walls. He lifted a corner of the blanket and pulled her into his arms.

"Let go!" Sophia struggled, slapping his arm.

"You really want to be alone in the dark?" His low chuckle brushed against her ear.

In the candlelight, their faces were inches apart when Ethan suddenly murmured, "Feels like our wedding night."

"Who uses white candles for a wedding?" She glared. "That's bad luck."

"Should I get dragon-phoenix candles next time?" His fingers twirled a lock of her hair.

"Maybe you should retake literature class." She rolled her eyes.

"A Harvard legacy student needs remedial courses?"

"I was the provincial top scorer in college entrance exams."

"I got admitted at twelve."

"I won the状元 at seventeen."

Ethan frowned abruptly. "Why did you only start grad school at twenty-one?"

Sophia's breath hitched.

That winter had been particularly bitter. Standing on the rooftop edge, she hadn't even felt the snowflakes settling on her wounds. Her mother, eyes swollen from crying, had kept vigil beside her for an entire year.

"Cold?" Ethan drew her closer.

Sophia shut her eyes, feigning sleep.

The candle wick crackled.

"During this business trip," he said suddenly, "I uncovered the truth behind your so-called 'accidents.'"
###Chapter 473

Sophia's eyes flew open, her pupils contracting sharply.

"What truth?"

Ethan Roscente's long fingers brushed her cheek as he spoke in a low voice. "Someone's been trying to kill you in secret."

The words stabbed into her spine like an ice pick.

"Even that knife wound last time—someone orchestrated it."

If he hadn't intervened, the lunatic's family would have used Sophia's police report as an excuse to attack her again.

Fortunately, he'd taken control of the situation before the mastermind's plan could succeed.

A chill ran through Sophia as she recalled the mysterious text message from months ago.

Was the sender the same person who wanted her dead?

"Scared?" Ethan gripped her icy fingers.

"Someone wants me dead, and I don't even know who." Her voice trembled. "Wouldn't you be scared?"

"Then stay close to me." His arms tightened around her. "No one will lay a finger on you."

"What if this danger exists because of you?" Sophia countered abruptly.

Ethan frowned. "Meaning?"

She thought of that damning text but hesitated.

"Nothing. Just talking nonsense."

He pinched her chin. "Don't say things I don't want to hear."

"Will ignoring the truth change anything?" Sophia scoffed. "Isabella Valentine has tried to ruin me repeatedly, yet you turn a blind eye."

Darkness flashed in Ethan's eyes. "You're blaming me?"

Though phrased as a question, his tone brooked no argument.

"I wouldn't dare."

He hated this act of hers the most.

Brimming with resentment yet pretending everything was fine.

"Behave, and this won't happen again."

Sophia laughed inwardly.

More like she'd die faster.

Her hand drifted to her abdomen as resolve flickered in her eyes.

The next morning, Sophia woke to an empty bed.

Just as she sighed in relief, her shattered phone rang.

Wrapped in Ethan's shirt, she picked up the cracked device and sighed—another month's salary down the drain.

An unknown number flashed on screen.

"Sophia, I'm so sorry!" Sebastian Valdemar's frantic voice came through. "My phone was stolen last night. Someone used my WeChat to message you and then recalled it. That wasn't me! Did they do anything to you?"

Sophia checked the app, staring at the recalled notifications before answering quietly, "I didn't see the content."

But Ethan had.

Those messages must have been vile to provoke last night's frenzy.

"I've caused you trouble." Sebastian sounded wretched. "I was drinking at a bar when my phone got stolen."

Sophia lowered her lashes.

Though unintentional, those messages had cost her dearly.
###Chapter 474

Her fingers trembled slightly as she deftly changed the subject. "If you lost your phone, report it to the police immediately. Since they texted you on WeChat, they might already be draining your accounts."

Silence lingered on the other end for a few seconds before Sebastian Valdemar finally exhaled in relief. "I froze all my accounts right away. I was just worried someone might harass you using my phone."

Before he could finish, Sophia Lowell suddenly felt strong arms encircle her from behind. Ethan Roscente's scorching lips brushed against the nape of her neck, his voice rough with sleep. "Why are you up so early?"

Sophia froze.

A sharp intake of breath echoed clearly through the phone.

She glared at the man behind her, but he merely arched a lazy brow, his long fingers toying with her loose strands. "Don't look at me like that. Mornings are dangerous."

"Ethan!" she hissed in warning.

Ignoring her, he traced his fingertips over the fading love bites on her collarbone. The crimson marks stood out starkly against her pale skin—deliberate imprints from the night before.

"I went too hard on you last night," he suddenly announced, raising his voice. "I'll make it up to you tonight."

"Are you insane?" Sophia frantically moved to cover the phone.

Sebastian's suppressed roar erupted from the speaker. "Ethan Roscente, you forced her!"

"Forced?" Ethan let out a cold laugh, snatching the phone from her. "She was screaming my name all night. Guess I have your texts to thank for that." His tone turned glacial. "Remember this—Sophia is mine. If you dare covet her again, I'll make you regret being born."

Sophia's pupils contracted.

Before she could grab the phone back, the call disconnected.

"You—"

A searing kiss swallowed her protest. Ethan cradled the back of her head, his other hand gripping her chin to force her mouth open. The kiss was punishing, as if he wanted to devour her whole.

Only when her legs turned to jelly did he finally pull away, unsatisfied.

"Beautiful," he murmured, thumb grazing her swollen lips, dark desire swirling in his eyes. "This look belongs to me alone."

Shaking with fury, Sophia spat, "How dare you humiliate me in front of Sebastian—"

"Because I'm your man." He tightened his grip on her chin, enunciating each word. "It's time he gave up for good."
###Chapter 475

His fingertips burned against her flushed cheek as he traced slow circles.

"Embarrassed?" His deep voice held a teasing edge.

Those dark eyes smoldered like ink, threatening to swallow her whole.

Sophia turned her face away, chest rising and falling rapidly.

She clenched her fists, then forced them to relax.

Arguing with this unreasonable man was an exercise in futility.

A timely knock interrupted them.

"Mr. Roscente, your breakfast is here."

Glancing down at her disheveled clothes, Sophia hurried into the bathroom.

The sound of running water filled the space.

When she emerged, an elegant breakfast spread awaited on the table.

Two paper bags sat neatly by the bed.

She reached for her clothes, but Ethan caught her wrist.

"Eat first." His tone brooked no argument.

The food proved surprisingly to her taste.

"Proctoring at ten?" Ethan pushed peeled shrimp toward her, brows knitting.

"Yes."

"That desperate for two hundred bucks?"

Sophia stirred her steamed egg custard deliberately. "Not all of us swim in money like you, Mr. Roscente. Some of us need side gigs."

Her pointed glance at her empty pockets spoke volumes.

"I'll replace your phone."

"Pass. Your gifts come with too many strings attached."

Ethan's expression darkened.

"Must you always be like this?"

"Must you always snoop through my things?"

The air turned glacial.

He suddenly slid his phone across the table. "Go ahead. Search it."

Sophia scoffed. "How do I know this isn't another trap?"

The shrill ringtone shattered the tension.

"Sophia? Where are you?" Vivian's voice pierced through the speaker.

Sophia's pulse jumped.

"You're at my place?"

"Obviously. Dad sent tropical fruits perfect for preg—"

Cough cough cough! Sophia choked violently.

Ethan handed her a napkin, his voice clear as day: "Slow down."

Dead silence from the other end.

"Holy shit!" Vivian's shriek nearly ruptured eardrums. "There's a man! Sophia Lowell, you dark horse!"
###Chapter 476

Sophia had just settled into her seat when she looked up and met Ethan Roscente's intense gaze.

"You followed me?" she whispered.

Ethan braced one hand on the tray table in front of her and planted the other on the seatback, effectively boxing her in.

"Should I have let you run off with some stranger?" He leaned closer, his breath warm against her ear. "I'd never find your body."

Sophia choked on her retort.

Was he always this insufferable?

As the train pulled out of the station, the cabin quieted. She glanced around and realized Ethan was still standing.

"No seat?"

"Standing ticket."

The CEO of Roscente Group with a standing ticket. Sophia scooted over, making room for him beside her.

A college-aged boy in the window seat had been staring at her since she sat down. Ethan's eyes turned icy. Suddenly, he yanked Sophia up by the waist.

"What are you—"

Before she could protest, he deposited her onto his lap. His muscular arms encircled her as he murmured, "More comfortable this way."

Passengers nearby turned to stare. Sophia's ears burned.

"Put me down!" She squirmed, keeping her voice low.

"Legally married. No one cares." Ethan didn't budge.

"I have professional dignity!"

"The Victorian era called. They want their prudery back." He smirked.

"Fine. You sit. I'll stand."

"That's poor manners."

"Since when do you care about manners?"

"There's a difference between choosing to be shameless and being forced into it." Ethan said it with complete seriousness.

A few passengers chuckled. Sophia wished the seat would swallow her whole.

The elderly woman beside them smiled. "Dear, your husband just wants an excuse to hold you." She elbowed her own husband. "Learn something, old man."

The husband hastily offered a bag of chips. "Here, your favorite cucumber flavor."

Ethan seized the moment to whisper, "That'll be us in fifty years."

"Dream on." Sophia elbowed him hard.

An hour later, the train reached Seattle. Sophia bolted for the exit, but Ethan caught her wrist.

"I'll be late!" She stamped her foot.

Ethan towed her toward the station exit. "Keep up if you want to be on time."

"You're taking me to campus?" Sophia hurried to match his stride.
###Chapter 477

The Shadow Network of Z City existed like phantoms.

They lurked in the darkest corners of the metropolis, leaving no trace of their movements. For years, various factions had tried to infiltrate them—yet none had found a way in.

The Black Web once went to great lengths to plant an assassin among them.

That assassin, codenamed Venom, died under mysterious circumstances during a mission in the West. The case remained unsolved to this day.

Joining the Shadow Network was harder than reaching the heavens.

They demanded no pledges of loyalty. They left no clues behind. The last time they surfaced was when Young Master Xue of the Xue Corporation traded classified intel for their aid.

The Lord of Star City once offered them a fortune for protection—and was refused.

Now, the Jiang family faced the same dilemma.

Inside the banquet hall, Bai Huan paced anxiously.

His inside man had gone silent. The sudden radio silence told him the plan might be compromised. His fingers brushed the remote in his pocket. He was ready to gamble everything.

"Sir, the ceremony isn't over yet." The guard at the door blocked his path.

Bai Huan forced calm into his voice. "My uncle was hospitalized. I need to see him."

The guard didn't budge.

Bai Huan measured the distance between them. Then he turned abruptly and pressed the detonator, squeezing his eyes shut as he braced for the blast.

No one noticed Yan Zhenyu had already slipped away.

In the nursing room, Xing Wanye cradled her twins. She'd refused all social obligations, waiting only for Yan Zhenyu's return.

"Where are Grandpa and Grandma?"

"Mr. Yan has arranged everything. They're with Elder Jiang," the bodyguard answered respectfully.

Lu Sheng stood sentry by the door, statue-still. "I'll protect you."

An Kexia gently stroked her pregnant belly. Nan Gongzi had just checked on them. The air in the room was thick with tension.

Then Gu Xiaonuan pushed the door open. "Are you rehearsing a silent play? Come out and eat!"

"Is it safe outside?" An Kexia asked.

"Perfectly safe. Wanye, your Yan is back," Gu Nuanxi said with a smile.

Xing Wanye shook her head. "I'll stay with the children."

Jiang Chenzhao stood at the center of the banquet hall.

Suddenly, Little Tiger darted over and tugged his sleeve, whispering urgently.

"Dad, I found a huge secret!" Jiang Tianzhi rattled off a string of numbers.

Jiang Chenzhao's gaze sharpened. He crouched to meet his son's eyes. "Are you sure?"

"Tiger swears on his honor!" The little boy thumped his chest.
###Chapter 478

I was grading papers when a commotion broke out behind me.

Looking up, I saw Professor An Jing leaning uncomfortably close to Ethan Roscente, her painted lips stretched in a calculated smile. The low-cut dress she'd chosen for today exposed too much pale skin that gleamed under the classroom lights.

"Mr. Roscente, you're so charming," she cooed, her voice dripping with saccharine sweetness. "Professor Lowell talks about you all the time—how handsome and considerate you are."

Ethan didn't even glance up, his long fingers tapping an impatient rhythm on the desk.

Undeterred, An Jing inched closer. Her red-polished nails "accidentally" brushed against his sleeve. "We educators are quite open-minded. If you're ever interested—"

A shrill scream cut through the classroom.

My head snapped up to see An Jing sprawled on the floor, Ethan's hand clamped around her throat. The glacial look in his eyes sent chills down my spine.

"Ethan!" I rushed forward, prying his fingers loose. "Have you lost your mind?"

He released her with a disgusted flick of his wrist. "She asked for it."

An Jing clutched her neck, coughing violently. Her perfectly styled hair now hung in disarray. After one terrified glance at Ethan, she scrambled away on unsteady heels.

The classroom fell deathly silent. Students in the front row ducked their heads, pretending not to witness anything.

"What were you thinking?" I hissed under my breath.

Ethan's eyes narrowed. "She tried rubbing her foot against my leg."

My protest died in my throat. An Jing had a reputation for flirting with male colleagues, but this was brazen even for her.

"That doesn't justify—"

"Oh?" His voice dropped dangerously. "You think I should have entertained her advances?"

The icy tone made my skin prickle. Suddenly, I remembered exactly who stood before me—the heir to the Roscente empire, the ruthless business magnate whispered about in hushed tones across New York.

"I didn't mean that." I drew a steadying breath. "But this is a classroom."

Ethan's sudden smile chilled me to the bone.

"Sophia," he murmured, drawing out my name, "you seem awfully concerned about your colleague."

I instinctively stepped back. His gaze reminded me of a predator sizing up prey.

"I just—"

A choked sob interrupted us. An Jing stood trembling in the doorway, her neck visibly bruised.

"Professor Lowell," she whimpered, tears streaking her makeup, "I'm reporting this to the dean!"

Ethan's expression darkened. I quickly positioned myself between them, bracing for another outburst.

"Professor An, it was a misunderstanding," I attempted to mediate.

Her tearful demeanor vanished, replaced by venomous spite. "You planned this, didn't you, Sophia? Bringing him here just to humiliate me!"

The accusation stunned me. Before I could respond, Ethan let out a soft, terrifying laugh.

"Professor An," he purred, his voice deceptively light, "are you certain you want to file that complaint?"

All color drained from her face. She opened her mouth, then closed it, fleeing without another word.

Silence reclaimed the classroom. As I exhaled in relief, I found Ethan studying me with unsettling intensity.

"Seems you have your own troubles here," he remarked cryptically.

My pulse stuttered. There were layers to that statement I couldn't decipher.

Outside, clouds swallowed the sunlight, plunging the room into shadow. An inexplicable sense of foreboding settled over me.
###Chapter 479

Sophia slammed her lipstick onto the bathroom counter.

She had actually failed!

After conquering countless men over the years, she'd never met one she couldn't seduce. The colder Ethan Roscente acted, the more determined she became to have him.

"Miss Sophia?"

A black-suited bodyguard suddenly appeared at the women's restroom entrance.

She whirled around, nails digging into her palms. "Who let you in here?"

"You've offended someone you shouldn't have." The guard's expression remained impassive.

Sophia Lowell walked out of the academic building with a stack of graded papers, spotting Ethan beneath a maple tree in the distance.

He was tearing leaves apart irritably, the ground littered with shredded foliage.

"OCD acting up again?" She approached with teasing lilt.

Ethan glanced up briefly before resuming his obsessive scrubbing with antiseptic wipes, his knuckles rubbed raw.

"Filthy," he muttered with visible disgust.

Sophia couldn't suppress a laugh. She grabbed his hand and pressed a kiss to his reddened fingers. "Clean now?"

"Not enough." His eyes darkened as he suddenly pulled her into his arms.

His warm lips captured hers in a slow, melting kiss that left her breathless and limp against him when they finally parted.

"Are you insane? We're on campus!" Her cheeks burned as she pummeled his chest.

Ethan jerked his chin toward a nearby couple making out passionately beneath the trees. "They're worse."

Flustered, Sophia shoved him away and marched toward the school gates. Ethan followed at a leisurely pace, amusement curling his lips.

"After suffering such injustice, don't I deserve compensation?" He stated it like an indisputable fact.

"I just kissed you!"

"That was emotional compensation." He leaned close, breath tickling her ear. "I require physical compensation too."

Sophia considered for a moment. "Dinner then."

"Where?"

"There's this lovely tea house nearby. Their jasmine-roasted chicken has the crispiest skin and juiciest meat. The brioche with vanilla ice cream creates this perfect hot-cold contrast. Their vermicelli-wrapped shrimp has this amazing springy texture, and the stone pot tofu just melts in your—"

She rattled off the menu enthusiastically, oblivious to the increasingly predatory gleam in Ethan's eyes.
###Chapter 480

A flicker of disappointment crossed Ethan Roscente's eyes. He'd expected something more special for their date.

"Just this?" His reply was half-hearted.

"Don't you have exams to proctor this afternoon?"

Sophia Lowell shook her head. "I need to visit Napa Valley."

His brows knitted at the rustic name. "What business do you have in a place like that?"

"Luming Studio secured the Bay Bridge Project. We need to acquire land from the villagers." She sighed. "They agreed on compensation, but now they're backtracking, citing ancestral graves. Rerouting would cost millions."

Rubbing her temples, she added, "I have to assess the site and see if we can modify the design."

Ethan scoffed. "Since when do architects double as demolition crews? Did the client run out of staff—or drop dead?"

Sophia clapped a hand over his mouth. "Hush! This is a government project with tight budgets. Keep talking like that, and you'll get arrested."

He arched a brow, unimpressed. "Who'd dare?"

Truthfully, no one would touch the city's top taxpayer.

Their car stopped outside a bustling restaurant. Ethan's expression darkened at the crowded entrance. "This is where you're treating me?"

The noise reminded him of street vendors.

Sophia, accustomed to his fastidiousness, shrugged. "The food here is amazing. Leave if it's beneath you."

Without waiting, she strode inside.

Ethan gritted his teeth but followed.

"Table for two?" a waiter greeted cheerfully.

Sophia held up one finger deliberately. "One—"

Feeling his murderous glare, she slowly added a second finger. "Two."

Amid the din, they were led to a corner table.

"Scan the QR code to order," the waiter said before rushing off.

As Sophia pulled out her phone, Ethan remained standing.

"What now?"

He eyed the greasy table with distaste. "Filthy."

"It's clean," she argued. "They just wiped it."

His nose wrinkled. "It's stained."

Resigned, Sophia sighed. "Wait here."

She dashed to a convenience store for disinfectant wipes, scrubbing every inch of the table three times. Only then did Ethan deign to sit.

"I ordered their specialties. Want anything else?"

He sipped from the cup she'd sterilized with boiling water. "Whatever."

The dishes arrived swiftly. Sophia eagerly picked up a piece of green tea roasted chicken, savoring the aroma.

Noticing Ethan hadn't touched his chopsticks, she nudged. "Try it! It's delicious."
###Chapter 481

Ethan Roscente's brow remained furrowed throughout the meal.

Sophia Lowell noticed his expression and assumed he was about to nitpick. She casually placed a piece of green tea roasted chicken on his plate. "Try it, Mr. Roscente. It's not poisoned."

Only then did his tense features relax slightly.

She then pushed a bowl of stone pot tofu soup toward him. "Pair it with this. The flavors are incredible together."

He took a small bite.

"Well? Isn't it amazing?" Sophia's eyes sparkled with anticipation.

The delicate aroma of green tea bloomed on his tongue. The chicken was crispy outside yet tender inside, while the tofu melted effortlessly, blending perfectly with the rich broth. Two contrasting flavors harmonized in an unexpectedly delightful way.

A flicker of surprise flashed in Ethan's eyes, but the moment they met her hopeful gaze, he schooled his expression into indifference. "Barely passable."

"You're clearly obsessed but still putting on this act. The Oscars owe you a trophy for this performance," Sophia muttered under her breath.

As they prepared to leave the restaurant, two children suddenly darted around the corner, chasing each other recklessly.

They nearly collided with Sophia's abdomen before Ethan swiftly pulled her into his arms. His sharp glare pinned the children in place. "Running wild in public? Are you blind?"

"I'm so sorry! They're just too energetic!" Their mother hurried over to apologize.

Ethan's expression darkened.

The children trembled and hid behind their mother.

Sophia pressed a hand to her chest, steadying her racing heart. She crouched to meet the children at eye level. "Playing like this in public is dangerous. You could hurt yourselves or cause trouble for your parents."

"What's it to you? You're not our teacher—"

The mother immediately scolded them to apologize.

Clearly spoiled, the children stubbornly refused.

Ethan narrowed his eyes, his voice icy. "No apology? Then they belong in juvenile detention."

The children burst into tears.

"S-sorry..." they stammered between sobs.

The mother, visibly embarrassed, dragged them away.

Sophia tried to wriggle free from the arm around her waist. "You can let go now."

Ethan not only kept his hold but tightened it, steering her toward the exit. "No."

Just two words, leaving no room for argument.

Her ears burned. "People are staring..."

"I'm holding the mother of my child. That's perfectly natural."

"Who said I'm—"

"You."

"..."

Absolutely unreasonable.

In the elevator, he cornered her, his gaze intense. "I'll handle our child's discipline. They'll never turn into ill-mannered brats, and you won't have to worry."

Sophia's heart skipped. Instinctively, her hand drifted to her abdomen.

He'd already planned that far ahead...

Upon arriving in Napa Valley, they headed straight for the prime viewing spot.

Endless fields of flowers stretched gloriously under the sunlight, their vibrant waves rippling with the breeze. The air carried a faint floral sweetness. In the distance, the sea merged seamlessly with the sky, creating a breathtaking panorama.

This village, sustained for generations by flower cultivation, should have prospered. Yet due to poor transportation, their blooms struggled to reach markets, leaving the growers trapped in poverty.
###Chapter 482

Sophia scanned the surroundings, her brow furrowed.

"This is more complicated than I expected," she murmured to herself.

Ethan Roscente glanced at her sideways.

Sophia quickly analyzed the situation.

"Building a bridge would destroy the entire flower field. Those graves would have to be relocated too." She paused. "If we detour, we'd have to cross another mountain. Costs would double."

She frowned. "The flower farmers suddenly bringing up ancestral graves? Just a ploy to raise the price."

Ethan scoffed.

"You figured it out. Why waste time coming here?"

"I needed to see for myself."

Seeing her troubled expression, Ethan remained unmoved.

"Anything solvable with money isn't a real problem."

He led her down a shortcut toward the village entrance.

Sophia was surprised by his familiarity with the terrain.

"You've been here before?"

Ethan gazed at the flower fields, instinctively reaching for a cigarette before stopping himself.

"Yes."

As Sophia was about to press further, Zachary Evans's voice interrupted.

"Mr. Roscente. Miss Lowell."

She startled.

"Zachary? When did you get here?"

Zachary smiled politely.

"Just arrived."

In truth, they'd been followed since leaving the university.

He handed over a document.

"All floral supplies for Roscente properties will now be sourced from this village."

Ethan motioned to Sophia.

"Any other issues? Resolve them now."

Sophia gaped.

"That's it? It's settled?"

This was absurdly straightforward.

Zachary explained.

"Long-term contracts are more cost-effective than one-time compensation. Once this becomes a tourist site, profits will double."

Ethan gave her a sidelong look.

"The farmers are smarter than you."

Sophia bristled.

With his resources, she could've devised the same solution—settling land disputes while securing supply chains.

Typical Ethan Roscente.

After resolving the matter, Sophia wanted to sketch the scenery.

Had she known Bianca Savigny would appear, she wouldn't have stayed an extra minute.

Bianca wore a white dress, fresh as jasmine.

Her daisy-braided hair framed a shy smile among the blossoms—picture-perfect innocence.
###Chapter 483

Sunlight spilled over the country lane. Sophia Lowell glanced down at her mud-splattered pant cuffs.

She tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear, only to find bits of grass clinging to her fingertips.

Ethan Roscente's brow furrowed the moment he spotted Bianca Savigny. "What are you doing here?"

Bianca wore a pale pink sundress that swayed with her movements. She pressed her lips into a demure smile. "Don't tease me, Mr. Roscente. This is my hometown." The villagers behind her erupted in approving laughter.

"Our Bianca has really made it, knowing such an important businessman!"
"Now our flower fields will never lack buyers!"
"Who knows? She might even become the lady of the house someday!"

Two pink blooms appeared on Bianca's cheeks, though her eyes glittered with something sharper. She'd been hiding in the village these past days, terrified Ethan would come demanding answers. That morning she'd woken to find the wrong man in her bed—she'd nearly lost her mind.

Now seeing Ethan here filled her with equal parts hope and dread. Then her gaze landed on Sophia standing beside him, and her smile froze.

Sophia stood a few paces away, listening to the villagers fawn over Bianca. She looked down at her wrinkled blouse, speckled with unidentified seeds. Her phone buzzed—Theodore Orlando calling.

"Professor," she answered, her voice tight.

Bianca seized the moment to step closer to Ethan, tilting her face up with practiced innocence. "Mr. Roscente, let me show you the flower fields? The roses are at their peak this season."

The villagers chimed in:
"Yes, let Bianca guide you!"
"She knows every inch of this village!"

Sophia's grip on the phone turned white-knuckled. Theodore's voice murmured through the receiver, but the words dissolved before reaching her. Sunlight caught in her disheveled bun as the makeshift twig hairpin threatened to give way.
###Chapter 484

"Sophia, I heard you went to Napa Valley?"

"Yes. The project needed to be resolved."

Her fingers brushed across the phone screen as Sophia stood at the edge of the flower field. As Luming Architectural Studio's designer, she didn’t need to clock in daily, but she never shirked her responsibilities.

Without a base salary, every project was about survival.

"You reckless girl!" Theodore Orlando's voice sharpened through the phone. "Running around like that while pregnant? Those villagers aren’t easy to deal with!"

Sunlight danced on the petals, scattering tiny sparks of light.

"It’s already handled," she said lightly. "The contract will be signed tomorrow."

"That fast?"

"Ethan Roscente made a deal with the flower farmers..."

She summarized in a few words, deliberately omitting the undercurrents beneath the surface.

A brief silence stretched on the other end.

"He went there for you?"

Sophia’s lips twitched. "You’re overthinking it, Professor. Our project was just a side benefit."

By the time she hung up, she had wandered deep into the flower field without realizing it. Ethan and Bianca Savigny were nowhere in sight, leaving only swaying poppies stretching endlessly before her.

A line of ants marched past her feet.

She nudged the procession with a blade of grass, suddenly amused. Their busy little forms reminded her of herself—constantly scrambling to make ends meet.

"Miss Lowell seems to be enjoying herself."

Bianca’s voice pricked at her from behind.

Sophia rose slowly, brushing grass from her skirt. Not far away, Ethan stood with his back to them, his tall figure half-hidden among the flowers as he took a call.

"Something you need?"

Bianca stepped closer, her perfume clashing with the floral breeze.

"Seeing you here... displeases me."

Clouds drifted over the sun, casting a sudden shadow.

Sophia met her gaze. "Funny. Pleasing you was never my intention."

A gust of wind swept through the field, stirring a crimson wave across the blossoms.
###Chapter 485

Bianca Savigny's face twisted with rage, her eyes flashing viciously. "Didn't you receive the photos? Ethan and I have already slept together."

"Oh?" I adjusted my cuffs idly. "What number were you in line?"

Her fingers trembled with fury, but she swallowed her anger, aware of Ethan Roscente's presence nearby.

"Miss Lowell, you don't know, do you?" She suddenly smirked, pointing toward the distant flower fields. "Napa Valley is my hometown. My brother is buried there—he died saving Ethan."

Following her manicured finger, I gazed at the graves soon to be demolished for the overpass. So that was the story hidden beneath.

"You think he came here for you?" Bianca leaned in, her perfume cloying. "He visits my brother's grave every year. This time, he's even moving it to the best cemetery in Seattle. Know why he bought the village's flower fields? To repay the locals for taking care of me, a martyr's orphan."

A fifteen-year-old girl who'd followed him for a decade—of course she knew him better than I did after just two years.

The mountain breeze brushed my hair, and I finally understood why he knew that winding road so well.

"Miss Savigny, you came all this way to tell me this," I mused, watching the drifting clouds. "What are you afraid of?"

Her face stiffened.

"Let me teach you something." My skirt swished against her stilettos as I turned. "If you want to stay by his side, learn to play deaf and dumb. Someone as impatient as you..." I glimpsed her clenched fists. "...won't last three months."

On the way back, Bianca squeezed into Ethan's passenger seat.

I slid into Zachary Evans' car without hesitation. The black Maybach didn't even pause in the rearview mirror.

"Miss Lowell..." Zachary gripped the steering wheel, hesitating.

I closed my eyes, pretending to sleep, and heard his resigned sigh.

By dusk, we reached my apartment.

"Thanks for the ride, Zachary." I cut off his unspoken words and strode inside without looking back.

My phone buzzed. A message from Ethan: [How long are you going to stand there?]

Glancing up, I saw the curtains flutter on the 21st floor. Clutching my phone, I laughed bitterly.

This bastard never learned to knock.

The elevator numbers climbed. The fingerprint lock beeped, and I was yanked inside before it finished.

"Avoiding me?" Ethan pinned me against the foyer wall, his tie loose around his neck. His scent—foreign perfume mixed with faint tobacco—clung to him.

I turned my face away from his breath. "Shouldn't you be with Bianca?"

His hand gripped my waist, and his cold laugh brushed my ear. "Now you're jealous?"
###Chapter 486

Sophia pushed open the apartment door to complete darkness.

Her fingers fumbled for the light switch.

The moment the lights flickered on, a dark figure yanked her into his arms.

"Ah!" she gasped.

Ethan Roscente lifted her onto the entryway console, his long fingers gripping her chin. "Why are you back so late?"

"Didn't you take Bianca home?" Sophia turned her face away.

The man chuckled low in his throat. "Jealous?"

"No."

"Really?" His breath warmed her ear.

"Ethan," Sophia closed her tired eyes, "I'm exhausted today."

The amusement in his gaze vanished instantly. His thumb traced her neck. "Can't even bother to pretend with me now?"

"That's right." Her reply was crisp.

The air turned glacial.

Ethan's eyes darkened. He suddenly bit down on her collarbone. "Too bad. The more you act like this, the less I want to let you go."

"Are you insane?" Sophia struggled against him. "I visited three hospitals today. All I want is sleep!"

"Your problem." He pinned both her wrists with one hand.

She laughed coldly. "So to you, I'm just a plaything you can summon whenever?"

"If I say yes," his eyes narrowed dangerously, "does that mean I can have you right now?"

Sophia stopped resisting and leaned against the wall. "Then hurry up."

Her resigned expression ignited Ethan's fury.

"Can't rush," he taunted, nipping her earlobe. "You know that."

Her ears burned. "I'm sure Bianca would be happy to accommodate you."

"Still claiming you're not jealous?" He forced her face toward him. "Sophia, you care."

She scoffed, too drained to argue.

Under the dim light, her porcelain skin glowed. Something in Ethan's chest tightened. His voice softened unconsciously. "Sophia..."

Her lashes fluttered against closed eyes.

Just as he leaned in, Sophia's eyes flew open, locking with his fathomless gaze.

Before she could react, his scorching kiss crashed down.

"Mmph—" She tried to knee him, but he used the motion to spread her legs and press her against the wall. The more she fought, the more brutal his kiss became, only releasing her when she went limp.

"Keep playing mute," he wiped the wetness from her lips, "and I'll continue."

Sophia glared at him with reddened eyes—then suddenly swung her hand.

Slap!

The sharp sound echoed through the silent apartment.

The calico cat hiding behind the sofa bristled, its amber eyes wide with alarm.

Ethan turned his head slightly, tongue probing his bleeding lip. His expression was unreadable.
###Chapter 487

Ethan wiped the blood from his lips, his dark eyes fixed on Sophia with a stormy gaze. "Hitting me again?"

She finally snapped out of her daze, her heart skipping a beat. But she stubbornly lifted her chin. "You shouldn’t have kissed me without permission!"

Like a bristling wildcat, her defiant display only made him want to tease her more.

She didn’t know this was exactly what Ethan loved about her—terrified yet pretending to be fierce.

He loosened his tie with deliberate slowness, looking down at her. "How many times have I kissed you without permission before? Did you slap me every time?"

"If you dare try again, I won’t hesitate to do it every single time," she hissed through gritted teeth.

"Stubborn." He chuckled, poking her waist. "You were melting in my arms just moments ago."

"Shut up!" Sophia was so furious she wanted to bite him.

The mood ruined, Ethan finally let her go.

Exhausted, her eyelids heavy, she shoved him away and stormed into the bedroom, locking the door behind her.

"Meow~"

The calico cat circled Ethan’s feet, its tone almost mocking.

Ethan narrowed his eyes. "Just like your owner—ungrateful little thing." He poured cat food into the bowl. "Keep laughing, and I’ll have you neutered tomorrow."

Watching the cat devour its meal, he scoffed. "Never mind. If I actually did it, someone would cry."

And he’d be the one suffering for it.

Sophia slept like the dead, waking to sunlight streaming through the window.

Stretching lazily, she realized it had been ages since she’d slept so soundly.

The room was silent, with no sign of Ethan. She assumed he’d left last night—until she spotted steaming breakfast on the dining table.

Her fingers brushed the bowl of porridge. Still warm.

She pursed her lips. At least he had the decency to leave before she woke.

A week later.

Sophia’s baby bump was impossible to hide now. Fortunately, summer break had started, giving her time to rest.

But staying in Seattle was a bad idea.

She’d realized three days ago that Ethan had assigned a bodyguard to follow her. It happened when her grocery bag tore, and someone appeared out of nowhere to help. Looking up to thank them, she recognized one of Ethan’s men.

Since then, the same face kept appearing everywhere.

"Stop following me, or I’ll call the police," Sophia warned coldly.

The bodyguard stood stiffly. "Apologies, Miss Lowell. Mr. Roscente ordered us to ensure your safety."

"I don’t need this kind of protection."

"My orders are non-negotiable."

"You’re making me uncomfortable."

"I’ll be more discreet."

"But I’ve already noticed you."

"That’s my failure."

Sophia massaged her temples. "Do you only know how to apologize?"

"Apologies, Miss Lowell."

"..."

Realizing it was pointless, Sophia gave up.
###Chapter 488

Sophia clenched the hem of her blouse. The bodyguard had been tailing her for three days straight. If this continued, he'd inevitably discover her pregnancy. Worse still, the constant surveillance made her skin crawl.

She had to confront Ethan Roscente.

The phone rang endlessly as she counted each tone. Just as she was about to hang up, his lazy voice dripped through the receiver. "What an unexpected call, Miss Lowell."

"We need to talk."

"That depends on the topic." His chuckle was infuriating. "If you're missing me, I'm free right now."

She bit her lower lip. The man was incorrigible.

"About that bodyguard—"

The line went dead.

Sophia hurled her phone onto the couch.

At dusk, knuckles rapped against her door. Peering through the peephole at the persistent guard, she yanked it open.

"Mr. Roscente requests your presence."

"Who does he think he is?" she scoffed.

Learning Ethan was in Seattle gave her pause. She changed into a flowy dress that concealed her bump.

The car stopped before an upscale restaurant. Sophia frowned at the neon sign—the most exclusive couples' venue in town.

"You're sure he's here?"

The guard nodded silently.

Pushing through the doors, her breath caught. The entire space had transformed into a sea of weeping jasmine blossoms, candlelight flickering between petals. A piano melody floated from the corner.

"Surprised?"

Ethan materialized behind her. She startled backward, only for his hand to steady her waist.

"Have you lost your mind?" She twisted free.

Instead of answering, he offered a jasmine bouquet. "Happy anniversary."

Sophia froze. She'd forgotten the date entirely.

"Do you like it?" His fingers brushed stray hairs behind her ear.

Candlelight sculpted his sharp features, mirroring their first meeting years ago. Dizziness washed over her. She gripped the nearest chairback.

"Are you unwell?" His gaze sharpened.

She evaded his reaching hand. "Call off your watchdog first."

Ethan's eyes darkened. "So that's what this is about?"

The piano's melody twisted abruptly—an ominous shift in the air.
###Chapter 489

Sophia wrinkled her nose in distaste. "This setup looks like a funeral parlor."

Ethan's expression darkened instantly. "Since when do funeral parlors use red candles?"

"That's what makes it creepy."

"..."

A vein throbbed at Ethan's temple. "Sophia, I must have been out of my mind to plan a surprise for you."

This woman had zero appreciation for romance.

His carefully arranged candlelit dinner was completely wasted.

Damn Zachary and his terrible single-guy advice.

After the waitstaff cleared the decorations, Ethan finally noticed Sophia's outfit as she took her seat. His pupils constricted sharply. "This is what you wear to a date?"

Sophia glanced down at her loose sundress. "Problem?"

"It's practically a nightgown!" Flames of anger flickered in his eyes. "Any woman would dress up for someone she cares about. But you? You deliberately wore this to provoke me?"

Sophia scoffed. "Only if that someone is worth dressing up for."

Ethan's face changed. "Then who is worth it for you?"

She leisurely cut into her steak. "That's not a question your surveillance team has the right to ask."

His brows knitted tightly. "They're bodyguards, not spies."

"I don't need them."

"Forgotten about last time you got hurt already?"

Sophia's face remained impassive. "Turns out I'm safer when you're not around."

"Are you saying I'm the danger?"

"Aren't you?"

"..."

Ethan's expression turned stormy.

Watching him seethe, Sophia cheerfully polished off her steak.

The restaurant really was excellent.

She continued devouring her meal, utterly ignoring the man across from her.

Ethan slammed his cutlery down with a sharp clang. "Keep eating like that and you'll balloon into a whale."

Pregnancy had given Sophia a ravenous appetite. She eyed Ethan's untouched steak. "Not hungry?"

"..."

He swallowed back the word "no" and gritted out, "Too rare."

"Medium-well is perfect."

"I prefer well-done."

"Well-done is like chewing leather."

"My teeth are strong enough."

Sophia muttered under her breath, "Like a dog with a bone."

"What did you say?"

She dabbed her lips primly. "So you're not calling off the bodyguards?"

"No."

"Fine."

She nodded. "I'll file a police report tomorrow about suspicious stalkers."

Ethan laughed bitterly. "Sophia, you're ruthless."

"Better than being controlled."

Sophia rose to leave.

He grabbed her wrist abruptly. "Where are you going?"

"Restroom."
###Chapter 490

Ethan Roscente watched Sophia Lowell's retreating figure, dark emotions swirling in his eyes. Why was she so resistant to having a bodyguard? The question gnawed at him.

The second-floor restroom was under renovation, forcing Sophia to go downstairs.

After exiting, she lingered by the hallway vent. The breeze tousled her hair as she gazed at the endless stream of cars outside, lost in thought.

It would be a lie to say she wasn't moved. What woman could resist Ethan's meticulously crafted romantic gestures? Especially when he was the man she'd once loved deeply.

For two years, she'd fantasized about such moments. But as a secret lover, those dreams had to stay buried.

Now that she'd finally woken up, he kept reappearing, stirring up her emotions.

Ethan Roscente, you're truly despicable.

Sophia gently touched her abdomen, resolve hardening in her eyes.

"Junior?"

A familiar voice made her stiffen. Turning, she saw Sebastian Valdemar approaching with his usual gentle smile.

"Sebastian?" Her eyes widened in surprise.

This was a couples' restaurant. Why was he here? Only a week had passed since their awkward phone call, yet it felt like a lifetime.

"A friend dragged me here for a blind date," he explained with a helpless shrug. "But she stood me up. Ended up being two men sharing a romantic set meal."

Sophia couldn't help but laugh.

"And you?" Sebastian's gaze turned concerned. "Here with Ethan?"

She looked out the window, her voice distant. "Yes."

His brow furrowed. "Did he give you trouble again?"

"Not exactly." She shook her head. "It's just... unpleasant."

"How much longer will you put up with this?" Sebastian's tone grew urgent. "He's not right for you. The more this drags on, the more you'll get hurt. And now that you're preg—"

He cut himself off with a sigh. "You can't hide this forever. Unless you're willing to accept him having a fiancée while—"

"I know." Sophia interrupted him. "If he still won't let go, then I'll take the child and—"

Her words died abruptly.

At the end of the hallway, Ethan stood watching them. His tailored suit accentuated his tall frame, the white shirt hinting at his lean waistline. Passing women stole glances, admiration clear in their eyes.

He stood there like an unsheathed blade.
###Chapter 491
Ethan Roscente's arrival struck the restaurant like a thunderbolt.

He stood at the entrance, his tall frame accentuated by the black trench coat. His stormy eyes darkened with barely contained fury, locking onto Sophia Lowell with predatory intensity.

Sophia's fingers trembled, nearly dropping her coffee cup.

She knew that look too well—the same possessive glare Ethan wore whenever jealousy consumed him, like he'd caught her in bed with another man.

Sebastian Valdemar noticed the tension and turned to meet Ethan's gaze. With deliberate calm, he shifted to shield Sophia behind him.

"Mr. Roscente. What a coincidence."

Ethan's lips curled into a frosty smile. "Professor Valdemar. Like a fly to honey, aren't you? Can't seem to avoid you anywhere."

"Law professors frequent courthouses," Sebastian adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses. "Though I'm surprised to see the busy CEO slumming it in this humble establishment."

The air turned glacial.

Sophia saw Ethan's knuckles whiten. She stood abruptly. "Sebastian, I should get back to the firm."

"Let me drive you—" Sebastian reached for his coat, but Ethan was already there, gripping Sophia's wrist.

"Am I invisible?" His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper, each word gritted between clenched teeth.

Sophia tugged uselessly against his iron grip. She lifted her chin defiantly. "Are you detaining me now, Mr. Roscente?"

His eyes darkened.

Suddenly he leaned in, hot breath scorching her ear. "You weren't complaining about your freedom when you begged me in bed last night."

A flush burned up Sophia's neck.

Sebastian stepped forward, but froze under Ethan's warning glare.

"Professor," Ethan traced the red marks on Sophia's wrist, "I hear your father's bidding on the East District land?"

Sebastian's expression tightened.

"Let's go." Ethan dragged Sophia toward the exit, pausing only to deliver his parting shot: "If I catch you near her again, that land will become your family's burial plot."

The car door slammed.

Before Sophia could brace herself, Ethan pinned her against the leather seat. His fingers dug into her chin. "Three days apart and you've grown bold."

"It was just—"

"Coincidence?" His laugh was razor-sharp. "Coincidentally at a couples' restaurant? Coincidentally in the lovers' booth?"

Only then did Sophia notice the pairs surrounding them, the roses on every table glaringly obvious.

"I didn't know—"

Ethan nipped her earlobe. "Tonight, I'll remind you exactly who owns you."
###Chapter 492

"Go ahead. Try me."

"I will."

"..."

Sophia's chest tightened with suffocating frustration. Her nails dug crescent moons into her palms.

"You're being unreasonable."

Ethan Roscente's lips curled into a cold smirk. "My rules are absolute."

Her gaze turned glacial. "You always resort to intimidation."

"You started this." His eyes darkened like gathering storm clouds. "After everything I've done for you, you run to another man? What am I to you, Sophia?"

"That's not—"

"You'd rather I disappeared."

"Liar!" Her voice trembled. "You're the one twisting facts."

"Me?" His stare could flay skin. "When you complained to Sebastian about how I mistreat you, was that twisting facts too?"

A familiar ache bloomed in her ribs. Their arguments always followed this destructive script.

Perhaps their meeting had been a cosmic mistake.

"Was he wrong?" Her eyes glistened. "Forcing me into things I hate. Humiliating me for Isabella's sake. Having your guards stalk me—aren't these the gifts you've given me?"

"That was protection!" Veins stood out on his temples. "And don't drag Isabella into this."

A tearful laugh escaped her. "Right. A secret lover like me shouldn't mention your future Mrs. Roscente."

His expression turned murderous. "Say that again and get out."

"Gladly."

She sank her teeth into his wrist.

Ethan recoiled with a hiss.

Sophia wrenched free and fled toward the door.

Blood welled from the bite mark on his hand. Watching her retreating figure, he roared, "Walk out that door, and don't expect to return!"

The slam of the door was her only reply.

CRACK!

His fist shattered the floor-to-ceiling window. Shards rained down as crimson droplets bloomed across the marble tiles.

——

The night air carried a chill.

Sophia wandered aimlessly under streetlights that stretched her shadow into a lonely ribbon.

Everywhere, life mocked her—couples holding hands, young parents with strollers, elderly neighbors exchanging greetings. Each happy scene pierced her heart.

Two years of suppressed anguish erupted. She crumpled onto a bench, hugging her knees as sobs wracked her body.

"Sophia?"

A black sedan pulled over. Sebastian Valdemar emerged, his brow furrowed.

She hastily wiped her face, only to meet his concerned gaze.

"Sebastian..." Her voice broke.

He draped his coat over her shaking shoulders. "Where's Ethan? He just abandoned you here?"
###Chapter 493

Sophia Lowell forced a smile. "I shook him off and ran out."

Sebastian Valdemar's Adam's apple bobbed as guilt clouded his eyes. "I'm sorry for causing you trouble."

She blinked. "What does this have to do with you? Ethan Roscente is the unreasonable one."

His gaze lingered on her swollen eyes. His chest tightened as if crushed by boulders. "You've been crying."

Sophia managed a weak smile, fingers unconsciously twisting the hem of her shirt.

She refused to show vulnerability in front of others.

"My emotions got the better of me. I'm fine now."

Sebastian studied her reddened eyelids but didn't call out her pretense. "Let me drive you home."

Sophia waved her phone. "I'll call a ride."

"Taxis are scarce here." He glanced at the ominous sky. "If not for yourself, think of the baby."

Her hand instinctively cradled her abdomen. After a hesitation, she finally nodded. "Thank you."

The car door clicked shut.

Not far away, knuckles cracked audibly inside a black sedan.

The driver shivered, stealing a glance at the rearview mirror.

Ethan Roscente's dark eyes burned into the vehicle ahead.

"Sir, should we follow?"

"Keep tailing them." His voice dripped ice. "I want to see where they're going."

Tires rolled over damp pavement. The cabin was so quiet their breathing echoed.

Only when turning onto her street did Sophia break the silence.

"Sebastian...do you think I'm pathetic?" Her voice cracked. "Even though he's getting married, I still..."

His grip tightened on the steering wheel.

"Don't say that." His tone softened. "Ethan's the one who won't let go."

Her nails dug into her palms.

"But I initiated it." A bitter laugh escaped her. "In that kind of relationship..."

"You knew each other before, didn't you?" Sebastian suddenly asked.

Sophia's breath hitched.

"How did you know?"

As the car glided into the complex, his profile looked especially gentle under streetlights.

"The way you look at him is different." He spoke softly. "Our first meeting was actually in Seattle."

Sophia turned sharply.

"That summer, you came to my house with your mother." Nostalgia flickered in his eyes. "You were spacing out in the yard while I watched from the second-floor window."

Her pupils dilated.

"You wore a white sundress and smiled up at me." His voice lowered. "It was a forced smile, but...memorable."

Raindrops began pattering against the windows, blurring the neon lights outside.
###Chapter 494
The car came to a gentle stop under the dim streetlights. The glow from the lampposts filtered through the window, casting a pale hue on Sophia's face.

"I'm sorry, I really can't remember." She bit her lip, fingers unconsciously twisting the hem of her blouse.

Sebastian chuckled softly, his warm gaze resting on her. "You were standing in the hospital corridor back then, so small, with eyes red like a rabbit."

His quiet words sent a tremor through Sophia's heart.

"When you fainted in my arms, I finally understood." He paused. "Some people really can make time stand still at first sight."

Sophia's head jerked up, meeting his deep, soulful eyes.

Their first meeting at seventeen. Two years of tangled emotions. A self-deprecating smile curved her lips. "I was too greedy, reaching for something that was never mine."

The air in the car grew heavy.

Sebastian leaned forward suddenly, his warm hand covering her icy fingers. "Loving someone is never wrong." His thumb gently stroked her knuckles. "The wrong belongs to those who don't know how to cherish it."

A tear escaped Sophia's control, splashing onto their joined hands.

"Cry if you need to." He offered a tissue, his voice impossibly gentle. "You're only twenty-two. This should be the age when someone treasures you."

His words turned a key in the lock around her heart.

"Thank you." She accepted the tissue with a shaky hand, only to find his burning gaze when she looked up.

Sebastian's expression turned serious. "Sophia, let me take care of you."

Her breath caught.

"This isn't pity." His eyes held hers unflinchingly. "From the moment we met again at the hospital, I knew there was no escape."

Her nails dug into her palms.

"Ethan Roscente... that chapter needs to end." His voice darkened. "And the baby deserves a father who can claim them openly."

The words struck like thunder.

Sophia's pupils contracted as his lips formed the next sentence: "Marry me. It's the best solution."

Outside, the night wind hurled fallen leaves against the window—a perfect echo of her suddenly racing heartbeat.
###Chapter 495

Ethan Roscente was too proud and arrogant. If he discovered she was carrying another man's child, his fury would be catastrophic.

She knew him too well.

That man never forgot a slight. He would never tolerate such humiliation.

But should she use Sebastian Valdemar to escape Ethan?

Sophia Lowell clenched her fists.

Her nails dug deep into her palms.

She couldn't do this.

Sebastian had no idea how ruthless Ethan could be.

Vivian Ashcroft had nearly lost her acting career because of her. She couldn't drag anyone else into this mess.

"No." She shook her head vehemently. "It's too dangerous."

Sebastian studied her shifting expressions, his voice gentle. "Sophia, I'm doing this willingly."

"No!" Her refusal was absolute. "I won't allow it."

She reached for the car door.

His fingers lightly encircled her wrist.

"At least tell me why," he murmured, a wounded note in his voice.

Sophia lowered her lashes.

She didn't want this debt of gratitude.

Nor could she bear to betray his sincerity.

"I'm sorry..."

"Is it because I have feelings for you?" He asked bluntly.

The tips of her ears burned.

Her pulse spiked.

She turned her face away in fluster.

Sebastian released her with a soft sigh. "My feelings are my own. You don't owe me anything."

"Sebastian..."

The words stuck in her throat.

He tactfully changed the subject. "Let me take you home."

Night deepened.

He circled to the passenger side and opened the door with gentlemanly grace.

As Sophia stepped out, her foot slipped.

"Careful!"

Warm hands steadied her.

"I think I twisted my ankle," she winced.

Sebastian knelt, examining it carefully. "No swelling. It shouldn't be serious."

She hastily withdrew her foot.

"I can walk."

"You're pregnant. Let me escort you upstairs."

Streetlights stretched their shadows long across the pavement.

Not far away.

A black Maybach idled beneath the trees.

The window was half-lowered.

The cigarette between Ethan Roscente's fingers had burned to the filter.

His icy gaze tracked the intimate pair.

A tempest raged in his eyes.
###Chapter 496

The night was ink-black. Ethan Roscente stood beside his black Maybach, his knuckles white with tension. Not far away, inside a white Porsche, Sebastian Valdemar’s fingers brushed through Sophia Lowell’s hair—the gentle motion stung like salt in a wound.

"Sir, should we approach?" the driver asked cautiously.

A storm of violence churned in Ethan’s eyes, his jaw clenched tight. He watched as Sebastian’s hand slid from Sophia’s shoulder to her cheek before the two embraced and disappeared into the apartment building.

Inside the elevator, Sophia steadied herself against the wall. Sebastian hovered a hand near her waist, his brow furrowed. "Are you sure you don’t want me to walk you up?"

"No need," she murmured as the doors slid open. "You should get some rest, Seb—"

A dark figure lunged at them with brutal force. Sebastian took a fist to the face, his body slamming against the wall. Blood trickled from his split lip.

"Ethan!" Sophia screamed, stumbling back as a sharp pain lanced through her abdomen. She collapsed, curling into herself as cold sweat drenched her skin.

Sebastian struggled to rise, but two black-suited bodyguards pinned him down. Ethan hauled Sophia against his chest, fingers digging into her chin. His voice was glacial. "Flirting with another man right in front of me?"

"You’re insane!" She trembled but shoved at him. "He was just seeing me home!"

Sebastian spat blood, his gaze sharp. "Let her go, Roscente."

"My woman isn’t your concern." Ethan smirked before driving his knee into Sebastian’s leg. The sickening crack of bone echoed through the elevator.

Sophia’s pupils shrank. Her nails bit into Ethan’s arm. "Stop! You’ll ruin his career!"

Deaf to her pleas, Ethan snapped his fingers. The bodyguards forced Sebastian to his knees, wrenching his arms behind his back.

"Break his right hand," Ethan ordered casually.

"No—!" Sophia’s scream tore from her throat. A cramp twisted through her stomach, darkness crowding her vision. "Ethan, I’m begging you… He’s a surgeon!"

Ethan gripped the nape of her neck, forcing her to watch. "See what happens to men who touch you."

The bodyguard raised a steel rod. Sophia thrashed violently, sinking her teeth into Ethan’s wrist. He recoiled, and she scrambled toward Sebastian. "Run!"

Ethan’s eyes burned crimson. He yanked her back by her hair. "You bit me… for him?"

Tears blurred her vision as she looked up. Then she felt it—warm liquid trickling down her thighs. Crimson streaked her legs, blooming across the tiles like grotesque flowers.

"The baby…" Her voice shattered as she clutched her stomach. "Our baby…"

Ethan’s hand froze mid-air. His face drained of color.
###Chapter 497

"Stop!" Sophia's voice sliced through the air.

She saw the madness in Ethan's eyes, her nails digging into her palms. "I'll give you anything. Just don't hurt him—"

Sebastian was pinned to the ground, the glint of the Swiss Army Knife blinding her.

"Kiss me," Ethan demanded suddenly.

Sophia's pupils contracted.

His thumb dragged across her trembling lips. "I thought you said you'd do anything?"

The bodyguard pressed the blade against Sebastian's wrist.

Sophia rose onto her toes.

The kiss tasted like blood. Ethan gripped her waist, his voice icy. "You'd throw away your dignity for him?"

She swallowed the salt of her own tears.

Then Ethan took control, kissing her until she gasped for air. He only released her when her legs buckled.

"Get out." He kicked over the coffee table. Glass shards grazed Sebastian's temple.

As she was dragged away, a sharp pain tore through her abdomen. Six months pregnant—her back was drenched in cold sweat.

"Slow down..." She doubled over in agony.

Ethan sneered. "Still acting? Weren't you just playing the devoted lover?"

The elevator numbers climbed.

Sophia realized with dread—they were heading to the rooftop. Moonlight through the glass walls made Ethan's profile look demonic.

"Where are you taking me?" Her voice shook.

He wound his tie around her wrists. "To show you the price of betrayal."

The rooftop wind howled. Sophia shielded her belly as she stepped back, her heel catching in a drain.

Ethan froze.

Under the moonlight, the blood seeping through her skirt was unmistakable.
###Chapter 498

The abandoned apartment building loomed ominously, its peeling walls and musty stairwell reeking of decay.

Legend had it that every year during college entrance exams, heartbroken students would leap to their deaths from its heights. Over time, it became infamous as a cursed place.

Ethan Roscente carried Sophia Lowell effortlessly up five flights of stairs, his steps unnervingly steady.

"Are you insane? This is illegal!" Sophia struggled violently against him.

A cold smirk twisted his lips, his eyes dark with fury. "Illegal? Let me show you what real lawlessness looks like."

Her stomach clenched. She dug her nails into her palms.

The howling wind on the rooftop made her realize his intentions. With no surveillance cameras, a fatal push would leave no evidence—

"Ethan!" Her voice trembled. "You can't—"

He abruptly turned into the hallway, producing a key to unlock a rusted iron door.

"You... own an apartment here?" Her eyes widened in disbelief.

Ethan flung her onto the bedroom mattress. The bedframe groaned under their combined weight as he pinned her down.

"Figured it out now?" His scorching breath seared her ear.

Tears spilled as Sophia cradled her swollen belly. "I was wrong... Please don't—"

"Spare me the act." He shackled her wrists with one hand. "Where was this fear when you pulled a knife on me?"

The metallic clink of his belt buckle echoed through the silent room.

"Did you enjoy bringing that man into our home?" He bit her earlobe. "Let's make this even more memorable."

Suddenly, the steel door shuddered under violent pounding.

"Get lost!" Ethan roared.

Sebastian Valdemar's voice cut through. "Sophia! Are you in there?"

Seizing the distraction, Sophia staggered into the bathroom. The mirror reflected her ghostly pallor. The bloodstains on her skirt made her entire body shake.

"Sophia!" Sebastian kicked open the locked door, his temple bleeding. "Police are coming. I'm getting you out."

Her legs gave way. A knife-like pain twisted through her abdomen. "The baby... Save the baby—"

He scooped her up, brushing past arriving officers in the stairwell. Amidst the wailing sirens, her last glimpse was of Ethan pressed against the wall by police—his crimson eyes still burning into her.
###Chapter 499

Sophia curled up in the passenger seat, her slender fingers pressing desperately against her abdomen.

Her lips had lost all color, turning ghostly pale. Beads of cold sweat dotted her forehead.

Ethan's grip on the steering wheel turned his knuckles white as he floored the accelerator.

"Hold on just a little longer. We're almost at the hospital."

A black sedan suddenly swerved around the corner, blocking the road.

The screech of brakes tore through the night.

The car door was yanked open violently. Ethan stood silhouetted against the light, his presence radiating terrifying intensity.

"Get out."

His voice was ice-cold.

Sophia shuddered, her nails digging deep into her palms.

"Don't be afraid," Sebastian murmured under his breath. "I'll ram through them."

She shook her head weakly and pushed the door open with trembling hands.

Ethan seized her chin, his grip crushing.

"Having fun?" Rage simmered in his eyes. "Teaming up with your old flame to make a fool of me?"

The pain left her speechless. Darkness flickered at the edges of her vision.

Sebastian lunged forward and grabbed Ethan's wrist. "I was the one who took her—"

"Shut up!" Ethan flung him aside effortlessly and scooped Sophia into his arms. "We'll settle this later."

The engine roared like a beast.

Sophia lay curled on the seat, her back drenched in sweat.

"It hurts..."

Her voice was barely a whisper as her fingers clutched at Ethan's sleeve.

"Cut the act," he sneered. "You think I'll fall for the same trick twice?"

The car jerked violently.

Sophia suddenly doubled over with a whimper.

"The hospital... please..."

Ethan glanced at her ashen face. His chest tightened inexplicably.

The brakes screeched again.

"What the hell are you—"

His words died in his throat.

His pupils contracted sharply, locked onto the bloodstain spreading across her skirt.

"This is..."

Sophia's hands trembled against his collar. "The baby... our baby..."

Tears mixed with sweat streamed down her face. "When I fell earlier..."

Ethan's blood turned to ice.

A deafening buzz filled his ears, as if a swarm of bees had erupted inside his skull.

"What... did you say?"
###Chapter 500

Agony like a soul being torn apart consumed Sophia's entire body as her consciousness began to fade.

Was she dying?

Through the haze, she thought she saw Ethan Roscente's usually cold, composed face twisted with panic. His trembling arms held her tight as his hoarse voice repeated in her ear, "Don't you dare leave me."

How ridiculous.

Since when did he care about her?

Sophia, are you still dreaming?

The blinding emergency lights flickered on.

When her awareness returned slightly, Sophia saw doctors bustling around her.

A middle-aged female doctor noticed she was awake and gently took her hand. "Don't be afraid. The baby is safe. We'll protect you both."

That soothing voice miraculously eased her terror.

With difficulty, Sophia whispered, "If anyone asks... tell them I'm less than five months along."

The doctor frowned. "Why?"

"My fiancé... has violent tendencies." Sophia's voice was weak. "If he finds out the child isn't his..."

The doctor gave her a complicated look.

"Please..." Sophia clutched the doctor's hand desperately.

Finally, the doctor sighed. "I promise."

"Thank you..."

With a relieved smile, Sophia slipped back into darkness.

Outside the ER, Ethan leaned against the wall, his face ashen under the harsh fluorescent lights.

"I'm pregnant, Ethan... I'm carrying your child..."

Those words echoed endlessly in his mind.

He was going to be a father.

And he had almost killed his own child.

"Mr. Roscente!"

Zachary Evans rushed forward to steady Ethan as he staggered.

"Sophia's pregnant," Ethan rasped.

Zachary froze. "Congratulations, sir..."

"Congratulations?" Ethan let out a bitter laugh and stepped back. "I almost—"

The doctor's words—"we might not be able to save it"—made his world spin.

"She'll be fine," Zachary said firmly.

"Yes. She'll be fine." Ethan repeated it like a drowning man clinging to driftwood.

This level of vulnerability had never been seen in the ruthless Ethan Roscente.

"Family of Sophia Lowell?"

The ER doors opened, and the doctor emerged.

"Mother and child are stable, but she needs complete bed rest." The doctor's tone was stern. "No more stress."

The tension in Ethan's shoulders finally eased. "Where is she now?"

The doctor studied his refined, aristocratic appearance, struggling to reconcile it with the image of an abuser.

"Still unconscious. She'll wake in about two hours."

Once the doctor left, Zachary beamed. "Congratulations, sir!"

"Lock this down." Ethan's gaze sharpened. "No leaks."

Zachary understood immediately—if the old Mr. Roscente found out, Sophia's true identity would be exposed.

......

When the hospital bed was wheeled out, Ethan strode forward.

Sophia's pale face sent a knife through his heart. Her weak voice echoed in his ears again:

"Ethan... I'm pregnant..."
