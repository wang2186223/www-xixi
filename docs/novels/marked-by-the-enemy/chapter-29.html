                <p>&#34;Beep!&#34; &#34;Beep!&#34; The clock blows off in my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, in a confused state of mind, my eyes remained closed for a few seconds, although I was awake. Then when my phone finally had mercy on me and my alarm stopped ringing, I raised my eyelids and stared at it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had two more hours before my first class according to the time on my phone screen. So I got down from my bed, flickering my toes when they touched the cold tiles and chill ran through my foot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly the echo of a soft knock drew my attention to the doorway and mumbled, &#34;Come in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few seconds later, Nero walked into the room, gazed at me, and said, &#34;Come down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For what?&#34; I mumbled, trying to guess from his expression what this was about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nero turned away and walked out of the room, getting me frustrated at such an early morning hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyed, I walked after him, heading downstairs and out of the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, he stopped, and I stood beside him, staring at the black jeep in front of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You got a new car?&#34; I mumbled, looking at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s yours,&#34; Nero casually uttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swaying my gaze away from him, I looked at the car, and then back at him before staring at the Jeep and taking another look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? You can&#39;t drive?&#34; Nero asked, still using a casual tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you buy me a car?&#34; I mumbled, still struggling to process my emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you won&#39;t get into shady vehicles and get into another shitty crisis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That looks expensive. I&#39;m not driving that to school!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you can drive?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s the twenty century, people get their license at sixteen. But that&#39;s not the point! You can&#39;t have me&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaving me talking, Nero walked away, heading back into the house, and shut the door behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence was annoying as I stood there, glaring at the door, wondering why he was so freaking complicated to understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got inside the villa, I met him in the dining room and relaxed at the table as he looked at me with a calm expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t expect me to ride a car worth thousands of dollars without raising people&#39;s brows, Nero. What were you thinking, getting me something that expensive?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was thinking, oh if Blake had her car, she would stay out of trouble and not get kidnapped again since we haven&#39;t figured out who was behind yesterday,&#34; Nero said, looking slightly irritated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You make it sound like it&#39;s my fault that I got kidnapped!&#34; I mumbled in annoyance. &#34;Also, I know yesterday happened because of Karen!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She threatened me in the hallway before I got kidnapped.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way he was looking at me made it clear that he thought that I was making a stupid assumption, and I knew I will just be wasting my words by explaining to him if I tried to explain, so I turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you going?&#34; Nero shouted after me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To find clothes for school, and thanks for the car. But I&#39;m not driving such a burden to school!&#34; I shouted back without stopping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Also, I&#39;m dropping your class today, just so you know!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After I got to my room, I chuckled when I heard Nero mumble, &#34;Stubborn brat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were only a few more days left for him being my Alpha, and I have been feeling nervous that I was about to lose him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Nero claimed Luna that means I have only Loki to rely on, and even though I despise him and wanted to leave the state after Nero and I are unbound, I couldn&#39;t because of my mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing that she was alive had changed so much, and I wanted to meet her at least once to ask her what the heck was she thinking, leaving me with Loki and if she hates me too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By eight-thirty, Jason and I arrived on my campus, and even though he too had tried to talk me into driving the jeep, we ended up using an Uber to get here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The class was already half full, and Jason and I walked past Nero, headed to the back of the class, and took our seats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By nine on the dot, Karen walked into the class with her followers, and I felt an intense rage awake inside of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, she locked eyes with me and smirked before walking up to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get your ass up,&#34; Karen said pointedly. &#34;I want to sit here. You too, beta!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss, Noble!&#34; Nero called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My gaze swayed towards him, and he looked a bit tense as he stared into my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake,&#34; Nero whispered. &#34; Don&#39;t,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling my eyes off him, I looked at the stupid smirk on Karen&#39;s face, and flashes of memories from her past insult to me started running through my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rage that was consuming me only seemed to grow intense when I heard her chuckle and mumble, &#34;Is your ass stuck? Or do you need an assistant in getting up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it fun picking on someone weaker than you? Does your sick mind love to trample on others for the sake of your stupid excitement?&#34; I mumbled, looking into her blue eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Noble, I advise you back the fuck up and get out now!&#34; Nero mumbled, sounding angry and looking worried at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking back at Nero, Karen sneered and shouted, &#34;Can you stay out of this!!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she looked back at me, her eyes darkened with hate, and she harshly uttered, &#34;Get your ass up, Blake!!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping my gaze on her, I stood to my feet, and before I realized it, my wolf was in control. I</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within haste, I had spun Karen around, twisted her hands behind her back, and locked her wrists in my grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to break free as she growled, but my fingers clawed into her hair and yanked it, only to end up with a bunch of loose hair in my hand, and I gazed at the bald spot on her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A scream escaped Karen&#39;s lips, and I heard Nero call out, &#34;Blake, you need to stop!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring his voice, my grip on Karen&#39;s hand got tighter as my nail shifted into claws, penetrating her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my! Blake stop! You are hurting her! She&#39;s bleeding!&#34; One of her followers screamed, yet none of them dared to approach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, a growl slipped from Karen&#39;s lips, and I pushed her head on my desk, pressing her down by her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake, calm down,&#34; Jason whispered, and I darted my eyes towards him as I felt my claw sink into the skin of her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Viciously pressing Karen&#39;s head flat against the desk surface, I forcefully pulled her hand upward, causing her to scream in pain when a bone popped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake!&#34; Nero shouted with dominance in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Playing deaf ear to his word, I leaned closer to Karen&#39;s ear and whispered, &#34;You don&#39;t know half of the shit I&#39;m capable of doing to you right now and so stop pushing your luck!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I felt my rage subsiding a bit, I released her neck and said, &#34;If I find out that you were behind me getting kidnapped yesterday, I&#39;m coming back for you, and next time, I would stop my nails halfway in your skin!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took a moment, then my anger finally calmed down, and I gained back control of myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second that I let go of Karen, she dropped to the floor, clutching onto her neck and coughing excessively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When our eyes locked, it was the first time I have seen raw fear in her eyes as she mumbled, &#34;I didn&#39;t ask some-one to kidnap you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way she looked at me and her voice, I felt some sense of honesty from her, and it left me in a predicament.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get her to the infirmary,&#34; Nero said, and I looked back at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet my mind was a bit messed up about if Karen wasn&#39;t the one behind the kidnapping, then who could it be. In less than a second, I was left with two people&#39;s names, Luna and Loretta.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that I was in control again, the blood on the floor, and Karen&#39;s bloodstained neck, and wrists made me a bit weird out as her followers helped her to her feet, escorting her out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The look on the faces of the other students as they stared at me made the entire situation a bit awkward, and I looked the other way only to meet Nero&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was the one who bullied me first,&#34; I whispered under my breath, pouting at me as he slightly shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Class dismiss!&#34; Nero said out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he walked out of the class, and my gaze followed him, wondering what he was so pissed about when Karen was the one who started all of this.</p>
