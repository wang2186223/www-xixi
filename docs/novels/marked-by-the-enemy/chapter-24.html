                <p>The thought of skipping a class wasn&#39;t something I thought to be doing. But the less of Nero that I see, the more quickly I could forget about him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last night was the worst, and this morning was even more terrible. Jason had not spoken a word to me, and I did the same because I felt ashamed that I used him at the party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Also, he and Nero weren&#39;t speaking to each other either, and I feel like it has something to do with me. But then again, it could be more than that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake!&#34; I heard the instructor call out my name, and I slowly raised my eyelid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring his call, I kept my head on the desk and shut my eyes, feeling tired to go through this with him since this wasn&#39;t my first class under him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing?! Wake her up?!&#34; Mr. Graham shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I heard the omega seated beside me mumble, &#34;Hey, you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, I was even more pissed and decided to act on my anger by being stubborn and not raising my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispering arose in the room, but I didn&#39;t care because their stupid remarks were only making me bitter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But suddenly, I felt a manly hand rest on my neck and heard Jason&#39;s voice, &#34;Blake,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, I had to fake asleep because I felt a bit embarrassed to let him figure out that I was faking it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wake up,&#34; Jason mumbled, rubbing my neck which felt ticklish and a bit different that made me feel a bit weird.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mmm&#34; I whispered, raising my eyelids to see him staring at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was all his fault that I had my head bent in the first place because he chose to sit right beside me today instead of waiting in the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyed, I raised my head and stared at him, feeling emotionally drained, and my brain became blank from all thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want to share with us the work you did last night that kept you up and is causing you to sleep in my class?&#34; Mr. Graham asked, scowling at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t strange that he was behaving rudely to me. After all, Karen had him and most of the instructors in her purse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was simply sleepy,&#34; I mumbled, resting back in my seat as I focused on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rig-ht, so you choose to treat my class as something irrelevant and not pay attention!&#34; Mr. Graham uttered, raising his voice a bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I was about to speak, Karen suddenly blurted out, &#34;Maybe her mate worked her around the clock last night, and that&#39;s why she is tired. It wouldn&#39;t be strange since she was bold enough to kiss him at the party yesterday.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The semester is still new, so how about you focus on your study, huh, Miss Hayes?&#34;Mr. Graham said, grimacing at me. &#34; You are not the smartest here. Just a little advice before you flunk again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within a second, the class grew loud with noise from all the silly giggling and mumbling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And how about you stop being an ass kisser to Karen and taking every trash she says literally, judging me based on her idiotic remarks!&#34; I loudly uttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, it grew silent as a frown settled on Mr. Graham&#39;s face, and Karen shouted, &#34;You, bitch!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes!&#34; I mumbled, looking directly into her blue eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get the hell out of my class now!&#34; Mr. Graham yelled with his fist clenched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Jason was about to speak, I held his wrist, and he paused, looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or what?&#34; I uttered, swaying my gaze on Mr. Graham. &#34;You are going to do what if I don&#39;t leave? Call Loki? Do it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t push your luck with me, Blake?&#34; Mr. Graham calmly said, yet his eyes burned with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is me pushing my luck! Call Loki! Tell him how you insulted me in a crowded class by calling me, &#39;dumb.&#39; And let&#39;s see who will still have air in their lungs before the day end!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of hesitation crossed Mr. Graham&#39;s face as he stared at me, then at Karen. Then he cleared his throat and said, &#34;Can you at least pay attention for the rest of the lecture?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring his words, I laid my head back on the desk and shut my eyelids as a reward for all the times he embarrassed me, called me names in class, and worst of all, made Loki come on campus so often that I was getting a beating almost every day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, back to the topic in discussion, Werewolf Shifting, and Transformation.&#34; Mr. Graham&#39;s annoying voice echoed in my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the class time was over, I grabbed my bag and walked out of the room, leaving Jason a few steps behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we got to my locker, I angrily unlocked it while listening to the annoying whispers in the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one has seen her wolf yet, and she is suddenly this bold!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe she&#39;s faking it to look tough, so she wouldn&#39;t get bullied and be worth something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slamming my locker door shut, I angrily mumbled beneath my breath, &#34;You guys are so fucking dumb!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hallway got instantly quiet, and I felt a bit calm, even though I could feel others&#39; eyes on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake,&#34; Jason called from behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still enraged, I turned to look him in the eyes and mumbled, &#34;What?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing,&#34; Jason said with a straight face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My tone was harsh, and I regretted it, so I sighed and whispered, &#34;I&#39;m sorry for lashing out at you. It&#39;s just that between what happened now and yes&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; Jason said with a faint smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere between us had changed, and I knew it. But I wasn&#39;t really to have such a talk with him because I was afraid of both ways our conversation could go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got my next class,&#34; I mumbled, darting my eyes away from him. &#34;Maybe you should stop following to sch&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we talk about it later?&#34; Jason suddenly asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at the calmness in his eyes, I paused for a moment before silently nodding as I mumbled, &#34;Sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, a scent caught my attention, and I gaze to the right, screwing my face into a frown as I glared at Karen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I mumbled in annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You keep forgetting your place, and I will have to remind you of it one of these days if you keep acting daring!&#34; Karen said in a peremptory tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more she keeps showing up in my face, the harder it&#39;s getting not to hurt her and use her as an example for everyone. Yet, I couldn&#39;t do it because the Noble was powerful, and if I was to puncture my claws in Karen&#39;s face, I need a good reason to do so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I was about to speak, Jason suddenly laced his fingers with mine and pulled me along with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34; I whispered, following him obediently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we walked past Karen, he eyed me and said, &#34;You have a class to attend. Don&#39;t use those minutes to entertain rubbish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey!!&#34; Karen screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Jason kept walking, and I could do nothing but followed him while holding in my laugh. When we got to my class door and stopped, I looked down at his fingers against mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising my gaze, I stared at his eyes and mumbled, &#34;About last night&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t apologize,&#34; Jason cut me off. &#34;It will hurt if you do because what happened last night meant something to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kiss meant something to him? What was that supposed to mean? Yet, I couldn&#39;t ask because I fear the answer, although the words were on my tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. Then I am not sorry about last night.&#34; I mumbled, smiling softly at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Jason intensely stared at me. Then he let go of my hand and said, &#34;You should go in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not knowing what to say next, I turned away from him and headed into the room, walking to the back of the class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After taking my seat, I was about to rest my head on the desk when my phone buzzed, and I gazed at Nero&#39;s name blinking on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, I didn&#39;t want to answer it. But after his third call, I accepted it and mumbled, &#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The line was silent for a moment. Then he finally uttered, &#34;You missed class today. If you keep up such behavior you are going to have to repeat the cou&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m thinking about dropping your class!&#34; I blurted out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although I wasn&#39;t considering it at all before this moment, after blurting those words out, I was serious about it now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh,&#34; Nero&#39;s voice flowed through my ear, sounding shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. So you don&#39;t need to worry about me and my grades. We will be just fine.&#34; I mumbled, ending the call without waiting to hear if he had something else to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tossing my phone on the desk, a groan slipped from my lips, and I squeezed my fist, realizing that I was caught in the middle of an Alpha and his Beta.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then again, Nero doesn&#39;t have feelings for me, so that just meant it is Jason who</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nope! I shouldn&#39;t be reading too much into things because that is how my heart becomes a mess. For all I know, both of them could be mad at each other over nothing related to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, class, move to page fifty-five.&#34; Mr. Walter said, and I opened my textbook, ignoring all thoughts about Nero and Jason.</p>
