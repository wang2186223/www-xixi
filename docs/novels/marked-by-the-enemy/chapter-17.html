                <p>Which sister I&#39;m bond with</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**********Nero Pov*********</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes are fixed solely on her, studying Blake&#39;s face, hoping that she will look my way so I can see the answers to my dilemmas in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Blake wouldn&#39;t even dare look my way, not even a glimpse, and it was intentional because she darted her gaze everywhere else, but my way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The number of lies that have been told in this room this morning felt annoying to think about. Claiming Luna as my mate and Blake declaring that Jason was her mate</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the heck was she thinking saying something that outrageous. Even if she had to lie, why choose my beta to do so? Was it to hurt me more because I acknowledged her sister in front of her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking about it now, I had no right to be mad at Blake because I started all this. But for some reason, I felt annoyed, frustrated that she made it known to everyone that it was Jason and not me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that only made me understand exactly what she&#39;s going through seeing Luna and me together. If I was truly her mate, then it must be devastating for her to see me with her sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But how was I supposed to know? This stupid curse has blocked all the connections I should have with my mate. Even after marking Blake, I still can&#39;t feel her emotions and read her thoughts as they should be between mates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There should be more, and it is not there. Yet, when I look at her, a part of me wants my mate to somewhat be her. Yet the doubt still tears me into two, making my other half want to focus solely on the mission and forget about Blake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Fang!&#34; I heard Loretta&#39;s voice, and snapped out of my feeling, swaying my gaze toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smiling at me, Loretta met my eyes and then asked, &#34;Luna tells me that you two share a bond?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s not like I didn&#39;t hear the question, but my brain went blank when I heard those words, and I didn&#39;t know how to answer her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My daughter is your mate, right?&#34; Loretta said, keeping the smile, but her eyes gave it away that she was mad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes! Of course, Luna is.&#34; I blurted out when Loki eyed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I unintentionally glanced at Blake, and I saw her hastily wipe her face with the back of her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, I felt someone grab my arm, and I looked down to see Luna, hugging onto my arm as she softly intoned, &#34;Mother, can you stop putting Nero in the spotlight. I need eyes off him and not on him, now that he&#39;s mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that Luna was intensely staring to her left, I followed her gaze, and my sight rested on Karen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahaaa, am I not just the luckiest leader? My daughter is mated to a filthy rich alpha, and my other daughter is not wolfless!&#34; Loki boastfully uttered with a prideful look in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at him, my wolf went wild with rage again, and I felt myself slipping into my alpha state. But I hastily snapped out of it and suppressed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Count your luck days, Loki. Because by my claws, you will draw your last breath. That&#39;s a vow.&#39; I mumbled in my head, swaying my gaze off him to ease my wolf&#39;s anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Babe!&#34; I heard Luna&#39;s voice, and I looked down at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wallowing in a state of confusion, I met her calm eyes and mumbled, &#34;Huh,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the heck! We were now at the cute names-calling stage. How fast does this girl move!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are coming with me to Blake&#39;s &#39;cancellation of exile&#39; ceremony, right?&#34; Luna whispered with a naive smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; I mumbled in uncertainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind and heartfelt screwed up at that moment, and it was like a war was going on in my body that I couldn&#39;t understand, and I felt torn into pieces by my decisions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; Luna mumbled, a sparkle of excitement in her eyes. &#34;We should go shopping together after your class time is over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh look! It&#39;s already over, thankfully!&#34; Karen harshly said as she stood from her seat. &#34;Now, my eyes can stop bleeding from this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After getting ahold of her bag, she walked past Luna and me, throwing me a hard look before walking out of the class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake! You will be there tomorrow, right?&#34; Loki suddenly asked, staring intensely at his daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honey,&#34; Loretta mumbled as she clutched onto Loki&#39;s arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he ignored her cry with his eyes still glued to his daughter and said, &#34;Blake!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will, Loki! I will be there!&#34; Blake spoke with bitter resentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile curved on Loki&#39;s lip, and he shook his head slightly as he mumbled, &#34;Good. See you and and your mate there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he looked at Loretta, took her hands in his, and walked out with the five betas following him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within a matter of seconds, students started leaving the class, and at last, it was just Jason, Blake, Luna, and I in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Babe, we should leave now before the mall gets packed,&#34; Luna mumbled, pouting as she gently tugged on my arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right,&#34; I whispered, swaying my gaze on Blake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Making eye contact with me, she stood still, and although her lips didn&#39;t move, her eyes told me that she hated me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should get to my next class.&#34; Blake finally said, looking away from me as she grabbed her backpack off the chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she looked at Jason and asked, &#34;You coming?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a split second, Jason cast his sight on me before staring back at her and said, &#34;Sure. Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she was about to walk away, Blake caught me staring intensely at her, and she suddenly tripped, only to get caught by Jason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it intentional? Did she do it on purpose to mess with my head? Because if she did, she certainly achieved what she wanted because I was frustrated, watching Jason help her balance on her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Babe!&#34; Luna shouted, and I dragged my gaze towards her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When our eyes locked, she pouted and whispered, &#34;I called you three times, and you didn&#39;t answer!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; I mumbled, my eyes on her, my mind focused on Blake. &#34;Should we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Withdrawing her hands from my arm, Luna laced her fingers mine, and we walked out of the classroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A while later, I drove my car into the parking lot of &#34;Deluxe Edition Mall&#34; and then turned off the engine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t it sweet that we met because of Blake&#39;s exile party, and now, we are shopping as a couple to attend the canceling of her exile party!&#34; Luna cheerily said as she beam at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, it is,&#34; I mumbled, pulling my key out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nero!&#34; Luna called out with a bit of edge in her tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering her brows, she then bit on her lip, keeping silent for a while, and then mumbled, &#34;It&#39;s just that you are not matching my energy. I&#39;m excited and you are not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am happy for us!&#34; I said, pulling a little life in my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The liars felt a bit difficult to do because of how disturbed my mind is, but when Luna pouted, I forced a smile and said, &#34;Honestly, I am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, she leaned towards me, and I watched her lashes shut as her mouth rested on mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling her moist lip brushed against mine, my eyes remained wide open as Luna kissed me, leaning further towards me that my back was pressed against the seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shrugging slightly, I moved my hands down to the fore of Luna&#39;s hips, pulled her in, and embraced her, kissing her more fully and deeply, all lips and no tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, she crossed over from her seat to mine, sitting backward on my lap, and wrapped her hands around my neck as our kiss got fierce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without parting her lips from mine, Luna reached for my belt, struggling to unbutton it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, I grabbed her wrist and mumbled, &#34;Hold up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly, Luna&#39;s eyelids snapped open, and she pulled back, looking at me with darting eyes as her expression deepened into a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t want this?&#34; Luna whispered, giving me a long stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are in public, Luna! The parking lot of a mall full of werewolves with super hearing. Of course, I don&#39;t want this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a touch of sadness in her eyes, she tugged a loose string of hair behind her ear. Then she struggled to get off my lap and sat back in her seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What was that all about?&#34; I asked, looking her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will it sound desperate to say that I can not wait for the full moon for you to mark me?&#34; Luna mumbled, lowering her head as she played with her fingernails. &#34;Well, I heard the mark happen during sex and I well&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you just give me a little more time?&#34; I asked, realizing that my dilemma wasn&#39;t something I was going to solve today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising her head, Luna looked at me, gave a sweet smile, and said, &#34;Okay, I can wait. But don&#39;t make me wait too long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though she didn&#39;t say it, I knew there was a time frame in her head, and I realized that I had from now to the next full moon to figure out which sister I&#39;m bonded with or going to settle for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hopefully, in that time range, my curse will have been broken, and I can determine my true mate and not just choose out of lust or sympathy.</p>
