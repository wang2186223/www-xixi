                <p>Now that I am standing in a room filled with the scent of my enemies, memories are rushing back to my mind and I can see the blood of our history clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And even though the past wasn&#39;t something that I wanted to repeat at this moment, my wolf was misbehaving because of the scent of Loki.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I caged its rage and smiled as Luna approached me. Tonight has been tough with all the fake emotions I had to put on and portray and the lies I had to tell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to win the trust of my enemies, I had to gain their sympathy first, and even though it wasn&#39;t going to be simple, today was the first step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; Luna said with a weak smile when she stopped in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; I asked, striving to keep up the act that I give a damn about her feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know what the hunt means?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Karen kind of filled me in on it the other day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising a brow, Luna hesitated and then asked, &#34;You know that the hunt means that they are going to kill my sister?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kind of,&#34; I uttered, keeping my expression indifferent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t hard to act like I didn&#39;t care for Blake because I didn&#39;t give a shit for anyone other than my pack and Jason. But deep down, I felt odd when I heard those words from Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t feel bad that your student is going to die?&#34; Luna asked, her voice filled with doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you have to be close to someone to have some kind of feelings for them?&#34; I mumbled, shoving my hand into my phone when I felt a vibration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. But I thought you were considerate toward your students.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mmh,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My entire focus was off Luna as I clicked on Jason&#39;s message and read, &#34;Why didn&#39;t you tell me Blake is an omega in heat,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shit! I forgot, and now, all I could think of is if Jason was able to restrain himself since betas are way more vulnerable to an omega&#39;s pheromones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nero, did you hear me?&#34; Luna&#39;s voice brought my attention back to her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got to go!&#34; I told her, putting my phone in my pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is everything okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Let&#39;s catch up another time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply from Luna, I rushed out of the room and ran down the hallway, shutting my mind of all thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got out of the Hayes mansion, I hurried to my car, got in, and drove out of their yard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment I was further away from the house, I managed to get my phone out of my pocket and then called Jason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few rings, he answered and I hastily asked, &#34;Where are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Out of the villa,&#34; Jason said with an exaggerated sigh. &#34;I could have hurt her tonight, Nero Thankfully, I was quick to leave the house. I have never smelled something so sensual and powerful like that. What is Blake?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have the same question. I&#39;m on my way home. Where are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had to get far away from the house for my wolf to cool off. I&#39;m in my hotel room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, she&#39;s alone?!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The line grew silent, and I felt annoyed for raising my voice at my beta again because of Blake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Yes,&#34; Jason finally said. &#34;Nero, don&#39;t you think Blake is different from the others?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know that you can&#39;t sense who your mate is because of a lineage curse. But I haven&#39;t seen you care for anyone outside of the pack as you do for Blake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Comparing my behavior to Blake to that of the bond between two mates is just stupid. What I felt for her was sympathy and that&#39;s that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Jason. She&#39;s not the one.&#34; I said, stepping on the accelerator pedal, putting the car at full speed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How would you know if you don&#39;t know what a bond between two mates feels like?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, Jason&#39;s words made sense, and I hated to admit it because Blake isn&#39;t supposed to be mine, not after everything I have done and am about to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not to talk about how much my father and the pack will frown upon marking the daughter of our enemy. Forbidden is the only word to describe that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s because she makes herself so pitiful and needy that I can&#39;t help but care. I still have a soul, you know.&#34; I finally said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure,&#34; Jason mumbled, and I could hear the sarcasm in his tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A while later, after I had brought the car to a stop in my yard, I got out and headed for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I was about to unlock it, the knob turned, and then the door opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing in the doorway, Blake gazed at me, and I could feel the heat of her stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring her, I walked into the hallway and shut the door behind me. But as I was about to head upstairs, Blake grabbed onto the edge of my coat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How many times do I have to avoid you for you to get the hint and stay away?&#34; I mumbled, gazing back at her calm face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking away from my eyes, Blake drew her hand back and dropped her gaze to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she let out a shaking breath and said, &#34;I can take the hint. It&#39;s Luna that you prefer. Then I wouldn&#39;t bother you anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, I took a long look at her and then said, &#34;Come here,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34; Blake mumbled, raising her gaze to meet my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wanting to repeat my words, I walked over to Blake, and not giving her the chance to pull back, I lifted her in the air and threw her over my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing! Put me down!&#34; Blake cried out, swinging her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But my grip on her legs only got tighter as I carried her out of the hallway, heading upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I entered the guest room with Blake, I took her to the bed and tossed her on the mattress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think it&#39;s fair to torture me?&#34; I told her as she gaze into my eyes. &#34;This is my first time feeling this way. It&#39;s pathetic and you keep doing it to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t do it on purpose. I can&#39;t control my heat.&#34; Blake whispered, her lashes fluttered, a few rapid beats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without breaking eye contact with her, I approached the bed and climbed on it, leaning in towards her lips, and whispered, &#34;It&#39;s not intentional?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, she dropped flat on the bed. But that didn&#39;t stop me from climbing above her and drawing closer to her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want relief from your heat?&#34; I mumbled, not even struggling to fight against her pheromones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without replying, Blake kept gazing at me, and her eyes were as steady as glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not kidding. There&#39;s a really pleasing scent coming from you.&#34; I mumbled, feeling drunk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;From me?&#34; Blake whispered as her eyelids widened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing closer to her lip, I smirked and mumbled, &#34;Who else is in the room with us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s like I forgot everything logical as I slipped my hands under her nightgown and pulled it upward, tossing it to the tiles after getting the gown off her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once my clothes joined hers on the floor, I looked into her eyes, and at that moment, Blake raised her head and rested her lips against mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My last sense of hesitation faded immediately, as I parted her lips and slid my tongue into her mouth, kissing her fiercely as I pressed her hands flat against the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I finally gave Blake a moment to breathe, a soft moan crawled out from the deepest of her throat as I held her and was about to pull in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop,&#34; She whispered with tears in her eyes. &#34;My legs hurt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I haven&#39;t gone further in yet,&#34; I said, lacing my fingers with hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, then take it out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But it&#39;s already halfway in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you to stop.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking into Blake&#39;s wet eyes, I took a long look at her and then asked, &#34;Are you sure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she bit her bottom lip, refusing to speak, I gave her a half-smile and said, &#34;You are a bit tight. Relax a little.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment I attempt to move my hips a bit, she cried out, &#34;Fuck! It really hurts!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake, just relax. It&#39;s almost all the way in,&#34; I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I give her a second to catch her breath before thrusting, slamming my hips into hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;AHH!&#34; A scream escaped her lips as she tightened her grip on my hand. &#34;It hurts!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With tears running from the corners of her eyes, she loosened her grip on my hands and cried, &#34;Nero! It really hurts!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning towards her lips, I watched her darting gaze before kissing her neck and whispering, &#34;I&#39;m going to move a bit, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment I raised my hips and thrust, she wrapped her legs around me while her nails clawed deep into the skin of my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her body collided with my mine, I felt my wolf going wild again, making me excited to do something, something that I said a few minutes ago that I wouldn&#39;t do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thrusting in deeper and faster, I listened to Blake moan louder, and then, not holding back, I sunk my teeth into the skin between her shoulder and neck, making her moan ripen into a wild scream.</p>
