                <p>After allowing me to call him ten different times, he finally answered and I calmly uttered, even though I was infuriated, &#34;What is Scarlet doing here?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Last night, you claimed Loki&#39;s daughter, right?&#34; My father&#39;s voice echoed with so much dominance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know which girl I am talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I didn&#39;t answer, he let out, &#34;I know all about your little display last night at the Hayes mansion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words left me with one answer, knowing that I was double-crossed by my own spies and lying was not an option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was Loki&#39;s decision,&#34; I mumbled, frowning at the thought of which one of those pricks betrayed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you provoked him into doing it!! Why?!&#34; My father uttered, his tone sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years ago, I turned my back on Blake because of my father I feared that a child of Loki would not live, raised under his roof. I thought she was better off with her kind. But no matter how hard I try to escape from my promise, fate keeps dragging me back to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The web I am entangled in with Blake keeps getting tighter around my neck, and I don&#39;t think I can escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When we found Loki&#39;s whereabouts, and you realized that she was alive, I told you to avoid that child, Nero!&#34; My father lashed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t. There is so much going on here that you don&#39;t know about! Blake is the easiest way to get to Loki. I just realized that now. He wants her to lead the dark moonlight pack. That&#39;s how much she is worth to him.&#34; I raised my voice. &#34;With her&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t give a damn, Nero! I don&#39;t believe that you are with her just to get to Loki! That girl is bad luck! She&#39;s ruining everything just like before!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, she was just a baby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That doesn&#39;t excuse the fact that if it wasn&#39;t for her, you would have completed the mission as I ordered you to do so!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you that it wasn&#39;t because of Blake that I ordered for us to retreat!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I believe what Scarlet reported any day over your bullcrap story about what happened that day. You got weak because of her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!! I got sick because I looked into her eyes and realized that I was no better than Loki!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the line fell silent, I buried my face into my palm and whispered, &#34;Scarlet shouldn&#39;t be here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t trust you anymore, son. Something is different about you, and I don&#39;t like it. Scarlett will stay until Loki is dead along with the rest of those scoundrels.&#34; My father mumbled with so much disappointment in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are ruining everything by allowing her to stay! Don&#39;t you see!!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Scarlet is capable of handling herself. She&#39;s not leaving because she is the only one I trust since Jason is useless to me because of his loyalty to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sigh, I heard him mumble beneath his breath, &#34;I raised him, and he chose to put you on a pedestal, biting the hands that fed him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe I am Blake&#39;s Alpha because from the moment we met shit keeps getting risky and unpredictable for me. She is putting me against everything and everyone, and I can&#39;t seem to not choose her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you mark her Blake.&#34; My father voiced out, and I could hear raw anger in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I uttered since there was no use lying anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I always knew Blake and I was an impossible force from the moment we met again, and I don&#39;t get why fate keeps trying to merge us Only chaos can blossom from what we are, and I want to shield her from all of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after everything that has happened so far, I realized that the universe wouldn&#39;t allow that to happen, so I will give in to its intention until everything burned into ash for us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a firm tone, my father let out, &#34;After you are done with this mission, I want you to reject her. I wouldn&#39;t accept her, Nero, and neither will the pack. She can not be the Luna of this pack with Loki&#39;s blood running through her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing that I didn&#39;t have the words to reply to his remark, I withdrew the phone from my ear and ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recklessly, I dropped onto my bed, and rested my back flat against the sheet, feeling a burden like no other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The brightness of the bulbs caused me to shut my eyes, and when I opened it again, it was because of my ringtone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that it was Blake calling, and a couple of hours had drifted by, I woke from my bed, answering the phone as I left my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few minutes of driving, I reached the parking lot of the campus and brought my car to a stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Blake got into the front seat, she pouted at me and mumbled, &#34;You are late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I fell asleep,&#34; I told her, putting the car in gear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Driving her back home was silent, and now and then, she would eye me with a look of concern on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were a lot of questions masked behind her calm expression, and I could tell every time I stared into her eyes. But my thoughts wouldn&#39;t allow me to say a word to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we got home, I left her downstairs and headed to my room. But as I was about to remove my coat, a knock on the door got my attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hesitating, I took a long look at its wooden frame as I pulled my coat off my shoulders. But then Blake&#39;s voice echoed, &#34;Nero, did you lose your job at the school?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The raw concern in her voice left me guilty, and I walked over to the door, opened it, and gaze at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes brimmed with sadness as she whispered, &#34;You left the campus early, and&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I didn&#39;t lose my job,&#34; I said, unable to bring a smile to my lips to comfort her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could I lose my job when I am paying the school to teach there, and as one of their biggest sponsors, there was no way they were going to address me about Blake and I relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why do you look so miserable?&#34; Blake muttered, sounding even more worried now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honesty is a gift that I could never give to her, so I snapped myself out of my emotions and took her hand, leading her into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After shutting the door, I looked back at her and said, &#34;I am just tired and hungry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The look of confusion in her eyes only lasted for a second before she beam with excitement and uttered, &#34;I will cook something for you then. What would you like?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything will be fine.&#34; I calmly uttered, feeling guilty by the look of joy in her expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she rushed past me for the door, I grabbed her by the waist, spun her around, and lightly kissed her on the nose before mumbling, &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The corners of her lips pulled upward as she giggled, glowing with happiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After letting go of her waist, I watched as she rushed out of my room before allowing the smile on my face to fade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the minutes drifted off, I got concerned about Blake and headed downstairs to check on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got into the dining room, I froze at the sight of the table covered in food and Blake adding more to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would you make this much?&#34; I whispered, walking over to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because you and Jason have all this food wasting away in the fridge, and I don&#39;t want it to spoil. Plus, you said anything.&#34; Blake let out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then dragging her gaze to the table, she looked a bit skeptical as she murmured, &#34;Did I go overboard?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resting my index finger under her chin, I directed her focus back to me and said, &#34;No, not at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face looked a bit relaxed as she stared into my eyes. Then she picked up a sandwich, bit into it, and mumbled, &#34;Try it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking down at the sandwich as she pointed it to my mouth, I pushed it aside, tilting in and locking Blake&#39;s lips with mine, parting them to get a taste of her tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With shut eyes, her body weakened against the table as she kissed me, her palm pressed against the solid wood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grabbing Blake by the waist, I set her on the table, and her fingers slid into my hair, grabbing it a bit hard when I pulled on her lip with my teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly withdrawing from me, Blake looked hesitant as she whispered, &#34;Maybe you should eat first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think my appetite has shifted for something tastier.&#34; I teased her, unable to quench the spark she had awakened in me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she moved her lips to speak, a buzz from my phone interrupted her, and she silently gazed at me while I took it out of my sweatpants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Scarlet is gone. I lost her, and can find her anywhere in the hotel.&#34; I calmly read Jason&#39;s message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I shove my phone back into my pocket, smiled at Blake, and mumbled, &#34;Where were we?&#34;</p>
