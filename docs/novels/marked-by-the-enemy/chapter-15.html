                <p>*****************Blake POV***************</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I raised my eyelids, the light from the sun seemed too bright, so I shut my lashes. Then I tried to move, but I sensed an intense pain in my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My muscles were aching, and it was not because I was lying on the floor, instead of the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last night&#39;s transformation took a toll on me. But I felt awake, and I could sense my wolf more accurately now, even though I still didn&#39;t have control over her or a stable connection with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, I finally opened my eyes again, and at first, my sight was dim, then my eyes adjusted to the light, and I could now see everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, my gaze rested on Nero&#39;s chest, and I could feel the weight of his hand around my waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, I attempted to wake up, but his hand pulled me closer, pressing me against his body, causing me to struggle a bit in his arm when I realized he had a boner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t move. I don&#39;t think I can control myself if you keep shaking.&#34; Nero mumbled with his eyes still closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then his lashes slowly lifted, and I was staring directly into his calm eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are we on the floor,&#34; I whispered, feeling nervous from his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because your wolf was too big for the bed,&#34; Nero said as he gave me a dull smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darting my eyes away from him, I looked at the ceiling and mumbled, &#34;Can you let go? The floor feels cold and hard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, Nero continued to keep me in his grip. Then he finally let go, and I left from under the blanket, standing to my feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took me a hot embarrassing second to realize it, and when it hit me that I was naked, I yanked the blanket off Nero and wrapped it around my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chuckle escaped his lips, and I could feel my face growing hot as he turned to look at me with those alluring eyes of his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think we have passed that stage.&#34; Nero teased, awakening from the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he took a step towards me, but I drew back, knowing nothing good would come out of us being closer, even though I felt drawn by every inch of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is your body feeling a bit better?&#34; Nero asked, stopping a foot away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were too close, too close for my comfort zone. Ever since he bit my neck, I have been attracted to him, making it so damn hard to resist him, even though I have been trying my hardest to do so. And now that my wolf has fully awakened, this shit has become even more difficult.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine. Now, can you create a six feet distance between us!&#34; I mumbled, pulling my gaze to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of doing what I ask, Nero took a step towards me, breaking the space between us, and claimed my mouth, lightly tugging my bottom lip with his teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crazy dilemma that was happening in my head at that moment was infuriating. I wanted this! I didn&#39;t want this! At this point, I couldn&#39;t tell between what I wanted and what my wolf craved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, I gained the strength to draw back, putting a five feet space between us, and then aggressively wiped my lip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A frown crossed Nero&#39;s face, and I couldn&#39;t tell what was going on behind his calm eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart was pounding wildly in my chest and I could hear the beat in my ears as I lashed out. &#34;Why are you kissing me all of sudden? Can you stop sending mixed signals!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without uttering a word, Nero walked towards me, and I felt like my feet were glued to the floor as I kept my gaze fixed on his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he stopped, I drew a breath, inhaling the air he was exhaling because of how close our body was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is not a joke. You need to get a grip on your pheromones. It&#39;s getting harder to restrain myself.&#34; Nero calmly uttered, his gaze piercing into my soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know what to do!&#34; I said in annoyance. &#34;This is not my doing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Nero raised his brow and frowned at me, I felt infuriated and shouted, &#34;This is all your fault for showing up in my life and arousing emotions that I hate!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The feeling is mutual,&#34; Nero said with delicate disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words hurt more than I expected them to, and I suppressed my emotion, hardening my face to mask my pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence between us lasted for a while. Then he said with an exaggerated sigh, &#34;I should get ready for work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching as he walked out of the room, I felt a tightness in my chest that I refused to acknowledge until the door slammed shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not giving in to my tears, I dropped the sheet off me and walked over to the closet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After finding something comfortable, I got dressed, headed over to the nightstand, and got a hold of my phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was I still active on our school website and most of the student blogs and vlogs even though it was depressing? It&#39;s because I wanted to stay informed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was no secret that after going rogue, it wasn&#39;t going to be long before the hunt for me started, and this was the only way I knew how to get information.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The good thing was, I have been using an anonymous account for years, and no one knew it was me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once I was comfortable in bed, I hit on the video that Karen uploaded a few minutes ago, scowling the moment her irritating voice echoed into my ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, boos! Last night was lit, wasn&#39;t it!&#34; Karen said with a fake ass smile that made me want to barf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated with the video already, I skipped through a few seconds and then stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, congratulations, Jeremy. Yesterday, you went through your first transformation at age fourteen. Good for you! At least, we all now know that you are not wolfless!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Is it possible to hate someone more than you already do? Because the more I stare at Karen and listen to her lousy voice, my hate for her just keeps expanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Speaking of wolfless, so far Blake hasn&#39;t been found yet. After, acting dauntlessly in the class and getting her ass exiled. She&#39;s now hidden away like some coward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fury I felt because of that remark was indescribable, and with every other word that came out of her lips, I could sense my anger intensifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why act like a wolf when you are a wet dog. Wolf less freak. I&#39;m not her, but I feel so embarrassed just thinking how fuck up she is!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of her mocking laughter, the fact that she had a thousand views, and that people were liking her outrageous video with every passing second, enraged me to my very core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The longer I watched her go on and on about me, I could feel myself slipping away and my wolf taking over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within a split second, I swung my hand, throwing my phone at the wall, and watching it slam into the solid concrete before jumping out of bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I headed out of my room, went straight to Nero&#39;s bedroom,  and walked inside since his door was unlocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was empty, but I picked up his scent in the bathroom. So I headed inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake!&#34; Nero called out, sounding annoyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring the anger in his eyes, I frowned and said, &#34;I want to go back to school.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What!&#34; Nero mumbled as he stared at me like I was losing my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing that he heard me the first time, I kept quiet, frowning at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. If that&#39;s what you want, I can try and find a way to get your transcript, and you can attend a school abroad.&#34; Nero finally said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I&#39;m going back to my old school.&#34; I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without uttering a word, Nero walked past me and headed into his room. But I was hot on his heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am serious,&#34; I shouted out when our eyes locked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are not going back to that school,&#34; Nero said with a straight face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Speechless from anger, I watched him walk over to the bed and pick up his shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must be kidding, right?&#34; I mumbled, feeding off the anger that burst through me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do I look or sound like a joker?!&#34; Nero coldly uttered as he buttoned his shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My life doesn&#39;t belong to you, nor does it revolve around you! You can&#39;t just go about interfering in my life like it&#39;s yours!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It does! I am one of the only people here who doesn&#39;t want to end your damn life! And I&#39;m not going to sit back and allow you to make reckless decisions that are going to get you hurt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My death is not yours to worry about!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room fell silent as Nero gave me a shut-your-mouth glare. Then he grabbed his pants and said, &#34;Don&#39;t push me to my limit, Blake!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t care. I have a few scores to settle with some people and not even you can stop me from doing that!&#34; I lashed out, tightening my fist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s great for you. But do that now, and you will be dragging me into your shit!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then toss me back on the street! I&#39;m ready to sleep on the sidewalk!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The damage is already done. I can&#39;t throw you on the street even if I want to! Because of you, my back is against the wall, and my hands are tied!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a gentle knock on the door echoed into the room, and I held back my tongue when I heard Jason&#39;s voice, &#34; Guys, is everything okay in there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swaying my attention away from the door, I looked at Nero and said, &#34;My mind is made up, so except you are prepared to cage me in this house, I am walking out of here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you do this, if anything happens to you, I wouldn&#39;t be able to intervene or get you out of it!&#34; Nero coldly uttered. &#34;So think about your decision carefully.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meeting his eyes, I felt hesitant for a moment. Then I sunk into the madness of my rage and said, &#34;I already did, and I don&#39;t need you to be my knight in shining armor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exactly as I fear</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*************Nero POV**********</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I believe that things couldn&#39;t get any shitter, it does, and now, Blake has become more rebellious than before after her transformation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was this crazy look in her eyes as I stared into them, and I knew nothing I said was going to make a difference, yet I still gave it a try.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, you want to go to school then go. I will not be responsible for you. Transport, feeding, and any other thing will be your problem for the remaining days you will be in this house!&#34; I said, striving to get my anger under control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Find! I will get a job then!&#34; Blake uttered, her voice had a surprise in it and a bit of an edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The arrogance in her tone set me off and I lashed out, &#34;Blake!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes rolled in the back of her head, and she said in a defiant tone, &#34;You worry about your life, and whatever mess you have going on with my sister. And I will worry about myself and not dying!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, I snapped and lashed out, &#34;Get out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will!&#34; Blake mumbled without breaking eye contact with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes flickered with defiance as Blake stared at me. Then she stormed out of my room, slamming the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything was falling apart so fast, and my brain hurt just by thinking about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly the door opened and my gaze met Jason&#39;s eyes as he called out, &#34;Nero,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I said, more harshly than I intended to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake just walked out of the house, claiming she needs fresh air. What the heck is going on between Blake and you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, he threw me a hard stare and said, &#34;Nothing? Try me with something more believable!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Things are just becoming more complicated than I anticipated,&#34; I mumbled, sitting at the edge of the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I warned you from the very beginning, Nero. If you need a fresh start, you shouldn&#39;t get mixed up with Loki&#39;s daughter!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. I know!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning, Jason took a long look at me and then said, &#34;Also, what are you doing with this Luna person?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing that should concern you,&#34; I mumbled, looking away from the anger in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you hiding from me, Nero!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake has already pissed me off, don&#39;t push me off the cliff before I lose my damn mind!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, the silence that I wanted, befell the room as Jason kept glaring at me without uttering a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got a class to teach,&#34; I mumbled as I stood from my bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Last night!&#34; Jason said, pausing as he met my eyes. &#34;Did Blake transform?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated, I rubbed my neck, feeling the tension in my shoulder. Then I studied his face for a moment and mumbled, &#34;Ultima She is an Ultima.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nero, what the fuc!!&#34; Jason harshly uttered, his eyes widened. &#34;Are you kidding me! She is not a simple wolf. An ultima! You got yourself mixed up in some serious shit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Believe me, I know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know how powerful and rare her species of wolves are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising his brow, Jason scowled and said, &#34;Do you! Her power is crazier than a true alpha, and if words get out there about what she is, they will come for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up!&#34; I coldly uttered, annoyed that he was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what they are like! They will use her over and over. They wouldn&#39;t care about what she wants or her life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have a bigger concern than worrying about them and her. Blake is an adult, and she is capable of handling herself. Also, this is a small state, finding out who Blake is, will be difficult for them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But not impossible!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not my problem.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And... things just keep getting better in the most troublesome way possible. That was not even on my mind, but Jason just had brought it up and made things even worse than I  thought it would get. Just great!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence in the room lasted for quite a while as Jason kept staring at me with a touch of disbelief in his eyes, almost like he was extremely disappointed in me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should get going,&#34; I finally told him, pushing aside every thought in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Jason said nothing, I walked past him. But the moment I grabbed the door handle, he asked, &#34;Are you just going to let her go back to school?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You heard her! I focus on myself, and she will do the same.&#34; I said, squeezing my hand tightly on the handle. &#34;And that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m going to do. Blake is not my problem to care about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After opening the door, I stopped in my tracks and gazed at Blake, standing in the hallway, glaring at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When did you get here?&#34; I subconsciously mumbled, worried that she must have overheard Jason and I conversations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Running her finger through her hair, Blake gave me a smug smile and then said, &#34;Just now. But I think I have heard everything I needed to hear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she walked away, and after taking a few steps, she stopped, turned around, and said, &#34;See you on campus, Mr. Fang.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without saying a word, I turned away from her, and headed down the hallway, suppressing all my emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An hour later, I arrived on Campus, and when I got to my class, it was half empty since I was a bit early, and only Luna was seated in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning,&#34; I mumbled, shocked to see her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There&#39;s another problem I forgot that I had. Luna claimed that I am her mate which is just confusing. How was I supposed to tell if she was telling the truth when I am under this damn curse?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it is because of my curse my father chose me for this mission since he trusted that I wouldn&#39;t fall in love with Luna while using her to get the information that I need from her father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Things were not supposed to go far between us, and I am not allowed to claim her. It&#39;s a straight order from my dad. But what am I supposed to do now that she is insisting that there is a bond between us?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Which sister is being truthful with me, and which isn&#39;t? I can&#39;t tell, and it is just so annoying! Yet, Luna seems like a safer choice than Blake, and I couldn&#39;t help feeling like things will be easier with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a warm smile on her lips, Luna left the chair, walked up to me, and then stopped a foot away from me before mumbling, &#34;Good morning, Nero.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes were fixed on my gaze as she tiptoes to reach my height. Then when she leaned in closer and her lips were about to rest on mine, the classroom door burst open and Blake stormed inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Locking eyes with me, she sneered and said, &#34;Book a hotel or motel room. This is a classroom for crying out loud, Mr. Fang!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I left this morning, I was hoping that Blake&#39;s madness would die down, and she will give up her plan to come back to school. But now that she was here, I knew things were about to get worse as I fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How did she even get here so soon? That&#39;s the first thought that crossed my mind. But I couldn&#39;t ask Blake because she and I should not know each other personally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Jason walked into the room, drew a breath, and abruptly said, &#34;Did you have to run so fast?! We could have gotten a Uber as I suggested!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning his gaze on me, Jason&#39;s eyes locked with mine, and he was about to speak when I lightly shook my head, hoping that he got the signal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping silent, Jason stared intensely at me, and I could see thousands of questions hidden in his calm gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sister!&#34; Luna abruptly uttered, and her voice snapped me back to reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nervousness I felt watching Blake coldly stared at her sister was unlike something that I have never felt before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though none of us spoke, the tension was raw and drastic, and every silent second had me wondering what was going to happen next.</p>
