                <p>********Luna pov*******</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patience is not my best suit, yet, Nero keeps testing me, and my frustration is off the charts right now as I lay in bed, staring at my &#34;Good morning, babe&#34; text that I sent him to which he is yet to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, I thought he was just a gentleman by not wanting to have sex with or mark me. But recently, he has become more distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We haven&#39;t even reached third base yet in our relationship, and I have tried to make it happen. But, he keeps treating me like something fragile that he doesn&#39;t want to ruin or touch too hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hopefully, this full moon, he will let go of his gentle side and allow me to experience the beast inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After another few minutes of glaring at my phone screen, I slapped it on the sheets and grabbed my pillow, covering my face as I screamed into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It has been hours since uncle Rolex ensured mother and me that he was going to handle Blake! So why I haven&#39;t heard any news of her death yet! All of this is just so frustrating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Milady, the table is set and your parents are waiting for you?&#34; Rebecca&#39;s voice echoed into the room along with the sound of a gentle knock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting out of bed, I walked over to the door, opened it, and looked her dead in the eyes before slapping her hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although that didn&#39;t quench my rage, I did feel a bit of thrill when pain glowed in her widely spread eyes, and that distracted me a little from my problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, I looked at the bleeding cut on Rebecca&#39;s lip, smirked, and then walked past her, heading downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when I got in the hallway, I saw my father and mother heading to the living room with a bunch of members of our pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity ate at me, and I rushed after them until we got into the living room. Then I walked over to the couch and sat silently beside my mother who seemed a bit stressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uncle Rolex was among those in the room, and I already had a guess about what this meeting would be about, and the thought of Blake being dead made me entirely forget the annoyance that I felt that Nero had not answered my text, even now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is so important for you all to rush to my home and disrupt my breakfast with my family!&#34; My father said, his tone a bit rough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Say it, uncle Rolex. Tell him that his bastard is dead. Who cares if she&#39;s a child he conceived with his mate! The only thing that matters now is that she is gone, and I can rest assured that Nero is all mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There has been a massacre,&#34; Uncle Rolex said, lowering his hand as his fingers tightened into a fist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did he look so disheartened! I get that he needs a bit of emotion to announce Blake&#39;s death, but the grief in his eyes looks raw. Also, what the heck did he mean by a massacre!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Six Betas were brutally killed yesterday.&#34; Mr. Noble uttered since Uncle Rolex refused to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the fuck! Six Betas? How about Blake? Why the heck this news doesn&#39;t have her name within it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?!&#34; My father mumbled, looking as though he was still in denial about the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We believe that they were murdered by someone powerful because we picked up no scent at the scene, and the bruises on these deceased betas body proof that the wolf that killed the was huge.&#34; Uncle Rolex finally mumbled, still having the look of grief on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although I wanted to deny it, the answer was all there. The betas that died were those that uncle Rolex sent to kill Blake. But who killed them? Blake there is no way it&#39;s her it can&#39;t be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Also, one of the wolves was shredded to pieces.&#34; Mr. Drew mumbled with a disgusted expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room immediately became quiet when my father slapped the table and shouted, &#34;How could this happen?! Six of our members murdered, one ripped to shreds like he has been butcher, and no one knows how the fuck that happened?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a single person spoke, and I could tell from his blood-red eyes that he wanted to slaughter all of them for their silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rolex!&#34; My father shouted, and my heart froze for a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was still shocked over the news that the wolves uncle Rolex sent to kill Blake are dead, and one of them got minced into pieces. But mother didn&#39;t look bothered at all, and I guess she already knew. Way to keep me in the dark, mother!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There&#39;s no way Blake could have done that She could not have taken on six betas, especially uncle Rolex wolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have any any idea about what precisely took place yesterday!?&#34; My father asked, his fingers in a tight fist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though I knew father had nothing on uncle Rolex to suspect him, my heart wouldn&#39;t be calm, and my mother threw me a hard look, but she wasn&#39;t steady either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wolves died, and there was no news concerning Blake being wounded or dead, and it enraged me more than the fear I felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Shadow Woods is isolated, so there&#39;s no way to find out the truth about yesterday&#39;s massacre.&#34; Uncle Rolex said with his expression calm and his tone stable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absurd!&#34; My father shouted, and my heart hit against my rib.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My alpha, please calm your rage.&#34; My mother uttered with her steady gaze on my father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have not died yet, and someone dared to carry out such an act beneath my very eyes!&#34; My father lashed out, totally disregarding my mother&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please still your anger. We all are as stunned as you and uncertain about this situation!&#34; Mr. Noble said, fixing his gaze on my father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words worked like charm, and my father&#39;s expression finally softened as he sat back down, on his seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Mr. Noble&#39;s phone started to buzz, and he picked it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he rested it against his ear, I silently watched, noticing how his eyes were slowly squinting and his brows drawing downward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eavesdropping on his conversation, I was shocked to hear what the lady&#39;s voice on the other side of the line was saying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake did what to my daughter!&#34; Mr. Noble shouted, standing to his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he eyed my father with a hateful glance and said, &#34;What! Karen has a bald spot on her head because Blake pulled out her hair?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere was intense, and yet, I felt so tempted by those words to burst into laughter. But I suppressed my emotions and kept a straight face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hearing the injuries Karen sustained because of Blake, I realized that if she could take out Karen who used to beat the shit out of her, then I can be a bit open-minded to the thought of Blake killing six betas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, I wasn&#39;t willing to wholeheartedly believe that because not even my mother can take out that much betas alone. Someone must have helped her. But who?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Mr. Noble ended the call, he looked at my father and said, &#34;You need to get your daughter down here now! Her behavior is unacceptable!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although my father looked enraged by Mr. Noble&#39;s tone, he grabbed his phone off the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Things just seem to be getting more bizarre, and I felt confused that Blake could be the one causing such damage within the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although it enraged me to think about it, I also felt a bit afraid, and I hated that feeling because it made me feel inferior to Blake for a moment... just for a split second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where are you</p>
                
                
                
                <p>******Blake Pov*******</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I was about to head to my department office to drop Nero&#39;s class, my phone vibrated in my hand, causing me to stop and gaze at the screen to see Nero text, &#34;Come to the parking lot!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After abruptly ending his class, he suddenly wants to see me, and I have a feeling that it&#39;s so that he can shout at me and nothing else!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; Jason asked, and I eyed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as I was about to speak, my ringtone distracted me, and I gazed at Loki&#39;s incoming call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was he calling too? Did he get the news about Karen? Right now, I can only handle one shouting at a time, and I would rather it be Nero first because talking to Loki is just going to make me feel more enraged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got to head to the parking lot. Can you wait for me here?&#34; I mumbled, ignoring Loki&#39;s call as I focused on Jason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, he looked a bit hesitant, and I know it&#39;s because he and Nero have this idea that I am something that needs protection around the clock. Then he gave a half-smile and said, &#34;Sure. Just don&#39;t hurt anyone on the way there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, I guess my little interaction with Karen had made him finally believe that I am capable of taking care of myself, and the look on his face said it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure Whatever&#34; I chuckled, looking at the smirk on his lip and the twinkle in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After turning away from Jason, I clenched my jaw at the thought of Nero yelling at me because Karen, and I squeezed my bag rope, marching down the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got to the parking lot, I knocked on Nero&#39;s car window glass, and he looked up at me before unlocking the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Struggling to stay calm, I opened the door, got into the car, and looked him in the eyes as I asked, &#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut it?&#34; Nero said in a commanding tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage sparked in me, thinking he was telling me to shut up. But as I was about to lash out, he pointed at the open car door, and mumbled, &#34;Shut it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Squinting my eyes, I pouted, knowing he wasn&#39;t just talking about the door. Yet, I still slammed it shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Nero turned the key, confusion shadowed my thoughts, and I whispered, &#34;Where are you taking me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But, the sound of the car engine was the only answer I got, and I wore my seatbelt quietly, relaxing back in the seat, knowing that he would not speak until he was ready to do so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a couple of minutes, we drove in silence, and my gaze remained on the windshield all those time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the fuck were you thinking back there, Blake?!&#34; Nero finally asked strongly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I was not in the mood to reply, so I continued looking at the tinted window which was better than seeing the look in his eyes right now because I knew it would be anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know what it feels like to kill someone for the wrong reasons?!&#34; Nero mumbled, his voice a bit calmer now. &#34;It can be the worst person alive, but if your motive for killing them is wrong, you will not get rid of the guilt for years!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although I wanted to hate those words, he was a bit right. I attacked Karen believing she was behind me getting kidnapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after finding out it might not be Karen, I don&#39;t apologize for hurting her, yet, I do think I would have regretted annihilating her if she isn&#39;t the one who did it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want you losing yourself to the anger and hate, Blake. It can make a monster out of a man!&#34; Nero said, sounding so serious. &#34;Do you understand what I&#39;m saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sighing, I eyed him, realizing that it wasn&#39;t a look of anger in his eyes but pain mixed with grief, and I felt my heart soften a bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nero, I only attacked Karen because she provoked me. I am not a maniac, you know.&#34; I mumbled, gazing at him in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know because I&#39;m the maniac, and I don&#39;t want you becoming close to the person that I am! so I need you to promise me that you wouldn&#39;t lose yourself like that again without a solid reason. Your wolf is not ordinary, Blake!&#34; Nero uttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;II&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s aggressive and very dangerous, Blake. You could have hurt others, and before you even realize what&#39;s happening, you are far too gone to stop!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was trying to stay calm and play stubborn with Nero&#39;s words, but the dominance and sincerity in his voice made me feel awful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I felt tears settling in my eyes, I gazed back at the window, fighting against my desire to cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, I felt the car stop. But my gaze remained glued to the glass, afraid to look at Nero because I knew that I was going to break down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did well defending yourself today and yesterday.&#34; Nero&#39;s calm voice echoed in my ear, and I squeezed my eyes shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why the heck didn&#39;t he start this damn conversation like that in the first place, instead of putting me into a roller coaster of emotions!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake,&#34; Nero whispered, and I could feel his eyes on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sniffing, I swung my head to the right and glared at him, and mumbled, &#34;What?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m proud of you, truly. That bitch deserves some good beating for her arrogance.&#34; Nero chuckled with calmness in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling a mixture of sadness and joy, I crack up with tears running down my cheek while sniffing and giggling at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Nero&#39;s thumbs brushed against my cheeks, wiping them dry as he stared into my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want your mark to fade!&#34; I blurted out before getting a grip on my tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nero simply stared at me, not saying a word, and I pulled my face away from his hand, mumbling, &#34;I should call, Loki.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; Nero asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, now he can talk! I felt like slapping him, hard. But I simply ignored his question, focused on my phone, and dialed Loki&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he answered, Loki shouted in my ear, &#34;Where the hell are you?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is the issue, Loki?!&#34; I mumbled, feeling annoyed by the choice of men in my life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is the issue?! Did you attack Karen Noble?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake, get your ass down to this house now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping quiet, I listened to his heavy breathing, and I waited for his tiny brain to remember that I wasn&#39;t his property anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake!&#34; Loki&#39;s harsh tone echoed from the speakers, but I refused to answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a couple of seconds went by, he called out a bit softly, &#34;Blake, are you still on the line?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, I kept my lips sealed even after he calmly said, &#34;Mr. Noble is mad, Blake. Can you come home so we can talk about this before things escalate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My brain was crowded with thoughts that my mouth refused to say out loud, and I kept my cool, eyeing Nero before directing my stare to the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please,&#34; Loki finally uttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am on my way there,&#34; I mumbled, cutting the call before he uttered another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Nero suddenly started the car engine, I glared at him and asked, &#34;Where are you going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To your father&#39;s house.&#34; Nero casually uttered, driving the car back on the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nah. Let me down Fine, I will let myself out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do not touch that fucking door lock, Blake!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that he was serious, I chuckled out my anger and asked, &#34;How are you going to explain us magically arriving together, Mr. I don&#39;t want anyone knowing about you and me?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not going for you. Luna sent me a &#39;Good morning&#39; text, and I just remembered that I forgot to reply. It&#39;s better to apologize in person, than on the phone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What a faithful mate,&#34; I whispered in sarcasm, focusing back on the windshield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My ringtone abruptly snapped me out of my emotions, and I stared at Jason&#39;s name, smiling weakly before answering the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then his calm voice flowed into my ear, &#34;Blake, it&#39;s not fun to go ghost on someone? You got me looking for you like an idiot. Where are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m with Nero. He suddenly drove off with me, and I kind of forgot to tell you. I&#39;m sorry.&#34; I mumbled, listening to him huff loudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, so are you guys coming back on campus?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. My dad wants to see and speak to me concerning Karen so he and I are on our way there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you be okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think so.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Call me if you want to talk afterward, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I ended the call, I could feel Nero&#39;s eyes on me as he mumbled, &#34;You guys&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You gave me your blessing, so don&#39;t start. Not when you are teasing with my heart. I deserve better than you, and if that&#39;s Jason or anyone else. Then I am willing to look past you and see them. Got it?!&#34; I uttered, ignoring the dull throb in my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car grew quiet for a moment before Nero whispered, &#34;Crystal,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Do you like my sister</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*******Nero Pov*********</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is what I want, Blake off my back, so I can focus on what I came here for and head back home. But why does every second I spend with her keep making that harder for me to do and everything she does affects me to a great extent?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe No. Such a thought would only hurt her further than now. It&#39;s better this way. The sooner she is with someone stable, the better it is for her, and it&#39;s the only thing I can hope for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swaying my gaze off the road for a second, I stared at Blake, deep into the game she was playing on her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face gave away that she was pissed, so I focused back on the road, knowing that I can not afford another argument with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was I supposed to respond to Blake not wanting my mark to fade on her when rejection is the only thing that awaited her if it doesn&#39;t? It must be more preferably if my mark fades than to emotionally break her in the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, I drove into the Hayes yard and brought the car to a stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, Blake pushed the door open before I could turn off the engine and got down, rushing into the mansion, slamming the door as though she didn&#39;t want me following her or getting seen with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I got out of the car and headed into the mansion because she was the reason I came to this stupid place in the first place, knowing that it was her against everyone in this damn house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got into the living room and Luna&#39;s eyes rested on me, her face lit up as she jumped from the couch, rushing into my arms with a bright smile on her lip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hugging onto her waist, my gaze met Blake&#39;s cold stare, and she rolled her eyes before looking at Loki.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here, babe?&#34; Luna whispered, stroking her palm against my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh!&#34; I mumbled, pulling my gaze off Blake and focusing on her. &#34;Oh, to apologize in person that I didn&#39;t respond to your text from this morning, and as if you want to grab lunch later with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure, babe!&#34; Luna gaily whispered. &#34;Let me get changed and then we can go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing that I have fuck up, I looked back at Blake and said, &#34;Oh, like now How about after this meeting? Your sister needs a witness for what happened between Karen and her, and since I&#39;m their teacher&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you and Blake come here together?&#34; Luna asked in a harsh tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, staring back at me, Blake&#39;s face hardened as her lips pressed in a firm line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then her expression suddenly softened as she mumbled, &#34;Yes, Luna. I asked for his help because I know no one in this house will believe my words. But since my soon-to-be brother-in-law was there and saw everything that happened, why not use him as a witness since we are family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not breaking eye contact with me, Blake&#39;s eyes darkened, and she mumbled, &#34;I hope it&#39;s not a problem, sister?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If he helps give us clarity about what happened between Karen and you, then of course not,&#34; Luna said, smiling as she entangled her fingers with mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Narrowing her eyes, Blake sneered and then looked back at Loki and the others in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What clarification do we need when you have injured my daughter so severely!!&#34; Mr. Noble lashed out, slapping the chair arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Severe? She will heal by this evening. I can&#39;t say the same for her bald spot though.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You little...!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Also, if what I did to Karen was brutal, then what would you call what she&#39;s been doing to me over the years?&#34; Blake mumbled, her tone calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s not play dumb here, Mr. Noble. We both know that your daughter is not an angel. Even her eye color gives that away that she is a devil.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scowling at Blake, Loki clutched onto the chair arm and said harshly, &#34;Watch how you speak, Blake!? Even if Karen had wrong you in the past, attacking her for no reason is unacceptable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For no reason! Haha! I see someone got the wrong narrative of the story.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are not helping your case here, daughter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a hateful gaze, Loretta frowned at Blake and said, &#34;You know that there is punishment for such behavior, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? Where were those rules and penalties when everyone was shitting on me?!&#34; Blake shouted with aggression in her every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You shouldn&#39;t be speaking in such a tone, especially if you are in the wrong here, Blake!&#34; Rolex abruptly uttered, frowning at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And how is she in the wrong again?! Were you there when the incident happened?&#34; I uttered, scowling at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking up at me, Luna pouted and whispered, &#34;Babe,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not caring for her frown, I looked Rolex directly in his eyes and said, &#34;What happened in that classroom between Karen and Blake was an act of self-defense. Karen came onto Blake, she simply matched her energy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By pulling Karen&#39;s hair out and wounding her badly!&#34; Luna mumbled beneath her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Compared to getting your head slammed in the classroom tiles, I say that&#39;s a pretty forgiving act on Blake&#39;s part!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning at her, Luna scoffed and mumbled, &#34;Why are you standing up for her?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because if I see evil, I call it out for what it is Your sister was being bullied? Am I the only one who sees that as something wrong?... Or would you all rather that Karen have been the one who hurt Blake instead?!&#34; I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere grew pretty quiet instantly, and I could see that none of them appreciated what I said, except Blake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at me, she had that same intriguing look in her eyes as she did the first time she went into heat in my house, and I couldn&#39;t help staring into her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course not, babe. I didn&#39;t know that Karen and Blake had such a tense relationship. If I knew that my sister was being bullied, I would have helped her. But Blake hardly tells me things about herself.&#34; Luna uttered softly, drawing my eyes back to her pleading expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was a lie, and I knew it. But to keep up the appearance, I brush her hair and mumbled, &#34;I understand,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearing his throat, Noble looked at Blake and said, &#34;I think highly of you truly. And I hope we can get past this disaster that has happened between my daughter and you, for the future sake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mmmh,&#34; Blake mumbled, squinting her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to leave it at that for now and go see my daughter. I hope that you two can get along soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mmmh,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t liking the sound of this, not one bit. If he wanted Blake and Karen to get along, that only means he and were thinking of blending the family through Blake and Killain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck no! Blake can be with anyone, and I will be okay with it, but that douchebag. Not that ass not him!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving his seat, Noble looked at Loki for a moment and then walked away, leaving the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake, can we speak in private?&#34; Loki said as he stood from the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of frustration crossed Blake&#39;s face as she sighs and then mumbled, &#34;Sure Loki, let&#39;s talk!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire shift in this discussion was pissing me off, and for a moment, Blake eyed me, looking disheartening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she followed Loki out of the living room, and I subconsciously took a step forward before Luna&#39;s voice stopped me in my tracks, &#34;Babe, can we go now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34; I mumbled, meeting her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m starving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmmm, sure!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking my hand in hers, Luna pulled me along with her as she murmured, &#34;Great.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it, I didn&#39;t want to leave Blake behind I didn&#39;t want to walk out that door, knowing that she was still inside. But I did, and I hated myself the moment I drove out of that yard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you like my sister?!&#34; Luna abruptly blurted out, her eyes on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do I like Blake?&#34; I asked with my gaze on the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First Jason, and now her. Can&#39;t I just not have to think about what my feelings are for Blake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Nero!&#34; Luna replied in a strong tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would you even ask such a question?&#34; I uttered in annoyance, clutching the steering wheel tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because the full moon will soon be here, and I just need to know that you will keep your word and don&#39;t have a thing for my sister!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t have a thing for Blake, and I&#39;m keeping my word when the full moon arrives, so can we drop this damn conversation!!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lost my cool by raising my voice, and I could see the look of shock on Luna&#39;s face as she stared wild-eyed at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I mumbled in a calmer tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing. I think I just got more eager to have you and can not wait for this full moon.&#34; Luna whispered, biting on her index finger as she giggled faintly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Killian&#39;s Mark</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blake POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m calling Jason to pick you up.&#34; I read Nero&#39;s text, feeling numb and aggravated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this point, I am just going to accept that I am never going to understand him and leave it at that because it&#39;s less hurtful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that Jason?&#34; Loki&#39;s voice echoed into my ear, and I raised my gaze off my phone screen, looking at his annoying face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it that you want to talk to me about?&#34; I mumbled, putting my phone away in my jeans pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your mother&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though I wanted to feel mutual about his words, I held my breath because of how eager I was for his reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is not a member of the dark moonlight pack.&#34; Loki calmly uttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body immediately came to a standstill, and I felt my heart triple its beat as I stared at Loki, wondering what to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have other family members than you and those two?&#34; I mumbled, finally getting over my shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Noble would like you to be with Killian, Blake.&#34; Loki blurted out, and I felt anger squeeze my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated, I scowled at him and lashed out, &#34;Loki! Can we go back to the first discussion! My mother her pack who are they&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of having other family members out there was amazing a bit scary, but very much intriguing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake, you must have a good amount of cards in your hands, but I have mine too. So how about you cut the bullcrap and your stubbornness and listen to what father says.&#34; Loki said in a calm tone and deadpan expression that made me swell with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you try to blackmail me, Loki!&#34; I shouted, losing control of my rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would never. I just need you to come to your senses, Blake. Loretta has half of the pack members in her grip. But the Nobles own most of them financially&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sighing heavily, Loki&#39;s expression softened as he said, &#34;With Luna mated to Nero, your chances of running this pack is slim, except you have both the Nobles and me backing you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I don&#39;t give a shit about running this pack. All I want is to know where my mom is and which pack she&#39;s from.&#34; I mumbled, fighting against all my emotions that had suddenly overwhelmed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You might not like to run this pack, Blake, but it&#39;s what I want, and for me to help you, you got to do exactly what I prefer! Do you understand the trade?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you want to force me on the Nobles, knowing fully well that Killian is not my damn mate!! I have no feelings for him, Loki!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes were at the rim of leaking tears, but I kept my emotions together, knowing that acting pathetic wouldn&#39;t still change his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sometimes Blake, feelings don&#39;t matter in getting what you want, sacrifice does!&#34; Loki casually said like he didn&#39;t give a damn about my opinions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was sickening. No matter how much I think I could escape my pathetic reality, life slaps me in the face with a decision that makes me even more miserable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing that I had no other choice, I suppressed my emotions and mumbled, &#34;So if I bare Killian&#39;s mark&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And decide to take over the pack!&#34; Loki blurted out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, so if I allowed him to mark me and take control of the pack, would you tell me everything about my mother and her pack?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Blake! Every detail that your heart so desires to know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. But can we wait for the full moon before I give myself to him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because it&#39;s going to be less painful after Nero&#39;s mark fades. But those words were not for Loki&#39;s ear. So I lowered my gaze and said, &#34;Just so I can be ready emotionally.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a brief pause. Then Loki slightly nodded and uttered, &#34;Okay. But before then, can you at least make the effort to get to know Killian? I will arrange a date for you two. What do you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever&#34; I whispered. &#34;Sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. Don&#39;t worry, Blake. I promise you that this is for your own good. With the Nobles behind you, you will be untouchable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mmmh&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a thought clicked in my mind, and I hesitated for a moment before muttering, &#34;Someone is after my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Loki shouted, a glow of bright red color shot in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got kidnapped yesterday by six betas, and they wanted&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait! You are the one behind the massacre?... You killed those six betas, ripping one to shreds?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, I felt dumbfounded over Loki&#39;s last statement until I remembered Nero. He did what to the sixth wolf?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind went blank for a moment. Then I recall our conversation this morning, and everything somehow made a bit of sense. He wasn&#39;t kidding when he said he was a maniac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I mumbled, focusing back on Loki.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took a long while of silence for him to say, &#34;Okay. I will look into it. For the time being, come home, and live here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he dumb or something? Did he not already put two and two together and realize that being in this place will accelerate my chances of death?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated, I slowly exhaled and mumbled, &#34;Loki&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he cut me off and said, &#34;Be obedient, Blake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although those were only three words, they had so many meanings that made me hold back my tongue and then muttered, &#34;Fine. I will come home tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. I will send Gustav to pick you up when your classes are over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a maze my life is! I ran only to end up in the same spot, from the very beginning. But if that means I get to find a new direction to flee in, then I&#39;m willing to take the risk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A vibrating feeling hit my thigh, and I reached into my pocket for my phone, pulling it out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that it was Jason calling, I immediately answer the call and mumbled, &#34;Hi,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m outside, waiting on you,&#34; Jason said, sounding worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will be down soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After ending the call, I looked at Loki and said, &#34;I got to leave. My ride is here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jason?&#34; Loki asked, scowling strongly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you know about that guy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring his question, I stood from the couch, clutched onto my bag rope, and walked out of the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got downstairs, Loretta and I met in the hallway, and her face hardened into a frown as she asked, &#34;Leaving?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I mumbled, not losing sight of her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. But just a little advice, stay away from Nero. What happened today should be the last time you use your sister&#39;s name to manipulate him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what, Loretta! You are not my mother, so how about you keep your advice for your daughter, uh!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you don&#39;t learn to take a hint, you might just end up like h&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of Loki&#39;s voice drew my attention off Loretta onto him as he asked, &#34;What&#39;s going on here?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not saying a word, she turned around and walked away, but I shouted after her, &#34;What did you say?! Finish your word, Loretta!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake!&#34; Loki lashed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Behave!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could have sworn that Loretta was talking about my mother, and now I&#39;m eager to know who all knows about her and the truth about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyed, I threw Loki a dirty stare before walking away and leaving the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately stopping in my steps, I looked at the black Range Rover in the yard and Jason standing by it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like it?&#34; He asked the moment I reached him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After he opened the front door for me, I gave a half-smile and mumbled, &#34;Sweet ride.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a while, Jason and I didn&#39;t speak as he drove out of the yard. But once we were a bit further from the house, he looked at me and whispered, &#34;So how did it go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmmm I hate Loki more than I did before seeing him today.&#34; I mumbled, gazing at Jason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was that bad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yep!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It got quiet for a while, and then I mumbled, &#34;I am moving out tomorrow, Jason.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, he stepped on the brake, bringing the car to a stop. Thankfully, the road was deserted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; Jason uttered, locking eyes with me. &#34;Is it because of Nero?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. It&#39;s personal.&#34; I mumbled, not wanting to drag him further into my mess. &#34;I&#39;m coming back home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will be fine, Jason. I am doing this for myself and willingly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly taking my hands in his, Jason intensely gazed into my eyes, and I could feel every single beat of my pounding heart as he calmly uttered, &#34;I don&#39;t want you getting hurt. If this is about your father visiting me&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s something more than you or Nero.&#34; I mumbled, giving him a weak smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darting his eyes away from me, Jason pitifully chuckled and said, &#34;I guess I will have to take this bad boy back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? You don&#39;t like the car?&#34; I mumbled, stroking my thumb against his finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need a vehicle. Never was a fan of the luxury life. But after yesterday&#39;s incident and you refusing the Jeep Nero got for you, I thought it would be safer to get myself a car to take you to school and back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jason,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know it&#39;s conning,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, it&#39;s not!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence fell between us as Jason focused back on my eyes with a look of hesitation in his eyes. Then he leaned towards me, stopping at my lips as he whispered, &#34;I think I&#39;m in love with you, Blake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to bear Killian&#39;s mark soon, Jason,&#34; I whispered without breaking eye contact with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You are really pretty</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*******Jason Pov*******</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a long while, I felt speechless, staring at Blake, wondering if I should take those words seriously or chuckle at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing away from her lips, I met her eyes and mumbled, &#34;Please tell me that you are kidding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze deepened into a look of sadness as she lowered her stare and whispered, &#34;I&#39;m not, Jason.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nah, hell no!&#34; I mumbled, striving not to take her words seriously because it was messing with my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of Killain and her together set me off more than I expected and I had to stare away from her, to calm myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you not get mad or lash up and just be okay with it,&#34; Blake whispered, choking back on most of her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It sounded like she was dying inside. How did she expect me to be okay with something that made her look so broken?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Blake. I can not be not mad at me! You can&#39;t be serious about something like that.&#34; I mumbled, striving to keep my voice calm even though all I wanted to do was flip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I am. That&#39;s why I need you to be okay with it and not judge because it&#39;s my decision.&#34; Blake whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t look me in the eyes and lie like that!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jason,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is your father&#39;s sickening decision, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly it fell silent as a look of hesitation crossed her face, and she paused before muttering, &#34;You don&#39;t understand!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need to understand what&#39;s going on to tell you that Killian is not someone you want to get yourself entangled with, Blake,&#34;  I said, raising my voice as my anger ceased me for a second. &#34;I have met him once, and I wanted to punch the shit out of him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring away from me, Blake gazed at the windshield and mumbled, &#34;Okay. Maybe we should just drop the topic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can not force you not to go through with this. But I am pleading with you to not do something this stupid, Blake.&#34;  I uttered, frowning when she looked back at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she didn&#39;t reply, I blurted out, &#34;Does Nero know about this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. And can you not tell him.&#34; Blake hastily uttered with pleading eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way I wasn&#39;t telling Nero. I would rather give her up to him than have her be with that jackass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jason, promise me that you won&#39;t tell him?!&#34; Blake mumbled, scowling at me as I started the car engine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t make such promises, Blake,&#34; I uttered, stepping on the accelerator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jason, please. I don&#39;t want to be a burden to him or you anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you choose to do what? Put yourself at stake with Killian! Also, who says that you are a burden to us?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swaying my gaze off the road for a moment, I eyed the look of reluctance on her face and then sighed, focusing back on the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, I brought the car to a stop in the parking lot, got down, and approached Blake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at me in confusion, she darted her gaze around for a moment and then mumbled, &#34;Where are we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At the hotel that I stay at,&#34; I told her, chuckling at the nervous look on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jason,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not going to eat you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I was about to walk past her, Blake looked unwilling to follow. So I laced her fingers with mine and led her out of the parking lot and into the building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jason,&#34; I heard Harley&#39;s voice, and I gazed at the counter, towards her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I led Blake over to her and smiled as I replied, &#34;What&#39;s up, Harley?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing. Just wanted to say, &#39;Hi.&#34; Harley said almost in a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a weak smile on her lips, she stared at Blake and mumbled, &#34;Hey. You must be our leader&#39;s daughter Blake, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Blake nervously glanced at me before looking back at Harley and said, &#34;Mmm Hi, and yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are really pretty,&#34; Harley whispered, sounding a bit sad as she avoided my gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, you too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about the entire situation felt awkward, so I locked eyes with Harley and mumbled, &#34;Is that all, we will be&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure. Of course! Have fun, you guys!...&#34; Harley chuckled, tapping the desk as she twitched her lips. &#34;I should stop talking now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nice meeting you, Harley,&#34; Blake called out as I led her away to the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we got to my suite, she slowly spun around and then gazed at me as she raised a brow, mumbling, &#34;You are not a fan of the luxury life?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Where a man sleep is important, you know.&#34; I mumbled, taking out my coat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, the smile on Blake&#39;s face faded, and she cleared her throat, staring the other way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chuckling faintly, I walked over to the couch and sat down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you need to sit for this talk,&#34; I said, my voice drawing her attention back to me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she walked over to my bed and sat at the edge of the mattress, focusing on my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, so&#34; Blake whispered with a stiff smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nero is cursed!&#34; I blurted out, knowing that if I don&#39;t say it now, I would be too selfish to do it later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If not me, then I trust Blake with him. No one else is going to be okay for her, especially not Killian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Blake whispered, sitting up straight and her face grew serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s lying about whatever is going on between Luna and him. Nero doesn&#39;t have a damn clue about who his mate is, and it&#39;s not because he hasn&#39;t found her yet, it&#39;s because he wouldn&#39;t know who she is even if she&#39;s standing before him.&#34; I let out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nero comes from a lineage of cursed Alphas who only finds their mates after sharing blood and sweat. He&#39;s good at acting. But I grew up with him, and I can assure you that whatever is going on between Luna and him is fake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It grew silent as Blake stared blankly at me, and I felt desperate to know what was going on in her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, so!&#34; Blake mumbled, shrugging her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you get it? Nero and you have more chemistry than I have seen between him and anyone over the years!&#34; I told her, confused by her casual look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And just he still somehow chose Luna over me. Even if it&#39;s true she&#39;s not his mate, he still decided to settle for her rather than me. Ahhaa Now I feel more enraged.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t what I envisioned when I was imagining it in my head. But I stuck by the script and mumbled, &#34;I believe he cares about you more, and you could be the one to break his curse if&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jason, I am not the one pushing Nero away! He&#39;s the one driving me away! I have been all over him from the very beginning, and it makes me sick to say, but that&#39;s the truth. I love him, and he he..!&#34; Blake lashed out, frowning at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She loves him. Ha, way to rip my heart into two, and fuck up my emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34; Blake suddenly whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About what?&#34; I mumbled in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Back in the car, you said And it&#39;s not like I don&#39;t... But it&#39;s...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake, it&#39;s fine. You have the free will to fall for whoever you want to be with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If that&#39;s how you truly feel, then respect my decision to be with Killain and stop putting ideas in my head about Nero because if he&#39;s not going to want us then I rather not yearn for it too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a brief silence. Then she relaxed her gaze and said, &#34; I know what you are doing, Jason, and how hard it must be for you to do. But you can not save someone prepared that is to drown.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The look in Blake&#39;s eyes told me that she was serious about this, and I knew that I couldn&#39;t change her mind, so I pulled out my phone from my pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jason, what are you doing?&#34; Blake whispered, clutching onto the edge of my mattress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Calling Nero. Maybe he will be able to talk some sense into you.&#34; I mumbled as I scrolled through my contact, stopping at his number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Blake rushed from the bed, jumped on me, fighting me for my phone, and I struggled to keep it against my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jason,&#34; Nero&#39;s voice finally echoed from the speaker, and she stopped struggling, resting against my chest silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake is planning on bearing Killian&#39;s mark,&#34; I immediately uttered, gazing into her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A frown shadowed her face, and her eyes bore worry as Nero lashed out, &#34;Bring her home! I&#39;m here already.&#34;</p>
