                <p>My date knows my sister</p>
                
                
                
                <p>******************Luna Pov**********</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I stepped out of my bathroom and entered my room in a towel, I saw my mother sitting on the edge of the bed dressed in a stunning, elegant dress, looking like a true Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When our eyes met, she gazed away, and her sight rested on the bags.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s in there?&#34; My mother asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you that I was going shopping today,&#34; I said, striving to keep my emotions in check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight was extremely important for my mother, and I knew her mood would be unstable, and a slight slip of the tongue could send her off. Also, I needed her to be in a good mood for when I broke the news about Damn it! I didn&#39;t get his name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning, I watched my mother walk over to the bag, pick it up, and take it to the bed. Then she pulled out my black and gold slim-fit dress and gazed at it with a smile on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s good to know that you are putting effort into tonight,&#34; My mother mumbled, dropping the dress on the sheet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she looked into my eyes with her piercing gaze and said, &#34; You know that Killian and his entire family are going to be attending tonight, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can I forget prince charming&#39;s attendance? That&#39;s all that you have been talking about to me.&#34; I calmly said as I met her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, because you need to be reminded of that since if Killian becomes your mate, it will be the perfect opportunity to secure your position in the park.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking away from her face, I mumbled, &#34;I am going to attend a party but not with Killian. I met this super amazing Alpha. Well, I know he&#39;s an alpha because only their kind can mask their scent, and&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna, what the heck are you talking about now?&#34; My mother lashed out, standing from the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although I wanted so desperately not to offend my very powerful mother at such a crucial moment, the thought of spending my night at the ceremony with Killian disgusted me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He seems like a nice guy, mother, and he&#39;s rich too. If you can just take your focus off Killian for a moment and give him a chance to..&#34; I mumbled, pausing when I noticed the look of anger in my mother&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want me to give some random so-called alpha that you met at the mall a chance and forget the alpha that your father and I know?&#34; My mother said, taking a few steps closer to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wanting her anywhere closer to me, I kept moving backward slowly as I said, &#34;Just for tonight. Please!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you leave your brain at the mall, Luna?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though I didn&#39;t respond, my mother&#39;s yellow eyes bore right down to the very deepest of my soul, and I froze, unable to take another step back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When my mother reached me, she leaned closer to my face, and with brisk authority, she said, &#34;You are going to put on that gorgeous gown, match downstairs, and stay by Killian&#39;s side during the entire ceremony so you two wolves can get bound.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I whispered, dragging my gaze to the floor to avoid the apathetic look in her eyes after speaking those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. Now put on your little gown and come downstairs. The guests will start arriving soon, and it will be nice to have you by my side to help greet them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giving me a stiff smile, my mother caressed her palm against my cheek and then said, &#34;Don&#39;t stay in here for too long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyed, I gave a smug smile and calmly uttered, &#34;Sure thing,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then my face hardened as I watched her turn away from me and walked out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mother wouldn&#39;t understand, but I deserve the best, and I have this gut feeling that the guy I met at the mall is what I&#39;m looking for. He&#39;s rich, hot, and an alpha, what could be better than that, and he seems to have a decent attitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if my wolf has no connection with him, and I don&#39;t have a feeling for him, not even my mother or anyone else is going to stop me from getting my hands on what I prefer and that&#39;s him!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight, I met him for the second time, and I wanted every inch of my body to be perfect because he was the only wolf I wanted to sink his teeth into my neck and leave his mark engraved on my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dropping the towel from around my breast, I walked over to the bed and picked up my gown, and smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I took my time to get dressed, and after I was done, I styled my hair into a very elegant accessorized updo, exposing my neck and my back before completing my look with a dramatic night make-up look, gold sandals, and an exquisite black clutch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After giving myself time to admire my beauty, I smiled at how perfect my reflection was. Then I left my room and headed downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I reached the staircase, my mother and father were already awaiting me there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without saying a word to them, I stood by my father. Then I forced a stiff smile on my lips and held on to his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Killian and his family are already in the ballroom,&#34; My mother said, giving me a side-eye as she and my father walked along with me to the grand hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I ignored her words since I didn&#39;t care about her or what she wanted because tonight was all about my desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment we arrived in the grand hall and others realized our presence in the room, the hall became silent, and everyone&#39;s focus got drawn to us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attention we were getting wasn&#39;t something strange, and I was too distracted trying to find my date that nothing mattered at that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s Killian and his sister. We should go and greet them.&#34; Mother said, and her eager voice drew my attention back to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You two do that, and I will greet Mr. Noble.&#34; My father said before letting go of my hand and walking off into the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, I was pissed at my mother for being headstrong in making me hang out with Killian. But then when I stared at him, I saw someone that I was impatient to meet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure, mother. It will be nice to meet the Nobles.&#34; I said, striving to suppress my excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A doubtful look crossed my mother&#39;s face, but I overlooked it and walked away, heading straight for Karen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way she was looking at my date that I invited made an irritation flare in my chest for her, and yet I met her gaze with a smile on my face as my mother and I approached them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then when I reached Karen, I tapped on the shoulder of the alluring guy beside her, and when he turned, locking eyes with me, I smiled and said, &#34;Hey, it&#39;s nice to see you again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though I could feel my mother intensely gazing at me, I didn&#39;t look her way and kept smiling at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a bore risk to disobey my mother, but in the midst of such a crowd, I knew her reputation came above putting me in my place, and I was willing to use that to my advantage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dimple formed on one side of his cheek as he smirked and then said, &#34;You too, Luna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gawking at me, Killian snickered and said, &#34;Hey, Luna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi,&#34; I mumbled before darting my gaze back to my date and focusing on his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look incredible,&#34; I said, also ignoring Killian who couldn&#39;t take the hint and walk away but kept scowling at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not as stunning as you are in that dress.&#34; He said with a sweet lob-sided smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearing her throat, Karen suddenly threw me a dirty look, and with a note of incredulity in her voice, she said, &#34;Well, it seems like you two are well acquainted. I thought the only person you ever speak so formally to is Blake, Nero?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I heard those words, I swear my jaw almost drop to the floor as I gazed at Karen with my lips apart. At least the only good thing I felt glad about was that I now knew his name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hall grew quiet for a while, and the silence was kind of freaking me out, especially since tonight was about banishing my sister, and everyone just heard that my date knew my half-sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know my sister?&#34; I asked, glaring at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your sister is Blake?&#34; Nero uttered, a little doubtfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though I didn&#39;t want to freak out, my mind kept forcing intrusive thoughts in my head, and I felt my hate for Blake grow stronger than ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, I kept my lips upward, in a smile, as I calmly replied, &#34;Half-sister. How do you know her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, she&#39;s a student in a class that I teach.&#34; Nero casually uttered, and the unconcerned look on his face told me that he didn&#39;t seem to care about her as Karen made it sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it was still frustrating to know that the Alpha that I had my eyes on knows my sister, and worse of all, he kept that from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, you know Blake and behaved as though you didn&#39;t when I told you about the ceremony?&#34; I mumbled, unable to keep the question suppressed any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t mention her name in the conversation, and as I said before, I am new in town,&#34; Nero uttered, frowning slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was true, and now, I felt a bit embarrassed about confronting him on it when it was just a question that my common sense could have answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Young man, who are you?&#34; My mother abruptly asked, and I held in my breath to calm myself as I watched her scold at Nero.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Let the hunt begin</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching my mother grimace at Nero, I felt so enraged, and yet, I knew not to blaze the fire by getting mad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, I gazed at Nero, drew my brows together, and made a face to signal him to answer her question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, he stared at me and then faced my mother as he said, &#34;Good evening. I&#39;m Nero Fang, a transfer instructor from West Coast college who recently arrived in the state.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a look of annoyance on her face, my mother snorted derisively and said, &#34;I&#39;m not asking for your name or job? I mean, who are you exactly, and what&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Google my name,&#34; Nero calmly uttered, not breaking eye contact with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need the answer from you and not some stupid Internet!&#34; My mother said, her yellow eyes staring back at him cold and unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, he had this unbothered expression on his face almost as though he wasn&#39;t afraid of her. But I couldn&#39;t blame him since he was new in town and didn&#39;t know the kind of person my mother is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grabbing onto her arm, I pouted and whispered, &#34;Mom, you are drawing others&#39; attention to us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she yanked her hand out of my grip and lashed out at Nero, &#34;Who do you think you are walking into my house and ordering me around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I invited him,&#34; I mumbled, feeling so embarrassed that she was doing this in the middle of such a crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, the worst that could happen happened. My father approached us with Mr. Noble by his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are that dumb-ass instructor who didn&#39;t know when to shut his garbage hole and stay humble.&#34; My father said in a nasty tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know Nero?&#34; I asked, shocked that my date was well known than I assumed him to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without taking his gaze at Nero, my father furrowed his brow and said, &#34;You are that filthy brat instructor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, can you watch your words, please. I know what Blake did was wrong. But she&#39;s still your daughter and my sister.&#34; I said, feeling sickened in myself by every word that I uttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly, my mother, my dad, Karen, and even Killian&#39;s eyes were on me, and from their expression, I knew exactly what they were thinking, &#39;When did you start caring about Blake?!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not in a million years will I give a damn about what my father says about his bastard. But a good impression is what I wanted Nero to have for me, and if that means putting on a caring sister act, then I&#39;m down to do that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I&#39;m Blake&#39;s instructor,&#34; Nero said, and I studied his eyes but there were no emotions within them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no denying at this point that he felt nothing for my sister. But even if he did, he could only have her dead because I&#39;m not allowing Blake to take what I want.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here, in my house, with my daughter?!&#34; My father said in a firm voice, with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I invited him,&#34; I rushed to Nero&#39;s rescue, judging from my father&#39;s expression that he didn&#39;t like Nero either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was frustrating because if I&#39;m supposed to bring him into the pack, my parents need to accept him first, and that seems like something impossible at this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna, if you don&#39;t shy...&#34; My father coldly uttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyed, I pulled out my phone, hit my browser icon, and typed in &#39;Nero Fang.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As my eyes stretched out wide, I looked at him and said, &#34;Y-ou a-re! You are the founder of Xbox Tech, a multi-billion dollar corporation with branches all over the world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though I was staring at his picture in the article, nothing felt real at that moment because I was in disbelief at how wealthy he was. Compared to him, my father and everyone&#39;s riches in this state were a trifle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My father suddenly snatched my phone out of my grip and looked at the screen for a while before staring up at Nero&#39;s face and coughing faintly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he absentmindedly handed my phone over to me as he asked, &#34;What&#39;s a billionaire like yourself doing in a small state like this and working as a college instructor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Taking a break from the world of business and following my passion for teaching... Why I am in this state,&#34; Nero uttered, looking relaxed as he spoke, and in that instant, he had an air of importance about him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I met his eyes, he slightly smiled at me before saying, &#34;I got transferred and didn&#39;t choose this school. Since teaching is my pursuit, I am humbled to where I get sent by the head of the Department of Education for werewolves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was quiet for a moment. Then Killian abruptly asked as he shoots Nero a look of raw resentment, &#34;What&#39;s with the scent concealment, pal? Is the something you are hiding?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A remote coldness came into Nero&#39;s eyes as he frowned and said, &#34;I thought I was invited here as a guest. I didn&#39;t think I would be getting interrogated!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A surge of annoyance spiked in me when I heard those words because I invited him and now, my pack was treating him like some criminal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I get it. I&#39;m the new guy in your territory so the skepticism is understandable.&#34; Nero said as his expression smoothened a bit. &#34;I don&#39;t suppress my scent because I have something to conceal, but because I&#39;m hiding from something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fixing his gaze on me, Nero let out a sigh and said, &#34;Rogue from my pack attacked one unfortunate night when I was little and carried on a massacre, leaving me as a lone alpha, and my sister and I are the only surviving members of the pack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The despair in his eyes as he told that story and how vulnerable he looked made him even more seductive, and I slightly bit my bottom lip as my body grew a bit hot and my heartbeat raised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can see that my presence here is unwelcoming, so I think this is my cue to leave.&#34; Nero suddenly uttered, and I felt my heart stop for a slight second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, I grabbed his hand and entangled my finger with his, and said, &#34;No, please, stay!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But his focus swayed towards my father almost as though he was waiting for his approval and not mine, and even though I felt a bit annoyed, his behavior was sensible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since my daughter seems to have taken a liking to you, I too won&#39;t mind you being here.&#34; My mother said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It should have felt strange hearing her say those words since she was so hookup on Killian and me being together. But it didn&#39;t because she&#39;s my mother, and just like me, she wants what best, and Killian was nothing compared to Nero.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now all I had to worry about was my father, and when I gave him a pleading stare, he looked away from me and said, &#34;Since you are my daughter guest, you can stay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like that, I had my hands on a filthy rich alpha. I guess fate really does favor me a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Mr. Fang what a tragic life story. I&#39;m so glad you and your sister survive, even though it&#39;s truly sad that the rest of your pack didn&#39;t.&#34; Karen said as she clutched onto Nero&#39;s arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this point, I was like, &#34;What the fuck was going on?!&#34; But it was clear from her thirst appearance that I had a competition, and it wasn&#39;t my half-sister, but her classmate, Karen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now I knew why she was trying so hard to ruin Nero for me. Unlike having Blake as an opponent, Karen was a bit of a challenge, and if she did want Nero, things would get ugly pretty fast. But I wasn&#39;t ready to be the one to lose him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking up at his face, I pouted and mumbled, making my voice sound pitiful, &#34;It is truly tragic. But you have my comfort just as you are here for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And mine too,&#34; Karen abruptly uttered, and my anger pierced through my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I was about to put Karen in her place, my father cleared his throat and uttered, &#34;We should start the ceremony!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he looked at me, frowned slightly, and said, &#34;Luna, Loretta, can you two join me at the front of the room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though my body was hesitant, I let go of Nero&#39;s hand because I knew not to misbehave when my father&#39;s eyes changes color to red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I followed my parents, keeping my gaze ahead of me and trying my best not to think about how much I wanted to snatch the air from Karen&#39;s lungs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we got to the front of the room, I stood by my father and kept my gaze glued on Nero, feeling a sense of calmness when I noticed that he had taken his hand from Karen&#39;s grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, I accidentally locked eyes with Killian and he had the gaze of someone who wanted to destroy a being, and I didn&#39;t need to guess who that person was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Today, we gathered here as a pack to announce that one of our members has rebelled and forsaken the pack, and it&#39;s my regret to inform you all that it is my daughter.&#34; My father declared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The news about Blake getting renounced by my father has spread like wildfire so no one seems shocked by what he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In the presence of you all, I proclaim that Blake Hayes will no longer be a member of Dark moonlight pack, and she&#39;s an outcast!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never did I imagine such a day, but I was glad it happened, and now, I had one less bitch to worry about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;According to the pack law&#34; My father uttered, pausing with a look of uncertainty in his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swaying my focus off him, I looked at Nero&#39;s emotionless face, and I wondered what he was going to think about the rest of my father&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;According to the pack law, let the hunt for the rogue begin!!&#34; My father loudly uttered with a cold-blooded expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within a matter of seconds, the hall grew noisy with cheering, and it was no surprise that Blake didn&#39;t get a single sympathy from anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This pack was no place for the weak, and if you are, you are worth nothing and just a nobody which is what Blake was.</p>
