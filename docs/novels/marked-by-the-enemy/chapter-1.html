                <p>Rejected as a wolfless disgrace, Blake Hayes endures brutality in her Alpha father&#39;s pack. When her dormant wolf awakens with a dangerous duality, she’s branded a rogue and marked for death. Nero Fang, an undercover Alpha seeking vengeance against her family, becomes her unlikely protector. Bound by a primal attraction that defies their enmity, they navigate a treacherous world of pack politics and forbidden desire. As the full moon threatens to expose Blake’s true power and Nero’s secrets, they must choose: loyalty to blood, or a bond that could destroy them both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being the only wolfless student in a school meant for werewolves is just awful. To be honest, the word &#34;awful&#34; is a bit too simple to express my hate toward school. How do I put it? Oh, right! I got it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hate this shitty place more than the hell hole that I call &#39;home!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, I hate my home too. Let me correct that, &#34;I despise the house I have spent my pathetic life in since I was little.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My life is more like a twisted Cinderella story. However, in my case, I&#39;m the step-sister whose mother is nowhere in sight and whose father detests her as much as his wife and daughter do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth is, he was more considerable to me when I was little until I hit puberty, and my wolf refused to show up like every teenager at my age wolves did. After that disappointing full-moon night, he became a monster that I fear. But mostly, I detest him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the limousine came to a stop, I felt my breath cut because I knew that behind that tinted glass was another shitty place that was ready to cage and torture me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though I wanted to reach for the door handle, fear kept me at a standstill, and I was at war with my anxieties which seemed to be winning so far against my confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I get one bad report from your school concerning you this year, you will visit the &#39;night&#39; for an entire month!&#34; A cold voice speared through my ear, sending chills down my spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to shake off the feeling of panic, I shut my eyelids. Then I slowly raised my lashes and hesitated for a few seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wanting to make the monster more annoyed, I swayed my gaze towards my father, staring directly at his icy expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we glared at each other, I could tell he had no soul behind those icy gray eyes of his because &#34;The Night&#34; was a dark and cold dungeon used to punish the dangerous fugitives within the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Believe me when I tell you that I have been through dreadful things and punishment. Despite all that I have endured, I draw the line at &#34;The Night.&#34; That place is brutal and not for the weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The howls of wolves that got sent there in the past hunted me when I was little and still do even now, and as I intensely gazed at Loki, my only thought was how my father could be so vicious to think of sending me to such a place, even though his savagery wasn&#39;t strange to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although I was sore and had a few words that I wanted to get off my chest, I kept my lips sealed because the truth was, I didn&#39;t want to get Loki mad at me, especially not on the first day of a new semester.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it was no secret to me that there was no way I would stay out of trouble on the first day of school, even if I wanted to do so, and Loki needed to get reminded of that since he had forgotten apparently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone in there knows that I am wolfless, and there is no way that they are not going to pick on me or beat the crap out of me, even if I hide in the bathroom!&#34; I boldly uttered, looking at my father directly into his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not my damn concern!&#34; Loki uttered, scowling at me. &#34;Having you as my daughter is already degrading enough! So I need you to be on your best behavior this year! Do you fucking understand me?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Classic Loki&#39;s behavior! He never seems to give a shit about anything when it comes to me because the biggest disappointment in his life is &#39;me,&#39; and now that I think about all the time that I heard those exact words from him when I needed him to be a father, it pisses me off, a lot!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I will be on my best behavior! But are the fools in there aware that you want me to be on my best behavior?! Because they are the reason for all the bad reports that I got last year!&#34; I calmly uttered, even though I wanted to scream it from a rooftop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his grey eyes cold as always, Loki scowled at me and lashed out, &#34;Well, maybe if you weren&#39;t so,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Useless?! I didn&#39;t ask to get born this way and into this mess! If you want to throw your useless blame on someone, how about you put it on my neglectful mother who ghosted me when I was little, and on you who is the worst father ever!&#34; I shouted without thinking for a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Never speak to the monster without running your words in your head two to three times!&#34; That is my rule, and I just broke it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, I regretted every second that I spent uttering those words because of the look of insanity that spiked in Loki&#39;s eyes as they shifted red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Run!&#34; was the only thought that screamed in my head, but I knew that there was no escape. So I sat still, feeling weak in my knees as my heart pounded while I remembered my father&#39;s brutishness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You little worthless brat!!&#34; Loki shouted, raising his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giving me an icy stare, he released a vicious slap in my face, and I could hear a piercing noise buzzing in my ear as the pain ripped through my head, giving me a nasty headache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly feeling a warm liquid running down my nose, I looked at my palm, and then a drop of blood landed on my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was bleeding from my nostril, and that is the pettiest force Loki&#39;s hit can get. The truth is, he when easy on me this time. Maybe it was because I had to attend a class in like a few minutes from now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throwing Loki a hard stare, I uttered no words to him. Then I pushed the car door open, ran out of the limousine, and headed into the building, ignoring the number of people staring at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With my bloodstained hand clapped tightly over my nose and hoodie covering my face, I rushed down the hallway of my school with my head bent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant I turned the corridor and was about to walk down the hallway, a student suddenly crashed into my shoulder with his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I immediately rushed past him since I wasn&#39;t looking for another bruise to deal with and continued walking fast down the hall, ignoring the pain in my arm and pretending like I didn&#39;t hear him when he shouted after me, &#34;Watch where you are going, you wolfless freak!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s so original! If I had a dollar for every time I have heard that stupid insult, I would be rich enough to buy a plane ticket to get out of this shitty city because it&#39;s all that I have been dreaming of since I was little. But I&#39;m broke!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, when I arrived at the bathroom area, my mind was too disturbed, and I didn&#39;t give the care to stare at the sign on the door and hurriedly pushed it open, rushing inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, I locked the door behind me, and locked it, afraid for someone to walk in on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I rested against its wooden surface, letting out a deep sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After giving myself a few seconds to calm down, I drew my hand from my nose and then gently touched the tip of my nostril before staring at my thumb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The bleeding has stopped,&#34; I mumbled, feeling annoyed at the bloodstain on my palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the hair on my neck suddenly stood when I heard a deep man&#39;s voice, &#34;You are in the wrong room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh shit!&#34; I mumbled beneath my breath with my gaze glued to the floor as it slowly clicked to my mind that I have entered the men&#39;s bathroom.</p>
