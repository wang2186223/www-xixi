                <p>The long game</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****************Blake POV***********</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This house has been so much hell for me that walking back in it makes the hair on my neck stand and my heart double its beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Jason and I arrived inside the ballroom, I felt awkward being here. In the past, I was our family&#39;s shame and they weren&#39;t proud to show me off, so I didn&#39;t get to attend the fancy party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s why I went crazy using Nero&#39;s card to purchase this dress that had a lot of zero on the price tag, and I kind of am hoping that he never asked me about the price or the large sum of money that is missing from the card because I can not pay him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight, I didn&#39;t want to look or be pathetic because my childhood was, my love life is, and that&#39;s how I felt for most of my life. So, this party was my comeback to rewrite my story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My presence in the room caused a sudden silence, and I squeezed Jason&#39;s arm, giving in to the feeling of nervousness that instantly hit my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got you,&#34; Jason whispered, his voice sounding reassuring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking up at him, I gave a smile when he stared down at me, and then I focused ahead of me, keeping my head high.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake!&#34; Loki heartily shouted the moment his eyes locked with mine. &#34;I&#39;m glad you came, my child!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire pack was here, and Loki was acknowledging me in their midst! It felt surreal and a bit shocking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at the alphas around him, Loki had this prideful look in his eyes as he said, &#34;You each owe me a million bucks. I told you that she was going to show up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They gave a shaky laugh, and then elder Clinton put his arm around Loki&#39;s shoulder and said, &#34;Forgive our big mouth. We were stubborn and decided to only believe when we see it happen. Now that Blake is here, we know that our leader is not a liar.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t blame us though. Who would have thought that Blake would be bold enough to show up here after every...&#34; Elder Hall laughed, pausing suddenly without staring at Loki.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t strange that they bet on me attending the party or not. After all, I didn&#39;t have the finest history of about house, and it was just yesterday when Loki changed his mind about killing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Also, some of the wolves in here listened to Loretta instead of Loki, and it would be stupid of me to come, knowing that she wasn&#39;t the slightest bit happy about Loki&#39;s decision. But here I was, among the midst of those that wouldn&#39;t hesitate to rip me apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna is here with her mate!&#34; Loretta cheerily announced as the bloodthirsty look in her eyes faded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leave it to Loretta to take the spotlight off me and on to her daughter. But I didn&#39;t mind because the only reason I came here was to learn about my mother since Loki looked a bit welcoming to me again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Nero and Luna passed me, I squeezed Jason&#39;s arm a bit tighter, holding in my breath to calm myself and still my pounding heart when I noticed his coat around her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nero, it&#39;s nice to see you!&#34; Loki said as they shook hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The look on his face showed that he was proud of the alpha Luna had, and just for a second, I pictured that it was me and not Luna by Nero&#39;s side. Then I brushed the thought aside and faintly smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake, come over here!&#34; Loki shouted, looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hate I have for this man just keeps growing as he continues to pretend to be a father rather than the abuser that he is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping my chin up, I walked over to Loki with Jason by my side, stopping a foot away from him, and said, &#34;Loki, I came as you begged. Now can we talk somewhere quiet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The look of embarrassment that flashed crossed on his face, and the nervous look in the expression of the elder&#39;s faces gave me a satisfying feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about we talked after the announcement?&#34; Loki said with a straight face which only pissed me off, even though it was meant to scare me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t come to party, Loki. I came to get answers. How about you deal with me first, so I can be on my way, and you guys can have your little celebration.&#34; I calmly uttered, not caring for the wrinkles between his brows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can you abandon a party meant to welcome you back in the pack?!&#34; Elder Lurker abruptly announced a bit sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Firstly, his tone had me clenching my jaw as I screwed my face into a frown and glared at him. I didn&#39;t earn my freedom just to get yelled at by a bunch of fakes, self-absorbed, and cold-hearted old men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I looked at Loki and saw the look of hesitation in his eyes, I gave a half-smile, and boldly stated, &#34;Did Loki not tell you guys that I am a rogue and plan to stay that way!?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What!&#34; All the elders shouted in unison, stretching their timeworn eyes wild open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will take that as a &#39;yes.&#39; Well, since he withheld such information from you all, I will clarify things. I have no intention of joining the pack again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Loki&#39;s eyes glowed red as he shouted, &#34;Blake!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The force from his voice, the energy he was releasing, and the murderous look in his eyes vex me and my wolf instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t yell at me, Loki!&#34; I shouted, surprised by my voice and the dominance in my tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hall grew silent, and I could feel people&#39;s eyes on me. Even though I felt my wolf fully awake, I looked at Jason as he stared blankly at me and asked, &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your eyes are glowing red,&#34; Jason whispered as he gave me a soft smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Coughing slightly, Loki cleared his throat and loudly said, &#34;Let&#39;s be transparent here! We as a pack haven&#39;t given my daughter a reason to trust us, so until she does, tonight will only be about lifting the kill order on her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The faces of the elders told me that none of them was happy about such news, including Loretta, which wasn&#39;t strange to me. Even Luna looked a bit pissed when our eyes met. I guess she couldn&#39;t play pretend with such news when she wanted to hear the opposite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glaring at me, elder Arthritis frowned and stated, &#34;Loki, you know we can not have a wolf with an extremely dominant force at such a young stage to be a rogue. Do you know the dang&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut the fuck up, Arthritis!!&#34; Loki coldly mumbled, swaying his cold gaze on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he looked back, took a long stare at me, and said, &#34;Let&#39;s talk!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afterward, Loki walked away, and as I was about to follow him, I caught Nero staring at me, and I hesitated for a moment, holding back my breath before turning away and heading after Loki.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we got to his study, he locked the door, and instead of feeling afraid since the room was soundproof for werewolves, my wolf became aggressive, and I gave her full control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to show yourself or going to keep hidden as you did for all these years!&#34; Loki said, talking in a formal tone, and I knew he was talking to my wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But why was he so casual to her? What did he know about me that he was so hellbent on going against Loretta and even the entire pack for me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A growl suddenly escaped my lips, and I felt violence like nothing before, and the hate that I felt wasn&#39;t mine, it was my wolf. She was mad to the point of wanting him dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be stubborn. You know that you can not keep her safe alone at this stage. You need me to help you out.&#34; Loki said in a calm tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I saw a spark of fear in his eyes when she snarled, and I couldn&#39;t help wondering if this had something to do with the way he treated me, or if there was something more going on because Loki sounded like he knew her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, I felt the rage subside, and my wolf gave control back to me which only left me with more questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Care to explain?&#34; I asked, frowning as I met Loki&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have to stop acting headstrong, Blake, and come back home where you belong. You deserve to lead this park after I&#39;m gone.&#34; Loki casually uttered as though he just didn&#39;t drop a bomb on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Speechless, I took a long look at him and asked, &#34;What nonsense are you talking about now, Loki?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not nonsense. It&#39;s your birthright, Blake.&#34; Loki said with a deadass serious expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nah, now you are making no sense here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake, I need you to get over your pride and see the bigger picture!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What bigger picture, Loki!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence fell between us, and his expression didn&#39;t change as I glared at him, wishing he could just move his lips and spit out the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are my first, and it&#39;s your right to lead after I&#39;m gone.&#34; Loki finally said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I knew that there was more. I could see it in his eyes. Yet I understood if I wanted to find out the truth, I needed to play his game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. I will think about it. Not promising anything though!&#34; I mumbled, crossing my arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s all I asked,&#34; Loki said, smiling faintly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he unlocked the door, and as he was about to head outside, I mumbled, &#34;My mother!... What can you tell me about her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Decide to return to the pack, and after you take over, I will tell you about Skylar,&#34; Loki said, staring back at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking directly into his eyes, I hesitated, holding in my breath, and then asked, &#34;Answer me this, please Is she alive?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Loki said without the slightest bit of hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, I softly exhale, wondering if I should smile, feel sad, or get mad that she has been alive all this time and choose not to see me. Now, I wanted to desperately look into her eyes and scream at her for leaving me in this shit hole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was annoying to know that if I wanted to do so, I had to play a long game with Loki until he is satisfied to tell me where she is.</p>
