                <p>&#34;Can you answer the damn phone!&#34; Nero&#39;s text suddenly displayed on my screen, and I rolled my eyes to the back of my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then before I could reply to his text, my phone started ringing, and I took a long look at Nero&#39;s name before accepting the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you?&#34; His voice rang in my ear.</p>

                <p>&#34;Where?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fact that he was this overprotective was annoying and confusing at the same time, and I had to draw a long breath to calm myself and then reply, &#34;I am not sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stupid uber had tinted windows, and it was hard to figure out where we were from just the front windshield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Share your location,&#34; Nero said in a calm, measured voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, I felt like crying, screaming, and laughing at how bizarre his attitude was and how ignorant he was to not see that this is the behavior that gives me messed up emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying not to lose my damn mind, I scratched my brow, did a little breathing exercise, and whispered, &#34;Fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; Nero mumbled, and I ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I went through my apps, sulking, I couldn&#39;t help wondering if this is how crazy he was with Luna also, or if he just loves to drive me insane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, the map displayed on my screen, and I realized that I was nowhere near the direction that I had given the driver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, I shared my location with Nero and texted him, &#34;I think I&#39;m in trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within a split second, he messaged back, &#34;I&#39;m on my way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking away from the phone, I looked into the mirror to see the driver&#39;s eyes blue, and I knew that I was in some deep mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you let me down here?&#34; I said, trying not to freak out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the car came to a stop, and he looked back at me, smirking as he mumbled, &#34;We are here already.&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>According to the location on my phone map, we were on the road that goes through &#34;Shadowy wood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With every pound my heart made, I regretted focusing on my phone, not paying attention to my surroundings, and getting in this damn car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After he opened his door, my eyes followed him, and then my door suddenly opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I shifted my gaze to the right, I saw a built beta reach into the car, grabbed my arm, and yanked me with force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fighting back, I clenched onto the seat tightly. But he let go of my hand, rushed for my legs, and dragged me out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When my butt hit the ground, I groaned out the pain and looked up, staring at the five robust betas surrounding me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head and heart were a mess with thoughts and emotions running through me endlessly. Then I felt my wolf awakening, and I stood to my feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the wind hit my face, I tugged my loose hair behind my ear and mumbled, &#34;Okay. Do I at least get to know who wants me dead before I die?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one spoke as I stared coldly at their faces one after another, and my wolf got alarmed and defensive when she smelled the deadly aroma in the atmosphere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I gave a soft laugh and said, &#34;It seems like someone didn&#39;t get the memo last night, or don&#39;t any of you respect your leader anymore?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, one of them met my eyes and said, &#34;Where is your wolf, Blake? Or were you calling a bluff about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who wants to meet her, you or the person behind this nonsense?!&#34; I mumbled, not breaking eye contact with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were six of them, and I could smell the last beta in the wood, the beat of his heart, the flow of his breath, and every movement his feet made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard that you have a thing for betas. You even turned down Killian Noble for a beta.&#34; One of them said with a smirk on his face. &#34;Well, there are six of us. How about a hookup, and we might spare your life if we are satisfied?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I frowned, he sneered and let out, &#34;What!? We are not good enough as your so-called Beta?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling enraged now, my brows snapped together as I mumbled, &#34;I will passDid Karen put you guys up to this shit?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As his eyes bored into me, he took a few steps forward towards me, but I stood my ground and listened to him say, &#34;For someone who is about to die, you are very bold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, my phone buzzed, and he rushed to me, not giving me a chance to react, and jerk it from my grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nero,&#34; He mumbled, raising his gaze to look at me. &#34;You are in touch with your sister&#39;s mate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give me back my phone!&#34; I uttered, slowly relinquishing control to my wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring me, he looked at the other Betas and said, &#34;He&#39;s on his way here. Let&#39;s finish this before he arrives.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words made me give up control totally to my wolf, and I immediately screamed in agony, dropping onto my hands and knees trying to endure the anguish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pain from my spine breaking and changing its structure followed by my arms and legs twisting in inverse ways had me screaming as I gazed at them, watching me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, my scream slowly shifted into a howl, and I was now seeing through the eyes of my wolf, gazing at the look of terror on their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell is that?&#34; One of them whispered, looking directly into her eyes. &#34;She is huge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a brief pause. Then my wolf was face to face with five large wolves with their bloodthirsty gazes on her as they growled and snarled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wasting a second, they launched toward her, but she didn&#39;t give them the chance to attack first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The feeling of aggression that overcame her made me feel every beat of my heart as she rushed for the first wolf, piercing her claws into his fur, sinking them deeper into his skin, and viciously tearing through it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the second wolf charged toward her, she struck his face with her paw, dragging her claw into his fur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, we felt a sharp pain in the back of her leg, and teeth inside her flesh, pulling on her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, she kicked back with great force hitting his jaw and causing him to release her foot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she turned, hurried towards him, and grabbed him by the neck, snapping it into two before dropping him to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The remaining three wolves attacked at once, biting into her fur, and she groaned. Yet, the pain only seemed to make her more aggressive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snarling, she turned her focus on the other wolf, and as he was about to pounce on her, she hit her paw in his chest, slamming him to the ground and then bit into his skin until he stopped shaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next wolf sprang up to her, only for his neck to get caught in her mouth and she swung him toward the wood, watching him smash into the tree before she focused on the last wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she took a step towards him, he stepped back, and she moved forward, but he drew back. Then he suddenly turned to run, but she grabbed his back leg, a bit hard into it, and threw him towards the car, crashing him into the windshield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly we heard a growl coming from the woods, and she looked in that direction to see a brown wolf slowly approaching us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this point, I was feeling a bit uncertain that she would be able to fight since her injuries were severe, and her fur was wet with blood. Also, I felt myself regaining control which was not a good sign.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just in time, a car sound caught our attention, and she looked to the right. It was Nero&#39;s vehicle, and I felt a sense of relief wash over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the driver&#39;s door opened, Nero got down and took one look at me, and all I could see in his eyes was rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I shifted back into my human form, feeling my wolf growing calmer and weaker, my eyes remained on Nero until I was staring at a wolf with black thick fur and blood-red eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at his wolf, I fought to keep my eyes open, and the last thought on my mind before I lost consciousness was, &#39;He looks like a wolf I would never dare to fight.&#39;</p>
