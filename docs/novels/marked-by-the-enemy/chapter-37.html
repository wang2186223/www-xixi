                <p>Silently, I watched Nero from the kitchen door, gazing at his back and feeling drunk by his scent which was everywhere on me, and no, it was not because I was wearing his shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dreaming about something bigger than running away from home was never a part of my thought. But now, I feel greedy like I am becoming needy wanting more from him for us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dreaming about something bigger than running away from home was never a part of my thought. But now, I feel greedy like I am becoming needy wanting more from him for us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An addict to Nero is what I was turning into. Everything about him is like a drug I couldn&#39;t get enough of, and thankful I heal faster, or else I wouldn&#39;t have survived last night because I was drowning in him and he was like a rough wave crashing into me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning,&#34; Nero muttered after he turned around and saw me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking away from the door, I approached the counter, stopped in front of him, and whispered, &#34;Good morning,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, he grabbed me by the waist and sat me on the counter, causing a cry to escape my lips because my body was still sore since it was just a few minutes ago before we decided to take a break.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34; Nero said with a hint of worry in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34; I whispered, pretending like I didn&#39;t hear those words because of the memories that came with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is your body okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to annoy him, I pouted and whispered, &#34;Why wouldn&#39;t I be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because you kept wailing...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hastily, I clapped my hand over his mouth, giving him a warning look when he chuckled, looking satisfied in himself for teasing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I finally drew my hand back, he smirked and said, &#34;Do you want us to stay home so you can rest?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I have a test to take today,&#34; I mumbled, looking at the plate beside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay. Then I will drop you off, even though I have already missed my class time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You missed your class Wait. What&#39;s the time?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Picking his phone off the counter, he turned on the screen, stared at it, and mumbled, &#34;Eleven-thirty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it, Nero! I missed my test.&#34; I shouted in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What! You were the one who kept holding me and moving your hips.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahh! Stop talking!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyed, I was about to get off the counter when he drew the plate closer to me and said, &#34;Grilled cheese sandwich. You should have some to replenish your energy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; I whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pouting at the bread, I picked it up, frowned at Nero, and then bit aggressively into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After I was done with the second sandwich, I was about to leave the counter when I picked up Jason&#39;s scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once my feet were back on the tiles again, I gazed at the door and saw him, standing in the way of the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When our eyes locked, he hastily stared over my head and had this anxious look on his face as he gazed at Nero.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning,&#34; I mumbled, feeling awkward because his confession never did leave my thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning,&#34; Jason said, lowering his gaze for a second to look at me before staring at Nero.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear that he had words to tell him. But I was the one holding him back from speaking his mind, so I whimpered, &#34;I should get ready for class.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving both of them alone in the living room, my ears were alert as I headed upstairs. But the fact that neither of them said anything useful the entire time I was gone left me even more curious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their silence lasted even after I got dressed and came back downstairs to meet them. It was difficult now not to suspect that something was fishy about their behavior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what made it worse was when Nero handed me the jeep spare key and said, &#34;You should drive yourself to school.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to get the truth out of him, I pouted and mumbled, &#34;But you said..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know what I said, but something came up, and I need to take care of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated, I snatched the key from his hand and walked off, feeling hesitant to go to class now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But because of Mr. Franklin&#39;s stupid test, I had to go, knowing that I didn&#39;t want to repeat another semester.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got on campus, it was almost one o&#39;clock, and I was crying in my head that Mr. Franklin would take pity on me for whatever reason as I hurried down the hallway, when I unexpectedly bumped into someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, I looked up, and staring back at me was a gamma. She was really pretty and had this fierce aura about her that left me gawking speechlessly for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am so sorry,&#34; She let out softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, no. I should be the one who&#39;s sorry. I bumped into you first, and my apologies for that.&#34; I hastily said with a smile to smooth the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, but if I weren&#39;t wandering around here like a fool, you probably wouldn&#39;t have run into me, so I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the calmness in her tone and the gentleness in her expression, she seemed like a really nice person, and I couldn&#39;t help asking, &#34;You were wandering around?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. I am kind of on a campus tour, also new to town, and I wanted to complete my last semester hopefully here. So I came to take a peek at the campus.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I can help show you around later if you want and have the patience to wait. I have a thing to discuss with my instructor first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, if you don&#39;t mind, I can just follow you. That&#39;s kind of a tour, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mmmh, Okay let&#39;s do that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she smiled at me, I returned a slight grin and uttered, &#34;I am Blake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With gentle eyes, her voice was so polite when she replied, &#34; Scarlet is mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a pretty name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks. Yours is pretty too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Have you ever met a stranger and it just feels right? That&#39;s how this moment felt with Scarlet. She was so sweet and different from what I have been greeted with within this damn place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we arrived at Mr. Franklin&#39;s office, he looked up from his desk, glared at me, and mumbled, &#34;See who finally has time for school.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am truly sorry that I missed your test, Mr. Franklin.&#34; I pleadingly uttered since lying wasn&#39;t an option, and the truth wasn&#39;t for others ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are lucky you have connections. But my advice to you, Miss Hayes, or would you prefer Mrs. Fang?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wha&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Connect don&#39;t carry people too far without hard work. You should keep that in mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although I was infuriated, I couldn&#39;t help wondering what he meant by I have connections. My father didn&#39;t know that I missed my test. No one else did, except Nero, and then everything made sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will take your test tomorrow. Apparently, today will not work for you.&#34; Mr. Franklin mumbled with an air quote.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t say that. I am prepare to take the test right now!&#34; I blurted out in annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good for you. I&#39;m glad to know that you have some sense of seriousness left. But tomorrow is when you will receive your test.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly, getting a hold of my tongue, I bit down on my lip to stop myself from lashing out at him and calm down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I looked at Scarlett and said, &#34;I guess I am free to show you around the building now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt so embarrassing that she was there to see all that happened, and as we walked back down the hallway, I felt too ashamed to talk to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have two last names?&#34; Scarlet whispered, looking modest when I peered at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hayes is my father&#39;s last name, and Fang is is kind of my mate&#39;s surname,&#34; I mumbled beneath my breath in reluctance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, you are mark!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yep,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It must be nice,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she said those words, I realized that it was actually really nice having Nero as my mate because he was incredible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Mr. Franklin made me feel somewhat guilty about it, it was nice that Nero cared enough to put his reputation on the line for my grades. That was the first time someone had cared about my education.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time drifted by along with little conversations between Scarlet and I, and finally, we were standing outside of the campus building because I was done showing her the entire inside part of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are such a sweetheart for helping me out!&#34; Scarlet said, fixing her eyes on mine as she took my hand in hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks. It was fun.&#34; I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should grab lunch sometime Please say, &#39;yes.&#39; I have been really bored since I arrived, and you seem like a genuine soul.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Umm, yes. Of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As my lips settled in a smile, I suddenly heard Nero shout out my name, &#34;Blake!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking around, I felt a sense of confusion sweep through me, and then my gaze rested on he and Jason, approaching us with serious expressions on their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nervously, I waited for him to reach me along with Jason before asking, &#34;Is everything okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Nero uttered, looking at Scarlet, and I swear I saw a spark of rage in his eyes for a second. &#34;Who is she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s Scarlet,&#34; I mumbled in an attempt to clear the atmosphere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What&#39;s your plan</p>
                
                
                
                <p>******Nero POV******</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at me, Scarlet smiled, and I felt my anger stab me when she asked Blake, &#34;Who is he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hesitation settled in Blake&#39;s gaze when she took a long peek at me. Then she looked at Scarlet and shuttled, &#34;Umm. He&#39;s my&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow uncoiling of anger seared through me as I stared at Scarlet, and knowing the exact kind of orders my father usually gives to her, something snapped inside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without giving myself time to think straight, I grabbed Blake&#39;s hand and pulled her away, not letting go, even though she was walking stiffly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we got to my car, I opened the door, frown at the touch of annoyance in her expression, and said, &#34;Get in!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a couple of seconds, Blake took a long look at me, and a question was in her eyes, but she didn&#39;t speak and just stared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike Jason, Scarlet is different. Her loyalty lies with my father despite her feelings for me, and I should know that because we have worked together for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she thinks Blake is a threat, she will go in for the kill if my father orders it, and I know she is going to get her ass killed if she&#39;s stupid enough to face Blake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So to protect Blake from getting involved in an even more disastrous situation with my pack, I needed her to stay as far away from Scarlet as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flash of annoyance glowed in Blake&#39;s eyes as she mumbled, &#34;I thought you and Jason have a thing to take care of, so why are you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were following Scarlet&#39;s scent, and I know now that she purposely led us here so she can pin my back against the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I felt uneasy that you were alone, so once Jason and I got done, I came to pick you up,&#34; I uttered, peeking at Jason and Scarlet a few steps from us. &#34;You are done with your classes, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Blake mumbled, looking back at Scarlet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great, let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get in the car, Blake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pouting, she walked past me, got into the seat, and I slammed the door after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After getting behind the steering wheel, I took one last look at Jason and Scarlet before driving off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment we got home and walked through the front door, Blake stopped in the hallway and mumbled, &#34;Do you not like Scarlet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words brought me to a standstill, and I turned around to meet her eyes, wondering how I should answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, I sighed and let out, &#34;No. So stay away from her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; Blake blurted out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because! Because I don&#39;t like her, okay? She doesn&#39;t seem like a good person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I like her. She seems nice,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake, no!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just met her for a couple of minutes and didn&#39;t even talk to her. How can you judge her like that!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning at the stubborn look on her face, I hesitated for a moment and then asked, &#34;How long have you known this Scarlet person for?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darting her gaze away from me with a pout, she puffed and whispered, &#34;Well&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s what I thought,&#34; I told her, feeling a sense of remorse. &#34;After everything that others have done to you, a friend is not something you should be chasing after, especially with a stranger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A reluctant look settled on Blake&#39;s face. Then she let out a heavy sigh and gave me a faint smile, &#34;I get it. You are just looking out for me. But I will be fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a hint of sadness clouded her eyes, she downcast her gaze and whispered, &#34;I don&#39;t want me to be a burden to you. It will take away from our relationship.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not true,&#34; I told her, even though that was somewhat accurate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We both know that&#39;s a lie. But you don&#39;t have to stress about every little thing I do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you that&#39;s not it I have had my fair share of experiences, okay! So this is more about me, than you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Canceling the space between us, I took her hands in mine, squeezed them, and said, &#34;I just need you to be safe. That&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile hovered over my lips to distract Blake, and when she beamed softly, my hand moved up to her face, slowly tracing the outline of her lips with my thumb, mumbling, &#34;Let&#39;s not fight over this, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. I will stay away from Scarlet.&#34; Blake whispered with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wild card is what Scarlet is, and the thought of her trying to get close to Blake, for whatever reason, haunted my mind all afternoon, and when the cloud darkened into night hours, I found myself feeling too stressed to fall asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the further I drifted into my thoughts, the weaker my body became, and I was about to finally doze off to sleep when I heard footsteps in the hallway, getting closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, I got out of bed, walked over to the door, and opened it to see a touch of reticence in Blake&#39;s expression as she stared at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After she walked into the room, I shut the door, looked back at her, and asked, &#34;What is it? Are we out of milk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I didn&#39;t fix the drink because my dad texted me.&#34; Blake said, walking over to the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After she sat down and didn&#39;t finish her statement, I muttered, &#34;Okay, and?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He wants both of us to attend the pack meeting a day from tomorrow,&#34; Blake let out slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not knowing what to say next, I walked over to the bed, sat beside her, and rested my palm on the back of her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was quiet for a couple of seconds. Then Blake raised her gaze and mumbled, &#34;What are your plans?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I studied her gaze and said with a casual tone, &#34;Be precise,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have the wealth to travel to any country in the world, so why settle for such a small, remote state. Don&#39;t you have bigger plans?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know! Something more than this place more teaching&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cutting Blake off because I knew where this discussion was going, I told her, &#34;I have seen and done it all, and right now, a remote state is exactly where I need to be at this point in my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see,&#34; Blake murmured, sounding a bit disappointed. &#34;I thought&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are your plans?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t have one right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a couple of seconds, we stared into each other&#39;s eyes without saying a word. Then I abandoned her gaze and said, &#34;Find one. You are too young not to have a plan for your life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My words were followed by silence, and I knew not to lecture her because I wanted the conversation to die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The quietness dragged on for a while until Blake pushed her hair back and mumbled, &#34;Tomorrow, Loki might suggest that I become next in line to him, and I don&#39;t want to inconvenience you by&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then you agree with him.&#34; I let out, feeling frustrated with myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t want to be a burden to me because it will take away from our relationship, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, but&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Power can make that happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, but you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will be right by your side as your partner and supporter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking hesitant, her eyes bore into mine, and she whispered, &#34;Are you should you are okay with this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hundred percent,&#34; I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence fell between us as interest lit up Blake&#39;s eyes, and she wrapped her hands around my neck, being so freaking vulnerable with the soft look on her face as she let out, &#34;You are amazing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling miserable, I watched her giggle happily and hastily uttered, &#34;Okay. But no matter what, we should enjoy every moment together like as if it&#39;s our last!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like our last. How could three words mess me up so fast so badly that when Blake suddenly met my mouth with a kiss, I got distracted, and even though I wanted to put in the effort, my thoughts left me numb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet I didn&#39;t pull back from her lips. But she did only a few seconds in, looking confused and a bit hurt as she muttered, &#34;Are you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yep,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With uncertainty in her tone, she drew her hands away from my neck and whispered, &#34;Okay I should go, fix my drink.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Blake stood to walk away, I hugged her from the back, and rested my head against her waist, crawling my hands under her blouse, and hugging her bare stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nero,&#34; Blake uttered, sounding as if she was holding herself in check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure. Let&#39;s enjoy every moment together like it&#39;s our last.&#34; I mumbled, kissing the soft skin of her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who is he</p>
                
                
                
                <p>******Luna POV*******</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was quiet for quite a while as the elders stood around an oval table, and I heard one of them mumble, sounding disappointed, &#34;Where is Blake&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I too was wondering where she was, hoping that she stay the hell there and didn&#39;t show her face. But when I looked at my father, he seemed more worried than angry, and that just pissed me off even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After he finally sat down at the head of the table, the rest of us took our seats. Then my mother glared at him and said softly, &#34;Your daughter is late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swaying his gaze away from my father&#39;s fierce stare, Elder Grand focused on the other elders and said, &#34;We all know how reckless Blake has been acting these days. But she can not even show up on tim&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watch your mouth, Grand.&#34; My father coldly grumbled, throwing him a hard stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence followed his statement, and the other elders kept a mutual expression on their faces as they gazed at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although no one would dare say it out loud, the pack was about to have an inner war of division, and I hated that this was even happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My father has called for a pack meeting, and that is an indirect challenge to my mother because we both know it has always been Blake, and only the fact that she was wolfless stood in the way of my father choosing her over us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, it is clear that my mother and I have to fight for what was handed to me on a silver platter the moment I had my first transformation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the door flew open, and Blake walked in with Nero by her side, and my eyes were glued to them until I felt Killian touch my thigh, pinching my skin hard, and I felt a sense of chill crept through me as I directed my gaze to the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was awfully silent as Blake and Nero took their seat in the midst of all twenty-four elders, and after a while, I raised my gaze, staring at Blake and meeting her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gosh, I detest the sight of her, and how relaxed she looks sitting next to Nero is just outrageous because I knew she is a harlot who always had her eyes on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I know her being with him is her way of defying me, trying to snatch everything that should be mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After taking a long look at me, Blake smirked faintly at me with pride in her eyes, and the feeling of hate squeezed my heart tightly in its grips, causing me to dig my nails into my skin until I felt a wet liquid pulling down my finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I called you all here to let you guys know that my daughters have come of age to get more involved with the issue of our pack, and&#34; My father let out calmly, yet his expression was deadass serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We know. But we also know that that&#39;s not all to it, right our leader?&#34; Elder Carla asked with a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyeing her, I watched her throw my mother a side-eye, and I wasn&#39;t the tiniest bit confused because, before this so-called meeting hosted by my father, my mother had a little gathering with those that stand with us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, Carla!&#34; My father uttered, sounding pressed. &#34;We all know that I don&#39;t have a male heir and have two daughters. Now that they have mates, it&#39;s safe to say that they can now be more intimate with the affairs of the pack because sooner than later, one of them will have to take over from me, and...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If this meeting is about our next leader, then it shouldn&#39;t be a discussion because we all know that Luna will be just perfect for the position.&#34; Elder Carla blurted out, and I just knew my mother programmed her to be her spokesman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gazing at Carla, my father&#39;s face was ravaged with rage as he looked her dead in the eyes and firmly said, &#34;I don&#39;t give a shit about your opinion, so cut me off one more time and!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some of the elders slightly cleared their throats and the others seemed focused on nothing other than my father&#39;s red eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though a minority of the elders wouldn&#39;t agree with what he was about to say because of my mother, there was still the majority of the elders who felt the way he did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So are you announcing that you have already made up your mind on Blake?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And if our leader did, what&#39;s wrong with that?&#34; Elder Oscar asked with a humble tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room immediately grew noisy with all the elders throwing their thoughts in the open, arguing aggressively while we watched in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you all shut the hell up!&#34; My father finally roared, looking like he was fed up with their noise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The was still mumbling going on in the room, but when he went into his Alpha state, silence seized the moment, sealing everyone&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You guys may be elders, but I&#39;m still the leader of this pack, and I wouldn&#39;t think twice to put you all in worse conditions if you don&#39;t remember your place! So do not test my damn patience!&#34; My father yelled, gazing around the room with bloodthirsty eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a couple of quiet minutes, he darted his gaze around the room and let out, &#34;As full-grown individuals, how about you learn to take turns to talk!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one dared to speak for a couple of seconds, and I glanced over to Blake and Nero, wondering what was going on in her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could he look so annoyingly comfortable with her when he was never like that with me. Karen was right all along. Thinking about that bitch is just as frustrating as looking at Blake because it&#39;s her fault that I am stuck with her abusive brother!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can we not want Luna when we have never seen Blake&#39;s wolf?&#34; Elder Hall mumbled, pausing with a nervous look on his face. &#34;I will never call my leader or his daughter a liar, but no one has seen her wolf, and it is baffling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other elders slowly shook their heads in agreement with him, and I could see the look of hesitation on my father&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s true. We all know Luna&#39;s wolf. She has run with the pack every full moon since her first transformation. But not Blake. How can we trust a leader who we have never seen her wolf?&#34; Elder Tio calmly uttered, almost like he was picking his words wisely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We all know the kind of wolf Blake&#39;s grandfather is, so if she&#39;s anything like him, I will be hundred percent with her being our&#34; Elder Scrolls blurted out, his face turning pale instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room grew cold as though he had said something forbidden, and when I looked at Blake, she looked just as confused as me, even Nero looked shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My grandfather?&#34; Blake mumbled, looking at my father with a touch of anger in her eyes. &#34;Loki, what is he talking about?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The death stare that my father gave Elder Scrolls made me realize that those words were not meant for Blake&#39;s ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the heck is so special about her that everything about her life has to be some big secret that even she doesn&#39;t know about, and yet, it seems like all the elders, including my mother and father, know more than they are telling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s my grandfather, Loki?!&#34; Blake asked, and I could tell from my father&#39;s reluctant gaze that he hated being put on the spot by her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he didn&#39;t reply, I eyed Blake, and she looked hysterical with a touch of rage glowing in her eyes as she shouted, &#34;Who is he, Loki?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was being blackmailed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dragging echo of nothing but silence in the room as I waited for Loki to give me an answer about my grandfather was infuriating, and yet, I was patient, hoping that I would not have to lose my damn mind before someone gave me an answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after a couple of prolonged silence, I stood to my feet, looked Loki directly in his eyes, and said, &#34;Nero, get up. We are leaving!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t me calling a bluff. My anger was going like a bat out of hell, and I felt like talking to Loki about this now would only make me even more frustrated, and I might do something insane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though rage was the only emotion I felt at that moment, the instant Nero didn&#39;t hesitate and woke from his seat, I felt a sense of comfort like I wasn&#39;t alone in this mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before all this, I thought I had some kind of identity for myself. The wolfless hybrid whose mother abandoned her, leaving her in the care of the monster and his wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, I don&#39;t even know who I fucking am anymore, and when I gazed at Nero&#39;s alluring eyes, I couldn&#39;t help thinking that although there is a lot I don&#39;t know about him, at least he&#39;s not lying to me like these bunch of hypocrites.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darting my gaze away from Nero, I stared around the table at the faces of the elders, and gosh, it was pretty clear that they were all liars. They couldn&#39;t even look me in my eyes without a look of nervousness spiking in theirs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All along, I thought my mother was this self-absorbed woman who didn&#39;t give a shit about me, and now, I suddenly find out that I have a grandfather who these deceivers know!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It is so annoying because now I am wondering and frustrated about just how much of my life and my identity have been ripped from me, and why the heck did they feel the need to hide that aspect of me!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ready to leave?&#34; Nero whispered, placing his hand on my waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at the touch of concern in his gaze, I squeezed my phone to calm my rage and mumbled, &#34;Yeah, the last thing I want is to lead this pac.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s talk in the study!&#34; Loki blurted out, standing to his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I don&#39;t think I can trust a single word of yours right now!&#34; I let out in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, I caught him eyeing Nero, and within a split second, Nero patted my back, whispering, &#34;If you need an answer, you got to talk to him, but if Umm, you two should talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although I wanted to leave because my anger was getting in the way of my reasoning, when Nero said those words, I took a moment to hold my breath, stabilizing my heartbeat before giving him a faint smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I focused on Loki, wondering if the truth is something I was going to get finally, and mumbled, &#34;Fine. Let&#39;s talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second, Nero&#39;s grip on my waist got a bit tight before he let go and sat back down in his seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I followed Loki out the door, I took a quick peek at Nero and then headed out of the room with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The walk was silent, and I managed to hold my peace until we got to his office. But the moment Loki locked the study door, I let out, &#34;Who is he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Scrolls was talking about my father, Lon Hayes. Since you don&#39;t know, he was a quite powerful leader and Alpha, although most people were scared of him because he ruled with an iron fist.&#34; Loki explained, his tone casual and stable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No words could express my emotions at this point when I lashed out, &#34;Don&#39;t you dare try to mess with my head and treat me as a fool!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will never,&#34; Loki said, looking so damn serious as though that was going to make me believe him. &#34;I am sorry I never told you about my side of the family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The anger that I thought I had control over broke loose, making me so infuriated that I refused to speak for a while because I knew that I was going to explode if I did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, when I felt a sense of control again, I slowly exhaled and said, &#34;We both know Scrolls wasn&#39;t talking about your father, Loki. The atmosphere in that room the moment he uttered those words had nothing to do with Lon Hayes but my mother&#39;s father! So let&#39;s not act a fool, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In between a scoff and a smirk, he frowned and mumbled, &#34;Your mother&#39;s father? Come on Blake&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop! Stop with the lies, Loki!! I just want to know the truth! So stop toying with my damn emotions!&#34; I screamed so loud, feeling a mild sense of relief afterward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room instantly fell silent after my meltdown, and Loki didn&#39;t break eye contact with me for quite a while before he let out, &#34;Fine. You were right. It&#39;s was your mother&#39;s father Scrolls spoke about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; I mumbled the only word that I could think about at that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Scrolls made that remark because your grandfather is an Ultima and your grandmother is a human, which makes your mother a hybrid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You had a fifty-fifty chance of getting your grandmother or grandfather&#39;s side of genetics as your mother did. But she, well she was more human than wolf, and never did go through her transformation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For so long, I have been longing for such a moment, and now that I have a glance at it, I felt numb and my mind went blank because I didn&#39;t know how to process everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s why I never give up on you because an Ultima is a rare kind of breed, and even though your mother wasn&#39;t one, I trusted that you were going to have the gene,&#34; Loki said with a glint of pride in his expression like he had won a trophy or something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So my grandparents Are they alive? Is my mother with them? Why did you you guys keep their identities from me? Who are they? Do you know where they stay?&#34; I mumbled, putting all my thoughts into words one after the other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow! Hold up now. Remember, this is a trade. You get information for doing what I want, and so far, I can say, &#39;it has not been a fair trade on my end.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you kidding me right now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I am serious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The audacity of this devil I called, &#34;Father,&#34; is a curse a punishment for whatever the fuck I did in my past life because that&#39;s the only logical reason I can think of that won&#39;t make me lose my damn mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, how about we head downstairs, you behave, and go through your transformation so the elders can be convinced that you are truly your grandfather&#39;s bloodline, an Ultima, okay?&#34; Loki said gently, and yet, it felt as though I was being blackmailed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I didn&#39;t utter a word because I was trying to get past my frustration, Loki let out, &#34;I promise to keep my word to you, Blake. I swear to you. All you have to do is put in the effort in being the pack leader and succeed at it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you so obsessed with me running this damn pack? Luna is your daughter too!&#34; I mumbled, knowing once again, that Loki had me tightly in his grip, and escape was not an option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you willing to go back downstairs and play nice?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dodged Another question, and I don&#39;t think I will even get an honest answer for it at least not today, and the only thing I could do was continue playing Loki&#39;s sick game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But at least it seems not to be in vain so far because I know three family members already that exist. Just a bit longer, and I will be able to find out the truth, hopefully.</p>
