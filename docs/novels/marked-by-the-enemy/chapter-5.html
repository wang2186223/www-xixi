                <p>********Luna POV********</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This mansion has never been so irksome and loud as it is tonight, and it is all because of my bastard sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since she decided to run away from school, my father has been acting up and having everyone&#39;s heart up in their ass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the day I could remember, I never liked her. But now, I despise her even more and I don&#39;t care if she never returns home. That way, she would be doing all of us a favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I mean, what&#39;s the use of having a useless sister who can&#39;t even transform like everyone else, even though her faults do me more good than harm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It grew silent for a moment. Then my father robust tone suddenly vibrated through the walls, and I covered my head with a pillow, hoping that would make me deaf and save me from this torture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then a sudden knock on my room door forced me to yank the pillow away from my ear and threw the blanket off me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyed, I marched over to the door and opened it, frowning at Rebecca, our in-house maid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Say something sensible or get punished for disturbing my peace!&#34; I uttered, crossing my arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Milady, your mother requests your presence in the dining room to have dinner with our Alpha and her!&#34; Rebecca said with her head bent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing in a deep breath, I shut my eyes for a moment, knowing very well that dinner would be a disaster. But what mother wants, mother gets, so I knew to obey her fully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I arrived in the dining hall, it was quiet, and I stared at my father, seated at the table, glaring at the maids as they served him his food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they got done, he leaned forward, took a sip of the soup, and then his face hardened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You call this food!&#34; My father screamed, pushing every single dish off the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, my heart pounded in my chest as the sound of plates shattering and bowls breaking echoed in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a hint of burning rage in my father&#39;s eyes, he kicked the chair to the floor and roared, &#34;Am I paying you fools to serve me trash!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quietly, I walked over to my seat and then locked eyes with my mother. But she said nothing, and even though my father was fearful, my mother was the one I fear the most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although both my parents shower me with love and affection, it was because I was their pride and joy, the child who turned out perfect, just as they had hoped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Growing up and seeing everything that Blake had been through, I wasn&#39;t planning on being the disappointment that she was, and fortunately, fate was on my side, and I&#39;m exactly what my dad thought Blake was going to be, a brutal wolf who can carry on the family legacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After pacing around a bit, my father&#39;s scowled and harshly mumbled, &#34;Where the hell is she! Her scent can&#39;t just vanish without a trace!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was so thunderous, that none of the servants dared look him directly in his eyes. Instead, they kept their heads bent with their hands clapped to their sides while they humbly stood in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth is, my father still has hope in Blake that&#39;s why he still kept her around, and that&#39;s why I feel extremely pissed right now because I, his perfect daughter is right here, and he&#39;s worked up over a nobody.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enraged by the look of anger in his eyes, I glared at him and harshly said, &#34;Daddy, why are you being stressed up for something so worthless like Blake!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up!!&#34; My father intoned, giving me a cold stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though he is my father, the fact that he is the alpha of the pack outweighed that, and I immediately sealed my lips together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gracefully placing her teacup on the table, my mother looked at him and calmly intoned, &#34;When you find Blake, what punishment do you plan for this absurd behavior of hers?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though my father was the alpha, his wife came from a line of powerful gammas, and most of the members of the pack respected her, even more than him, that&#39;s why my father wants Blake to be powerful, and my mother knew that, so did I.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Blake is his illegitimate child, he felt like if she got mated to someone influential, that would increase his standing in the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Blake getting mated to someone powerful was a chance in a million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I mean, which alpha would find a wolfless hybrid attractive? It&#39;s just simply impossible, and I am glad that it is that way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Imagine if she was a competitor. Since there can be only one star shining in this house, I will have to cut her light off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though that&#39;s never going to happen, I still feel like killing the life in her eyes just by thinking about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed like my mother got sick of my dad not answering her question and saying anything because she suddenly uttered, &#34;If you don&#39;t punish her, the others will feel a bit annoyed if they find out you are compromising the pack laws for your daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not compromising the pack law, Loretta!&#34; My father shouted. &#34;You just have to wait for me to get my hands on her, then you will know what her punishment would be!!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Picking up her teacup, my mother eyed me, and then I smirked at her as I thought, &#39;You are, you dead wolfless trash!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After calming down a bit, my father picked his chair up and sat down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, the door opened and Alaska rushed into the room, hurrying towards him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you guys found her yet!&#34; My father harshly asked his beta, clutching his fist as he stood from his seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha, we have wolves standing watch at every place we assume that she may go, and wolves are searching for her. But we don&#39;t have any leads on her whereabouts.&#34; Alaska said, resting his hands behind his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of anger flared across my dad&#39;s face, and with not a single mercy in his eyes, he slammed his fist against Alaska&#39;s nose before swinging another hit on his cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood dribbled out of Alaska&#39;s mouth onto the floor, and dark blood rolled down his nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glaring at Alaska, I felt entertained by the look of anguish on his face, even though I was annoyed that my father hit him because of Blake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where the hell is she?!&#34; My father shouted in his beta&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know, Alpha.&#34; Alaska cried with his head bent, staring down at his blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Find her!&#34; My father whispered, cleaning his bloodstain hands on Alaska&#39;s shirt. &#34;Or else, I will need a new beta! Got it?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, master!!&#34; Alaska uttered before running out of the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down, I was hoping with everything in me that they would never find her, and yet, a part of me wanted it to happen just to glare at her face as she took her punishment, knowing that she would always be the wolfless bastard child and nothing more.</p>
