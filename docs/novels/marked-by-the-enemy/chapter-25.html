                <p>It won&#39;t happen now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**********Luna POV***********</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing had been the same in this house since Blake went through her so-called transformation. My father and mother had grown a bit distant, and although they hadn&#39;t fought, I knew that the words they were holding back could start a war within the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad!&#34; I shouted, stopping at the steps when I saw him grab the front door handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna!&#34; My father mumbled, turning around to face me with a weak smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With my eyes fixed on his, I walked down the last two steps and hurried over to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you going?&#34; I asked, grinning at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, I was enraged inside about the sudden liking that he had taken towards Blake, and I wanted so badly to scream in his face and let my anger out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then again, that wouldn&#39;t get me anywhere. So, I am going to remain daddy&#39;s little obedient girl while being not so timid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Somewhere,&#34; My father said, looking a bit haste to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does that somewhere have a name?&#34; I mumbled beneath my breath while keeping a stiff smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he stared at me, I widened my eyes with my hands clutched behind my back, knowing he couldn&#39;t resist the childish look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, a sigh escaped my dad&#39;s lips, and he mumbled &#34;I&#39;m going to Highlight hotel to have a word with Jason.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; I muttered, losing my smile immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last night was the perfect assurance that I needed to make sure that Nero and Blake weren&#39;t together, and her kissing Jason and revealing that he marked her was just perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If my father is going to talk to him, then that could mean one thing, he wanted them to split up, and I wasn&#39;t having any of that nonsense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last thing I wanted was Blake being without a mate again. Because for some unknown reason, Nero doesn&#39;t even look at me like the way he looks at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s with all the questions, Luna?&#34; My father mumbled, hardening his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you afraid to answer her questions though?&#34; My mother&#39;s voice echoed from behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning my head to glance at her, I felt goosebumps raised on my skin by her cold eyes and immediately focused on my father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since Luna refused Killian as her mate, it&#39;s only logical that Blake has him as hers. After all, the Noble is the best choice here.&#34; My father said as his gaze danced over my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know mating doesn&#39;t work like that! Blake already has her mate! Breaking them up would mess her up!&#34; My mother said in a calm tone, but I knew that she was infuriated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Noble is among those that have great importance in the pack, and if Blake was to become Killian&#39;s mate, my father was going to get what he always wanted, a greater influence in the pack than my mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But it wouldn&#39;t kill her. You of all people should know that.&#34; My father said with a deadpan expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he turned his back to us, opened the door, and walked out, leaving me staring at his back fading out the door before it shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After standing still, I turned around to face my mother, and she suddenly walked away, heading upstairs. But I immediately chased after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we got to her bedroom, she stopped, gazed at me, and said, &#34;Do you know what this means?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake can not live?&#34; I mumbled, knowing from the death stare that she was giving me that she wanted someone dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly. If your father is being headstrong about Killain and Blake getting together that could only mean he&#39;s thinking about her being the one to run the pack!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the fuck!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Language, Luna!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence fell between us as I scowled at her, annoyed that she cared about my words in such a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Folding my fingers into a fist, I felt anger stab its way into my heart as I shouted, &#34;He&#39;s going to turn over the pack to Blake?! But she&#39;s a bastard&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, she&#39;s not.&#34; My mother blurted out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The immediate silence that settled in the room grew loud as each second passed without my mother giving me more explanation than the nonsense that she just said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to explain yourself?&#34; I finally mumbled, getting a grip on my anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake is the daughter of Loki and his legitimate mate, the one before me.&#34; My mother said, lowering her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, I felt like I couldn&#39;t breathe and was drowning in my anger as my wolf awoke and I started to feel the transformation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna, get yourself under control!&#34; My mother shouted with a mixture of fear and anger in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling my nails shift slowly into claws, I stared down at the blood dripping from my hand onto the tiles before snapping out of the transformation phase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then who am I?&#34; I whispered, feeling like the answer was going to make me lose it completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are Loki&#39;s and I&#39;s daughter!&#34; My mother mumbled, glaring at me as her eyes shifted blue. &#34;And that&#39;s all that matters!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the careful way of saying that I have been living in Blake&#39;s identity all along, and the bastard had been me all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t tell you the truth because I never expected Blake to become something that your father will care this much about.&#34; My mother said with a note of desperation in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was freaking unbelievable that I felt like I was having a sick nightmare that I needed to wake up from and never dream about it again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But now that she has gained his attention, we need to act now. Even though Loki will be mad if she does die, he can not hold us accountable if he doesn&#39;t want a war within the pack and to lose the last of his heir.&#34; My mother hastily let out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scowling at her, I tried to stabilize my breathing and lashed out, &#34;Why would you even leave her alive in the first place for all these years, knowing her identity?! Now, I can&#39;t trust you to do the damn thing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna! Watch how you speak to me!&#34; My mother shouted with her blue eyes glowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do what you have to do, and I will do what I have to do!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should not act&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If Blake doesn&#39;t die today!... I&#39;m going to lose my damn mind and go insane! You don&#39;t want that, mother! You don&#39;t want a river of blood in this mansion, do you?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After intensely staring at me, my mother sighed and then walked over to the dresser. Once she had gotten ahold of her phone, I watched as she strolled through it for a moment and then placed it to her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My ears were alert when I heard her say, &#34;Hey, brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uncle Rolex, my mother&#39;s oldest brother and the head of punishment at, &#34;The Night.&#34; My mother may have the pack respect, but uncle Rolex was feared by many, and he loves it, and so did I. He was kind of my role model.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;s my baby sister doing?&#34; Uncle Rolex said, his voice emotionless as always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not good.&#34; My mother said, pausing as she eyed me. &#34;It&#39;s time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want Blake dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mmmh, yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The line grew silent, and I couldn&#39;t help wondering why uncle Rolex was hesitant to respond since I was impatient to know if Blake was going to die today or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Uncle Rolex said from the other end of the call, &#34;The last time, you told me not to kill her because you were afraid of&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been nineteen years, Rolex. It&#39;s safe to assume that it is never going to happen.&#34; My mother mumbled, avoiding my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, I was really confused and annoyed that so much was being kept a secret from me, and I didn&#39;t realize how much I was kept in the dark until today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, you are sure that you want to do this?&#34; Uncle Rolex asked, his voice uncertain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes!&#34; My mother said, looking directly into my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay then, consider it done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. Make sure&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing leads back to you. I know, little sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After my mother ended the call, I immediately asked, &#34;Why didn&#39;t you allow uncle Rolex to end Blake back then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because of her background. But it&#39;s in the past and doesn&#39;t matter now.&#34; My mother mumbled, yet she sounded doubtful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doesn&#39;t matter! What if this past comes back to bite us in the ass?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s what I feared. But if it didn&#39;t happen for nineteen years, it won&#39;t happen now. Also, after today, we wouldn&#39;t have to worry about Blake ever again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at my mother, I couldn&#39;t shake off the awful feeling I was getting because so much about Blake was being kept a secret, and I needed to know why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But from the responses I had gotten so far, I understood the answers weren&#39;t going to come so easily. So I knew I had to let it go since the problem was about to get solved.</p>
