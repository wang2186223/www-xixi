                <p>****************Luna POV***********</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The calm music playing, the laughter of the guests, and the small chit-chat, all these sounds pissed me off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing in this hall and smiling with people is annoying as fuck. But what annoyed me, even more, is that Nero is late, and he&#39;s the reason that I am even here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dad suddenly caring about Blake is the most frustrating thing that could happen to me right now, and it has been messing up my head like crazy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This party is the biggest insult dad can throw at my face, and if I wasn&#39;t still in a submissive position, I would have rained hell tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling like I was about to explode from the rage that I have been suppressing for this long, I walked out of the room and went outside to get some fresh air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna,&#34; A very annoying voice that makes me want to claw my nail into someone&#39;s skin echoed in my ear, and I turned around to see Karen and Killian approaching me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he looked into my eyes, a smirk flashed across his lip, and I sneered, annoyed that this is what I was bonded to and is supposed to be my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he reached me with his sister beside him, I scoffed at the stupid smirk on his face and rolled my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s not that Killian isn&#39;t hot, it&#39;s the fact that he knows that he is, and uses it to his advantage to get anyone undressed and in his bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, annoyed by their sight, I tried to walk off. But Killian&#39;s words stopped me in my tracks, &#34;What&#39;s the end game here, Luna?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know what you are talking about?&#34; I mumbled, swaying my gaze to the left to avoid his cold eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am patient until I&#39;m not. You sure you want to test my limit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Those words should be meant for you, Killian. Stop spreading lies about us before I get pissed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning my gaze on him, I met his eyes and said, &#34;You and I are not mates and will never be. Got it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it because you have your eyes glued on something that isn&#39;t yours?&#34; Karen mumbled, and I shot her a warning look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she smirked as she took a step towards me, leaned towards my ear, and whispered, &#34;Nero is not your mate, you lying bitch!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I better you want that to be true, so you can hook and crook your way in getting his attention. But Nero has taste, and he doesn&#39;t eat from the garbage.&#34; I mumbled, smirking as I looked at the sparkle of anger in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a faint silence, Karen scoffed and mumbled, &#34;He does have a preference. I wonder between you or your sister, who he truly has a thing for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Again with this rubbish. Can you find something better than the same old bullcrap?&#34; I mumbled, getting a bit annoyed now because I knew there was truth in those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way Nero and Blake look at each other doesn&#39;t seem like a way a teacher and student stare at each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we are together in front of her, his body language and words change, and he behaves a bit oddly which pisses me off. But until he marks me, all I can do is smile, and if I have to keep up the act for too long, someone will get hurt, really bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your lips might have said those words, but your eyes gave you away. You know the truth, Luna. I am not your competition here.&#34; Karen said, widening her smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she walked past me, heading into the villa, and I looked behind her as my anger fed my hate for her, swelling it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t like people touching what&#39;s mine, Luna,&#34; Killian mumbled in an authoritative tone, and I gave him a hard look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good for you, Killian. But I am not yours, so I don&#39;t give a damn about those words!&#34; I mumbled, giving a smug smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But my lips immediately widened into a grin as I watched Nero&#39;s car pull into the yard and came to a stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me, my date is here,&#34; I mumbled, walking past him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Killian grabbed my arm, squeezing it with strong pressure in his grip, and it hurt as I struggled to break free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let go,&#34; I cried, yanking my arm as I watched Nero get out of his car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t push me off the edge, and come to your senses!&#34;Killian coldly uttered with a wild, dangerous glitter in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Get your hands off me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are tempting me, Luna, and for your father&#39;s sake, I will give you a week to get your ass to me, or I&#39;m coming for you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, I realized that my mate was not only a fuckboy, but an abuser, and his red eyes told me that he wasn&#39;t kidding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears swelling in my eyes, I looked at Nero as he stopped beside Killian and stared at him stonily, then commanded, &#34;Get your hand off her, or mine will be on you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The force in his voice, the dominance in his tone, how can one not want an Alpha like him even if he&#39;s not mine to claim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at Killian, I watched the hesitation in his eyes as I tried not to give a mocking smile, and waited as his fingers slowly loosened off my arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should be thankful that tonight is not the occasion to ruin my thousand of dollars suit!&#34; Killian said, giving Nero a murderous gaze before walking off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34; Nero softly asked, gazing into my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitating, I rushed into his arms, clutching tightly to his coat, and cried my eyes out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a while, Nero stood still, not reacting at all, and when I was getting extremely pissed by his coldness, he suddenly stroked my hair gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the moment, a limousine drove into the yard, and I slightly frowned, wondering who it could be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, the door opened and Jason stepped out. Then he reached inside, and I felt my anger spark, knowing that it was Blake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These two seemed a bit weird like something was off about their relationship. Firstly, they didn&#39;t look the slightest bit intimate, even though Blake claimed that he was her mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chemistry that should be between them wasn&#39;t there, and they looked more like friends than a couple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Blake got out of the car, my lip slightly parted, staring at her in a glitter red slim-fit off-shoulder dress with deep slip on the side, exposing her curves and titillating physique.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; Nero asked, and I could feel his eyes on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I couldn&#39;t take my gaze off Blake because she looked annoyingly stunning, and her outfit looked like it cost a fortune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Nero looked back, and I looked up at him, seeing the truth in his eyes. Karen was right, and there was no way Nero and Blake were just a student and a teacher when he had such a mesmerizing look in his eyes as he stared at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without taking his eyes off her, his throat moved as he swallowed, hard, and I felt myself drowning in a rage that I have never felt before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My worst nightmare was arising slowly before my eyes. Blake was becoming something, something that I see as a threat, and I realized that it was time to cut the light in her eyes before she became a hindrance to my perfect life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time was still in my favor since this was just the beginning, and I didn&#39;t plan to waste a second of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sister!&#34; I said, forcing a smile when Jason and Blake got closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s my baby sister,&#34; Blake lively uttered, hugging me when I rushed into her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look stunning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The audacity of Blake had me struggling against my anger as I withdrew away from her arms, keeping my lips in a forced smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake,&#34; Nero whispered, and both our attention drew to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could he make it so obvious that she got his entire attention when I was standing beside him. Even though I knew that something was off between them, I didn&#39;t know what and how. Also, Jason and Blake were another mystery that buffet me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at Jason gazing at Blake, I realized something was different tonight. He was staring at her without blinking, and the look in his eyes looked affectionate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now I feel really confused. Did I read their relationship wrong from the beginning, and Jason is Blake&#39;s mate? And if he is truly her mate, then why did he and Nero have the same look in their eyes as they gazed at her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing was making sense to me anymore at that moment. But what I was certain about was Blake had to get out of my picture-perfect life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Fang,&#34; Blake whispered as her fingers gently squeezed onto Jason&#39;s arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she walked past Nero with Jason escorting her into the villa, and I glanced after them before focusing on Nero.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyed, I hugged myself and whispered, &#34;It&#39;s kind of cold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Nero looked down at me as I faked a tremble and gave him a soft smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he removed his coat off his body, revealing the tight shirt beneath it, placed the blaze around my shoulders, and pulled me into his arms as he mumbled, &#34;Let&#39;s go in before you catch a cold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking up at Nero&#39;s straight face as he led me into the villa, I wondered if he truly felt the connection of the bond that I lied about, or if he was just playing along with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But why? Was a question I knew not to ask, afraid of the damage it would result in because I laid, even though the question haunted my mind.</p>
