                <p>As I stared at Blake, I could tell that she was holding in her breath and fighting back her tears while she gazed back at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I said nothing as I kept gazing at her wet eyes, bruised lip, and bloodstained nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if I wanted to, I didn&#39;t know what to say to her at such a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So I dragged my gaze off her and coldly uttered, &#34;Blake, I think you and your father have disrupted my class enough, so maybe you should take a seat, or get out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling her eyes on me, I turned around, and the moment our eyes locked, I paused for a moment and then said, &#34;Did you hear m...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did,&#34; Blake mumbled beneath her breath with her gaze still fixed on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silently, I watched as she clutched onto her backpack and walked out of the class, gently shutting the door behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, my gaze remained focused on the doorway. Then I sighed and stared back at the class before casually uttering, &#34;Okay, you guys, turn to page twenty of your textbook. We will be discussing, &#39;The effect of an Alpha Bite.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After my class time was over a while later, I was about to leave the room when Karen suddenly appeared out of nowhere and blocked my way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nasty brat was what she was, and if I wasn&#39;t trying to remain low profile so I won&#39;t blow my cover, I would have given her a taste of her own medicine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that the other students were leaving, I threw her a hard look and asked, &#34;Miss Noble, can I help you with something?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her hands clutched behind her back, Karen smiled as she took a step towards me and softly intoned, &#34;Karen,&#39; will do just fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take a step back, Mrs. Noble, and stop wasting my time if you don&#39;t have anything to say,&#34; I uttered, scowling at her as my patience slowly run out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Karen ignored my words and took another step closer to me, breaking the space between us, and whispered, &#34;Is it hard to say &#39;Karen,&#39; or is it only Blake that you talk informally to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s catch up on this little chat when you have something useful to say to me,&#34; I uttered, struggling against my wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For some reason, it was becoming aggressive towards her, and I didn&#39;t want to keep up this chit-chat for her safety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So I walked past her, and when I was about to head out of the door, Karen shouted, &#34;Do you like Blake!?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without any doubt in my mind, my answer to her stupid question was, &#34;No.&#34; But it wasn&#39;t just to Blake. It was an answer to any question that involves me being drawn to someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stopping at the doorway, I felt annoyed as I strived not to clutch my fist. Then I turned around and said, &#34;Great assumption, Miss Noble. But no, I don&#39;t like Blake!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why did you help her!?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because spoil brats like you think it&#39;s okay to trample on those weaker than you. So yeah, I had to help her because of your nasty behavior to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I take it that Mr. Fang doesn&#39;t like me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, I don&#39;t like you, Karen. You are a nasty bitch. But your father is not someone I want to cross right now since I didn&#39;t want anyone digging into my past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without replying, I tried to leave but Karen suddenly shouted, &#34;I am sad that you don&#39;t like me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sighing heavily, my feet remained stuck to the tiles as I shut my eyelids, striving to suppress the sense of annoyance I felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I raised my lashes and said, &#34;I don&#39;t hate you, Miss Noble. It will be wrong of me as your instructor to do so.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good because I want you to like me, but not just as your student,&#34; Karen uttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without saying a word, I walked out of the classroom, shutting the door behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I reached the driver&#39;s door of my car, I froze as I gazed at Blake, squatting against my vehicle with her face buried in her palms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must be shitting me!&#34; I mumbled in annoyance, rubbing my brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I realized that she had no scent, and a thought suddenly crossed my mind, &#39;Did she mask her scent?... She did! What the heck! I thought only I and other alpha can do that!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, Blake raised her head, looking up at me with her irises hazel. Then went I focused on her face, she cried, &#34;I got nowhere else to go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was bad. She and I are not supposed to go this far. We shouldn&#39;t be entangled with each other because she could blow my cover easily with her identity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Helping you was a one-time thing, Blake!&#34; I mumbled, feeling kind of pissed at this point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. But I&#39;m begging you to help me for only a few days, and after I figured out things, I will leave and never look back. I swear.&#34; Blake cried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It grew silent between us, and I felt angry as I gazed into her eyes. Then I sighed out my frustration and said, &#34;Now, get off my car.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Blake sharply uttered with a hint of stubbornness in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing that her wolf was in control, I frowned and lashed out, &#34;Why do you only show up when it comes to me! You could have done her a lot of help with her father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Blake didn&#39;t answer, a bitter laugh escaped my lips as I rested my hands on my hips and stared at the blue sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I glared at her for a moment before firmly asking, &#34;What do you want from me!?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To stay at your place for a couple of days,&#34; Blake said with an innocent expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without giving her a reply, I reached down and yanked her to her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I tried to pull her away from my car. But she yanked her hand out of my grip and slammed her back into the door when I unintentionally let go of her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay?!&#34; I hastily asked, feeling concerned by the look of hurt in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will die if you don&#39;t help me!&#34; Blake cried, staring solely into my eyes. &#34;You heard my dad! As a weak hybrid who is now a rogue, members of the pack wouldn&#39;t spare me since I no longer have my father&#39;s backing anymore!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are dragging me into a mess that I don&#39;t want to get involved in, Blake!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I promise not to leave the house. The fact that my dad didn&#39;t find me last night, means you have your house protected, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. There are herbs planted in the yard that prevent outsiders from picking up the scent of those in the house.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, so my dad and others wouldn&#39;t know where I will be, and you wouldn&#39;t get in trouble. Please, instructor Fang.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said, &#39;no! Your father is not a wolf that I want to cross paths with ag&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding back the rest of my words, I frowned and thought, &#39;Again. The last time it happened, things got bloody pretty fast, and uglier than I intended for it to go.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It grew silent as Blake took a long look at me. Then she softly sighed and mumbled, &#34;Fine. I guess you too are okay with me dying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she smiled at me, I could tell she was hurting as she said, &#34;I get it. At least for the best part, it was nice meeting you, Mr. Fang.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though she did her best to keep the smile, her eyes gave her away, and the look of devastation in them ached my heart, and I sighed, realizing that I was about to mess my life up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Two weeks. Afterward, you are on your own.&#34; I half-heartedly said, noticing that her eyes were getting watery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at me, she softly sniffed and then widened her smile, nodding slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get into the car before I changed my mind!&#34; I told her, frowning at the look of joy beaming on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitating, Blake rushed around my car and stopped at the front door. Then after I had unlocked the car, she got inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes later, I wore my seatbelt, and I was about to start the car engine when I realized that Blake&#39;s eyes were now black.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have control over it?&#34; I mumbled out loud, although I meant to think it instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34; Blake asked as she swayed her gaze on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your wolf, do you have control over it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a hint of sadness in Blake&#39;s eyes, she glanced at me for a moment before hanging her head low and whispering, &#34;To be honest, it&#39;s like it has a psyche of its own and does whatever it wants. I felt like leaving school after you humiliated me in class, but my wolf wanted to stay and wait for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She is detached from her wolf? It seems like they are two separate creatures instead of being meshed with each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something like that is unusual and dangerous. But I guess it happened to her because her wolf had been isolated from her for so long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning my key, I started my car engine and slightly frowned as I mumbled in my head, &#39;What am I allowing into my life!&#39;</p>
