                <p>The sense of worry I felt had me pacing around as my fingernails continuously rubbed the skin of my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fact that I couldn&#39;t eavesdrop on Loki and Nero&#39;s conversation was frustrating to say the very least, and I was about to go find them when Loretta walked into the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giving me a death stare, she stopped a foot away from me and said, &#34;You little devil! This was your plan all along, right?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A pleasant morning to you too, Loretta,&#34; I mumbled, feeling too nervous to care for her nonsense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think you are funny?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never claimed to be a clown, Loretta!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way she was staring at me in disgust left me with nasty memories of the past how she always looked down on me and treated me like trash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Are you not done vomiting all that you have to say?&#34; I asked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Arrogant serpent!&#34; Loretta lashed out. &#34;You think you can steal what belongs to my daughter&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one cares for what your daughter possesses!... Oh, you mean Nero? Nah, he doesn&#39;t belong to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You little&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Also, the pack is not hers to own either since Loki hasn&#39;t decided yet... You and your daughter should really stop the nasty habits of claiming what doesn&#39;t belong to you guys.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face looked so red like she was about to explode from rage, and when her eyes shifted, for the first time after these few days, I felt my wolf again, becoming alert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watch your mouth, brat!&#34; Loretta coldly uttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyed, I rolled my eyes and mumbled, &#34;If you don&#39;t want to hear from me, then stop showing up in my face and talking to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just because you managed to get my husband&#39;s attention and robbed your sister of her mate, that does not make you invisible. You should watch your back!&#34; Loretta said in a low voice, but her tone was spiteful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you should stop talking to me and ruining my mood!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Haha! You really want to push me to my limit, right? Just wait and see!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking over her shoulder, I saw Nero and Loki, walking into the living room, and the fact that he was unharmed left me smiling like some fool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What so funny, uh?!&#34; Loretta shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, is it wrong to smile in this house again?&#34; I let out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like Nero, Loki doesn&#39;t like walking about with his scent, and the stressful look on Loretta&#39;s face was priceless when I said those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop fussing with someone younger than you, Loretta. It&#39;s humiliating.&#34; Loki uttered when she turned around to gaze at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Killain and Luna walked into the living room, and I saw a look in Nero&#39;s eyes when he gaze at Killian that sent a chill down my spine and left me jealous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not knowing why he looked so mad when he saw Killain and Luna together kind of messed with my head. I know it was stupid, but I kind of felt slightly insecure when she looked into Nero&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We haven&#39;t talked about all that happened between them, and my poor, pitiful heartfelt sad, and annoyed that he took more than a minute to break eye contact with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere quickly became toxic, and I wanted to escape from there immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should get to school,&#34; I mumbled, avoiding the bitter look in Luna&#39;s eyes when she glared at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will drop you,&#34; Nero said when I gazed at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I was about to walk away, Loki asked, &#34;Don&#39;t you want to eat first?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with the power to heal pretty fast, I don&#39;t trust eating anything in this house after last night&#39;s event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, thanks,&#34; I said, fixing my eyes on him. &#34;Actually I wanted to ask you something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Loki uttered, his brows joined together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I wanted to tell you in private.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are all somewhat family here, so speak your mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyeing Nero, I felt hesitant to put him on the spot. But when he gave me a slight nod, I drew a breath, looked at Loki, and said, &#34;I want to move out over to Nero&#39;s place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Loki gave me the silent treatment after my remark, I grew impatient and was about to express myself when he suddenly uttered calmly, &#34;Sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But But you said&#34; Loretta whispered, glaring at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know what I said.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does this mean you only want Killain to earn your trust?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The confusion in Loretta&#39;s eyes and the look of anger on her face faded immediately when a smile defined her lips, and I knew it was because she believed Loki was letting me leave home since he didn&#39;t want me leading the pack anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna and Killain can move out for all I care.&#34; Loki loosely uttered, and now, I was even more confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t argue with Nero mend I moving out, and now, he was also doing the same to Luna. What game was he playing again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is that supposed to mean?!&#34; Loretta cried out, looking so frustrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It meant what it meant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are not making any sense, Loki!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wow, things were about to get heated, and I wanted Nero and me nowhere in their mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should get going,&#34; I mumbled while walking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Nero and I were finally out was the house and in his car, he drew his gaze off the road, glanced at me, and mumbled, &#34;Are you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh,&#34; I whispered, unable to get his angry image out of my head. &#34;Yes,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have been quiet since we left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he focus back on the road, Nero mumbled beneath his breath, &#34;Nothing always means something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, his phone buzzed, and he slowed down as he reached for it, picking it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes were glued to his face as he stared at the screen, and the instant he cancel the call, I blurted out, &#34;Was it, Luna?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Jason.&#34; Nero casually uttered as he laid his phone back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why did you cancel it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I am driving, Blake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning, he gave me a side glance and asked, &#34;What&#39;s the interrogation about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not even thinking, and allowing my heart to speak, I mumbled,  &#34;You took more than a minute to break eye contact with Luna!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?... How would you even know that it was one minute? Are you some stopwatch now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not joking, Nero! Also, why did you look so pissed seeing her with Killain?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because the thought that you were going to end up with him makes me want to punch him, not just once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a couple of silent moments, he drove the car to the side of the road, stopped it, and let out, &#34;Talk to me. What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are a lot of unanswered questions about you...&#34; I mumbled, knowing that if I didn&#39;t get it off my chest now, maybe I never will.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One of them being, &#39;why was it, Luna, all along with if you don&#39;t know who your mate is because of the curse, and she was deceiving you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, Nero said nothing, and the silence was so uncomfortable. Then he finally let out, &#34;Because she told me that I was her mate. How was I supposed to know she wasn&#39;t?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said the same thing, and your response was, &#39;I am not your Alpha.&#39; Why didn&#39;t you give her the same reply?!&#34; I mumbled in annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because you are my student, and she&#39;s not. I don&#39;t even know if I have a teaching job to go back to today because I am with you. It&#39;s against school policy, Blake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That made a whole lot of sense, and although it didn&#39;t clear all of my doubts, it left me feeling guilty enough to mumble, &#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand. We have to work on trusting each other, and it&#39;s my fault you lose it for me in the first place. I am sorry for that, Blake. But I am with you now, okay? And I&#39;m going to work hard to earn your trust again. I promise.&#34; Nero said, his words carrying a weight of sincerity in them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking into his eyes, I wondered if just knowing that his name is, &#34;Nero Fang,&#34; his beta is Jason, and he&#39;s my instructor is all the information that I need to know about him, now that I am willing to spend the rest of my life with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing it now, I wasn&#39;t acting this way out of jealousy only. When you love someone, you want to know every single detail about them, especially the important ones, and there were so many questions that I wanted to ask Nero.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he seems like the close book kind of guy, and I didn&#39;t want to push him any further than I have already done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay?&#34; Nero said, looking solely in my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; I mumbled with a weak smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For now, I am going to be patient. Hopefully, he will be willing to open up to me about himself soon. I mean, he can&#39;t keep me in the dark forever, right?</p>
