                <p>After noticing Loki walk into the room without Blake, I felt a rise of fear, and my gaze remained glued to the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, I saw her, walking through the door, and I slowly inhaled, feeling a sense of calmness wash over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Subconsciously, I felt my lips pulled upward as Blake walked further into the room and approached me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So&#34; I mumbled, meeting her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are going to stay a bit longer,&#34; Blake said with a shaky smile. &#34;Is that okay with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure,&#34;</p>

                <p>With a hint of sadness in Blake&#39;s gaze, I saw her eyes drift away from me, and I stared to where she was looking, landing my gaze on Loki, Luna, Loretta, and Nero.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although I didn&#39;t know what game Nero was playing here, I knew Blake meant something to him. Even if he couldn&#39;t say, his eyes, tone, and mood when it came to her made it obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every now and then, he was giving her side-eyes, and Blake&#39;s gaze remained in a fixed direction, solely on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she was his mate and meant to break the curse, then why was I suddenly having awakening feelings for her. Is this some kind of messed-up joke that fate was playing on me or I was reading too much into things!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, when Luna glared our way, Blake hastily pulled her eyes off Nero, placing them on me as he focused the other way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully, Loki distracted all of us by raising his glass and announcing, &#34;A few days ago, I stood in this very room and used these same lips that I am about to use to revoke my statement to banish my daughter!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking our way, he smiled and shouted, &#34;But tonight, I am about to fix my mistake and say that even though Blake is not a part of the pack, she will not be hunted and Killed! Go against my command, and you and your entire family from the smallest to the oldest will die by my hands!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words made me question if Loki knew that Blake was an Ultima, and if he did, what exactly his plans were for her because I just couldn&#39;t get over the fact that he suddenly was protecting her after marching into her class and threatening to kill her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome back, dear niece!&#34; A guy with silver hair suddenly said, raising his glass with a smirk on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Rolex,&#39; Blake whispered as she doubtfully stared at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is he?&#34; I mumbled, looking down at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna&#39;s uncle. One of the strongest gammas of our pack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way Rolex was looking at Blake and she was glaring at him, I guess that their history wasn&#39;t pretty and the tension in their stare made me believe that I was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want to grab something to eat?&#34; I asked to distract her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mmmh,&#34; Blake mumbled, finally drawing her attention back to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we were about to walk away, an alpha with an annoying amount of gel in his hair suddenly stood in our way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, Blake threw him a hostile look and sneered when he smirked at her as he mumbled, &#34;Damn, Blake!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The was a brief pause, and I could tell from her expression that she was pissed when she whispered, &#34;Killian,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You two know each other. That&#39;s good.&#34; I heard Loki&#39;s voice a short distance from behind us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who wouldn&#39;t know a guy like Killian when he&#39;s a ho&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake, watch your words.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A frown crossed her face, and from the anger in her eyes, I was now curious about this guy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know that Killian is a promising alpha from a prosperous and respectable family, so how about instead of offending him, you two get to know each other,&#34; Loki said, giving Blake a soft smile as he stopped in front of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But her eyes got dark and hooded, and she softly sneered and said, &#34;Don&#39;t push your luck, Loki. Just because you have a grip on me doesn&#39;t mean I will eat the trash you plan to feed me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake!&#34; Loki whispered in a harsh tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You Mr. Noble, please don&#39;t take offense to her words. You know Blake has a loose tongue with even me, her father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes flicked from Blake&#39;s feet to her eyes in the blink of an eye, and Killian smirked as said, &#34;From a stunning lady like your daughter, I take no offense in her words.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I just barf in my mouth,&#34; Blake mumbled, and I looked the other way, holding my laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You!&#34; I heard Killian shout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swaying my gaze at him, I stared at the burning fury in his eyes and mumbled, &#34;Are you talking to me?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes!&#34; Killian spoke with bitter resentment. &#34;Who the fuck are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not knowing how to answer that question, I eyed Blake, and seeing that she looked hesitant, I calmly uttered, &#34;I&#39;m her mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chuckle escaped Killian&#39;s lips, and he kept laughing mockingly until Blake harshly asked, &#34;What the heck is so funny?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring her words, Killian looked at Loki and said, &#34;You approve of this, a beta feasting in the plate that should belong to an alpha?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he just refer to Blake as an object sexually! If I wasn&#39;t in the middle of a room filled with my enemies, I swear I would have fuck this son of a bitch up and taught him some manner. I don&#39;t care if he is an alpha that could mess me up badly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Noble, do you have something against Loki Hayes&#39;s daughters?! First, you harassed Luna and made her cry, and now you are indirectly insulting her sister. What&#39;s your issue with both sisters?!&#34; Nero abruptly said, his voice, strident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tone he used sent chills down my spine because he used that voice when he&#39;s about to end someone brutally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What nonsense are you saying! How did I harass Luna!? I will never hurt her!&#34; Killian said, his voice coming out stiff and prim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning, Nero looked down at Luna and said, &#34;Am I the liar here, babe?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes and ears. He was using one sister to defend the other want without even revealing it. Since this trip, I have seen sides to Nero that left me speechless and kind of proud of my alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of hesitation crossed Luna&#39;s face as her eyes dulled when she glanced at Blake. Then she looked at Loki and said, &#34;Nero is telling the truth. Killain put his hands on me when we met outside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his eyes glued to Killain, Loki clenched his fist and shouted, &#34;You did what to my daughter?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of fear passed over Killian&#39;s face as Loki approached him and he mumbled, &#34;Mr. Hayes, I can explain. You see&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of his words abandoned his lips when Loki struck him in the jaw before putting a hole in his gut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like a real alpha, he took both hits without making a sound, and then stopped clutching onto his stomach when Loki stepped back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hayes, what is going on here?&#34; A tall, built guy said as he approached us with Karen and an elegantly dressed woman beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your son disrespected me, and I&#39;m just teaching him manners. Do you have a problem with that, Noble?&#34; Loki&#39;s voice turned dark as he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since that&#39;s the case. I guess I don&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. I&#39;m glad that we are on the same page.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swaying his gaze off Loki, Mr. Noble looked at Blake and said, &#34;Dear, it&#39;s lovely to see you blossom into your true self&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad,&#34; Karen said flatly with a look of annoyance in her expression. &#34;Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s too soon to praise her when all she has done so far is to change her eyes color? I meant, where is her wolf, or is she fakin&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep quiet, Karen.&#34; The lady I believe to be Mrs. Noble said when Mr. Noble threw her and her daughter a hard look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking away from his daughter and wife, Mr. Noble sighed and said, &#34;Blake, it&#39;s a shame that you have a mate already. It would have been our honor to call you our daughter-in-law.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, to me, it&#39;s honestly not a shame because Jason is perfect, and I couldn&#39;t ask for a better mate,&#34; Blake said, and my gaze settled on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though I knew she was just saying things that she didn&#39;t mean, those words made me slightly smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure, sister?&#34; Luna said. &#34;Have he even marked you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of hesitation clouded Blake&#39;s face, and I was about to come to her rescue when she abruptly uttered, &#34;Yes. What do you think the bandage on my neck is for!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All this time, I didn&#39;t think much about why she had a bandage on her skin tonight until she mentioned it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You and my daughter went through the marking process?!&#34; Loki asked, looking at me like he was about to kill me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glaring at Nero, I clenched my fist when our eyes locked. This entire time, he had been hiding it from me that he marked her. That bastard! No wonder his ass was so protective over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I mumbled, holding back my rage. &#34;I&#39;m sorry&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You son of a bitch!&#34; Loki shouted, moving for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Blake jumped in between us and yelled, &#34;Don&#39;t you dare! If anything happens to Jason, you should know what will happen!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, sister! I&#39;m sorry for doubting you.  It&#39;s just that I haven&#39;t seen you guys be intimate, and that&#39;s why I was certain that you were lying about Jason and you being mates.&#34; Luna mumbled, pouting slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning at her sister, anger spiked in Blake&#39;s eyes. Then she suddenly collared me, pulled me towards her, and before I could figure out what was going on, her lips were on mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was it! The uncertainty that I felt was clear as Blake kissed me, her lips brushing against mine, softly, delicately, and I couldn&#39;t get enough of the taste of her as I inhaled her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After our mouth parted, Blake stared blankly into my eyes, looking as though she regretted doing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I didn&#39;t mind because if her using me was the only way, I could get the chance to love her then I will take it, even if she was Nero&#39;s mate because it didn&#39;t excuse the fact that she was mine.</p>
