                <p>Swaying my gaze off the road for a moment, I stare behind at the backseat and stare at Blake, under the blanket before focusing back on the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s been a couple of minutes now, and she&#39;s still unconscious, which had me a bit worried because her injuries were deep, even though they weren&#39;t life-threatening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although I knew what Blake was, I didn&#39;t expect her wolf to be this aggressive and dominant at this stage. It was her second transformation, and she murder five betas without any help and in a short time frame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her wolf was way fierce and more mature than I thought it was. However, it seems like she&#39;s still weak, but once she reaches her full potential, today&#39;s incident will be nothing compared to what she can do.</p>

                <p>Immediately, I glanced back at her to look at her weary face as she stared into my eyes and mumbled, &#34;The sixth wolf,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dead,&#34; I said, looking ahead of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all these years, I let my wolf out for her, and now, I don&#39;t want to imagine what happened back there and the gruesome mess I made because it will make me nauseous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You killed him,&#34; Blake asked, her voice hoarse with shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mmmh,&#34; I mumbled without looking back at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It grew silent in the car afterward, so I looked behind and realized that she had fallen asleep again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a while, I forgot myself as I stared at her face until I heard a honk, and I snapped back to reality, immediately focusing back on the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look where you are driving, dumbass!!&#34; A driver shouted as he sped past us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we got to the villa, Blake was still asleep, so I had to carry her to her room, and the moment I rested her on the bed, I heard the front door open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Picking up Jason&#39;s scent, I walked out of the bedroom and headed downstairs, meeting him in the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was worried that Blake wasn&#39;t picking up her phone and called me a while back to ask if she was home. So I told him about what was going on, and now, he&#39;s here which I wasn&#39;t expecting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring up from my head and dragging his gaze down to my feet, Jason frowned and mumbled, &#34;Why are you dressed like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is what I could get my hands on in a rush,&#34; I uttered, gazing down at my pullover pajama set.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After receiving Blake&#39;s distress text, I was in such a hurry that I grabbed my pajamas from last night off the floor and my blanket from my bed, not sure if I was going to shift or she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is Blake?&#34; Jason asked as he looked over my shoulder, staring at the staircases.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was annoying to know that he was here because of her, and I don&#39;t know if I could classify what I felt as me being jealous. But I kind of hate seeing his face the moment he asked for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s sleeping,&#34; I murmured, walking past him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a while, Jason said nothing as he followed me to the living room. But when we finally took a seat, he met my eyes and asked, &#34;Is she okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even though she sustained some nasty injuries, a couple of minutes from now, she will be fine. Her wounds had already started healing.&#34;  I mumbled, trying to get the bloody image of her out of my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who could be behind something this fuck up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not sure. But I found this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching into my pocket, I pulled out a phone and tossed it on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After my brief encounter with sixth wolves, I went to check the woods to make sure that that was the last of them, and I stumbled upon his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he had picked it off the table, Jason eyed me before playing the recording, and I noticed his eyes glowed yellow and his fist tightened as he listened to the recording.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What he said this morning about not taking a step back and that he felt something for Blake left me in a messed-up dilemma, and seeing now that he did care about her in that way was kind of pissing me off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was in the woods, a few distances from where Blake got attacked. The fact that one of those bastards was recording, I think whoever sent them wanted proof of her wolf.&#34; I mumbled as I darted my gaze away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think Chloe is the one behind this?&#34; Jason asked, drawing my focus back to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It could be. Her father has the money and power for her to hire six betas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These guys are arrogant asses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They got what they deserved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I was about to explain my words in detail, Jason&#39;s face went blank, his eyes widened, and he didn&#39;t blink for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a couple of minutes, the noise from the video audio was the only thing echoing in the living room. Then Jason finally dropped the phone on the table and mumbled, &#34;What the fuc&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Focusing on my eyes, he took a long look at me and gaily laughed, &#34;She&#39;s freaking unbelievable!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no denying that and that I had wronged one of the few wolves that could take me out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did Loki want to talk to you about?&#34; I asked, pushing aside my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He wants me to well, he wants you to reject Blake,&#34; Jason said spitefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the slightest strange. Blake said it, and now that her words were true, I felt some type of way over the fact that Killain was the option her father was going for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First of all, he is a dickhead, and his attitude is pure trash that makes me want to beat the crap out of him until he stops shaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After keeping silent for a moment, Jason&#39;s face deepened into a frown and his eyes darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he sluggishly dropped back on the couch and mumbled, &#34;Loki&#39;s exact words were that I should stay away from his daughter if I don&#39;t want him to find other means to unbound her from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though I restrained myself from saying it out loud, I couldn&#39;t help wondering if Loki was going to force Blake into bearing the mark of an alpha she doesn&#39;t love and is bound to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The mark will disappear on the coming full moon naturally, so there&#39;s no need to emotionally break her,&#34; I mumbled, unable to get over the awful gut feeling I felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then what next?&#34; Jason asked, his gaze cold as he stared at me. &#34;Are you going to set her free?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the plan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About this morning&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly standing to his feet, Jason looked down at me and mumbled, &#34;I wasn&#39;t kidding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; I whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. There are a couple more days before the full moon. Make up your mind by then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s easy to say when you are not in my position.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping silent, Jason walked away from the couch. But when he got to the doorway, he looked back at me and said, &#34;Maybe if you stop shutting everyone out, and keeping things to yourself, you will find out that it&#39;s the simple things that you continue to make complicated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only he knew just how wrong he was. But I held back my words and watched him walk out of the room, knowing that my burden was mine and no one else to bear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After sitting in the living room for a long while, I headed upstairs to Blake&#39;s bedroom to check on her because sounds were coming from there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I entered the room, I met her sitting on her bed, wearing black shorts and underwear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is Jason here?&#34; Blake whispered as she gaze into my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. He was but he left.&#34; I mumbled, walking over to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression grew dull, and she looked a bit hesitant before pitifully mumbling, &#34;Oh,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s with that look? You rather him being the one here than me!&#34; I blurted out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Blake blankly stared at me with a stiff expression. Then she sighed and said, &#34;I simply wanted to ask what he and my father discussed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He wants my mark on you removed, and since you claimed that it was Jason you mated with, he wants him to reject you.&#34; I let out, stopping a foot away from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking up into my eyes, Blake bit on her lip, drew a breath, and said, &#34;It&#39;s either Killain or another powerful alpha. Loki will accept no one else, and Jason might get hurt if I keep using him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When did you start caring about what your father wants?&#34; I asked, seeing the look of distress in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since he found out my weakness,&#34; Blake mumbled, lowering her gaze to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is that supposed to mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing. Forget about whatever I said. I will handle things on my own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she didn&#39;t answer, I placed my hand under her chin, raised her head, and asked, &#34;What fuck up ideas are you thinking about now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As I said, it&#39;s either Killain or another powerful alpha, no one else,&#34; Blake said in a bold tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I furrowed my brows at her, she sneered and said, &#34;Don&#39;t worry, I was not thinking of you when I say another powerful alpha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated, I heard back my words as I screamed in my head, &#39;Then who the hell are you thinking of?!&#39;</p>
