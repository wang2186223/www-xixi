                <p>chapter Sixty-four</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have something for you too.&#34; His lips pressed into a thin line, as he pulled a white leather pouch from his pocket. Opening it, he dumped out a treasure trove of beautiful jewelry. All were coursbine, that same purple/blue as his sword. All charged with magic already. &#34;But first, lets talk about these.&#34; He held up a necklace that had a hundred little beads of coursebine strung through the silver chain, there was a bracelette that matched, and then a belt also. Her fingers slid over them, her eyes meeting his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These are amazing. Are they also treasures from the Temple?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. This set belonged to Ephira herself. It is only fitting that you would have them.&#34; He took the bracelet in hand. &#34;You will use these to create a sphere of protection around the baby. Lay back.&#34; She did as she was told, and he set the bracelette on her lower belly where he&#39;d held his hand the day before. &#34;They&#39;re recharging, so they can be used once a day for the next few years if need be, though you won&#39;t need them for this purpose that long. Then, you&#39;ll take these,&#34; he lifted the necklace and belt in his hand held them up, &#34;Only one per day. There are a total of 235 days here. If you hold off to every other day, or every third day, for the first month or two, you&#39;ll have plenty to get you through. These will pull the nihility magic from you into them. If they fill up too soon, or as the baby gets bigger you may find you need more than one, don&#39;t panic. I have instructions here,&#34; he set down a sealed envelope on her belly too, &#34;on how you can get the nihility magic from the beads to the sword. Don&#39;t use the sword on yourself though its pulling ability is going to be much stronger than the beads. So, unless the beads aren&#39;t holdin up, you do not want to use the sword itself. It could be dangerous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When did you find the time to do all this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gregron gave her a sheepish smile. &#34;He worked on it last night while we went over the plan. This is for worst case scenario of neither of us coming back. If only I do, I&#39;ll be able to assist with this whole thing. Damion explained it all to me already. Not that either of us are planning on not coming back.&#34; He smiled at her, looking much more confident than he felt, she was certain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right. You&#39;ll never even have to use them.&#34; Damion finally gave her that melting smile of his. A lone dimple playing in his hard features. He gathered up all the jewelry he&#39;d been talking about, putting them back in the pouch and tied it around her wrist. &#34;Make sure to put them somewhere safe. And I would avoid wearing them around where folk could see them. I hate to think what some would do to get their hands on that kind of magic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not to mention working coursebine. Folk spend obscene amounts just to have dead coursebine.&#34; Her eyes were wide as he held out two, much larger stones. These were red coursebine. One was placed in a simple pendant, but the stone was as long as her middle finger, and as wide as three. The second was set in a ring, which would hide the entire last knuckle of her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These are for us.&#34; His hand moved closer to her. &#34;Which one would you prefer?&#34; His eyes were steady on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already have a pendant, which I have no desire to take off, so I&#39;ll take the ring. Though, you&#39;re not expecting me to wear it are you?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just for now.&#34; He smiled, though it wasn&#39;t a fully confident smile. &#34;Gregron, if you could please excuse us.&#34; The Captain nodded, leaving the room. &#34;There&#39;s something I would like to try with you if you&#39;re up for it. We have a little time before we have to go.&#34; He said, slipping the ring on her finger before clasping the pendant around his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers slid over his neck, and Volencia gasped, sitting up. &#34;I can feel that.&#34; Her hand went to her lips and his eyes darkened with desire. As he leaned over, kissing where her fingers just touched, they both moaned into each other. He pulled her over, so that she was straddling his lap. As he moved her hips, she cried out. &#34;Is that what it feels like for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grinned at her, &#34;Yes. Just wait, it gets even better.&#34; He nuzzled his face into her neck. She practically melted under his hand, being able to feel what he was feeling was driving her mad. She couldn&#39;t get his shirt off fast enough, raking her nails against his skin until he growled at her. He pulled at her dress as she worked at his belt. His hands were moving very slowly compared to how he usually touched her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nodding, he leaned over, suckling on one of her nipples. Both of them shuttered together. Raising her up with one arm, he reached below to pull himself free from his pants. Experimentally, she reached down, touching gliding her fingers over the spot near his hips she knew he loved. It was slightly ticklish, and very sensitive. She wished she had a spot that felt as amazing as this did for him. &#34;You always have such a strong reaction when I touch you here I&#39;ve always wondered what it felt like for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is what I&#39;m curious about&#34; he slid her body closer to his, pressing the head of his shaft between her lips. They clung to each other, already breathing heavy. As she wiggled against him, he held her hips still. &#34;Careful this is amazing, but I&#39;m not going to last long like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled up at him, &#34;We definitely need to do this before that happens.&#34; She slowly curled her fingers around him, adjusting so that he was at her opening. She moved slowly at his request at first. She could feel his heart nearly beating out of his chest, his mouth closing around her shoulder, they both inhailed deeply as he bit down gently, growling. Whenever he growled like that, it drove her crazy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moving her hand out of the way, she raised herself up so that he almost fell out. Growling again, he shook under her. She loved that he could barely contain himself. Being able to feel what it was like inside herself was amazing, but it was clearly affecting him more than her. Pressing against him, she pushed herself down, shoving him inside her as forcefully as she could. It was such a shock to them both, he actually bit her to the point of bleeding. His hips arched, and he threw his head back. They both screamed as they orgasmed. She collapsed against him, as he clung to her still gasping for air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once her body had stopped spasming, she looked up at him sheepishly. &#34;That was amazing.&#34; She kissed his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was. I&#39;m so sorry though&#34; his fingers caressed where he bit her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave it,&#34; she smiled, &#34;It doesn&#39;t even hurt, it&#39;ll be my badge. Proof I can handle every part of you.&#34; She giggled. &#34;Every time we&#39;re together, it just gets better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I seriously thought I was going to explode.&#34; He pulled the pendant off, dropping it on the table beside him. &#34;That can&#39;t possibly be safe.&#34; He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Coursebine is already highly desirable, if folk knew you could do this with it I&#39;d constantly be fighting them off.&#34; She laughed, running her hands through his hair. Closing his eyes, he enjoyed her adoration. &#34;You look exhausted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You exhaust me.&#34; He chuckled as she trailed kisses over his face, neck, and shoulders. &#34;I need to start getting ready though.&#34; He opened an eye, looking toward the window. &#34;The gretemp is rising.&#34; He yawned, stretching beneath her, his thumb rubbing where he bit her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All the more reason for me not to move.&#34; She nibbled his lip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He snorted but didn&#39;t argue. He wanted to stay here. There was nothing he wanted to do less than go on this mission. But go he would. Gently kissing where he bit her, he asked, &#34;Are you sure you don&#39;t want me to heal that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; She pulled away, cleaining herself off and stepping into her dress. &#34;It&#39;ll be my reminder of you when you decide you like him better.&#34; She said flippantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throwing his head head back, he laughed. &#34;Are you kidding me? There&#39;s no one in the world who could make me feel like you do.&#34; He stood, pulling her against him, the blue rays of Amaris twinkling across the ornate rugs and stone floors, lighting the soft white of her nightgown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closing her eyes, she leaned into his embrace with a sigh. &#34;You&#39;ve never been with anyone else, so there&#39;s no way for you to know that. And who knows, you may decide you want to stay there. I&#39;m afraid you won&#39;t come back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That,&#34; he squeezed her tight, &#34;will never happen. And I don&#39;t need to be with anyone to know what you do to me.&#34; He let her go, lacing her dress before worrying about his own clothing. &#34;You don&#39;t really believe I would abandon you, do you?&#34; There was hurt in his voice. As she turned in his arms, he looked away from her, not meeting her eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. Not really. I am afraid though. I don&#39;t think you realize how far they&#39;ll go.&#34; She wrapped her arms around herself, watching as he pulled his shirt over his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not giving me enough credit for how far I&#39;ll go to make this work.&#34; He reached for her, but she spun away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s where you&#39;re wrong. I&#39;m terrified because I know you&#39;ll stop at nothing to try and save those women. Once you&#39;re there, it&#39;ll become all or nothing. You won&#39;t stop at those three either. He&#39;s going to have a room full of concubines and you&#39;re going to try to save them all. Even if it costs you your life.&#34; Her blue eyes were hard as she looked at him, pulling a blanket over her shoulder from the sudden chill. &#34;I hate that you&#39;re going, but I understand where you&#39;re coming from. If I was there, I&#39;d pray every day for someone to come for me. And especially with this plan of yours, you must understand that it hurts. If it was me going in there, to do what you&#39;re planning-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t let you go.&#34; He at least had the decency to look ashamed. Stuffing his hands into his pockets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly.&#34; Closing the space between them, she took his hands in hers. &#34;It doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t trust you. I just love you. And I want you to be around for the rest of my life. I want our baby to know you as their father. And I&#39;m scared that something will happen to you. That they&#39;ll make sure you don&#39;t come home to me.&#34; She felt tears stinging her eyes, but didn&#39;t bother to wipe them away. He needed to know how she felt, hoping it would help ensure he come back to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting her hand to his lips, he kissed each of her knuckles. &#34;I know. I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded, &#34;It wouldn&#39;t be like you to not go though. Every fiber of you believes this is the right course. For more than just a single reason, no less.&#34; Her other hand caressed his cheek. &#34;You&#39;re lucky I trust you as much as I do, Damion.&#34; She said with a sad smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were tears in his own eyes when he finally met her gaze. &#34;Thank you, Volencia.&#34; He didn&#39;t often use her full name, but when he did, it always quickened her heart and lit a little fire in her belly.</p>
