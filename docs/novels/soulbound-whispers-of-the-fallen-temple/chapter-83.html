                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t do anything. If I let you go, he could kill either of us. You saw dad. Damion is the one who took his arm. On the day he was born no less. Then, years later, Damion took his eye and leg. He&#39;s taken lives, Lencia. Many of them. I can&#39;t let you go. I&#39;m so sorry. I hope you know it&#39;s because I love you and him. But if he hurt you I would never be able to live with myself. He would never be able to live with himself.&#34; Travion&#39;s words finally hit home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia froze, staring at him. &#34;Why are you here? What did you see?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking away, Travion frowned. &#34;Things. I wouldn&#39;t have traveled-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then the door to the towers burst open. Venron jumped from his seat, putting himself in the path of Lock, as he strode through the door. &#34;What the hell are you up to?&#34; Lock strode in, looking from Venron, smiling, to Volencia with a frown. &#34;Are you aware there&#39;s a massive monster wreaking havoc in Belodia?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she felt a fool to be found in Travion&#39;s arm, she tried to sit up and failed. &#34;What&#39;s happening?&#34; She begged. Anything was better than nothing. Even if it came from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s going to destroy the city. Innocent folk are being slaughtered.&#34; The long sleave of his robes flounced as he made a dramatic arch with his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There were those who were lost during your last raid on my city.&#34; She looked away, which led her to Trey&#39;s chest, and all she wanted was Damion. &#34;I care about my folk too. There&#39;s nothing I can do.&#34; She gave Travion a serious look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re breaking the armistice.&#34; He finally looked at her. His eyes were alight, the smirk he wore telling. He wanted this. He&#39;d been wanting all of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Travion walked forward. Looking up into his visage, his eyes had gone white. Just like they did when he had his visions. At least from what Damion had told her. This was the first time she&#39;d ever seen it herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me?&#34; Lock folded his arms over his chest, now glaring up at Travion as he slowly closed the distance between the two of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Travion placed Volencia on her feet, his arm wrapped around her shoulders, as if knowing the moment he let her go, she would try to flee. &#34;Going to act as clueless as ever, aren&#39;t we? I&#39;m the Watcher and Law Keeper. I&#39;m disappointed that you still can&#39;t quite bring yourself to be honest with those involved about how all this works. You do realize you aren&#39;t helping anyone by taking that path?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And we&#39;re not hurting our ultimate goal by doing so anyway. For some reason, you still care about how this ends for all three of the imprisoned. How long do we have to wait for our turn to shine?&#34; Lock sneered, fisting his hands at his side in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Long enough for them to become the villains of their own story. The time is neigh. And your master&#39;s brother just realized it. If I didn&#39;t care for the twins, I would not have said so. But you should know, not all can have the happy ending they want. So, all shall receive the ending they deserve. That was the law written by Necron&#39;s own hand. You shall reap what you&#39;ve sown. Unfortunately, time was not on your side. And Chihero has finally made his move.&#34; Volencia felt Trey&#39;s hand harden on her shoulder as she tried to squirm away while he was distracted. He clearly had no intention of letting her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia watched the color drain from Lock&#39;s face. She&#39;d never seen anyone from the Council look so terrified. &#34;That means that beast&#34; Lock stumbled, not quite falling to his knees but almost. Without another word, he ran back toward the tower, throwing himself through the doors. Venron chased after him, yelling for the soldiers to let him pass undisturbed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does that mean?&#34; Volencia looked up Travion. &#34;I don&#39;t understand any of what you just said to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trey nodded, looking down at her. &#34;Unfortunately, you will remain in the dark until you learn more from someone other than myself. As a piece of the puzzle not yet revealed, only Damion or Necron can answer many of your questions. And only Damion once he figures them out himself. One day, you&#39;ll have to call on Necron. Be prepared for a lot of heart ache when that day comes.&#34; Travion sighed, looking past her. &#34;Unfortunately, that may happen sooner than later depending.&#34; His eyes closed, and when they finally reopened again, they were their normal magnificent blue. &#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34; He knelt in front of her, his eyes now level with her own. Without another word, he pulled her into his embrace and kissed her forehead. &#34;Damion and the others will be returning soon. We want to be in the tower when that happens.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he stood, she wrapped her arms around his massive forearm, both her hands each clung to one huge finger. Though they had spent plenty of time together in Samanthia, today was the first time he ever made her feel like a child. Why could he tell Lock things and not her? Who&#39;s stupid rules were they actually playing by? She ran through his words over and over again. He didn&#39;t seem to be threatening Lock. Though he gave him a warning about someone&#39;s brother. Did Lock even have a brother or were they referencing the twins? A dull pain started to throb at the base of her skull. Everything was so confusing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The soldiers lining the walls of the tower looked nervous. Her father stood before them, looking like all hell was about to break lose. When Volencia started trying to move closer to him, Trey&#39;s hand clamped down on her shoulder. &#34;You&#39;ll be staying by me.&#34; His stern look told her he had no intention of letting her stay if things went badly. They wouldn&#39;t be moving any further away from the door, and he was prepared to whisk her away at any moment. What bothered her most was that in this moment, she knew what Trey was thinking and why he was really here. Lock wasn&#39;t the most dangerous piece on the board. Right now, Damion was.</p>
