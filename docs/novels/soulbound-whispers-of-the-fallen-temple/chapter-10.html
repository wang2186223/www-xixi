                <p>chapter Ten **</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia stopped near the tub, looking down at it. She felt suddenly self conscious as she felt his heat at her back. &#34;I&#39;ll just take your hair out and help you wash it. I&#39;ll bath after you&#39;re done and dressed for bed.&#34; Even as he said the words, he was behind her, slowly releasing her tangle of hair from the braids woven together. When her hair was unbraided, it trailed the ground behind her, and she hated it. So, her maiden often worked hard once a week to put it up tightly, and when it would start to fall out finally, she would take it down, helping Volencia wash it, before putting it all back up again. She hated her hair. &#34;No wonder you can&#39;t do this alone, there are so many pins and ties.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; she sighed, &#34;We&#39;re not allowed to cut our hair.&#34; Though his hands hesitated a moment, he didn&#39;t respond. It took him a bit to loosen it all, and as he did, his warm fingers caressed the back of her neck and shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, this is just a suggestion, but if you would like, you could climb in the tub. I can cover the top of it with bubbles and turn around while you do. Then you&#39;ll still be covered, and we&#39;ll make sure your hair stays out and before we wash it, I could brush it out for you.&#34; His hands were warm as they rest on her shoulders. Leaning back against him, she felt her face heat up. The wine was definitely starting to do a number on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would love that.&#34; She started to unbutton the front of her gown, and a moment later, it was down around her ankles. Without thinking, she ripped the undergarments off, leaning over to grab them and throw them in the opposite corner of the room from where she normally put the clothing that needed to be washed. She never wanted to see them again. When she turned around though, Hero eyes were as large as gold coins and his face was as red as a raspberry. &#34;Are you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking his head, he swallowed hard. &#34;Uh, yes. I&#39;m fine. I just was expecting you to warn me before you stripped naked.&#34; His gaze was riveted on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking down at herself, her hands touched her breasts. &#34;Oh. I guess, I wasn&#39;t thinking.&#34; She didn&#39;t bother to dwell on it too long. Instead, she climbed into the tub, making sure her hair stayed on the outside. &#34;You really don&#39;t mind brushing it out for me? Trishia says it&#39;s the worst.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As long as I get to spend the night by your side, I swear I don&#39;t mind.&#34; As Volencia laid back in the tub, resting her head against the edge of the brass tub. A moment later, she felt him lift her head, sliding a towel under her neck. &#34;Is that better?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Much. Thank you.&#34; Relaxing as he started working on her hair again. Her head spun a little as she laid there letting him work at her hair. He was so gentle. This felt amazing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, he stopped, leaning over her shoulder he whispered in her ear. &#34;There. You&#39;re all done. Do you really need help washing it? Or are you ready for me to leave you alone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia sat up, and he snagged the towel just as it was about to fall in. &#34;I don&#39;t want to wash it. It&#39;ll be wet forever. Could you help me was my back though? I&#39;ll help you with yours too? There&#39;s enough room. You could join me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hero stared down at her a moment, before he slowly untied the bottom of his wrapped tunic. &#34;Are you sure? If not, I need to leave now.&#34; His smile was gone, but his eyes were alight with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure.&#34; She moved to the side, giving him room. Volencia watched as he removed his shirt. He was beautiful. Though he had muscles, he was also slim. Toned muscles covered his arms and chest. Now that his shirt was off, she wanted desperately to reach out and touch him. Instead, she settled for bitting her lip. His skin was so much tanner than what she was used to seeing. As he pulled off his britches, she turned away embarrassed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure you want to? I feel the need to remind you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you don&#39;t get in the tub, I will lose my nerve.&#34; She was staring at the clothes lined against the wall of her dressing room. Suddenly enthralled with the idea that she had clothes for just this occasion. It had embarrassed her before, but there was a pink silk and lace thing she really wanted to wear for him. His hesitation didn&#39;t last long though. A moment later, he was lowering himself into the water with her. As his legs touched her body, she felt like fire was set ablaze along her sides. Volencia couldn&#39;t help but nestle herself between them as she laid against his chest. The difference was, this time, she could feel his erection against her back. He was sitting ramrod straight behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he sat like this a few minutes, eventually he picked up the soap and lathered it so that he could help her wash. Starting at her back he worked over her exposed skin, washing her, just like she&#39;d requested. From there, he worked her shoulders and arms. Anything that was above the surface of the water. &#34;There.&#34; He said finally, relaxing back. &#34;I washed you as much as I can without becoming a total deviant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia knew the word, but for some reason couldn&#39;t think of what it meant. &#34;Does that mean it&#39;s my turn to wash you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is my abosolute, and final warning. I really don&#39;t want to do anything you&#39;ll regret. But I can&#39;t say no.&#34; His eyes fixated on her. He clearly wanted this as much as she did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Turn around.&#34; She wanted to touch him too. So, very, very badly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. You&#39;ll have to scootch behind me.&#34; His face was red and he was staring at the water. &#34;The tub is too small for me to move around in well.&#34; When she stood up to try to get around him, he nearly tackled her in the tub. Arms wrapped around her waist, and his mouth found the base of her belly, kissing his way up her hip. The dip in her waiste was too sensitive, and her knees nearly buckled. Hero held her fast though. &#34;Let me wash. I&#39;ll be quick. Then I can take you back to your room and we&#39;ll have all the space we need.&#34; He grabbed the bar of soap and immediately started to work it over his skin. Volencia crumpled to her knees, watching him. &#34;Sorry, I have to wash up. I don&#39;t know what this body has been through. I need to wash.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia relaxed back against the opposite side of the tub. But as he stood before her, she couldn&#39;t help but get up on her knees. With her hands at her side, half submerged but her breast laying just atop the water, she looked up at him. &#34;May I touch you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Please.&#34; He handed her the cloth and soap knowing he would regret it. But it would be the kind of regret you wanted to do over and over. As she worked up his body, he was already standing tall. When her fingers found his cock, he shivered. &#34;I won&#39;t be able to take that for long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No?&#34; She smirked, blowing on his tip, loving the way he squirmed. Kissing him, her lips suckling at him. &#34;I think I want to go to bed.&#34;</p>
