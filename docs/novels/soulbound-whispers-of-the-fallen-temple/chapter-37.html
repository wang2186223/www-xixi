                <p>A fight broke out, and it was Necron who stood between his brothers and wife. A fierce call rang out. &#34;Touch her, and I will kill you.&#34; In the darkness Volencia gasped, her mind racing to the last time she&#39;d heard those words. They were back in Thambair, she was bloody and broken in the streets, and Damion was caught in web created by the council, struggling. When Larkisis touched her, that was when the tides had turned, and there he was, holding her. Her beloved. She started to sob, and those around her turned, watching her in surprise. Lenny wrapped his arms around her, &#34;It&#39;s okay. It&#39;s just a story. Don&#39;t be afraid, Lencia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Travion didn&#39;t stop, &#34;Peace became strained, and wars between the folk started to break out. The brothers tried many times to siege the Temple, but Necron wouldn&#39;t allow them to hurt anyone there, and would turn into a beast that ripped them apart, and his wrath was loosed upon the land. But he always returned to his beloved. And soon, he became even more protective of her when they were surprised by the realization they were with child, and he tried to make peace for all once again, and went to his brothers, telling them that he wanted a better world for his son or daughter.&#34; Before them, Locke stood, red with anger. Keye stood, green with envy, and Necron was no longer the light glowing silver he was at the beginning of the story. Instead, he was a swirl of darkness and glimmering silver bits. The only one who changed for the better, was Ephira. She went from her dully white glow, to shining a bright golden light, like the rays of the sun. &#34;The folk of the earth resented the father and brothers for bringing battle and horror to them, and loved her all the more, because she was the one who walked the aftermath to healed them, healed their lands, and promised a brighter future. Necron had raised her up, for the world to see, and soon she was the only one they believed in. When her son was born, the world rejoiced.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Samanthians cheered again, and when she turned to the crowd, beaming, she held a little babe to her breast. Necron&#39;s colors eased, lightening again, and Locke and Keye&#39;s only darkened. &#34;The brothers promised peace, for their nephew. They promised they would stop speaking ill of their sister nor would they try to take her from him again. And peace fell to the world, though many could feel tension in the air.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another hooded figure could be seen, just behind the flames now, and he stepped forward but didn&#39;t come out of the shadows. &#34;Peace was tenuous, and the gods clung to the little hope there. The child grew, knowing them all. Loving each in their own way. Like all the others though, there was a special bond between him and his mother, as there always should be. When he disappeared, and his uncles with him, it affected her in an awful way. True, unadulterated fear was born.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The goddess crumpled beneath the tree, and Necron went to her, holding her. He became so dark, he was almost invisible in the night, nothing more than a shadow. As his beloved wailed and cried, he created creatures of darkness and horror, and sent them out, in search of their son. &#34;From that fear devastation formed. His beasts tore up the lands. As they searched, they brought pain and suffering to the folk. And Necron demanded blood until the return of his son was had. When a Hero, dressed in the finest armor anyone had or would ever see, the world rejoiced. He protected them. He fought for them. And he claimed to love them and swore he would vanquish the evil beset upon the lands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the Hero rose, he was covered head to foot in armor, a magnificent sword at his side. Necron and the Hero met in hand-to-hand combat, symbolizing the battles brewing around them. &#34;This battle lasted years. Until finally Ephira pulled herself from her void and saw the unrest that seized the lands.&#34; Her hands went out, and a wave of golden magic rushed over them, &#34;Stop!&#34; She cried. &#34;How dare you, all of you! Is this what you wanted? Why is the price to be paid in blood?&#34; She moved, standing between them. &#34;All we want is our son. Our most beloved, who was stolen from us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There is only one way that can happen.&#34; The Hero spoke, sheathing his sword. &#34;The evil beasts in the world are because of him. He has allowed this to come to pass. I have created a prison that will contain him for all eternity so that we can set the world to rights and ensure this will never come to pass again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They argued and disagreed. The god went to his tree, sitting beside it and on the wind they heard him speak. &#34;I will do what must be done. You, beloved, must choose.&#34; She would not give him up. She fought for him, cried for him, and then the twins showed up. &#34;&#39;He created all that we are, and all that we can be. You cannot condemn him for someone taking his child&#39;, the goddess argued. But the Hero would not relent. He told her, she would never see her son again, if she did not agree to have her beloved imprisoned. The twins argued that if he had taken better care of his creations, this would never have come to pass. The balance of the world was broken and shattered, and everyone knew this needed to be set right, but no one knew how to do it. Only believed their answer was true.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ephira went to her beloved, and she sat with him and cried. &#34;This was their last night, and they loved each other like they&#39;d never had before. Ephira slept beneath their tree, but the Father stood, and went to the Hero and twins. He told them he couldn&#39;t see her in this pain any longer. He told the Hero he knew who he was, and that this betrayal of his own parents was unforgivable. When the Hero told him he was not his father, but a monster to the world, our beloved lost all hope. But monsters don&#39;t sacrifice themselves for those they love, and that is what he did. He placed balances and checks upon the prison, and an armistice was born of their agreements.&#34; Volencia sobbed, her body shaking as Lenny rubbed her back. The Hero walked the father toward the fire, shackles and chain binding his hands and feet. A fiery beast leapt from the flames, rubbing his hands together eagerly. &#34;A beast that feeds on souls, got the ultimate soul that day. This all took place while Ephira slept. Just before he entered the flames, he turned looking at the Hero and proclaimed.&#34; The words changed from Travion&#39;s to Damion&#39;s, &#34;I will be back. Know, I forgive you, as you will see the errors of your choices. To you, brothers, you are denied any further affection from me. The moment I walk into this flame, you are dead to me, and when I come out, I will have my revenge on you for what you have done.&#34; Then he stepped into the flames. If you looked hard enough, you could see him in there, the beast with him, torment the only feeling on his visage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Ephira woke, she was alone. She called for her beloved, but he was no where to be found. The twins went to her with the Hero in tow, &#34;They gloated over their scheme, and when she saw that the Hero was her own son, her heart shattered. How could he betray them both? As the brothers gloated and jeered at her, reality seemed to come to Hero. They admitted they only wanted to get rid of their brother, and get back at her, their own creation, for surpassing them. In her weakened state, they told him that her beloved had made an unwilling pact on her behalf, and she would be forced to bind her magic and memories and would only be allowed to come back as a mortal when their brother did. Hero stepped forward, angry. He demanded a gift, for their betrayal; before they took her from him forever too. He laid his armor at her feet and asked her to bless it. So that one day, the one with a pure heart would put it on and go to take his father&#39;s place.&#34; Her hands shook over the armor, and her magic went into it. Once this was done, the brothers bound her, and her ethereal glow dimmed. She was mortal, and they took her as their own again, where she wilted into old age and died. The son, immortal still, left with his blessing, on a mission to find one pure of heart, to reverse the damage he&#39;d evoked. &#34;Both trapped and locked away from the world. Three immortals left. The twins and the hero. Rest and balance were never restored to the world. Their grip became too tight. Their power too strong. The son still roams they say, looking for the one who can save them from the biggest mistake the world had ever known. But their webs around him grew tight, and he faded into history, and no one even knows his name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence fell, and the images dimmed around them. Volencia still cried as the rest of the folks cheered and stood, clapping their hands. Lennion reached over to her, touching her shoulder. &#34;It is a good, and sad telling. The boys did a fine job with it today. I&#39;m sorry that it has made you sad, but the beauty is in the hope left behind. One day they will come back, and the world will be put to rights.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words didn&#39;t ease the pain in her chest. It was Lenny&#39;s hugs that made her feel better. He was crying too, and they sat there as the others went to Damion and Travion to thank and congratulate them. The child made her feel better, and soon they were just sitting watching the fire. She knew, more now than ever, that she had to free him. They had to free him. They needed to set this right. She knew she would need Damion&#39;s help, and they would find whatever answers they needed.</p>
