                <p>The forest wasn&#39;t overly dangerous if you knew how to maneuver through it. On horseback, it was even safer, because they couldn&#39;t travel in the densely forested areas that were always dangerous. Damion had to make a lot of amends to his route. Soon, Volencia wanted Trish to ride with her, and Damion wasn&#39;t going to neglect her. Once they were riding side by side, the chatter didn&#39;t stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They rode as hard as they could. Still not making Damion&#39;s camp as desired.  When the sun started to dip that was when he decided that they would stop right there and make camp. It wasn&#39;t as open as he would have liked, but he couldn&#39;t wait much longer. Especially since he was worried about Volencia. She kept getting sick every time they stopped to eat. The first time he thought that using as much magic as she had caught up to her, but when it happened two more times, it started to scare him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first thing he did was put up the shield, explaining that they wouldn&#39;t been seen, but they could still be heard, so as the creatures came out, they needed to be quiet. Just as they would hear the beasts hunting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the shield was in place, he tied the horses and left to find stones and firewood, asking his companions to wait for him. He handed them each a water skin and food. Volencia sat beside Trish and laid her head on her friend&#39;s shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure you&#39;re okay? You look pail and haven&#39;t kept anything down all day.&#34; Placing the stones he carried near the fire pit, he knelt down in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what I really want?&#34; She asked, not opening her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want milk. It&#39;s creamy, frothy, and delicious.&#34; Damion chuckled. She usually did have milk for breakfast or lunch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll be able to get you milk tomorrow once we reach the village. Is there anything I can get you from the pack instead? I do have some cheese and bread.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded and he handed Trish a ration of food to split between them. He pulled out a skin of food oil and some pots and pans and placed them on the ground in front of the women. He left to grab what they needed and wasn&#39;t overly successful getting enough stones to build a fire pit, so when he got back, he took his iron sword and used it to help him dig a pit instead. He was sweating by the time he was finished getting the fire ready. Volencia curled up close to him when he finally sat down to eat with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The darker it got; the more noise started to filter into their camp. The horses weren&#39;t settling well, and Volencia and Trishia were terrified. They couldn&#39;t see out into the forest, Damion had made sure of it, making the shield black as night. The night-creatures sniffed around the camp, one even kept trying to slam into the shield. It could probably smell the horses. Damion still set the bed rolls out. Having not slept in two days, he thought he would at least be able to get a few hours. But it wasn&#39;t working out that way for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laying out the bedrolls, Volencia curled up on one side and him and Trishia on the other. It left him uncomfortable, and hot. And some time in the middle of the night, Volencia stole his pillow and Trishia stole his blanket. There was a particularly meddlesome rock square in the middle of his back too. And the horses were not impressed will the noises around them, and kept stomping and whinnying, which only brought more attention down on them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time morning came, Damion was even more tired and weary than before, but Volencia and Trishia were feeling better. They left early in the morning, and it was after lunch when they arrived at his home. It wasn&#39;t until they were nearly in Samanthia that Damion started to get excited about finally being home, after what had felt like eternity. He couldn&#39;t wait until he could talk to Travion about everything. Not having him there had been the hardest. Of course, he missed his parents, but Trey was his rock. Usually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling Dark Night up short, Damion slid from his saddle, raising his face to the sky. He heard Volencia behind him. &#34;Oh, Trishia, do you smell that! Something smells delicious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion laughed, he hadn&#39;t told them the Samanthians were expecting them today and would have a feast in their honor. Overall, the Samanthian folk were magicless. But Damion was not and had a special connection with his brother. They could speak though their minds if they were within about a day of each other. So, Damion had warned his brother of their coming the night before when he&#39;d first been able to make contact in the middle of the night,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just you wait. You have no idea what you&#39;re in for tonight.&#34; Damion smiled, leading his horse on an open path now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This looks like an actual road,&#34; Volencia dismounted also. &#34;Are we that close?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, the village is close. The shield is just beyond that bridge. It&#39;s a little slick. You should lead your horse over, Trishia, incase she slips.&#34; Trishia complained briefly, no where near as graceful on her dismount as Volencia had been. Discarding the dress had been a good idea. All the horses shied away from the shield at first and it was Morning Star who stumbled on the small bridge nearly knocking Volencia into the shallow river.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who puts a bridge over a brook?&#34;  Trishia asked, looking at the slow bubbling water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a brook now, but in the spring during the melt, it rages, and the bridge is necessary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A doe lumbered into their path, grazing easily, unconcerned with them at all. &#34;Damion!&#34; Volencia exclaimed, grabbing his arm, &#34;She&#39;s so beautiful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll see a lot of wildlife here. Many animals come in the night for the protection offered. If you come to the field before day break, you&#39;ll see all sorts of creatures.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Must make hunting easier.&#34; Trishia laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion was about to reply when another voice boomed from the thicket. &#34;That wouldn&#39;t be very fair.&#34; It was followed by a booming laugh, and Damion&#39;s smile grew. His company jumped though. &#34;We&#39;re not the kind of folk who would slaughter animals who come for sanctuary.&#34; A large blue lizard blocked their path. Volencia beamed with excitement, but Trishia gave a squeal of terror and put her horse between her and them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As groggy and overtired as he was, Damion took a cheep shot at Volencia, &#34;Something else you didn&#39;t tell Trishia about, I presume?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her excitement vanished, replaced by shame as her feet froze to the earth. &#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34; She looked down at her boots. &#34;I did, but it&#39;s overwhelming seeing something or someone you&#39;ve never seen before. I did what I could.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need to have more care with other&#39;s feelings in the future.&#34; Damion poked her in the ribs gently. Smiling down, regretting snapping at her. He let his horse go off toward the meadow and opened his arms to the lizard before them. &#34;It&#39;s good to be home!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lizard pulled Damion into a massive hug, jiggling him around like a rag doll. &#34;By the name of the Goddess, I&#39;ve missed you little brother!&#34; Travion wasn&#39;t letting him go. &#34;Holy gods! You smell awful. Poor girls, having to put up with such a stench!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trey I need to breath, you snake! Put me down.&#34; Travion laughed, Dropping Damion none too gently.</p>
