                <p>At the end of the winding halls, a large arc opened up into a beautiful oasis. Indoor waterfalls. Flowers of every color and bigger than Damion&#39;s head bloomed, reaching toward the sky. This structure was built with green marble, and the ceilings arched over them in shining glass. It was warm, but not uncomfortably. Claven lead them to an alcove to the side of the room, where the members of the Empire gathered. Sitting before a well-stocked table. Servants wearing see through clothes catered to each of them. Calazerthlegle sat off to the side, glowering at everyone. A black and blue eye swollen on the right side of his face, watched them. He frowned deeply, a mug held in his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Announcing our guests from Thambair,&#34; Claven swooped an arm out toward them, &#34;Our honored guest, Damion and unfortunately he didn&#39;t bring out beloved princess, but the sourpuss Gregron.&#34; The prince turned back, pouting as he looked at Gregron again. Damion wondered what he would have done had he allowed Volencia to come with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A raven-haired beauty, her hair curling on each side of her head in large buns, carried a tray over. Her lips were painted red, her large blue eyes weren&#39;t as bright as Volencia&#39;s, but she had the same build. Damion blushed as she stood before him, golden chains held her breasts up, a thin black mesh of cloth did nothing to conceal her body. Her middle was bare, the heavy golden chain at her waist hung low. &#34;I picked her out just for you. I could tell you had an eye for the princess, but she&#39;s not the only one in the world as gorgeous as that. And this one won&#39;t flinch or cry when you touch her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claven&#39;s hand ran along her neck, she held the tray fast, but her eyes closed, red lips parting. &#34;I am here for your pleasure, Master.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh, thank you.&#34; Damion took a cup from the tray that looked like beer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would either of you like a tussle before meeting the others? I know I need a good one before I get down to business.&#34; A red head giggled as he pressed himself against her. &#34;This one works magic with her mouth&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knelt before him, &#34;Would you like-&#34; he pushed her away roughly and she fell to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She crawled away on all fours, before turning her eyes up to Damion and Gregron, batting her eyes at them as she touched herself, &#34;How about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, thank you.&#34; Gregron only shook his head, his eyes scanning the rest of the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claven pouted, &#34;But they are all ready for you. I thought it would be a nice welcoming gift.&#34; Then he shrugged, &#34;No matter, come and eat then. Let me introduce you to my fellow Council Members.&#34; He put his arm around Damion&#39;s shoulders, pulling him toward the rest. &#34;Damion&#39;s thinking about joining us, so make him feel welcome.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion noticed Lock was not here. &#34;Unfortunately, you killed Henrindal King of Rivendair, so his son, Jaquisis has come to take his place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t as small as the other elf had been, but he had the same flaxen hair as his father, which fell in loose waives. &#34;Thanks for the push into the throne. I thought my father would never croak.&#34; He laughed maliciously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is the new King of Crath, Gareth. He&#39;s not as excited about his new throne, so don&#39;t expect him to chum up with you.&#34; Claven grabbed a mug from the tray the dark-haired slave still held and went to stand behind the fairies sitting to his left. &#34;This is Reniza, King of Quimbled and all fairies and his lovely daughter, Aveline. If you&#39;re a marrying man, I do make the exception for diplomatic peace. She is in need a good husband.&#34; Her green eyes met his. She was dressed just like the slave girls, but her legs were pressed against her chest in an attempt to keep prying eyes to themselves. &#34;She is fun, because she can make you see and feel anything you want. The only reason she&#39;s not been added to my personal collection is because Reniza is my second in command and wants to use her for political gain. Which we can all appreciate. There are the dwarves, no one can remember their names, so it&#39;s just dwarf one and dwarf two. They smell a little funny, but their shield magic and earth magic is extraordinary, and in battle, you won&#39;t find a better front line.&#34; Both dwarves scowled out at everyone. Damion was angered by their treatment, he couldn&#39;t imagine how they felt. &#34;Chiervoni, King of the Chirobi Isles, some of their folk have nihility magic like you, but it&#39;s very rare. Their King is chosen based off this skill. So Chiervoni here is one of the most powerful users of the magic we&#39;ve known to date. Aside from you, of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My name is Chirbon, and I am a Chieftain, not a king.&#34; His skin was ebony, as were most of those who came from the Chirobi Isles. His hair long, salt and pepper, oiled into long thick dreadlocks. This was the Chiaro Cala had mention the night before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*You have nihility magic like I do?* The Chiaro asked. *Have you spoken through the mind before?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s everyone but Lock. He doesn&#39;t usually show up for these meetings though.&#34; Claven shrugged. &#34;Now that our boring introductions are over, sit and enjoy.&#34; He smacked Gregron on the back, &#34;You too. I might finally see a smile on your dull face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Yes, to both. Calazerthlegle said that your daughter is here?* Damion asked, making eye contact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reniza and Jaquisis both raised their hands in salute. Since the rest of them only glared at him, it made sense he would go see them first. &#34;So, I may be a little late to the party, what kingdom are you from again?&#34; Jaquisis asked, playing with his nails as a small blond sat beside him, rubbing him all over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thambair.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*She is. A warrior. And they&#39;ve been told if they abuse her, I will leave the Empire and shut my borders to everything. I have the strongest navy. Though I can&#39;t hold a candle to them on land. It would be a standoff, and the only reason I haven&#39;t done it is because my Islands would suffer greatly if we were blocked off from the mainlands.* Chirbon poured himself a drink, purposefully not looking at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lucky you. I&#39;ve heard the Princess there is sexier than the goddess herself. Though, I&#39;ve never seen her. Maybe if she refuses Claven again, I could try my hand. Claven has an interesting sexual pallet and folk know it, I think I&#39;d have an easier time securing that ass than anyone else here.&#34; The glare Aveline gave him over her father&#39;s head would have shot daggers if it could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Good luck with that.* Damion frowned at Jaquisis. *She&#39;d never go for such a pompous ass.*  Though he didn&#39;t respond, Chirbon choked on his wine, hitting his chest. Apologizing because his drink went down the wrong pipe. *Sorry forgot to disconnect for that.* He wasn&#39;t sorry, he wanted the Chiaro to know how they really felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I gave a fair go round with the little fey princess earlier today, but she wasn&#39;t really my cup of tea. Can&#39;t tell if its real or not, and who the he&#39;ll wants that?&#34; Jakisis gripped at the elf beside him. &#34;I also prefer having someone more my own size, and eager. She just looked mad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Don&#39;t apologize. I like her already.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone you idiot. The fey are often targeted for sex trafficking for that very reason.&#34; Reniza glowered. Claven was off with a young male and female already, ordering them into position for a good show if anyone wanted to watch. Damion watched for only a moment before turning his eyes back to the food on the table. &#34;I take it you&#39;re not accustomed to such open sexuality, are you? You look very uncomfortable.&#34; Reniza watched Damion closely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s true. Though I wonder if I need to worry here you see, my own sexual pallet is of a different nature than most.&#34; Clearing his throat, Damion waved at the platter before them. &#34;I&#39;ve never eaten half of this stuff. Any suggestions on where to start?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Try one of these.&#34; The Chirobi sat forward, plucking a large curled up piece of pink meat. He picked up a small spoon and sprinkled what looked like water over it, then dunked it in a red sauce. &#34;They&#39;re little shellfish from the oceans around my Isles. Just a sprinkle of lemon juice, the sauce is a little on the spicy side, but compliments the shrimp well. The only thing,&#34; he lifted a bottle sitting on the table beside him, &#34;to make it better would be a glass of vintage Isle wine. Ever had it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. But it&#39;s got to be better than this beer.&#34; Both the dwarves howled with laughter at that. Damion reached forward, fixing one of the Chirobi shrimp. *Thank you.*  Damion said to Chirbon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*You are welcome, friend.*  Damion smiled to himself, and was glad others were laughing to disguise his conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A man after me own heart.&#34; The dwarf Damion didn&#39;t know the name to slapped Cala on the back. His accent was thinkers than Cala&#39;s and harder to understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A glass then?&#34; The Cheif&#39;s locks bounced as he held the bottle higher, grabbing a clean glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claven pouted, leaning on the chair behind Reniza. &#34;That&#39;s good Belodian beer. What&#39;s wrong with it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cala leaned in, &#34;We have a secret fer ya. It tastes like warm piss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion held up his goblet, &#34;The wine is much better. Thank you, Chief Chirbon. And it&#39;s not that it tastes as bad as the dwarves say, it just has no body, no soul. I recently had a dwarven ale with Gregron and the King. The difference between the two, is like eating a boiled pigs foot verses having belly strips.&#34; Damion shrugged. Though the Chairo and Gareth exchanged glances, it was the dwarves who seemed to fully understand what he just said breaking out in wild laughter again. The others only stared back at him. Damion ran his hand through his hair shrugging, &#34;Okay, um like a brothel worker vs one of your concubines?&#34; The look of pure horror that crossed Claven&#39;s face told him he understood this at least.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But but you practically have to chew dwarvish ale.&#34; Damion couldn&#39;t help but chuckle at the disappointment he saw on Claven&#39;s face. &#34;This just isn&#39;t so potent. If I wanted to get drunk I&#39;d have whiskey.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Careful.* Chirbon&#39;s warning echoed in his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My brother brews at home, and the ale is perfect. Maybe a little too wheaty for some, but he mixes it with a type of fruit we have, which gives it just enough sweetness. It is also filtered, so there&#39;s nothing to settle at the bottom of the glass. Mayhap some of you might enjoy it someday.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know I would enjoy that.&#34; Chirbon sat forward, smiling at Damion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I need you to know something, and hopefully I&#39;m not being too forward, but I need to get Gareth&#39;s pregnant wife out of here.* Damion told the Chirobi. *No one deserves to be bartered off as a prize. Especially one in such a delicate situation. I&#39;ll need help.*</p>
