                <p>chapter Twelve</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; Volencia heard a hiss, which pulled her from the deepest sleep she could remember. She had made love to the most amazing elf. The type of whirlwind romance Ephira herself would have envied. Feeling the covers pull away from her, and the shocked intake of breath, had her mind in a frenzy. Something was wrong. Then there was a flurry of movement which roused her in a jumble of arms and legs. &#34;How in the Goddess&#39;s name!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hero?&#34; She said, sitting up to rub at her eyes. &#34;Are you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. No no no no.&#34; He kept backing away from her until he went over the side of the bed in a heap of blankets and flailing arms and legs landing with a loud thump. Volencia cringed, his emerald eyes wide with panic, making enough noise to startle half the castle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took her a moment to register what was happening. &#34;What are you-&#34; her hands flew to her mouth, &#34;Oh no.&#34; Since Damion pulled all the blankets off the bed, she grabbed a pillow, covering herself. She peeked over the side of the mattress. He was laying there with his hands covering his face. &#34;Are you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the morning light spilled over him, she admired the ripple of muscle on his chest and skin. Though she&#39;d notices the scars on his sides, chest, arms and back, they were even more noticeable now. She wondered what happened to him. Her heart hammered in her chest. How could she possibly be so careless with him and his feelings. This wasn&#39;t the type of person she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers parted so she could see his emerald eyes peeking though at her. &#34;Please, please tell me we didn&#39;t?&#34; The silence that followed his statement made clear what he was referring to. Why hadn&#39;t she and Hero been more careful? Her heart pounded. In the heat of the moment, they had forgotten about everything else. She felt heat rising from her belly to the top of her head. Not knowing what to say, she remained silent. &#34;Oh Goddess. What I have I done?&#34; He pulled the blanket up over his face, and she could hear him mumbling into it, but couldn&#39;t make out what he was saying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia cleared her throat in the stretch of silence that followed. &#34;You rescued me from a fate worse than death.&#34; She whispered. &#34;I gave you what they would have stolen. It was beautiful. Possibly the best night of my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion shot to a sitting position. &#34;The best night of your life? How?&#34; He looked genuinely horrified. &#34;What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kicking her feet over the side of the bed, she pressed the pillow to her chest and thighs. His eyes ran over her, his face going bright red before focusing on the blanket. &#34;Well, what&#39;s the last thing you remember?&#34; She tried to act casual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t mean to be rude. I know I asked, but could we get dress?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course.&#34; She nodded. &#34;Your clothes are near the tub in the changing room.&#34; She pointed at the half ajar door behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes closed slowly, and he pinched the bridge of his nose. Swallowing hard. He struggled with the blankets, making sure they were securely wrapped around him before disappearing into the adjacent room. Volencia tossed the pillow aside. Standing to see if she could find anything in the room to cover up with. She had thought there was a point when she had her robe out the night before, but she wasn&#39;t finding it. When he came back out, she was bent overlooking to see if it had been kicked under the side of the bed. He was fully clothed, and she was standing there, as naked as a newborn babe. Damion walked right up to her, surprising her as he draped the robe around her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry if I seem fuddled.&#34; His brow drawn and distressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia nodded. The way he avoided looking at her made her want to cry. She had known he wouldn&#39;t remember. She knew he would be upset. But it hurt deep in her chest. The sky beyond the window was starting to lighten into dawn. She wondered if she would feel better about all this with more sleep, she was still so tired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He perched on the edge of a chair, looking very much like he would be ready to run at any moment. &#34;I&#39;m sorry. I really, truly am. But the last thing I remember was watching that monster unbuckle his belt and pressing his foot into your back. I remember the anger that filled me and then there&#39;s nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Purposely choosing the closest seat beside him, she recounted the entire evening. From the armistice, to the books, the Temple, and everything after. Sparing him the details of what they did together. When she told him about how Hero had mentioned he would be upset, his eyes flashed with anger. At the same time, she broke down into tears. She explained her feelings, the way he held her. Everything. She had been alone for so long, as had he. They both needed to feel something, maybe it was a need for anything. To be skin to skin, to feel cared for. Their aloneness had been too much for either of them to bare. &#34;But now it just feels so much worse. I thought it would be enough. I just don&#39;t want to go back to being alone.&#34; She sobbed, unable to stop herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion listened. Occasionally covering his face. His jaw clenching and unclenching. The only times he met her eye was when she mentioned the books and how she wanted to find the Samanthians to help translate them and then again when Hero originally told her no. When she broke down, he was kind enough to wrap his arm around her shoulder and hold her. He soothed her back, and whispered kindly, easing her fear and worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know what it is like to feel alone. Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t make you go through that now. I&#39;ll help in any way I can.&#34; He assured her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock on the door made them both jump. Volencia looked at the window, this would be the normal time for her hand maiden to come to the room to see if she was ready to get dressed and what she would like for breakfast. Damion went ramrod straight, his arms falling from around her as he stared down at his boots.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s probably just Trisha. She&#39;ll want to help me get dressed and bring up food.&#34; His eyes darted quickly from her to the bed, where a red stain told the story of what happened the night before. The door opened before she was able to react.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, Princess, I wasn&#39;t expecting-&#34; she trailed off the moment she saw Damion sitting in the room, so close to her. Her eyes bounced to the bed, and immediately to the ground. &#34;you to have company. My apologies for barging in.&#34; She curtsied. &#34;Before I leave you, will you be needing my assistance to help you bathe and dress this morning? And would you like me to bring up some food?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would appreciate your help in the changing room.&#34; Volencia bounced to her feet, pulling a blushing Trisha into her dressing chamber, closing the door behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you safe Princess? Do I need to call for help?&#34; Her eyes were wild with concern.</p>
