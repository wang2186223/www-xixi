                <p>Damion enjoyed telling that story for the first time in his life. Her reactions were priceless. Finally, someone understood it like he did. Was stuck in it, and he no longer felt like he was forever alone. He was also over the moon about her comment; I prefer your eyes. I love you. Excited Samanthians surrounded Travion and him, talking about the story. They loved the addition when the god left the story to talk to Volencia. Most assumed it was just a cute addition to make their guest feel special. It was really for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Travion elbowed him as the crowd dwindled and pointed. Volencia and Lennion curled in their chair together. Both asleep. Tears still streaked her cheeks. &#34;Excuse us, we&#39;re going to go take them to bed.&#34; He pointed and the crowd parted for them. &#34;Damion?&#34; One of his and Travion&#39;s closest friends, the best hunter in the village, clasped Damion&#39;s shoulder. &#34;It&#39;s nice to have you back, but it&#39;s even better to see you genuinely smiling again.&#34; The two embraced and spoke for a moment before Damion went after the princess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Travion and Damion worked to untangle the two and Birna stood close by. &#34;I didn&#39;t have the heart. They were so sweet during the story. Near the beginning when he got frightened, she eased his fears with gentle words. As she became sad, he reciprocated the same back. I&#39;ve never seen him so tender.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Travion smiled, &#34;Oh, he&#39;ll be a lady killer for sure.&#34; He pulled the stripling into his arms. &#34;Yeah, just like his old man.&#34; She poked his ribs. &#34;Ma, can you help me with da? Or would it be better to have the boys come back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mom snorted, &#34;We carry him everywhere else when they&#39;re not around. Of course we can do it.&#34; Lennion reached up putting his good arm around Birna and his stump around mom. They hefted him onto his one good leg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion was last, taking Volencia carefully into his arms. He was exhausted and envied how she didn&#39;t stir while he tosseled her around. Trashia wasn&#39;t far from them, watching as he took her princess in his arms. &#34;You changed the story so that it mirrored the other day, didn&#39;t you?&#34; She asked quietly as Damion settled Volencia against his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I&#39;ve told this same story a hundred times. The only thing that changed was when the god came out into the crowd. That bit was for her alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;ll be even more determined to save him now. You did yourself a disservice by telling her this story, especially in such a powerful way.&#34; Trishia wrapped her arms around herself, following him home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trish, I&#39;ve been doing her a disservice by not telling her. It&#39;s a powerful story and she deserves to know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it all coincidence?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think so. I never believed a word of it before that night. But how can I deny it now?&#34; Trishia opened the door for him as they reached the house. &#34;Which bed did each of you decide to take for the night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trishia smiled at him. &#34;Would you be surprised if I told you she wanted the nest?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; He laughed. &#34;I would have been surprised if you&#39;d told me she wanted the bed.&#34; He knelt, tucking her in, pulling each leg up gently to remove her boots. He tucked his blankets around her, pushing her hair away from her face, and smiled down. She nestled in, sighing. He wanted to crawl in there after her and curl up to fall asleep in his own bed pushing the thought from his mind, he stood. &#34;I&#39;m going to head off to sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sleep well, it&#39;s been a long few days. Before you go, how do you get water into your bath?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I&#39;ll do it.&#34; He went to the bath and pulled a panel on the wall off. &#34;It&#39;s much easier than carrying buckets. There&#39;s a well beneath us, so this spicket runs down into it. You pull this out, then you pump this lever.&#34; The contraption folded out from the wall, and he took the handle lifting it up and pushing it down. &#34;The ore the pipping is made from is thin, so please be slow and steady if you choose to try it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to fill the whole tub or heat it. I just need to freshen up a bit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;ll take two minutes to fill and about twenty to heat. I know you napped earlier and it&#39;s not that late. I have no problem lighting the fires. Prepping only takes a few minutes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It takes us nearly an hour to get a bath ready for the princess&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And it&#39;s less than half the size. I know. This is one of the things I&#39;ve missed most.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I bathe in a barrel that&#39;s luke-warm at best.&#34; Trishia stood back, watching as Damion finished with the water and started on the fires. There were two spaces beneath the tub and a larger one to the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re going to love this then.&#34; He smiled at her over his shoulder. Once done, he stood on the rim of the tub, grabbing a few vials from the top shelf. Two he put down where she would be able to reach them, and one he dumped the contents of it into his hand, sprinkling it into the water. A pleasant smell of flowers and spring filled the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, what was that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Salts. Helps the water temper better. The pockets of air that bubble around them helps to stir the water.&#34; He rubbed his hands over the water, stepping down. &#34;Now, before you get in, just close the doors in front of the fires burning beneath. It&#39;ll stop the bottom of the tub from getting too hot while you&#39;re in it.&#34; Pointing to the shelves above the tub he said, &#34;Soaps and oils are here, feel free to open and smell them all. There&#39;s wine in the kitchen if you want a glass, ale too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, this is very kind. I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ve given you a hard time these last few days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You keep doing it if you feel it&#39;s necessary. I appreciate that you&#39;re on her side. She needs more friends like you, and I need the reminders.&#34; He shrugged, giving her a lazy smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can can I be honest with you then?&#34; Trishia wrung her hands in front of her. Damion&#39;s heart fluttered in his chest, worried her words were going to sting. Mmhm. He nodded. &#34;What she needs is someone who will stand by her side no matter what, Damion.  Someone that will love and comfort her when things get tough. Honestly, she just needs you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat rose up to his cheeks and his face felt like it was on fire. &#34;Thank you,&#34; this is the nicest thing she had ever said to him, he looked over at Volencia, &#34;I&#39;ll remember that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do love her, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve never been in love before, but if I had to guess, I would say, from the bottom of my heart. The thought of losing her terrifies me more than death.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s afraid to tell you, afraid how you&#39;ll take it but she loves you too.&#34; Trishia started to pull her hair down from the bun it is always in. &#34;There&#39;s nothing in the world she regrets more than letting Ghost, I think that&#39;s what you call him, get too close. It should have been you. I thought it would help you to know that. Even if she can&#39;t bring herself to say it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion closed his eyes, taking a deep breath. &#34;Thank you. Knowing this does help. Good night, Trish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good night. Sleep well, Damion.&#34; She gave him a curtsy as he was leaving, which made him feel too awkward to reciprocate. He walked slowly to his parents&#39; house, thinking over Trishia&#39;s words. The day had been insanity for him, what he needed most in this moment was to fall down and sleep.</p>
