                <p>Tatron roared, charging. He jumped toward Damion, quickening his attack, swinging the sword down on his opponent. Damion moved so quickly; she didn&#39;t even see him grab the switch that had been at his feet moments before. When the sword came down, it lodged in the wood lengthwise, cleaving the switch in two about a quarter of its length. If the sword had made contact, there was a good chance he could have lost an appendage or his life. However, he twisted the switch around, topsy-turvy, forcing Tatron off balance, who landed hard in the dirt Damion gained full control of his sword, and pulled the steel from the switch. He didn&#39;t smile or gloat. Instead, he tossed it at Tatron, stepping back, ready for another attack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even if I only use a stick once to disarm my enemy, I&#39;ve not only gained the upper hand by taking you off your feet, but I&#39;ve also gained your weapon. If you learn nothing else today, learn that. Any item, to a good warrior, can be used in battle. I once used bramble and stuffed it in the nasal cavity of a night creature, sending it into a flurry. Once it was focused on that, it was easier to take down. That is our purpose here today. But feel free to continue if you think that was a cheep shot.&#34; Damion wasn&#39;t just standing anymore, his feet were spread, knees bent, ready for an attack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tatron looked down at his sword, as if in shock, and picked it up slowly. Damion had the switch, the part that had been cleaved, resting on his shoulder, the bottom held just above the dirt, and his other hand held out before him. &#34;Why do you stand like that?&#34; Tatron asked, rounding Damion, readying himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Knowing your weapon, and what you can do with it is imperative. Such as knowing that my best chance at throwing you off right now are large flashy movements you wouldn&#39;t have seen before, because ranged weapons are rarely used here. The way I&#39;m holding my weapon now, allows me to be preemptive on your strikes. Another thing many of you lack is the ability to use both arms, so if I can throw you off further by switching from a one-sided attack or block to the other, I gain the advantage. My final objective this time around is to keep you further away. Though I have other moves that will allow me to take your weapon, my best option is to maintain the integrity of my switch, which has already been compromised. This is my main concern when it comes to having the inferior weapon. Yours will last, mine will not. Before it loses all constitution, I need to make sure I take your weapon again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you always tell your secrets to your foe?&#34; Tatron went in for an attack, which Damion side stepped, his own weapon catching his opponent behind the knee, sending him stumbling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head. &#34;Talking throws, you off too. You think too much.&#34; Just as Tatron gained his feet and started to circle again, Damion feinted left, then grabbed the switch and spun it into his other hand. Tatron blocked it but left his back open to attack with the move. In one deft move, Damion caught Tatron&#39;s belt between the broken end of the switch, and had him locked too far for his sword to be of use. Because the stick was at his back, Tatron struggled to get it off him. &#34;Trapping you with my weapon and keeping you at bay something your sword would never be able to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell!&#34; Tatron fought against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;From here I can either throw you or pin you. Either way, you get hurt and I get the advantage again. Or you can take off your belt, try to throw me off, now that I think I have you, and try to win back the advantage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t get that if you are already thinking about it.&#34; Tatron did as he said though. The clasp came off hard, and the belt slid out. &#34;Now stop talking so much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Training. If I don&#39;t tell you what you&#39;re not seeing, then I fail you. If you can&#39;t stay focused on the fight, then I fail you. You&#39;ll hear far worse than my voice in battle. You need to train hard enough that this becomes second nature. You need to hear my voice telling you to look for what you can&#39;t see. Now open your eyes. Look for something I can&#39;t see.&#34; Volencia wondered if there was anything he didn&#39;t see. A move Tatron might have an advantage on, but she saw nothing herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tatron did though. He ripped the scabbard from the belt and flung it right at Damion&#39;s head. The later was able to duck and avoid the scabbard, but Tatron, using his belt like a whip, caught Damion in the side of the head as he was ducking. From there, he moved in quickly. Damion had the belt wound around his forearm in an instant, but Tatron didn&#39;t try to save it. He let the item go and focused on his attack. That was when the younger soldier gained his own advantage and had Damion on the defensive finally. In one deft move, Tatron finally got an opening at Damion&#39;s back and Volencia had to cover her eyes as he attacked. Flipping the switch around so that the broken end dug into the dirt, Damion flung himself into the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tatron staggered, losing sight of his opponent, his sword was already in swing, waiting to hit, so he struggled with his balance having to pull himself up short. Just as he regained his footing, Damion dropped on his back, one arm linked around the front of Tatron&#39;s neck, the other securing the back. &#34;I could choke you out right now, tap and I&#39;ll let you go, and we&#39;ll end this round.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tatron tapped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Damion let him go, it was gently. He held his hand out to him, &#34;That was an excellent move. You did find something I did not expect. Throwing your scabbard and using your belt as a whip. Nice work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tatron frowned. &#34;Yet, I still missed my mark and you bested me, even when I finally thought I had the upper hand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion handed Tatron his belt and scabbard, &#34;Knowing your opponent and what they are likely to do is what saved me. When you got to my back, I assumed you&#39;d be quick on the opening. Had to fly blind from there based off what I thought you were going to do. Instincts. Hone them. Trust them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tatron nodded, &#34;I was wrong. I haven&#39;t had a fight like that before. Did you take it easy on me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did not. That will never help you improve to your best, which is our goal here. My hope is to teach you all how to get to the point where you can hold your own or even best me in the end.&#34; Damion nodded to the others as they stood before them again. The men cheered, all of them slapping the others on the back. Tatron nodded to Damion, they would be cordial from here on out, Volencia guessed. &#34;I feel that was a very telling session friends, thank you for letting me help out again today.&#34; He shook Gregron&#39;s hand before heading over to Volencia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was sitting on pins and needles nearly that entire fight! There were a few times I thought his aim was to kill you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me too.&#34; Damion laughed. &#34;Don&#39;t you worry though. I&#39;m not crazy enough not to take necessary precautions when it comes to those types of fights.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like what?&#34; Volencia cocked her head curiously. She was having trouble keeping her eyes off him as sweat glistened on his skin, running in rivulets over his chest and stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t give you all my secrets, Princess.&#34; His laugh sent a shiver up her spine. &#34;I&#39;m not a piece of meat. Up here please.&#34; He tilted her chin up to meet his eyes. &#34;I think I just figured out why you like coming down here for training.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia tried to control the blush rising, but it was impossible. She poked him in the chest with a finger. &#34;Honestly, it is a perk. You&#39;re gorgeous and you know it. However, I also have no intention of simply rolling over if I&#39;m ever caught in a trap like the day we met. I may not have been given leave to train with you yet, but I can watch and learn at least something. I don&#39;t want to be helpless anymore. Even today, there was much to learn simply by watching.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. That&#39;s the reason I thought you were coming down. Others are starting to disagree.&#34; His smile was gone, looking down at where her finger pressed at his sternum. &#34;Don&#39;t let yourself get distracted. If you do that, you&#39;ll lose. You already have a disadvantage. But we&#39;ll teach you how to use it instead.&#34; He grabbed her hand and ran it down his chest stopping just above his navel. &#34;Regardless, you can&#39;t swoon every time you see a bare chest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia rolled her eyes, wiping her hand on her skirt. &#34;I don&#39;t. It&#39;s only yours, Damion.&#34; She felt like she was going to choke on those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hm.&#34; Damion grunted, giving her a half smile. &#34;Be prepared to join us after your father and Samanthia have been taken care of. You won&#39;t be fighting, but my bare chest won&#39;t be the only thing you will have to face. It&#39;ll be a good lesson for the boys too.&#34; He winked, turned on his heals and went to the barracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning at his back, she stared after him. What was that supposed to mean? Her father was still standing by the side lines. His eyes shinning. She felt like he some how knew exactly what Damion was talking about.</p>
