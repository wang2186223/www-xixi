                <p>His eyes were the most telling. They went dark, no longer emeralds, but forest green dipped in shadow. His lower lip disappeared into his mouth for a moment and a hand absently pushed back his hair. &#34;Let me be honest,&#34; he said, pushing away from the floor and slowly moving toward her. &#34;I couldn&#39;t handle seeing you in that.&#34; Volencia felt herself frown, considering their previous conversation it didn&#39;t sound like much of a compliment. &#34;And second, my mother won&#39;t allow us to sleep in the same house, so I don&#39;t know where you got the idea we&#39;ll be together at night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You you said you have your own house. I guess I assumed that&#39;s where we&#39;d stay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion chuckled. &#34;Okay I can see where you might think that but our homes are small. Just one big room. You&#39;ll stay in my home with Trishia, and I&#39;ll be staying with my parents or Travion. Though our folk like visiting in the dead of night, so something my mother or brother could also see you in would be best.&#34; He took the hanger from her and put it back, running his fingers through her nightgowns. All she could imagine was him picking one of the gowns that was frappish, she didn&#39;t want to look like an old maid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he surprised her when he took down her favorite. It was ice blue, light, and had a matching robe. It was made of silk and lace, and she loved it. It wasn&#39;t overly sexy, and where the bosom dipped down and the sleeves showed her side, the robe easily covered. More than anything, the nightgown made her feel beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s my favorite anyway.&#34; Volencia blushed as he pulled it gently from the hanger and folded it, putting it in her pack as neatly as he had his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know.&#34; That&#39;s when it happened. He gave her that no-holds smile. The one where his dimple shined on the left side of his mouth. &#34;You have clothes for tomorrow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pointed to what was on the chest near the door. &#34;Kinda. I don&#39;t have a tunic to wear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded, &#34;That&#39;s okay. Worse comes to worse, I&#39;ll give you one of mine. It&#39;ll be big, but-&#34; he shrugged, &#34;It&#39;ll be better than a dress. I&#39;ll find something for you tonight and bring it in, as long as you don&#39;t mind me coming in while you&#39;re asleep. I can always leave it in my room for Trishia to grab early.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took them another few minutes to grab two dresses for while they were there. He only let her pick one pair of shoes, and her riding boots went next to the rest of her clothes for morning. &#34;Okay, that should be everything, unless you want to bring your own soaps or anything personal. But I have a lot of that kind of stuff at home. A favorite of mine to make is a rose soap for Birna, Trey&#39;s wife. I love how it makes my house smell for days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia knelt beside him, putting a few personal items in the front pouch. She was late on her regular monthly ladies and expected it to start soon. Rather than embarrass him, she tried to make sure he couldn&#39;t see what she was placing in the satchel. &#34;It sounds lovely. I&#39;m not going to burden our packs with anything unnecessary. This is the first time I&#39;m leaving my kingdom for more than a few hours. I want to experience everything I can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without notice, Volencia had gotten very close to him while putting the last few items in the bag. His eyes were still dark and watched her every move. Feeling emboldened, she pulled the stings on her satchel closed, buckled it, and half leaned over him as she tossed it toward her morning clothes. When she did, her side rubbed against his chest and she backed toward her own spot ever so slowly. Letting her body run along his. Since they&#39;d met, he&#39;d been very careful to keep moments like these at a bare minimum. She was going to take advantage. With one arm over his lap, the other brushed her long tresses back over her shoulder, and her breasts pressed against him. He inhaled sharply, his eyes narrowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry,&#34; she laughed lightly, &#34;I didn&#39;t realize-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion&#39;s hand curled gently at the back of her neck, pulling her into him. His mouth covered hers, parting her lips with his tongue. Kissing her deeply, gently just like before. A moment later, she was in his lap, straddling him. His fingers worked at the laces of her dress as she dropped her head back with a sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips blazed a trail over her neck, pulling the dress down over her shoulder just enough to expose her collarbone, letting his tongue run over the divot there. As his lips met her neck kissing up toward her jaw line, she sighed, &#34;Oh, Damion.&#34; His kiss deepened to a light bite, and she heard him growl deep in his throat. &#34;I&#39;ve been waiting for you to kiss me like this again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s when his hands hardened on her for a moment before disappearing altogether. When she looked at him, his face was flushed, his eyes burning a hole in her carpet. &#34;I-I shouldn&#39;t have&#34; He stammered, &#34;I need to go bunk down. We have an early morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia tried to cling to him. &#34;Please. What did I do?&#34; She tried to hold him, but he was pulling away. &#34;Don&#39;t go. What did I say? Please, don&#39;t go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just-get off me, Princess. I can&#39;t do this. I never should have even tried. It was-I was-Please, just let me up.&#34; His voice was filled with so much agony, she couldn&#39;t help it. He was up as soon as she moved, staring at him from the floor. He paced back and forth for a moment, &#34;I was being shellfish, stupid really, I just-&#34; his shoulders sagged as he turned and left through the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Straightening her dress, she hoped he would still be in her room, waiting to talk about whatever just happen. As she left the closet, she realized he really was gone. Throwing herself onto her bed, she sobbed into her pillow. The one that smelled like him. The rose he&#39;d given her lay on the night table. Grabbing it, she clung it to her breast, sobbing. She spent her night trying to figure out what she did wrong, only to eventually cry herself to sleep.</p>
