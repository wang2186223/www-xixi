                <p>The sun was already filtering through the curtains when Volencia stretched in Damion&#39;s nest. She had slept much better than she had expected and prayed that Damion had finally gotten some sleep too. The house was ripe with the smell of breakfast cooking and there was already a healthy spread on the table. The meat already cooked, clearly not here in Damion&#39;s house. &#34;Morning, Princess. Breakfast is almost finished. I&#39;ll be taking the eggs off in just a moment. You woke up at the perfect time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She crawled out of the nest and went to table. &#34;Oh, my I am starving and this all looks amazing.&#34; Sitting at the table, she started to fill a plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft knock sounded at the door. &#34;Come in,&#34; Volencia said around a mouthful of food. The door opened to Travion standing there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning. I hope you slept well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, thank you.&#34; She smiled, waving him in. &#34;Damion coming too?&#34; She asked, hopeful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hm, I was actually hoping he was here with you. I haven&#39;t seen him all morning. I&#39;m a little nervous now&#34; Travion&#39;s hand messaged the back of his neck as he looked around the small home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, he left in the middle of the night to do something with a sword. I was still awake when he came in and grabbed them.&#34; Trishia called from the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Travion swore under his breath, turning back out the door. Volencia jumped up, following him. &#34;Wait, he left in the middle of the night with those monsters out there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, he&#39;s clearly not thinking straight right now. Idiot. I knew I shouldn&#39;t have left him alone last night. I&#39;m going to go find him, you should stay here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; She said keeping up with him. &#34;I&#39;m coming with you. If he&#39;s hurt out there I&#39;ll be able to help.&#34; Travion turned to argue but she glared at him. &#34;Nothing you can say will change my mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine, we don&#39;t have time to argue. But if he&#39;s not at the mine, you&#39;re coming back here, understand?&#34; She nodded. Travion stopped at his parents&#39; house briefly to tell them what happened. Volencia wondered why they all looked so nervous. Hadn&#39;t Damion told her the creatures didn&#39;t scare him, that he&#39;d killed hundreds? &#34;Keep your ears open,&#34; Travion said, &#34;if you hear anything that sounds like a monster, tell me. In the day they lurk in areas where they can reach you if they&#39;re hidden in the dark.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia nodded, &#34;How far are the mines?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not far, but there&#39;s a deep slope which is dangerous enough to go down during the day, he should never have come out here, dark or not. If he&#39;s not hurt, I&#39;m going to kill him.&#34; Travion kept going. Clearly upset. When they got to the slope, Volencia wished she had stopped long enough to put on a pair of shoes. Her feet were already killing her, but the slope was all stone and tree roots. She didn&#39;t want to upset Travion any more than he already was, so she didn&#39;t complain, but followed his path to the best of her ability. A monstrous cry rang out in the distance. Travion looked up nervously, the further into the forest they went the more his shackles seemed to go up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, Damion told me that the two of you are able to speak to each other through the mind if you&#39;re close enough, can you reach out to him that way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked surprised that she knew about this, then frowned. &#34;Usually.&#34; Was the only comment he provided, offering nothing else in return. She decided that she wouldn&#39;t push it any further. A moment later, he looked back at her, as she struggled to follow him down the slope. &#34;Are you barefoot?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I forgot my boots so yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t you say something? Your feet are going to be killing you by the time we get back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m worried about Damion and I didn&#39;t want you to try to send me back. I&#39;m fine.&#34; She lifted her head as he started back up the path toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, I understand that. You understand if something goes wrong and we have to run, you could be in trouble. If you step on a snake, it could be even worse.&#34; He put his fists on his waist, looking down at her seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A snake?&#34; She asked swallowing nervously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, a snake. We have some poisonous ones in the area. Next time don&#39;t forget your boots. Do you want me to carry you down?&#34; She swallowed, not wanting to say yes, but afraid not to. So, she just looked down at her toes. &#34;I won&#39;t hurt you. But you&#39;ll need to climb onto my back so that I have my arms to help us down. Did you ever get pony rides as a kid?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright then, well, you put your legs around my hips and press your knees together, like riding a horse, then you put your arms around my neck and hold on tight.&#34; Putting his back to her, he didn&#39;t have to kneel because they were already on uneven ground. When she didn&#39;t jump on right away, he slapped at his back. &#34;Let&#39;s go, we need to find him.&#34; She didn&#39;t hesitate again, this time doing exactly as he said. After a few steps he choked out, &#34;Hold on tight, but don&#39;t strangle me, &#39;kay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry.&#34; She let her grip on his neck loosen. The slope was awful, and there were a few times she thought they were going to fall, but Travion kept them moving. He didn&#39;t bother offering to put her down once they were on even ground again. They just kept moving forward, much more quickly than when she had been walking with him before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; He countered quickly. &#34;Because my brother&#39;s an idiot?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, because I insisted on coming and all I am is a burden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not a burden. You&#39;re light as anyone I&#39;ve ever had to carry through the woods. You were right, you know. That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t fight you earlier.  If something has happened, and Damion needs help, you are the one I want with me.&#34; Volencia suddenly felt all warm inside. Travion trusted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They reached the mine faster than she had anticipated. Travion knelt in the dirt so that she could get down. &#34;Careful inside, there are crystals all around the ground and you&#39;re not going to want to step on them.&#34; Volencia nodded. The mine was closed off by a large wooden door which Travion had to fight open. That he was having such a hard time with it made her wonder if Damion had been here at all. As they entered, the mine was pitch dark. So Volencia called upon her magic, focusing light toward just her fingertips. Not a lot, just enough to brighten their way so they could see what was before them. &#34;See?&#34; Travion smiled back at her, that is a very handy thing to have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She beamed up at him but worry followed. &#34;What if Damion isn&#39;t here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry just yet. For what he wants to do, he&#39;ll be toward the back of the mine&#34; It was hard to watch where she was going and focus on her magic at the same time, but she was managing so far. He did turn to her at one point and insist he carry her through, so she let him. It was odd, being held in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that Damion?&#34; A shadow of someone kneeling in the distance, a strange pinkish glow emitted from a large stone protruding from the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If it&#39;s not, then we have bigger problems to deal with.&#34; Travion stalled, as if trying to reach out but came back empty handed. &#34;Shit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; She whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait here I can&#39;t read him.&#34; Travion walked up toward the silhouette, &#34;Damion?&#34;</p>
