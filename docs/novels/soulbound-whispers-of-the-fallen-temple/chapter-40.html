                <p>That didn&#39;t look to be in the cards for him though. Travion, Birna, and his parents were all sitting at the table playing cards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Finally,&#34; his dad drawled, &#34;Birna&#39;s been cheating while holding my cards for me. She keeps looking at them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have not.&#34; She pouted, &#34;Just because I&#39;m having better luck than you doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m cheating.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Besides, da, he&#39;s exhausted. Just look at him. He looks awful.&#34; Travion looked up, giving him a sincere smile. Damion knew he was trying to help. And he was pretty sure he didn&#39;t have much left in him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am tired. Haven&#39;t slept for two days.&#34; He pulled out a chair already set up by his father&#39;s side and sat. &#34;But I&#39;m down for one game. We&#39;ll need to start from the top though. Da, with me holding, against you.&#34; Everyone groaned, throwing their cards onto the table. He wasn&#39;t usually aloud to play with anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dealer?&#34; Damion asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll deal.&#34; Travion was quick on the uptake. He shuffled and dealt. &#34;You took a while. Did she wake up? What did she think of the story?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. She slept. Trish wanted a bath, so I helped her get it ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah.&#34; Trey put two cards in the middle. Everyone else did the same. &#34;You&#39;ll show your bath off to anyone huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone laughed. &#34;Wouldn&#39;t you?&#34; He countered, &#34;There wasn&#39;t a tub in the kingdom that could compare. Even the princess&#39;s was less than half and brass. I have been waiting to come back here just for that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion held the cards before his dad, who chose two cards and Damion laid them face down like the others. &#34;She enjoyed the story. It touched her heart. I was surprised she fell asleep, but I suppose you all must be worn out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, tired doesn&#39;t scrape the bowl&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then go to bed dear. We&#39;ll all understand. I&#39;ll make mine up-&#34; Kirna started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He can take mine.&#34; Birna interjected. &#34;I&#39;ll just crawl in with Lenny when I&#39;m ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will, thanks. In a bit, I&#39;ve miss all of you too. It&#39;s nice to be back with everyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;d it go removing the curse from Venron? Is he back to his old obnoxious self yet?&#34; Lennion gave a dry laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not yet. I couldn&#39;t store the whole curse, it was too powerful. Once we&#39;re done here, I&#39;ll have to go back and try again. He&#39;s able to talk now, but only about certain things. Removing the curse may have been a bit more than I was ready for. If the Princess hadn&#39;t been there to help, I would have been in a lot of trouble.&#34; Damion watched as the others laid their cards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Travion was winning. &#34;The two of you have come to rely on each other. That&#39;s good you know. For both of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34; Damion said, halfheartedly. &#34;It all seems so clandestine. Like we&#39;re pawns in a game we didn&#39;t know we were playing.&#34; He was a spectator at this game too, so he didn&#39;t miss the look his mom shot at his dad, or the way his dad&#39;s brow drew down, a frown forming around the corners of his mouth. The silence for the next two rounds was too much. Only Birna, who was likely winning, if the grin on her face said anything, chatted every now and then, breaking the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You need to ask. A better time will not come again. Damion heard Travion&#39;s voice echo through his head. He slapped a card on the table. &#34;Scraps.&#34; He said, nodding at his wife with a grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laying her last card, she smiled back, &#34;Good luck love. But I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve got this at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion watch mom lay her card down, already resigned to what was to come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know if someone had a hand in all this?&#34; Damion asked as Lennion pulled a card from his hand. He also didn&#39;t miss the way his hand shook as it made its way to the table to deposit his card on the pile. &#34;You did send me to Thambair at a crucial juncture. Told me to wait for something to happen, then find the King. Did you know what you were really sending me to Thambair for?&#34; Damion sat up, hating the way his hand holding the last four cards shook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Three pigs and a donkey.&#34; Trey smiled. Laying his cards up right on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lennon looked down toward his lap. &#34;That&#39;s a loaded question. May I suggest we put the cards up and start this story at the begging? Let&#39;s just finish this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Birna beamed as she laid her cards out one by one. &#34;Full Farm. Unicorn, traveler, hunter, and draft.&#34; Horse cards were the highest. Especially If you had one of each.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, come on. Why didn&#39;t you finish it when you had the chance?&#34; Trey complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would have if you didn&#39;t do it first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kirna laid her cards down, &#34;Just two drafts, nothing special.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion watched his father lay down two unicorns and two travelers. It would have beat Trey&#39;s hand, but he didn&#39;t gloat. He watched the table sadly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trey collected the cards, touching Damion&#39;s shoulder gently as he stood to put them away. Who was regretting the question already, too exhausted for any of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be as short and brief as I can be. You&#39;re looking like a soft breeze would blow you over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion chuckled. &#34;I&#39;m sure it would.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can always wait until morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Damion answered quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then help me to my chair. You take my bed tonight. I don&#39;t usually use it anyway.&#34; Travion and Birna both jumped up at the same time to help. Once their dad was settled, Trey grabbed cushions and put them on the floor, tapping one for Damion to settle into. Damion followed him placing his head on Trey&#39;s shoulder. His eyes were half closed before their dad even started.</p>
