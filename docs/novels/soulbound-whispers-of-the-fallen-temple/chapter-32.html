                <p>Travion pulled her from the tree, and Volencia could hear them talking, but couldn&#39;t make out what they were saying. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, Damion.&#34; She took another bite of chartis, it melted in her mouth like sugar, tasted like citrus-honey-flowers, and she still had a good chunk of it in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have nothing to apologize for. Mom&#39;s just excited and let&#39;s be honest, it was a little weird having her come up on us like that. I wasn&#39;t thinking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia smiled faintly, &#34;You should not think more often then.&#34; With a giggle, she followed Travion and Kirna out, nibbling another piece of chartis. Just before the curtain of leaves closed, she turned back, &#34;I want this moment to last. Any time we can come in here, and be like that again, please, let me know. You said you would do anything to make me happy? I would like more of that while we&#39;re here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion stared at her as she dipped from the safety of the chartis. He didn&#39;t follow. Not immediately. So Travion took up her introduction. &#34;Mother, this is Princess Volencia of Thambair, daughter to Queen Rosencia and King Venron.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look like your mother but have your father&#39;s hair and eyes. That&#39;s exactly what your mother wished for. We&#39;re so happy to have you here with us. My Lennion, Damion and Travion&#39;s father, was the best of friends with your father.&#34; Walking forward, she grabbed Volencia&#39;s hands and held them in her own just before pulling her into an unexpected hug. &#34;We&#39;re so happy to have you here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Damion always made her feel safe and wanted, Kirna made her feel more. She radiated the love of a mother and protector, just like her own had. &#34;I can&#39;t tell you how happy I am to have you here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look,&#34; Kirna pulled away, looking at her with worry, &#34;I know you had a long travel here. But I have food ready if you want it. If not, there is a bath ready for you at Damion&#39;s. We want you to be comfortable, first and foremost. I had Trey start the fire for the bath an hour ago, so it will be warm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want the bath to grow cold, but a good meal would do me and Trishia a world of good.&#34; Damion finally joined them, pushing the curtain of leaves aside from the chartis tree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My bath won&#39;t grow cold, not if Travion lit the fire. You have time. We can join them at any point you want, and you&#39;ll have a nice warm bath to escape to when it becomes too much and you&#39;re tired. I told you already, your going to love my bath.&#34; He came out of the tree with a sense of purpose and pride, &#34;It&#39;s even large enough for you and Trishia to enjoy together if you wanted. I can lay from one end to the other completely submerged and not touch my head and toes to one side.&#34; He bowed, &#34;My princess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia stared at him a moment, before holding up a finger and going to her maid. Trishia admitted she was hungry and wanted a bath. Not being a bit helpful in making up her mind for her. &#34;So, am I to understand, the food will get cold, but the bath will not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kirna smiled, &#34;Well, what you don&#39;t eat now will only be here later. I can keep it hot. When I say it&#39;s what will make you happy, I mean it.&#34; Kirna, however, was leaning against her door jam, and seemed eager to have her in the house. Volencia knew that Kirna wanted her join them. Her father&#39;s best friend lay beyond that door, and she desperately wanted to meet him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion shrugged, giving her a small smile. &#34;Go. I&#39;ll join, you if you eat. I can&#39;t join you in the bath.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was enough for her. Damion being there was half her battle. &#34;Okay, let&#39;s go eat. Then Trishia and I will go for a bath after.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kirna opened the door, holding it as they entered the home. Volencia wasn&#39;t sure what she was expecting, but something so quaint and cozy hadn&#39;t been it. Directly to the right of the door was a table, two large stools sat at it. They had no backs, but the seats were covered in purple plushy pillows.  The walls were half wood and half clay, matching the outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her right, there were two large stick and pillow nests nestled in the corner of the house and just beyond that, a half wall lined with pots and bowls, among other nick-nacks, which were placed in orderly fashion. Not a speck of dust to be found. The colors ranged from purple to greens, none as spectacular as what she saw in the city. But everything had its place. Just like Damion&#39;s room always did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toward the back of the home, large windows surrounded the kitchen space where Kirna had shuffled off to. The heat from her indoor stove burned hot, but the windows kept cooler air blowing, and her green and purple curtains fluttered. On the sills were a number of small plants in hand tossed pots and looked more like herbs than flowers. More shelves lined the walls and hand made plates, cups and utensils were stacked with care. A pie sat on the lowest shelf, cooling. She could still see the steam curling around the top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had a beautiful marble countertop. Veins of green, blue, and gold ran between the fissures. Clear and clean and swirling through the surface, this way and that. Kirna pulled a small boar from the oven, placing it in center of the counter. Volencia rushed for the door. Damion following.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head, running out into the grass in front of the house. Falling to her hands and knees, vomiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh&#34; He rushed after her. &#34;Princess?&#34; he asked, holding her hair back and out of the way. His face pinched with worry. He handed her his handkerchief. When she was finished, he said, &#34;I don&#39;t understand why you keep throwing up. Are you not feeling well? Is it because you used too much magic?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34; She stood, needing his help. &#34;I&#39;m so hungry, but there&#39;s a lot to take in here. I think my nerves are getting to me. This has never happened to me before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion nodded, taking her hand in his. &#34;That&#39;s fair. If you&#39;re going to nap, Now is the time. There will be time for dinner after.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to disappoint your mother, of all folk. I should go back in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You won&#39;t.&#34; Damion helped her onto wabbly legs, leading her to his home. &#34;You need rest. I need rest. She&#39;ll understand. I promise.&#34; He opened the front door. &#34;I&#39;ll go get everything from the horses and have Trishia come to help you. Bath&#39;s already drawn, just behind the half wall back there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Covering her mouth, she ran outside again, throwing herself into the grass. Her body heaved and hurt, but there wasn&#39;t anything in her stomach to come up. Damion knelt beside her. When she was finished, he held out a handkerchief for her to use. When she burst into tears, he wrapped his arms around her, letting her cry on his shoulder. &#34;What&#39;s wrong with me?&#34; She hiccupped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing, like you said, it&#39;s probably just nerves.&#34; He pulled her up again, leading her into the house. Travion, Kirna, and Trishia had all seen her in the grass. Trishia was the only one to follow them inside. &#34;Here, sit down and take a few deep breaths.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching up to the top shelf Damion pulled down a corked bottle and popped it open. Pouring a small amount into a cup. &#34;Here, sip this. It&#39;s chartis wine, very mild, but should help your nerves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a soft knock on the door, and Kirna opened it slightly. &#34;Would you mind if I came in for a moment, dearest?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, not at all.&#34; Volencia looked up, smiling. &#34;I&#39;m so sorry. I just don&#39;t know what my body is doing. I feel fine, my stomach just isn&#39;t cooperating right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, no need to apologize dearest,&#34; Kirna took a seat at the table with her. &#34;What are you drinking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Chartis wine, Damion thought it would help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you just take a little whiff of it and tell me how your stomach feels when you do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion chuckled, &#34;Always the mother, aren&#39;t you?&#34; As Volencia put the wine to her nose and sniffed, her stomach rolled again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It also makes me feel unwell.&#34; Volencia pushed the cup away, frowning at it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kirna went to her side, and put her wrist up to her forehead, then stood behind her to rub her temples. &#34;Strong odors, but your still feeling hungry?&#34; Volencia nodded, closing her eyes and leaning against the back of the chair. She nodded slightly, giving her an Mhm. &#34;May I ask you something personal?&#34; Mhm, Volencia nodded again. &#34;You&#39;re still having your regular lady visits each moon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia froze, her eyes popping open. Damion&#39;s head whipped around, the color draining from his face. &#34;Why does that matter?&#34; Volencia asked, feeling dizzy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because of timing. If you are more than half a moon out from missing it, there is a chance you could be with child. Your hungry stomach, and the vomiting would make sense. You don&#39;t have a fever, and strong smells, particularly cooking meat making you nauseous, are some of the first signs of pregnancy. Have you been intimate with anyone?&#34; The way her brow rose at Damion, Volencia realized she must have caught on that they were at least a little interested in each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Only once.&#34; She rubbed at her eyes, tears pooling there. &#34;I should have had my visit about a week after I can&#39;t be pregnant. There has to be another reason.&#34; Volencia thought she was going to faint. Poor Damion, he hadn&#39;t even been party to what happened, not really. What would he do? What would she do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It only takes one time love.&#34; Kirna hugged her close. Damion went down hard, aiming for the bed, but landing on the floor. He groaned, covering his face. &#34;Am I to be a grandma once more?&#34; Volencia only cried harder, and Damion jumped to his feet, heading out the door. &#34;This isn&#39;t the reaction I was expecting from either of you. You look happy together. I know it&#39;s only been a short time, but if you&#39;re intimate, you must have expected-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re not not really. I barely gotten another kiss from him since that night. It was my fault, I never should have I shouldn&#39;t Oh Kirna, I&#39;ve made such a mess of everything. He&#39;ll never forgive me now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened? It&#39;s no easy task to force yourself on someone like Damion.&#34; It took Volencia time to get ahold of herself, but when she finally did, she explained everything to Kirna, who was gentle and kind despite everything. It was Kirna who sat with her near the tub and helped wash her hair. It gave Trishia time to lay down and nap too.</p>
