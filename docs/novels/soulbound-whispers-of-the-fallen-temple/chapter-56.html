                <p>Even though the homes were close, Damion was dripping wet as he stepped into the house. Trish must have decided to ride it out with Birna and Lenny. As the door closed behind him heavily, the blankets in his bed jumped, and there was a small wimper that came from them. Sitting on the lip of the nest, his hand reached tout to sooth the blanket. &#34;I&#39;m sorry sweetheart.&#34; He said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia popped out from under them at his voice, throwing her arms around his waist. &#34;Thank you for coming back.&#34; He could feel her still trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I&#39;d realized a storm was brewing I wouldn&#39;t have left you. As soon as I heard the thunder, I escaped as quickly as I could.&#34; She wrapped her arms around his thigh, resting her head against his lap. He ran his fingers through her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes closed, relaxing against him. &#34;You really are my hero. I didn&#39;t even need to tell you that I needed you. You just knew.&#34; Her hand ran up his thigh, &#34;How can I ever thank you for all you do for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion felt himself blush as he covered her hand. &#34;You can help me make supper? I still have to cook that fish over there. I was going to take you out for a picknick under the chartis tree, but looks like we&#39;ll have to stay inside instead.&#34; He looked away from her, scratching at the back of his neck. He felt her go rigid against his leg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everything okay? What happened with you mom?&#34; Her smile disappeared and she went pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I promised that I would respect her wishes and not be intimate with you here in the village until we&#39;re married.&#34; Thunder crashed into a rolling rumble and Volencia squeeled. &#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sighed, releasing his leg. &#34;I shouldn&#39;t have pushed you so hard to be intimate with me. She must hate me for that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not like I&#39;m unwilling. I don&#39;t mind the push, I think she&#39;s being ludicrous. As far as I&#39;m concerned, we&#39;re already bound. Some ceremony isn&#39;t going to make our relationship stronger. I don&#39;t see the point of having to wait. Especially concidering your already delicate state. She&#39;s just scared. She&#39;s grasping at straws for control, which she doesn&#39;t really have. Mix growing up in the Temple of Ephira and her traditional values, plus her fear, and she&#39;s a mess.  So, no, she doesn&#39;t hate you. She&#39;s just worried that I&#39;m following in your dad&#39;s footsteps. Remember, my parents went through a lot of heart ache and pain with him.&#34; Damion shrugged. &#34;She is happy for us overall. Just worried.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sighed, pulling the blankets close. &#34;Who can blame her? If you were my son, I wouldn&#39;t want you marrying me.&#34; She pushed herself as far from him as she could in the nest. His heart felt like it was breaking as she wedged a wall in between them. &#34;I come with a kingdom on the threshold of war. My mother died at the hands of my enemy, and my father was cursed to an extreme. Nothing good befell him after getting involved in the war. But at least he didn&#39;t choose to join. And I&#39;m just a mess. Even knowing I only have a year to figure this out, here I am, pining over you, filled with lust and temptation, and begging you to let us stay as long as I can get you to. Just so I can avoid going back to reality because I&#39;m too scared to face it. Only an idiot would sign up for this willingly.&#34; She jumped as thunder rolled overhead again, wrapping her arms around her knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed, &#34;Thanks for that.&#34; Untying his tunic, he dropped the wet shirt in a pile on the floor and slid down into the nest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her head whipped up, eyes wide. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, that&#39;s not what I meant!&#34; Her chin shook, ready to cry again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come here love.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m naked.&#34; She turned away, blushing. &#34;I don&#39;t want to keep tempting you. I just crawled out of the tub, dried off, and got into bed. I thought we would be able to cuddle but&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You always tempt me. Naked or clothed. I&#39;ll always want you.&#34; He crawled over to her, opening his arms but not forcing anything on her. He didn&#39;t want to upset her anymore than she already was. She curled against his side. As thunder rolled around them again, even louder than before, she didn&#39;t even jump. &#34;From where I&#39;m sitting, I&#39;d have to be an idiot not to do everything in my power to protect you and keep you safe. As far as I&#39;m concerned, you are worth any trouble that we might have to face. I&#39;d give my life you in a heartbeat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t say that.&#34; She whispered, drawing little circles on his chest with her finger. They sat there for a while, cuddled up. He even closed his eyes, resting back. &#34;Damion?&#34; She said after a while. Hmmm? Was the only response she got from him. &#34;Can I kiss you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course. You know you don&#39;t have to ask.&#34; He peeked at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to make you uncomfortable.&#34; She said. He cocked his head at her, wondering if she knew how crazy it made him to feel her body slide up along his. Did she feel the same heat course through her when he touched her? Did the tingling sensation when they were skin to skin drive her wild?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Darling,&#34; he put his hands on her hips, guiding her body over until she was straddling him. &#34;My promise might make me uncomfortable, but only because I hate it and only did it for mom. But you, definitely do not make me uncomfortable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I feel like I&#39;m wrong in not trying to help you keep your promise. You wouldn&#39;t do this if it was the other way around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; He raised a brow. &#34;I would tease you like crazy.&#34; She leaned into him, kissing him deeply. &#34;Goddess almighty, I do want you so very badly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He started to move, pushing her to lay down, but she braced her hands against his chest. &#34;Damion, I&#39;m actually kinda hungry. Maybe we should start supper instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He froze over her, making a face. &#34;Conveniently.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She giggled. &#34;I&#39;ll keep teasing you if you want me to&#34; she blushed, pulling the blanket down enough to just enough so that her nipple was ready to come free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Please.&#34; He laughed, kissing her again. &#34;But you might regret it once we&#39;re back in Thambair.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh I doubt that. We&#39;re going to get to the castle and I&#39;m going to have to drag you to my room.&#34; She arched against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had to make a promise today, I feel like you should too. And that should be it.&#34; He trailed kisses over her chin and neck, growling. She giggled, pushing at him again, and this time he relented, moving off her. &#34;Alright. Let&#39;s get supper started then, shall we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. We should.&#34; She stood in the bed, turning her back to him as she let the blanket drop, and stretched. When she turned to look and see if he was paying attention, she saw his eyes darken with desire and smiled to herself. &#34;You make me feel pretty when you look at me like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pretty? You&#39;re absolutely stunning.&#34; He stopped in his tracks, watching her pull on her nightgown. &#34;Do you need me to help with anything?&#34; He was all too excited to help with the buttons ranging from breast to navel, kissing her neck as he worked at them. Even making dinner was harrowing. She flittered around, rubbing against him, and kissing him as they worked. As soon as he couldn&#39;t stand it, and started to react back, she put on the breaks, stopping him. It was excruciating and fabulous all at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once supper was in the oven, Damion sliced the bread laying out a few pieces for them. He would put them in the oven closer to when the rest of their meal would be ready. Once finished, he dusted off his hands, giving her a sideways glance. &#34;Alright, in just a short while, I&#39;ll need to add the bread to the oven.&#34; He leaned against the counter. Her fingers traced his stomach, and he had to grab onto the counter to stop himself from grabbing her. &#34;This might be too much, love. If you keep teasing me like this, I&#39;m going to go mad.&#34; He reached out, his fingers curling in her hair. &#34;I&#39;m starting to not even care about the promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I care.&#34; She took a few steps back, pulling her bottom lip into her mouth. &#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Love, please don&#39;t apologize to me. It&#39;s not your fault. I just have no control.&#34; He laughed. &#34;You can stand here and touch me, or stand there nibbling your lip, and it still excites me.&#34; He pushed away from the counter, but as he aproched her, she squeeked nearly backing into the hot stove. His arm wound around her, pulling her from danger. &#34;Should you be apologizing because I can&#39;t control my emotions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not helping.&#34; She blushed, making fits in his shirt. &#34;I should should&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There is nothing you can do. So, don&#39;t apologize, please. You are giving me exactly what I asked for.&#34; His lifted her chin up so that she was looking at him and kissed her softly. &#34;Everything I could ever want.&#34; He said with bated breath. &#34;All I&#39;ve ever dreamed of.&#34; She sighed as his lips viered to follow her jawling, ending with a nibble on her earlobe. &#34;More than I ever knew I needed.&#34; He twirled her around until her back pressed against the counter, gently. His thumb just grazing over her nipple, and his knee pressed between her thighs. She was gasping, his name a whisper on her lips. Then he released her. Leaving her head spinning and her blood boiling. He grabbed the bread, slathering some butter on each piece and tossing them in the oven.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia&#39;s head spun. His words, his soft, eager kisses nearly did her in. She leaned hard on the counter, her knees threatening to buckle, as he went about his business like she hadn&#39;t just turned to putty in his hands. &#34;That was cruel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed, winking at her. &#34;I shouldn&#39;t be the only one in torment. Now you know how I feel. Should I start applogizing profusely and acting like I&#39;m in the wrong for making you feel this way? Should I stop?&#34; He lifted her hand to his lips, kissing each finger and her palm. &#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; his head shook, dropping her hand, and he took a sidestep away, glancing anywhere but at her. &#34;I really am an idiot.&#34; He covered his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia punched his arm. &#34;You are being an idiot.&#34; She laughed. &#34;I guess I kinda am too. Because I definitely don&#39;t want you to stop. Or to feel bad for the way I feel, because it&#39;s absolutely wonderful.&#34;</p>
