                <p>Damion dropped Volencia&#39;s hand as one of the striplings launched herself at them. Catching her in the air, Damion lifted her high and twirled her around. She laughed and squealed. As he put her down, he got to a knee and they covered him in seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several young girls crowded around her too, pulling at her shirt, or playing with her messy braid. Kneeling in the middle of them like Damion, they asked her a million questions all at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you meet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to get married?&#34; This question, among many other silly ones, made her laugh, and she pulled a young girl into her lap, watching Damion wrestle to boys in the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, the quick version is this. I was in big trouble, and Damion rescued me. I would be the prisoner of an evil sorcerer right now if he hadn&#39;t come to my aid.&#34; The girls all gasped and covered their mouths. &#34;Since he helped me, I&#39;ve hired him to stay and continue protecting me. He&#39;s been telling me all about everyone of you.&#34; She rubbed the cheek of another stripling who giggled at her touch, &#34;So when he told me he had to come here, I asked if I could too. I&#39;ve been wanting to meet you all so badly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was about the same time that the others really started to collect around them. &#34;She looks just like her father.&#34; An older lizard announced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, he would be wresting the little monsters like Damion, see how she&#39;s just kneeling in the dirt telling stories that&#39;s what Rosencia would have done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another agreed, &#34;She&#39;s just lovely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All around them folk whispered, some called out welcomes, most didn&#39;t come too close. An older lizard approached Damion, reprimanding him quietly, &#34;Shouldn&#39;t you be acting more diplomatic at a time like this?&#34; He started pulling the striplings off Damion, and they disbanded with an, &#34;Awe.&#34; And Damion got back up on his feet, clearing his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled, running a hand through his tasseled hair, &#34;Sorry about that. I guess they overpowered me, and I didn&#39;t really think&#34; he turned, looking down at her with a charming half smile, &#34;Hopefully you&#39;ve taken no offense, Princess?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not at all.&#34; She took his hand as the little one on her laps scootched away, &#34;I think it&#39;s wonderful their so happy to see you. You&#39;ve got quite a way with children.&#34; He lifted her up, and she pressed a hand to her belly, &#34;They absolutely adore you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve got a soft spot for each other.&#34; He reached down, pulling the only little blue stripling into his arms. &#34;This is my nephew, Little Lennion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;HI!&#34; Lennion smiled, his tail whipping around happily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Awe, you look just like your father.&#34;  She smiled, giving him her hand. Once again, she was soon shaking hands with everyone waiting to meet her. She hadn&#39;t realized before, but as big as Travion was compared to Damion, he was shorter and slimmer than most of the others. No wonder Damion had seemed at ease fighting so many that were smaller than him when attacked or training. If he was used to training and fighting with folk nearly twice his own size, he must have felt he was at a better advantage still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Travion allowed this to go for a while, before finally raising his arms high and speaking over them. &#34;We are all eager to let the Princess know how welcome she is here, and to talk to Damion of his exploits, but they have traveled far and hard to get here and need time to rest and refresh themselves. We&#39;ll see more of them at our welcoming feast tonight, friends.&#34; His little speech worked well, and the Samanthians back away respectfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you. This was the warmest welcome I&#39;m so glad to be here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion&#39;s hand found hers, their fingers intertwining as his eye gently caressed her features, &#34;I&#39;m glad. It&#39;s my hope and pleasure for you to be as happy as you can be.&#34; She looked back to find Trishia hanging back with Travion, looking down at her bootstraps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will we be meeting your parents first? Then going to freshen up?&#34; Volencia asked, as he led her down a small dirt path toward the edge of the village.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever you prefer.&#34; He pointed to the end of the road, where a beautiful white tree, with long flowing purple leaves, grazing the grass below like a wilting willow. On either side of the magnificent tree, were two of the most quaint and adorable homes she ever seen. They were wood and clay, wood on the bottom half of the home, and soft, straight clay reached the wooden rafters in the rooves, which were covered in red clay tiles. The windows all had shutters, colored to match the roof tiles, with flower boxes below matching the log cabin style of the bottom part of the home. The boxes and sills were exquisitely carved with wildlife scenes, and flowers. As were the doors and jams. Large flat stones curved from the front doors to the dirt road. Running along both sides were the pretties purple and yellow flowers she had ever seen. They matched the purple of the tree, and brought attention to the yellow flowers beneath it, and the yellow fruit hanging from the limbs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia stopped, staring at the scene opening before them. Her hands went to her chest as she took it in. &#34;It looks magical. Who lives there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion practically glowed with pride. &#34;The one to our left is my house. The one to the right of the tree is my parents. And there&#39;s a third, you can&#39;t quite see it from here, on the other side of my house. That&#39;s where Travion and his family live. Just beyond our little family garden.&#34; He rocked back on his heals, his smile so deep, his left dimple showed. &#34;Do you like it?&#34; Unable to find the words, she kept staring and could only nod. He bent down to whisper in her ear. &#34;It&#39;s all yours. Modified for our folk, I think you&#39;ll like it here. Wait until you see the bath.&#34; He winked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That tree&#34; Volencia heart raced. She knew this tree. The tree Hero hadn&#39;t wanted to bring to life back at the Temple of Ephira. He&#39;d said it was growing where it was loved. The tree was here, with Damion. It looked to be loved, just as he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s beautiful, isn&#39;t it?&#34; He took her hand and started walking toward the small hill it sat on. &#34;It has the most delectable fruit. I&#39;ve never seen another like it before. It&#39;s our chartis tree. Sitting beneath it&#39;s shade is my favorite place in all of Rhelia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even the grass around it is greener than everywhere else. I&#39;ve never seen anything so beautiful.&#34; Damion pulled the curtain of flowing leaves back. As she stepped into the cover of the tree, a lavender-citric scent overwhelmed her senses. It was the most exotic smell she&#39;d ever encountered. It felt like stepping into a different world, a world they were meant to be alone in. He wrapped her in his arms, before plucking one of the fruits from the tree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He peeled it, tossing the skin of the fruit near the trunk, &#34;Little critters always come looking for the leftovers.&#34; Handing her the fruit he smiled. It was juicy, citrus-honey and something more. Volencia closed her eyes, laying her head on his chest. His breathing was even. His arms warm. His heartbeat like music under her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think this is my favorite place in the world. Right here. Like this. With you.&#34; She felt his head press against hers, and he sighed. She wasn&#39;t sure how long they stood there, holding each other, but the world never felt so right. Even with Hero, there was much lacking. With Damion, it was all right here. Everything she&#39;d ever wanted in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you like to swing?&#34; His eyes were bright with excitement as he looked down at her, tilting her face toward his with a finger. They were so close. Her heart started to race as she looked up at him and he started to bend down toward her. Her eyes closed, lips parted. He was going to kiss her. This was exactly what she needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damion?&#34; Someone called from nearby. &#34;Damion, what are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He jumped, backing away from her with a blush and running his hand through his hair. He swore under his breath before, plastering a fake smile on. &#34;I was showing the princess the chartis tree.&#34; He called back, and the leaves rustled to the side as a lizardess poked her head through. &#34;We were going to come in to see you in just a moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lizardess&#39;s eyes narrowed at Damion, but she shot Volencia a sweet smile. &#34;You must be Princess Volencia?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia tried not to look too disappointed. &#34;Yes, I am. I assume you must Kirna, Damion&#39;s mother?&#34; She smiled politely, curtsying awkwardly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am. Nice to know my son talks about me. I hope they&#39;re good things that he says.&#34; She held the branches up, but didn&#39;t try to join them inside. Volencia stalled taking another bite of the chartis fruit, trying to act as natural as possible. Thought it was difficult, Damion&#39;s face was clearly on fire, even in the shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom when I told you they were out here looking at the tree, that wasn&#39;t an invitation to come join them.&#34; Travion came in, annoyed. &#34;I asked you to give them a moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For what?&#34; Kirna placed her hands on her hips. &#34;Are you doing something that we shouldn&#39;t know about? Are you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mother!&#34; Damion and Travion both said, at the same time. Volencia had never heard Damion refer to his mom as mother.</p>
