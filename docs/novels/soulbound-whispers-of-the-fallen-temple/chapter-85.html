                <p>chapter Seventy-nine</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The party moved through the halls as quietly as possible. Having gotten Claven and the others locked away with the concubines assisted with the escape for a good way through the palace. No alarms sounded, which worried Gregron to no end. Avaline, the fairy, was successfully using her magic to hide most of them, so as they walked by, what the bystanders saw were three Council members walking swiftly through the halls. They had been trained not to bother those who are on the Council, so they simply watched as the members rushed by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gregron&#39;s heart skipped as platoon passed them by, one human&#39;s, a lieutenant by his uniform, eyed them more carefully than others. Other magic users would be able to feel the magic aura being used, and this was one of the first officers who had seemed to notice something was amiss. Chirbon proffered an arm, wrapping it around Gareth&#39;s shoulders, laughing aloud. &#34;I tell you, friend, it&#39;s going to be more fun playing with these little fairies that are following us than you&#39;ve ever had. Dwarf, where did our plaything go?&#34; He stumbled, turning to look at Calazerthlegle, who swayed briefly before wrapping an arm around Avaline&#39;s shoulders and pulling her close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Show yourself, wench.&#34; He grumbled, snapping the shoulder strap of her dress. As Avaline appeared, the soldier seemed appeased, turning his attention back to his platoon. Gregron wanted to laugh, watching the three of them act like drunkards. Though it would be cause for few questions. &#34;Aye, fae magic will do the trick fer ya, me thinks. Who woulna want to be able ta tell a perty li&#39;l thing like this exactly what tickles yer fancy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gregron shook his head, Cala was teasing her, but overall, they all looked like they belonged. He hadn&#39;t expected the vibe between them all would assist them with getting out. Avaline was actually pulling her weight, but he still worried about how long this would last. Damion&#39;s ominous warning from the night before seeped into his mind. He still questioned if he should have warned the others. Keeping his head low, and the others quiet as they ran through the halls was the hardest part.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something at the back of Gregron&#39;s mind was bothering him though. A dull ache throbbed at the base of his skull, just above his shoulders. Like a distant roaring of some nightmare brought to life. The closer to the entrance they got, the more pronounced the throbbing pain became.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all skid to a halt as they made it to the entrance hall. A line of soldiers blocked the exit, weapons drawn. With the other soldiers seeming to have no idea what was happening, they&#39;d all started to gain hope that they would pass looking completely normal and of no threat. Clearly, someone had figured out something was going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Avaline had hidden herself from view again. Even other Council members would be asked why they were trying to leave the palace with her. She stayed back with Gregron and the others as Chirbon and Gareth stepped forward. &#34;What is the meaning of this? Our meeting is over and we&#39;re heading home now.&#34; Chirbon put a smile on, but his tone was hard, if any of them would have been able to intimidate the soldiers into moving he was it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve been warned something is wrong. The Captain is on his way and will approve you three to leave. Until then, no one will step foot outside the palace.&#34; A soldier stepped forward. Because of the additional metals on his uniform, it was clear he was the one in charge here. He also had elemental bands on the sleeves of his uniform, two water and one air. Which meant he had a degree of magic he could wield. The soldiers around him raised their weapons, making it clear, they would not pass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A roar erupted from the hall and Gregron turned in time to see a massive black shadow charging toward them. &#34;This way!&#34; Gregron shouted, tossing himself to the side, and pulling a few of the prisoners with him. Shocked looks were exchanged between the soldiers, and Chirbon, Cala, and Gareth perked up at his scream. As Gregron ferried the prisoners toward the wall, a slave elf screamed as one of the females she couldn&#39;t see collided with her and her wine decanter shattered on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gregron stared at the beast charging down the hall toward them and could hear weapons being drawn. The beast was twice the size of a war horse with dragon like features that could be seen as the shadows hit just right. The monstrosity slid into the fountain violently, sending half the structure flying through the room, taking out three soldiers as they splattered against the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stand strong men! No one leaves the palace!&#34; The soldier called out, magic sparking all around them covering the entrance so that none could leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gregron watched as his own allies pulled their weapons too, as the monster focused toward them. The Captain could tell that he was sizing them up as more dangerous than the soldiers blocking the way. Gregron&#39;s hair stood on end, &#34;No! It&#39;s Damion, don&#39;t attack!&#34; Gregron yelled, pushing Mary into Cherbet&#39;s arms. &#34;Get rid of the glamour! Now!&#34; He dove between Gareth and the beast, waving his hands in the air. Too late, he realized, he didn&#39;t have to have Avaline remove the glamour. The beast could see through the magic. It took a step back. Trying to look at the thing head on was like trying to focus on nothingness. That place in your nightmares where you know there&#39;s a monster, some horror waiting in the recesses of the shadows. &#34;Damion, it&#39;s me Gregron. Please-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a moment where Gregron could have sworn he could see eyes watching him from the recesses of the beast&#39;s face. Silver orbs scrutinizing their every movement. That was until a volley of arrows from the soldiers near the door started. The beast growled low in its throat as they iron points drove into the shadowy hide, as its attention turned toward them. A soldier ran for Gregron, sword high. Gareth swung, as Gregron was still preoccupied with wanting to make sure of all the things that killed them today, it wasn&#39;t his friend. &#34;Come on, follow me. We&#39;re going to get out of here on Damion&#39;s tail!&#34; Gregron didn&#39;t know if that would be true or not, but he prayed that it was. For all the time he&#39;d known the young elf, he&#39;d felt like he was a gift from the gods, and seeing him now, he couldn&#39;t help but wonder if it were true. This monster wasn&#39;t attacking them, at least not yet. He might be the salvation they needed to get out of the city. Bodies flew as slaves screamed, scrambling to get out of the hall, disappearing into side nooks and fleeing through the various entrances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Avaline,&#34; Gregron called, handing Cherbet his sword as he pulled Mary into his arms again, &#34;lets get us all hidden again. If the city thinks that the only thing they&#39;re facing right now is that thing, we might be able to just stay on his tail and make it through.&#34; Chirbon, Cala, and Gareth were sword deep in the fight as the beast quickly took down all the soldiers at the entrance. When he was done, those silver orbs swept over them again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ye sure this is Damion? How the hell can ye tell?&#34; Cala wiped the blood from his blade, but didn&#39;t sheath it. The beast focused its eyes on Gregron, slowly closing in on him step by step. Gareth inched closer too, uneasy over the thought of this thing getting too close to his wife. Mary curled deeper into Gregron&#39;s shoulder, whimpering as the thing closed in on them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He said something like this could happen. That it would if there was no other choice. He was going to try to avoid it at all costs.&#34; Gregron&#39;s heart hammered against his rib cage. Damion had also explained it would be volatile and that he should be prepared to fight him too. Gregron couldn&#39;t bring himself to fight Damion though. He had known last night when they spoke about it that he wouldn&#39;t be able to, but he&#39;d avoided telling Damion that. As far as he was concerned, it would have been akin to killing his own son, considering how likely it was that he would have been Damion&#39;s father and knowing how special he really was. &#34;Damion, you need to get us out of here. Can you clear a path that we can try to follow? Help us get them out. And remember,&#34; he pulled the robes off Mary enough to show off her condition, though he couldn&#39;t tell if Damion could recognize or understand anything he was actually saying, though those piercing silver eyes continued to become more intense, &#34;We need to be as careful with Mary as we possibly can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snorting, the beast&#39;s head raised, looking toward the halls leading into the palace. Growling, he went to the door. Gregron waived for the others to follow and he felt the glamour of the fairy magic wash over them as Avaline hid them from view. The others flanked them as they stumbled over the shredded bodies of the soldiers that had tried to prevent them from leaving.</p>
