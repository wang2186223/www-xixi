                <p>&#34;No! No.&#34; She shook her head, taking Trisha&#39;s hands into her own. &#34;He rescued me yesterday. Everything that happened from there was by my choice. I just need to be quiet about all this, please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You let him?&#34; Trisha pushed open the door a crack and looked out. Damion looked over unimpressed, raising a brow at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop it.&#34; Volencia closed it again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He is incredibly handsome. But so serious, especially considering.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia went to her favorite wardrobe, &#34;I need to pick something out that&#39;s simple and nice. Not too overwhelming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trisha nodded eagerly. &#34;I think this one will do you well.&#34; She pulled out a simple white dress. It was layered with a hem around the neck, bell sleeves, and adorned in silver lace, but otherwise was simple. &#34;And these.&#34; There were a set of matching white shoes that had small silver embroidery to match. Volencia nodded, pulling the robe from her shoulders. Trisha eyed the tub, &#34;I don&#39;t mean to pry, but who filled the tub for you last night? I just want to make sure any questions that may come to light are snubbed out quickly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He did.&#34; Volencia nodded to her room. &#34;His magic is incredible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It would have to be to take on the entire Council.&#34; She agreed. &#34;Okay, that is something I can take care of then. I&#39;m going to take the sheets off your bed and burn them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Folk will talk&#34; Volencia worried her lip between her teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. Folk will understand when I tell them you were tired and dirty after the day you had.  That you fell into bed too exhausted to care. If anyone questions the blood, there was an injury left untreated from the abuse you took. Which has since been taken care of. They are offensive now that they are marred, and everything that was on the bed is to be burned.&#34; Trisha finished lacing up the back of her dress and nodded solemnly. &#34;No one will speak of this. And if they do, rest assured, I will put any rumors to rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trisha continued to work on Volencia&#39;s hair, even added a touch of paint to her eyes and lips. She didn&#39;t want to make Volencia&#39;s cheeks any redder with the frequency in which she was blushing. Trisha was quick when working to get her hair finished. She didn&#39;t bind it in tight braids like usual, to keep it out of her way. No, today, she simply had just two braids holding the hair tight around her head bound at the nape of her neck, letting the rest of her hair fall around her. Her hair was never loose making it feel even more strange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There. Now, if this doesn&#39;t put a smile on his face after last night, I might be forced to box his ears.&#34; Trisha&#39;s laugh tinkled quietly though the small room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia felt tears sting her eyes. &#34;Can I tell you something in full confidence?&#34; She turned her eyes up to Trisha. Who nodded, the laughter falling from her face as she looked at her Princess&#39;s worry. &#34;I have been alone here for a long time. I have been terrified of what yesterday was going to bring since I can remember. I was weak and stupid, and I let that interfere with how I treated him. What I did hurt him. I was warned it would. A few hours and glasses of wine later, I stopped caring about anything. All I wanted was him. He told me his story, and we had so much in common. The little touches turned to sweet kisses, he told me he wouldn&#39;t be able to resist. He didn&#39;t, but I feel awful because I knew better. Now he feels like I took advantage of him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t take the blame if he can&#39;t resist.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even if he wasn&#39;t in his right mindset to make the decision? More like, someone else was making the decision for him?&#34; Volencia wrung her hands in her lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing about that would be okay, Princess.&#34; Volencia nodded in resignation. She knew what she did was wrong. &#34;Why would you do this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shrugging, she wiped at her tears. &#34;Like I said, I wasn&#39;t thinking. There&#39;s no excuse I can give, I just didn&#39;t want you to think less of him if he seems angry with me. I deserve it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trisha nodded, messing with her skirts. &#34;You do. I won&#39;t deny that. But I can&#39;t imagine the type of stress that you must be under, even still feel, after everything you&#39;ve faced. It is likely harder still to have him approving it, standing before you, even if you knew he wasn&#39;t really in control of such decisions. Magic is confusing at best, and this makes no sense to me at all. I hope he doesn&#39;t think less of you considering the circumstances. I don&#39;t believe you would never hurt anyone on purpose.&#34; She touched Volencia&#39;s cheek, &#34;And I think with all the pain you had, and the fear you&#39;ve felt, was why you were easily pulled into this bad decision. I&#39;m sorry you&#39;ve had to deal with all this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia stood, pressing on her skirts. When they went back to her room, Damion was standing with his legs straight his hands wrapped around the toe of his boot and his head was making slow movements with his chin ducked toward his chest. Despite their reentry, he didn&#39;t bother cutting the stretch short. Volencia stood quietly and Trisha set herself to collecting the offensive sheets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Making a slow walk of his hands up his leg, he straightened to standing, finally looking her way. &#34;Sorry. My whole body aches. I was hoping stretching my muscles would help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did it?&#34; She asked curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; He frowned. Trisha quickly asked if there was anything either of them wanted for breakfast, but they didn&#39;t have any special request, so she left to get whatever was hot and ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am sorry. I never meant to hurt you.&#34; Volencia said into the silence that swallowed them when Trisha left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know.&#34; He sat again. &#34;It just complicates everything. Of all the things I thought would happen yesterday, this option never came to mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t have to tell anyone. And I&#39;m hoping you&#39;ll let me make it up to you.&#34; She sat beside him and he shifted so he was facing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t lie well. If the question arises, I will be honest.&#34; His emerald eyes seemed worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t lie. I just have no intention of telling anyone about it freely.&#34; She touched his knee, &#34;The only person who has a right to know who I&#39;m spending time with is my father, King Venron. So, it makes it easy. He&#39;s cursed and won&#39;t be asking questions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion snorted, his hand grazing the sword that was leaning up against the chair beside him. &#34;That&#39;s an ironic statement.&#34; He sighed. &#34;Would you like to know why this puts me into such a precarious predicament?&#34; She nodded. &#34;Four days ago, my dad made a request of me. He had learned that the daughter of his childhood friend was in trouble. I was adopted by the Samanthians, and being the only elf, made me the only one who could come. I was supposed to wait for trouble to start somewhere in the city and follow it. Imagine when I realized it was the elf I&#39;d met at the fountain that very morning?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your parents are Samanthians?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded. &#34;They&#39;ll be none too please to know about what happened last night. Being care takers for the Temple of Ephira, they believe in the sanctity of such relations. That it should only take place between two folk who truly love each other and want to spend the rest of their lives together. If they knew&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No oh no, Damion, I&#39;m so sorry.&#34; She went to reach for him, but the way his eyes panicked following her hand, made her stop. Every time she went to touch him, he looked at her like she was a snake to strike. She turned away trying to hide the hurt and tears in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded, &#34;To add that little extra layer of fear, I&#39;m supposed to go to your father, now that you are safe, and start the work I need to do to remove the curses from him. My parents were hoping your father would be so impressed with me, that he would find me a job. To help me buy new blood for out livestock. Possibly even some fabrics for clothes. Even just simple items to make life easier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All of this can still happen. I can make it right with you. You rescued me and saved my folk. You didn&#39;t deserve what I did to you. But I need your help. I cannot do this alone.&#34; She rung her hands in her lap. &#34;The other you said that I should bring you with me to the Temple of Ephira. He thought maybe you would want to help. That we should work together.&#34; Her lips pressed together as Trisha came up with a tray heavy with food, two cups of milk and a tea pot.</p>
