                <p>Over the course of the next moon, Damion grew more comfortable in Thambair with them. Gregron took him through the motions of what would be expected of him as her protector. He had abilities and responsibilities that would be considered inappropriate for any other male. He&#39;d started meeting her privately for breakfast every morning. Checked to see if she would need him, they even sat for hours some sometimes while he read to her from the books they&#39;d gotten from the temple. At least those she couldn&#39;t read herself. Even worked to teach her how to read them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The book her father had given him highlighted a number of rare and hidden creatures or species. Many which had become things of legend and myth, like the Sand Dragons, Crinchaw, and Merfolk. But it also spoke about the Dark Hive, and Samanthians in the same vein, leaving her to wonder, were they really myth? She would have assumed the Dark Hive were too, not a moon ago if she hadn&#39;t known that&#39;s where Damion and Gregron came from. It was fascinating to have him read the information to her. She appreciated being able to spend time with him alone. And she loved the eagerness he had in learning more. He, too, had assumed many of these creatures were of myth, but was suddenly convinced, there may now be an option to prove they are real. Though the book didn&#39;t tell them were these creatures would be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the days she had nothing in particular going on herself, he would tell her what he hoped to accomplish for the day. Many days, it was him wanting to spend time in the library. Once he made an appearance with the troops, they became so impressed with his strange fighting style, Gregron asked if he would go to their daily training sessions to assist and show them his fighting techniques. He politely agreed to do what he could, but ultimately let her decide. The more time they spent together, the more Gregron approved of him. Though he was anxious to have Venron back, as was Volencia, but he was much more forthright with Damion about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia found she was content with just having him here with her. He explained what it was like back in Samanthia and Volencia wanted to go there desperately. When she asked, he was cordial, but made no promises. He did say that he would be going back soon, but never told her when.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Damion usually went to her room for their meetings, she got annoyed when she went to his. Claven&#39;s invitation sat on his nightstand, open, showing the date as it grew ever closer. It was one of the few things they argued about. She wanted him to have nothing to do with the prince. He kept telling her had had no intentions of siding with Claven and that she shouldn&#39;t worry but hadn&#39;t decided he wasn&#39;t going to go. That was what bothered her. He argued he could learn a lot. What they knew, wanted, even knowing how they lived could help him.  Volencia didn&#39;t understand why he needed to know any of this. She hated it. Though she&#39;d avoided saying anything more to him about it, worried the more she fought him on it, the more likely he&#39;d be to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Volencia?&#34; Her door opened slightly, and Damion poked his head in. &#34;Sorry to just open the door,&#34; he took a step in when she smiled and waived, &#34;We&#39;ve eaten together every morning and I&#39;ve knocked for a few minutes now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, I was lost in thought. I didn&#39;t even hear you knocking.&#34; She was already sitting at the table, their usual meal spread before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah, what were you thinking about?&#34; He didn&#39;t sit across from her as usual, this time he sat beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing, really.&#34; She blushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sipped his tea, smiling at her. &#34;Do you have anything particular planned for the next few days?&#34; He asked before taking a bite. His eyes sparkling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia shook her head. &#34;I haven&#39;t had anything to do for 50 years. I&#39;m kinda new to the idea of freedom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good.&#34; He skootched his chair closer to her and leaned in. &#34;I was thinking today would be a good day to see what we can do about your father. Gregron finally agreed to let me take you to Samanthia with me. So, we could be ready to go either tonight or tomorrow. I&#39;m going to transfer the curse from him to my sword, then I have a place near home where it will be safe to expel it. I&#39;m afraid to have it laying around too long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia nearly fell out of her chair as she jumped up and threw her arms around his neck. &#34;Really? You&#39;re going to help my father and take me to Samanthia?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion wrapped his arms around her. &#34;I was worried you would get angry if I tried to help your father and then left right away and didn&#39;t take you. I&#39;ve been waiting for Gregron to approve you going with me. Hopefully your father doesn&#39;t disapprove right away when he can finally speak again. If he does, I&#39;ll still need to go myself. Just don&#39;t get mad if that happens, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t, I promise.&#34; Volencia kissed his cheek. &#34;I had no idea that&#39;s what you were waiting for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion blushed, &#34;I didn&#39;t want to say anything and get your hopes up. I didn&#39;t think he&#39;d approve, but I didn&#39;t want to keep waiting either. I also didn&#39;t want you mad at them for saying no either. So, I&#39;ve been bidding my time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew there was a reason I like having you around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bit his lip, &#34;I&#39;ve enjoyed being around.&#34; His blush deepened as he focused on his breakfast. &#34;I&#39;m not going to lie, I&#39;m excited for you to meet my family. I think you&#39;ll all really like each other.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If they&#39;re anything like you, I&#39;m going to love them.&#34; She reached for her cup and Damion choked on whatever he had in his mouth. His blush only deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You shouldn&#39;t say things like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did I say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll love them&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I uh&#34; It was her turn to blush. &#34;That&#39;s not really what I meant. But, I mean, other than my parents, I&#39;ve never been as close to anyone as I am with you. You&#39;re technically my first friend. So, it doesn&#39;t have to mean anything else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion gave her half a smile and nodded. They finished their breakfast in a comfortable silence. &#34;I&#39;m going down to practice. I&#39;m doing the first hour of training and then we&#39;ll go see your father before lunch. I&#39;ll probably use too much energy and sleep for most of the day. Can you just make sure my sword stays safe?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course. Mind if I come watch training today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not at all. I don&#39;t get what is so interesting though.&#34;</p>
