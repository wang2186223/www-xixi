                <p>chapter Fifty-five **</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion took a long drink, enjoying the way her fingers wound in his hair. It had gotten darker outside, &#34;I&#39;m going to light a few more candles. Eat up. Remember, you&#39;re eating for two now.&#34; He was standing between her knees. Placing his drink down on the counter, his hands rubbed her belly gently, a smile playing at his lips. Looking up at her, he kissed her lips gently before grabbing a piece of fish from the tray beside him, dipping it in the chartis sauce before holding it up for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia took it with her lips, suckling on his finger as she did. When she let him go, he turned away. Grabbing a little stick from a vase near the kitchen window, he put it in the flame of an already burning candle, and lit more around the small hut. The light glow around them, and the smell of the burning candles relaxed Volencia. Slidding from the counter she carried the trays over to the table and then went back for their drinks. Topping of her milk and his ale. &#34;Come sit with me.&#34; She smiled, pulling the chair out for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion took his place, and she curled up on his lap. They fed each other for a while, caressing each other, occasionally nibbling at an earlobe, throat, or lip. As time slipped away, Volencia switched positions so that she was straddling him. His eyes went dark as her hands roamed his chest, scratching his back lightly. She played with each nipple, one at a time and he chuckled. &#34;Can I do that to you?&#34; His face was flushed, but he was slowly forgetting his boundaries. Not that she wanted him to break his promise, but she didn&#39;t feel like this qualified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling at the laces between her breast, the soft blue fabric loosened. She pressed the bodice down until it collected under her breasts. Damion licked his lips, watching. His eyes had transformed to that dark, forest green as her hands gently messaged her breasts. &#34;I wish they were bigger.&#34; She pouted, looking down. He looked into her eyes, surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you kidding? They&#39;re perfect.&#34; He leaned over, kissing her on the lips, trailing a blaze over her goose-raised skin. Her curled toes grazed the back of his calves as his large hand engulfed one breast and his lips found the other. When she arched against him, his hand found the small of her back, and he pressed her closer. The sudden need to be skin to skin was overwhelming for them both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia pressed her mound to his cock, rubbing up and down against him. Their clothes were still on. No sex. That was the agreement. Damion growled as she started to pick up speed running herself against him over and over. He lifted her by the waist onto the table, knocking the food to the side as he fought with her skirts. Lifting them until they were at her waist. He put himself back between her legs where her juices wet his pajama bottoms through. When she locked her legs behind him, pulling him in, he moaned. Loudly. &#34;Oh, this is just pure torture.&#34; His brow pinched together as he panted. Sweat was blossoming over his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia wiggled out of her dress, tossing it aside. &#34;You can keep your clothes on. But I like it when you look at me.&#34; With a quick intake of breath, he was all but lost. Damn the promise. How could he resist her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vixen.&#34; He smiled. When he stepped away, she watched excited as his cock came out and his pants fell around his ankles. He kicked them away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blushed, sitting up on the table. &#34;Wait.&#34; She said, &#34;Just remember, we&#39;re just playing.&#34; Her hand reached out, cupping his balls, his hands grabbed her shoulders. &#34;They&#39;re so smooth. Would it be okay if I kissed them?&#34; When those large blue eyes looked up at him, begging, he nearly jumped on top of her. &#34;Light kisses and a little lick here or there doesn&#39;t hurt. Right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not at all.&#34; He stepped between her legs, grabbing her bottom as he lifted her against him. She kissed him passionately, her fingers twining in his hair as he effortlessly carried her over to his nest. He stepped in first, then laid her down before pressing himself against her. She could feel his erection on her hip and she let herself twine around him as they kissed deeply and passionately. As he found her entrance she pulled away, sitting up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nope, not that.&#34; She smiled down at the frustrated look he was giving her. &#34;I promised.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, and then you decided to give me a full, absolutely amazing display. There&#39;s no way-&#34; Volencia covered his mouth, laughing joyfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; She nodded, letting her breast trail his chest as she moved over him, pressing him back into the plush softness. &#34;However. The rest of this has been really fun too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I can&#39;t disagree there.&#34; He closed his eyes. It was too much. Her hands and lips trailed over his strong, muscled chest and abs. Crawling between his legs, she rocked back, letting her lips find his cock. As her lips gently kissed and suckled at his throbbing member, her fingers gently ran along his side. As she touched just over his hip bone, his fingers curled into the blankets. She straddled one of his legs and ran her pussy over his thigh, shivering as their skin touched. Half sitting up he said. &#34;Turn around.&#34; With the soft curve of the nest, it was a bit of work for him to get her into the position he wanted, but with his legs up and over the edge, and him laying through the center, her thighs settled on either side of his ears. He pulled her hips down until her lips met his, and he suckled the juices from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia cried out as he found her. It was amazing. Her body already shivered, clenching as his tongue moved in and out of her licking and nipping at her tender flesh. She wanted to have him in her mouth too, but she was too short and couldn&#39;t reach him. Instead, her fingers slid over him, wrapping around him, and his hips jerked. His hands found her breasts, pulling her up so that she sat back on his face. As he growled, the sound reverberated through her, sending chills along her. Gyrating her hips, she bounced on him, pressing her hands against his chest as her movements became wild with need. &#34;Damion mhm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling his tongue out of her, his lips found her bud, and as he rolled it between his lips, she couldn&#39;t take it anymore. Crying out, stars twinkled at the edge of her vision. Her whole body pulsed with her orgasm, but Damion didn&#39;t stop, and she couldn&#39;t keep going. It was far too overwhelming. Pitching forward, she pulled herself away from him, taking him into her mouth. Still frantic with need, wanting to see him enjoy her as much as she had enjoyed him. She wanted him to have as much pleasure as he gave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Playing with his sack as her lips worked over him, his body trembled underneath her. She moaned as his fingers found her. He leaned up, his teeth biting gently into her flesh from behind. His fingers dug into her thighs as the growled low, falling back onto the cushions, his hips jerking as he came in her mouth. She continued to suckle him until his hands tried to pull her away. &#34;I can&#39;t&#34; he said breathlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting him slip from her mouth, she blew on him gently. His body racked with shivers again. Turning around in the nest, she curled up beside him. &#34;I love you.&#34; She whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion&#39;s arms wrapped around her, pulling her as close as he could. &#34;I love you.&#34; He sighed. Reaching down, she pulled the blankets up over them. &#34;Wait.&#34; He got up, blowing out all the candles and grabbed a glass of water. She took a quick sip before they cuddled close again. &#34;That was amazing. But with all that, we could have just had sex.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, but we can still say we didn&#39;t.&#34; She felt the heat rise on her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not sure we can honestly say that.&#34; He chuckled. &#34;I&#39;m pretty sure that counted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34; She whispered, burring her face in his chest. Goddess, she loved his smell. His touch. His everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be. That was amazing. Are you properly worn out now?&#34; His hand pushed her hair back, messaging her shoulders and arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am. Are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Completely spent.&#34; Quiet settled around them as they both drifted off to sleep. Content and happy laying in each other&#39;s arms.</p>
