                <p>Walking down the path our of the village, the world was quieter than Volencia had ever realized it could be. Birds sang in the distance and she could hear the bubbling of a brook nearby. Volencia&#39;s heart raced. The further the village fell behind them, the more intimate the atmosphere grew. Though she and Damion already spent a great deal of time together, he rarely allowed it to become romantic, and when he did, there was always the concern anyone could walk in on them at any time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out here though, in the quiet of the forest, it felt like they had left the world behind them. &#34;Damion?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their saunter slowed to a crawl as his soft eyes turned down at her, a smile playing at the corner of his lips. &#34;Yes?&#34; His voice was huskier than usual, sending a chill down Volencia&#39;s spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stopped walking, hesitant to say what she wanted to. Pulling her lip into her mouth, she looked away. Focused on the path that lay ahead of them. Watching her patiently, she could almost feel the way his eyes caressed her face and she felt the heat rise over her cheeks. &#34;I just I know you don&#39;t like to talk about the first day we met, but there&#39;s something I want you to know about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand reached out, touching her elbow. &#34;Okay, before you start may I say one thing?&#34; Volencia nodded, meeting his eye. &#34;I don&#39;t want you to regret or feel badly about it anymore. I would do it all again if it meant we would end up here. There&#39;s nothing to forgive, because you did nothing wrong. I just wanted you to know, I don&#39;t regret any of it.&#34; His fingers caressed her cheek. He was being so gentle; tears sprang to her eyes. Wiping them away, he kissed her forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know it bothers you, and so many things have gone wrong because of my choices that night.&#34; She took his hands away from her face, holding them in her own. Turning away from him she continued, &#34;I can even understand why you wouldn&#39;t want to claim this baby as your own. You say you don&#39;t regret that night, but you have no reason to. What happened was my fault. I just wanted you to know, there&#39;s not a day that goes by I don&#39;t wish I had waited for you. That I don&#39;t wish you had chosen me too. I want you to know, that I was scared and confused and lonely, but none of it excuses my behavior. I should never if only I&#34; Cover her eyes, she cried. She wanted to say this to him so badly, and now she couldn&#39;t even look at him. Her heart raced as she tried to stop the tears but couldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling her into his arms, he comforted her. &#34;Darling, I don&#39;t blame you. I understand how difficult it must have been for you. I&#39;m sorry that you&#39;ve been worried.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll do anything you want,&#34; She sobbed, clenching his shirt in her hands, &#34;We don&#39;t have to rescue him. I&#39;ll forget it all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Considering everything, how can we do that? How selfish would we be, having the chance to bring back Ephira and the All Father and then to do nothing?&#34; She looked up at him, smiling down at her, his hair ruffled by the breeze. His sincerity touched her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tucked a few stray strands back behind his ear, allowing her hand to rest on his cheek. &#34;I already know, I&#39;m not willing to trade you for him. If that&#39;s what it means&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smile faded, his face turning toward the canopy of trees above them. &#34;We don&#39;t know that. Let&#39;s not complicate this with assumptions. Not tonight. Come, we don&#39;t want to run out of time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling a handkerchief out of his pocket, he tenderly wiped at her tears. Catching her face, he leaned down, pressing his lips to hers. &#34;Let&#39;s talk about happier things. I want to focus on us tonight. Once we do that, we&#39;ll be ready to talk about everything else. Besides, I don&#39;t want you stressing over what we can&#39;t control. It can&#39;t be good for our baby.&#34; His emphasis had Volencia sobbing again. Handing her the handkerchief, he put his arm around her, steering her down the path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You said, our baby.&#34; Their fingers entwined as they walked. The path curved and soon they were walking beside the brook she heard earlier. The path was lined with a full rainbow of different colored lilies, leaving the air smelling sweet and heavy with pollen. Damion plucked a number of them, all different colors, tying the stems with a ribbon from his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course. I was a little shocked by the idea at first, but I&#39;ve always wanted a son or daughter to adore. I mean, really, this is a dream come true for me. The timing was a shock, but he or she will definitely be mine, and I have every intention of making sure I&#39;m the best dad I can be.&#34; He handed her the bouquet, &#34;Especially since I know you&#39;ll be a fabulous mom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; She smiled, stopping to wrap her arms around him as she sobbed. He gave her a little time, before lifting her face to his and kissing her tear-stained cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wiping away the tears, he nodded at the path. &#34;Almost there, come. Only happy thoughts from here on out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You forget, my emotions are completely unchecked these days. Even if we only focus on happy things, I can&#39;t promise I won&#39;t still cry or get emotional.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes later, the small clearing opened before them held a crystal-clear lake with a small waterfall, which created a gentle mist around them, and sent continuous ripples over the water. Flowers bloomed across the entire clearing. Even the trees surrounding them bloomed heavily with flowers. &#34;Is this it?&#34; Volencia asked breathlessly, kneeling on a rock to stick her hand in the water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is the place, yes. But I brought you here to meet someone. While we wait, can I tell you about a Samanthian tradition?&#34; Damion sat beside her, pulling his boots off and rolling up the bottom of his pants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would love to hear it.&#34; She smiled, following suit, though it was much easier to hike up her skirts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, a few years ago, Trey asked an orphaned Birna to be his wife. He had been madly in love with her for years, but the Ma and Da&#39;s of our families are very important. When she lost both her parents, she felt like she wasn&#39;t good enough for him, and denied him when he asked to marry her. But Trey&#39;s never been one to give up easily, and he knew she loved him. So, instead, he brought her here and asked again. She denied him a second time though, admitting she didn&#39;t feel like she deserved him. Trey looked her in the eye that day and asked, if the gods send an omen of love, a miracle here to bless our union, would you reconsider? Birna agreed that, if such a thing happened, she would marry him. When a unicorn walked out of the forest just minutes later to drink from the pool, it was enough to convince her that they should be together.&#34; Damion leaned back, resting in the grass as his legs dangled in the water. Volencia watched the mist from the waterfall spray twinkling droplets over the flora. &#34;Would you require proof from me? That the goddess blesses our marriage if I were to ask?&#34; Damion sat up, his demeanor becoming serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia laughed, but he only looked more concerned when she did. &#34;If I&#39;m supposed to be the physical embodiment of Ephira herself, it wouldn&#39;t make sense for me to wait on such things.&#34; She met his eyes, smiling despite the concern there. &#34;It would make sense for me to follow my heart instead, wouldn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inching closer to her, he whispered in her ear, &#34;Remind me again, where does your heart lie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perching herself on his lap, she trailed kisses across his jawline until she reached his earlobe. His arms wrapped around her, and he shivered as she started to nibble at his ear. &#34;Don&#39;t pretend you don&#39;t know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion shifted her around as he reached back to a satchel that hung near his hip, pulling out an intricately carved box. Volencia remembered seeing it sitting in a prominent spot on the shelves in his home. A lovely dark wood, the pearlescent inlay created a picture of the goddess lily, the sparkling white material practically glowed in the evening sun. &#34;What is this?&#34; She asked, her fingers grazing the lid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes sparkled at her, &#34;Take a look inside.&#34; He chewed on his lip nervously, his excitement was endearing. He wasn&#39;t focused on the box, his gaze never left her. He was flush and she could feel his heart hammering away in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting the lid, a glowing star sat on a bed of black velvet. Volencia could only stare between him and the beautiful necklace, all words alluding her. The star was made from something similar to a white and clear marbled sea-glass, emanating a faint glow from the center of the twelve-pointed star. &#34;This is the most precious thing I own.&#34; The star was accented in silver and etched with intricate twirling designs. &#34;The only thing I have left of my birth mother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was only one reason Volencia could think of that he would be giving this to her. Her heart raced as her fingers grazed the star. &#34;It is beautiful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m hoping it will be yours soon.&#34; He laid the box aside, holding just the star dangling between them. His smile was so deep, his dimple was showing, and there was almost a second. He was breathless as he asked, &#34;Volencia, will you be my wife?&#34;</p>
