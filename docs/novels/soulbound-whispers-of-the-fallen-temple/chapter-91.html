                <p>chapter Eighty-four</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike the others, when Travion stepped close to the mirror, it extended out toward Damion like it had when they entered the tower in Thambair. Long fingers of the swirling vortex wound around him. As Volencia watched, the liquid-like substance looked as if it wanted to pull the black beast from his brother&#39;s arms. Damion growled softly as Trey took a step in, his eyes opening to meet Volencia&#39;s. She swallowed hard. He looked scared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The princess had expected to step in and out as per the usual when using the mirrors. But it wasn&#39;t like that this time. They entered into a space where there were no distinct doors or walls. The only tangible things to be seen were the frames of the mirrors. Though they appeared hazy and far away. The floor itself felt like they were walking through thick mud. There didn&#39;t seem to be any definite distances, and it felt like they were walking through a thick fog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Travion?&#34; She whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve entered the void. I told you it would be different.&#34; Travion said back, but even his voice sounded weak and though they were close, as if she couldn&#39;t tell where it was actually coming from. He seemed to be trying to walk toward the closest mirror as quickly as possible, but no matter how many steps they took, it didn&#39;t feel like they were getting any closer. Only getting further away from where they came in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The further into the void they went, the more agitated Damion became. Though it was clear it wasn&#39;t intentional, she could see his claws digging into Travion&#39;s shirt. Soon there were trails of red over the fabric. The Samanthian didn&#39;t complain or become angry, he just held tighter to his brother, whispering calming words to him, trying to move more quickly through the void. Volencia tried to keep her hand on Damion. Keeping her eyes on his, but he didn&#39;t even seem to notice her. His head kept moving to the right, as if something was coming. Something he seemed to be afraid of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It still seemed as if they were walking a never-ending road. Peeking around Travion, she was positive they were no closer than when they started. Looking both ways, her heart pounded. To their right, the fog had grown darker and seemed to be the only thing here getting closer to them. &#34;Trey&#34; Both her hands were now grabbing his shirt, and Damion&#39;s tail was now whipping around them uncontrollably. His growls seemed to surround them in the deafening silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re not going to make it out before that thing gets to us.&#34; Trey&#39;s voice was hoarse, and he was now struggling to keep Damion contained. It was clear the beast wanted down, as he started to fight harder and Trey was forced to stop to try to wrestle the thing into submission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damion! You&#39;re going to hurt him!&#34; Volencia went to grab him, but he turned snapping at her. She backed up, holding her hand against her chest. She wasn&#39;t sure if he had done it on purpose, or if he was just warning her back, but to see him lash out at the two of them did scare her. Travion had given her warnings, but she had thought things would be different. The beast finally got a clawed foot against Trey&#39;s leg, with an arm against his chest and pushed off. Travion flew backward, landing painfully on Volencia. The beast lurched, putting itself between them and the darkness that had grown scarily close. His growls a menacing warning to whatever closed in on them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia wriggled out from under Travion, tears stinging her eyes. There was a gash on his leg which was worse than the three staining his tunic, which looked more like scratches than an actual open wound. Travion had enough strength to sit up, wrapping his hands around the upper part of his thigh. His focus was not on the slice in his flesh though, his eyes were wide, watching as the beast body shook, growling menacingly at the shadow that continued to creep in on him. Though, now that he was free, it was moving closer to them more quickly. What seemed a last ditch effort on his part, Damion gave a last loud roar that resonated through Volencia&#39;s chest before the darkness started to surround him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crying out, Volencia tried to go to him, but Travion wrapped an arm around her waist holding her back. &#34;There&#39;s nothing you can do!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion rose on his back legs, as if trying to fight off the darkness. There was no tangible thing to fight, so the effort was futile. Soon, the darkness coalesced around him. His legs gave way, falling to the ground. Onto his claws and knees, then rolling over as his body convulsed. Volencia fought to try to get close to him, but to no avail. Travion held her tight against him, watching with his own horrified expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion&#39;s body spasmed, the seizures getting worse. There was nothing Trey or her could do but watch. Volencia sobbed, crying out as his visage crumpled into twisted pain and fear. The darkness started to wane. As it did, the scales smoothed. His skin turned from inky black to its normal tan. Eventually the spasms calmed, and a naked Damion lay before them, the thick fog rolled around them. Volencia pushed herself from Travion&#39;s arms. This time he let her go. Running to him, she practically threw herself on top of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damion?&#34; She repeatedly saying his name as her hands roamed over the wounds on his body. One by one though, they quickly disappeared. Her hands found his hair and her lips his face, as she kissed him everywhere. &#34;You&#39;re going to be okay. You have to be.&#34; Half his hair was gone now, chopped off just below his ears. Not that it mattered. Not if he was fine. When he moaned, her arms instinctively pulled him close. &#34;I was so scared. Oh, my love.&#34; She broke into broken words and bursts of tears. When he pushed himself onto his elbows, his head cocked to the side. One large hand rubbing her back. But when Volencia pulled away, the fear welled up again. His eyes weren&#39;t green, nor were they silver. This time, they were black with millions of silver and gold specs twinkling like a galaxy inside them. &#34;H-Hero?&#34; When he frowned, her heart skipped a beat. But there was confusion there too. How much didn&#39;t he remember. &#34;Dodo you know who I am?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes searched her face, before bouncing behind her. &#34;Stay back.&#34; His voice was hoarse. She was pushed behind him as he got into a crouched position. A soldier poked his head through the mirror. Damion glared at him. &#34;Well, I wasn&#39;t expecting to see you here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I need to see for myself. Is itreally you?&#34; His violet eyes watching Damion hopefully, his words soft. &#34;Then, you are back. It&#39;s really happening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion&#39;s eyes narrowed at the soldier, but he didn&#39;t answer. Only glared. Volencia and Travion exchanged glances, but both stayed silent. Watching the interaction between the two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The soldier&#39;s foot entered the mirror, and Damion&#39;s head cocked to the side, watching with rapt attention. &#34;II wanted to, well, I guess I need to apologize. It was never meant to be this way.&#34; The elf started to move further into the mirror, and was nearly all the way in when he stopped suddenly. &#34;I won&#39;t leave this place if I go any further, will I?&#34; His face fell as he looked up at Damion. &#34;You know, it&#39;s almost uncanny how much he looks like you always chose to. I should have known from the moment I saw him that you were coming back. But, it&#39;s not surprising. I&#39;ve seen you in thousands of faces. The only real difference this time was the nihility. And I never imagined you could at least, not from here.&#34; His eyes wandered the mirrors before he chuckled. &#34;Toran did this purposefully. He new you could enter the void and created a space using the towers to bring you back. I never guessed it. Neither of us did. My brother is going to be shocked. And perhaps angry. He pressed for these mirrors. I guess Toran outsmarted him after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elf chuckled, but when Damion started to walk toward him, he pulled out from the mirror, leaving only his head still in. The only reason he did paused was because Damion had stopped advancing toward him. &#34;I will have my revenge. You took everything from me.&#34; Damion growled deep in his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look, I understand that you would want revenge on my brother, but I truly never--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are even worse.&#34; The growl that emitted from Damion this time was enough of a warning. The elf nodded, his face falling, before he disappeared through the mirror. For a long time, he stared after him, as if waiting for someone else to show up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**We&#39;re at the end of our story. I hope you enjoyed. Next</p>
