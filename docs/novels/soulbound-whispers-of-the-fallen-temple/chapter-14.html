                <p>Volencia invited him to sit at the table across from her. &#34;I want to give you a job. I want you to be my protector. I want you to train me how to use my magic and how to fight.&#34; He nibbled on a fruity tart, looking it over. Realizing he&#39;d probably never had one before surprised her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He poured a cup of tea for both of them but sipped at his milk while waiting for it to cool. &#34;And your father will be okay hiring me?&#34; He asked, sounding skeptical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia bristled, her hand dropping away from her mouth as she was about to pop a small piece of fruit into it. &#34;I don&#39;t need his permission to hire a protector for myself. And I don&#39;t need his approval.&#34; She felt her back straighten and her chin rise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The corner of his mouth quirked up, a shadow of the smile he had the morning before playing there. &#34;I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m guessing you don&#39;t like when folk assume you need permission? I&#39;m just asking because my dad said I should reference the King in all decisions. The rules are much simpler in Samanthia, there is little room for misinterpretation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been running this kingdom without need of his wisdom for a long time. I don&#39;t need him now.&#34; She took a sip of her tea to calmed herself. &#34;Though I will be grateful to have him back. To be able to speak with him, and learn from him. I&#39;m not upset that you are going to try to give him back to me, I just I&#39;m tired of folk assuming that because I am female, I don&#39;t have a mind of my own or the wit to decide for myself.&#34; She broke a biscuit in half, dipping it in her milk before taking a bite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion cleared his throat, his smile widening. &#34;I never thought anything of the sort. You clearly have your wit. And I&#39;ve never seen bravery like you showed yesterday. You begged for amisty for your folk but not yourself.&#34; He blushed, looking away. &#34;I only meant that with waking your father from the bindings holding him, he&#39;s not going to come out angry about my being here, or think it&#39;s inappropriate to have a male protector?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t imagine what he would have to be angry about? I&#39;ve just never had anyone I trusted enough to ask.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why trust me? You don&#39;t even know me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She placed the wooden rose on the table between them, &#34;A reminder that things we think are just normal reaction can be construed as heroism.&#34; She smiled. &#34;You jumped up to help an old woman who had nothing to offer you. You came to my rescue, having your own agenda to worry about, and risked your life for me. You didn&#39;t even know my name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still don&#39;t.&#34; He mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve shown your true character more in the last day than most ever do in their lives. I would risk having you as a protector over anyone else. And my apologies, my name Volencia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Princess.&#34; He smiled. It wasn&#39;t deep enough to show his teeth or dimple, but it was enough for now, considering what they&#39;d been through together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion didn&#39;t look back at her, instead focusing on his food. The quiet surrounding them didn&#39;t seem as stiff or awful this time. Their eyes fluttered around the room and each other like an intricate dance. Their lips joined in a small smile here, the way he licked a drip of honey where it clung to the edge of his lower lip. Her mind wandered to the night before, and she wanted to desperately to pull him into her arms and show him how wonderful it had been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting in silence together, and the way their bodies spoke to each other seemed incredibly intimate. Before she&#39;d finished her tea, her whole body tingled with desire. She closed her eyes, bringing herself back to what they had been talking about. Hoping the thought of business would put her emotions back into check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, so I&#39;m thinking I should pay you two gold pieces a fortnight. A total of four for every turn of the moon. If you would be willing to be my protector, as Gregron is for my father. Plus teach me how to use my magic and fight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that a normal pay for something like this? Our village doesn&#39;t use any form of money, so I don&#39;t know the price of salt here in the city.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gregron gets paid this same amount, and your job would very much mirror his. So, you should make the same amount. I also want you to help me with everything Hero talked about yesterday, and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t like that you call him that.&#34; His green eyes were hard when they looked back up at her. &#34;That was what I called you when we first met. Remember?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do.&#34; She nodded. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, the turn of events at the time I started calling him that. It was supposed to be endearing to our meeting and how things unfolded. I wasn&#39;t trying to be rude. Do you have something you&#39;d prefer?&#34; She watched him over the edge of her teacup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about Ghost? We don&#39;t know anything about him. Who he is? Where he is?&#34; He looked like he wanted to say more, but chose not to, instead grumbling under his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tucked the name Hero away in her heart sadly, remembering how proud he&#39;d been when she first called him that. Certainly, it wasn&#39;t important enough to upset Damion over it any more than he already was. If she hadn&#39;t been so careless with his feelings, she wondered if he would bother over the name at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She nodded, Ghost it is then.&#34; She gave him an encouraging smile, hoping he would understand that all she wanted was to make things right. The more they talked, the more she found they were leaning in toward each other, making eye contact more than briefly, and even inching their chairs closer to one another. It happened the same way last night with him. It hadn&#39;t only been Hero she&#39;d felt that physical pull toward, just being near Damion, she wanted to touch him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once breakfast was finished, they parted ways. Damion wanted to bathe, and she needed more sleep. Since her bed had been relieved of any blankets, she took a throw blanket from the back of her sitting couch and curled up on it. It was a comfortable place to rest, as the cushions felt like they were wrapping around her and holding her. She drifted off into peaceful dreams, where silver eyes twinkled down at her, and soft lips claimed her fully.</p>
