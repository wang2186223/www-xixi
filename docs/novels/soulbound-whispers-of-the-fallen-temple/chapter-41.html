                <p>chapter Forty</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know Venron and I grew up together in the Temple of Ephira. We have a better understanding than most about the creation story and all the other stories that followed. We believed there was always a sign or some prophecy that would announce when a mortal representation of Ephira and the father came into the world. After the War of the Magi, he and I, Toakencia and all our spouses made a pact to do whatever we could to help them if it happened in our lifetime. There was a prophecy Venron started to chase after. It spoke of a child to be born of an old race, that sounded like it was coming to fruition. About a boy, born to the first future Queen of the dark hive to not have pure blood. A child who would be born with both types of magic. Brambee, you mother was not fully a Dark Hive elf. Her father was a merchant who happened to be lost when a Dark Hive elf found him and brought him to the Queen. So enchanted by him was she that she took him to bed, and your mother was the product of their time together. When they found out she was having her first child, they knew the prophecy was coming to light and told her they would be killing the child; for it had been told that when he came of age, the future of our would rest in the palm of his hands. He would either be the world&#39;s salvation, or its destruction.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion sat up, putting his hands over his face. &#34;The day is over, yet it still continues to get worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trey placed a hand one his shoulder. &#34;Maybe we should wait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Damion nodded at his father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Venron went to the Hive to plead for the child&#39;s life. Brambee refused to leave with him though, and the Queen believed the only plausible option the boy would have was to destroy the world because of how unbalanced it already was. She would not relent. So Venron, unbeknownst to them, cast a spell to let him know when she went into labor so that he could come back on that day to rescue him to rescue you. Imagine his surprise when the time came and he found her outside our village. She&#39;d decided that she didn&#39;t want her mother to kill you and hand come to find a safe haven to have you. She&#39;d been so close.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion knew what had come next. The birth had killed her. His magic had been too much, and the Night Creatures were all around them. That had been the Night his father had lost his arm trying to protect a dying elf and the newborn that killed her. He&#39;d heard from another warrior that he had ripped out his mother&#39;s stomach. The village had seen him as a threat for many years. That he knew firsthand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Venron hadn&#39;t been able to stay too long. His own child was being born that same night, so he had to go, but promised to come back for you when he could. The original plan was that he was going to take you back with him and raise you as a twin to his own child. The timing had been perfect. But the day his daughter was born, the winter snow melted around the castle grounds and flowers bloomed overnight. A pond formed in their gardens and Goddess Lilies blossomed above the water. We hadn&#39;t seen lilies like that since the demise of the Temple. When Venron came back, he was horrified to find the same kind of miracle at work here in Samanthia. But there were no Goddess Lilies here.  Instead, the first tree from the Temple blossomed exactly where your mother had passed. It became clear to us that there was more going on here than we expected. To have you both born the same day to have such miracles proclaim you were the equivalent of the God and Goddess we mourned. This was not the life which we had wanted for either of you, and we had no idea what to do. The little we knew of past mortals who had come was that it was the moment they met that their destinies intertwined. So Venron left you with us to be raised here, unable to allow you to meet his daughter. At least not yet. It wasn&#39;t clear when you should meet until the day Rosencia gave her life to protect her daughter. That was when we knew, the day the shield would fall, fifty years to the day that is was risen, would be the most dangerous day of her young life. They would come for her, and there was no one left to protect her from them. No one but you. That was when Toakencia brought the coursebine sword for you to learn with. She knew that it would be the best weapon for you to use against them. When you figured out how to use the power in the sword, I knew that you would be able to help remove Venron&#39;s curse. You, the child born of both creation magic and nihility magic. I didn&#39;t tell you because I was afraid you would fight it because of your past. I worried that you would hesitate before the Council, and they would get an opportunity to harm you. Of course, I also worried that the darkness would consume you we&#39;ve all seen it here. We fear it to, Damion. The decision was not made lightly to send you there unknowingly. But we believed that the darkness was still a better risk than allowing Volencia to be taken in by the Council. They would have destroyed her. Like they have in the past to others who represented the mortal power of Ephira. Beyond all else, we must protect her, and we must try to save the All Father. We need to put the world back to rights. Only he can rebalance the scales of good and evil. Only he can save us from the Council and the Empire they are trying to create.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion stood, grabbing a pillow and blanket. &#34;Where are you going?&#34; His mom asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To sleep under the tree. I need to be alone.&#34; His mom and dad started to argue, &#34;Look, do you both understand, you haven&#39;t been raising a God. You&#39;ve been raising the mortal who is meant to take his place in the eternal fire. This story does not end happily for me. If I take up this torch as you wish me to, I will be destined to an eternity of flames and heart break. I may be falling in love with the princess, but it will only shatter me when the time comes that I need to leave her to love another. Nothing good comes of this future for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damion&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t Trey.&#34; He didn&#39;t stay to argue, the door closed with a finality to it and he curled up under the charts tree, but sleep was as illusive tonight as it had been the past few. Anger welled up on him, none of this was fair. He hadn&#39;t asked to be born to some God forsaken prophecy. Yet, he was starting to understand it. His choice would decide the fate of the world. He could be the good guy and take the flames, or he would destroy everything by choosing himself over the world and the All Father. He was destined to lose everything no matter what.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He got up, listening to see if anyone in his house was still awake. He knocked on the door softly. &#34;Yes?&#34; he heard Trishia on the other side of the door whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s Damion, would I be able to come in to grab a few things?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened, and he brushed past her. &#34;I thought you were going to sleep?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tried. It&#39;s not really working out that way, so I figured I&#39;d at least make myself useful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grabbed his travel bag and two swords. He slung the coursebine sword over his shoulder and belted his iron to his hip. &#34;Wait are you going off to battle?&#34; She sounded nervous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I&#39;m going out to store the curse from Venron. This is just in case I run into anything thing that thinks I look like a tasty snack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Those creatures are out right now. You can&#39;t--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t presume to tell me what I can and cannot do. I&#39;ve lived here my whole life. I&#39;ve already killed more of them than you can possibly imagine. I&#39;ll be back around sunrise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slipped out the door silently. He&#39;d never talked to either one of them like that, and he was angry at the shock and fear he&#39;d seen in her eyes. He stood in the dark under tree alone for a long time before crossing from the safety of the village to the dark forest. If Travion knew what he was doing right now, he&#39;d be furious.</p>
