                <p>chapter Forty-seven</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia smiled as Damion pulled his dad into an embrace. She turned, grabbing the plate they would share and focused on filling it to give them a little privacy. Kirna was fixing her plate and Lennion&#39;s while the others took their seats at the table. &#34;Welcome to the family, love. I have rarely seen Damion as happy as he&#39;s been these last few days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been an overwhelming few day for me, and I think it&#39;s been more so for him. He&#39;s also very happy to be home, and I can&#39;t thank you all enough for having me here as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kirna nodded. &#34;All of this would have had a much different impact on him without out you here. I&#39;m glad he has you in his life. Thank you for being there for my son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she carried their plate to the table, Damion was helping Lennion to his seat. She headed back to the counter, &#34;What would you like to drink darling?&#34; Her fingers grazing his back as she passed by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mead is fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kirna, do you have any milk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, it&#39;s in the jar on the middle shelf up there.&#34; As Kirna pointed, Volencia looked over. She was never going to be able to reach that high up. &#34;I&#39;ll get it for you in a moment, love.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia nodded, pouring the mead for her newly betrothed. Damion was smiling up at her from their shared space as she returned. Settling herself between his legs, she perched on his thigh, wrapping her legs around his.  His arm circled her and his large hand settled on her thigh, she squirmed a little. Volencia felt awkward being so intimate with him in front of everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Before we start,&#34; Travion announced, raising his cup, &#34;I&#39;d like to shout hurrah and raise my cup in blessings up to Damion and Volencia, may your cups always flow over, and may happiness and joy fill you always. May the Goddess and All Father shine their light and wisdom upon you both and honor you with fertility.&#34; Everyone at the table raised their cups and shouted, &#34;HURRAH!&#34; Even little Lenny joined in giggling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion&#39;s hand slid up her thigh, moving slowly up over her hip until he pulled her closer settling on her belly. &#34;We are already blessed in so many ways.&#34; He whispered in her ear. The idea of being responsible for another life was still new, and terrifying, but she was also excited to share this adventure with Damion. He was great with the striplings in the village, and she just knew he would make an amazing father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The day you walked into my life, you changed everything.&#34; She pressed a kiss to his forehead. &#34;I&#39;ve never been so happy.&#34; He lifted a fork full of meat up to Volencia&#39;s lips, covered in a bit of tomato jam. His eyes hovered on her lips as she took the bite. Once her mouth was empty, she smiled at him. &#34;Do you hope for a boy or a girl?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion shrugged, &#34;I&#39;ve always wanted a son, but when I think about having a daughter like you, I&#39;m just as excited. No matter what, I&#39;ll be the happiest dad in all of Ephira.&#34; He picked up some of the vegetables next, holding them up for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he fed her, and with their close proximity, she wanted to touch him more, kiss him, and whisper in his ear, but she contained herself, as the family was all around them. &#34;Potatoes next, please.&#34; She smiled, and he obeyed. She&#39;d never been fed by anyone like this before, but she was adoring how intimate it felt. Different conversations broke out around the table, but Damion and Volencia only had eyes for each other as they spoke softly back and forth. In their own little bubble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think, Damion? You agree that we should expand westward and start working to build the town closer to the pond and not the river toward the south, right?&#34; Birna asked, her eyes settling on the two of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia&#39;s hand had found its way into the back of his shirt and she was running her fingers along the small of his back, they weren&#39;t even paying attention to the food in front of them anymore. As soon as Volencia had started scratching his back, Damion nuzzled his face into the crook of her neck, eyes closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Birna, he&#39;s not listening to a word any of us are saying. Poor guy is still half asleep. It&#39;s not that he doesn&#39;t care or want to talk about expanding the town, but right now, doesn&#39;t seem to be the best time. We should let him rest.&#34; Trey touched his wife&#39;s shoulder gently before leaning in to whisper in her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion opened his eyes slightly, looking at his sister from behind Volencia&#39;s back. &#34;Trey&#39;s right. I&#39;m not paying attention. I&#39;m sorry. I am still very tired. A few hours sleep, after three days of none, wasn&#39;t enough. My mind is still fried after last night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Birna nodded, frowning. &#34;Then why don&#39;t you head off to sleep now? That would make you feel better, wouldn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34; Damion chuckled, nestling back into Volencia, who rubbed the hair out of his face. &#34;But I don&#39;t want to miss dinner with all of you. I have missed you. And now I don&#39;t want to go lay in bed alone. I&#39;m happy right here, even if I&#39;m half asleep while doing it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kirna smiled at the group at large, &#34;I can make up the bed, and you could go lay down. You don&#39;t have to leave. We&#39;ll be quiet if you fall asleep.&#34; Kirna said, standing to clear the dishes from the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually, I was hoping Birna and Lenny could stay here and I could stay with Trey. I&#39;d like some time to talk to him alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course.&#34; Both Birna and Kirna chimed together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you want some pie before you go?&#34; Kirna held up a plate that already bore two pieces of pie and was walking it over to the table to place it before them. She knew her son well enough to know that he would not deny himself a piece of pie, no matter what. As she placed the plate before them, she smiled down at her newest daughter, &#34;Will you be going to bed early too? You are welcome to stay and chit chat or we could play a game of cards.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I actually have a ton of questions, and a few books I would like to know more about. So, if you don&#39;t mind me running home really quick when we&#39;re done and changing into my bed clothes and then coming back with the books I found I would really like that.&#34; Volencia said, messaging the back of his head. She reached for their fork and lifted it to his mouth. &#34;Open up.&#34; He smiled but didn&#39;t bother to lift his head or open his eyes as she put the sweet and tarty pie in his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d love for you to come back and ask any questions you have. I&#39;m thrilled your comfortable enough to do so. In your bed clothes no less. You already fit into this family perfectly.&#34; She went back to the kitchen and dished out more of the pie, delivering it to the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe I will stay.&#34; Damion said in a husky voice, chucking into her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia blushed, taking a bite of pie before offering Damion another. &#34;We can take a moment before I get ready for bed, you definitely need to sleep tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. There&#39;s something I need to do tomorrow. It&#39;s going to be a surprise for you.&#34; Damion finally lifted his head, sitting back in the chair. Volencia leaned against him, smiling up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to keep surprising me. Today was more than enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trey&#39;s going to come with me too.&#34; She was still feeding him the desert, which left his hands free to roam. As he caressed her thigh, waist, and belly, she blushed incessantly. She was sure that, even though they couldn&#39;t see what he was doing, because it was out of view under the large table, they must have known what it was because of her reactions. It was almost embarrassing, but since no one commented or made a fuss, she figured it must be fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anyone else want another drink?&#34; Trey asked, getting up to pour himself more ale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll have some water, if you don&#39;t mind.&#34; Damion said around a mouthful of chartis pie. As Travion set the cup down before them, Volencia grabbed it, taking a long swig. Damion raised a brow at her but didn&#39;t argue or complain. &#34;Alright,&#34; Damion said a few minutes later, I&#39;m going to head off. Give me just a few minutes Trey and then head over, otherwise I&#39;ll probably fall asleep on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fair enough.&#34; Trey nodded. Taking away their empty plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to follow you. I want to change anyway. Get all nice and cozy. Maybe you can plait my hair for me when I get back, Kirna?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would love to and call me mom.&#34;</p>
