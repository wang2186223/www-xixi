                <p>&#34;It&#39;s building up. It needs to be released.&#34; Venron&#39;s words were quiet. He wasn&#39;t sure about any of this, but he knew his daughter wouldn&#39;t last long like this. The healers walked back into the room, standing behind the two elves kneeling before the princess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I do that, like I did when I touched the invitation for Claven&#39;s event? I won&#39;t hurt either of them, will it?&#34; Venron stood, going to where Gregron stood, his arms folded over his chest, a worried scowl watching them. Grabbing the Captain&#39;s hand, he pulled him along until they were staring down at Volencia together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t understand&#34; Gregron whispered, &#34;I don&#39;t know anything about-&#34; Venron hit his arm, his lips pressed together. When Gregron only stared at him, looking confused, Venron sighed and paced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve been talking it over.&#34; The healer looked between them all. &#34;The best we&#39;ll be able to do to help is remove the child. It&#39;s clearly the root of the issue.&#34; Volencia cried out, clinging to Damion, who felt his panic rising. If he didn&#39;t figure out what the King was trying to tell him, he would lose his baby. &#34;And after this type of surgery, there would be the chance she won&#39;t be able conceve again. But it would be better than losing the only heir we have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re not going to let that happen.&#34; Damion answered shakily, pulling Volencia into his arms. She cried out, but still clung to him. Begging him over and over to save the baby. Losing him would destroy her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what are you going to do?&#34; The head healer scoffed, but Gladia elbowed him in his side, shaking her head. &#34;Because we think you&#39;ve already done enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion ignored the elf, because if he didn&#39;t, the healer would likely crawl out of this room with broken bones. Taking in a deep shaky breath, he swallowed hard, his hand trembling as it moved slowly closer to her stomach. Venron grabbed his hand, making a fist, and placing it in a position where it hovered above her stomach, directly in the center. Venron spread his own hands open, his pointer fingers and thumbs circling Damion&#39;s fist, while the other fingers spread out wide. He wiggled the six that weren&#39;t making the circle around Damion&#39;s fist. His hands vanished, and he gave Damion a thumbs up. Then cupping his hands, he covered Damion&#39;s fist, staring at him a moment, then shaking his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to leave some of the magic around the baby, and make sure I don&#39;t touch him while removing the surrounding magic which is compacting in her stomach?&#34; Damion&#39;s brow hitched. If that wasn&#39;t what the king was saying, then he had no idea what it was. A small smile hitched at the corners of the King&#39;s lips. But he stayed silent, sitting back on his haunches. Damion turned back to Volencia&#39;s upper half, pushing her hair out of her face. &#34;I&#39;m going to do my best. I love you, darling.&#34; His lips pressed hers gently. The tears staining their cheeks mixing as he pulled her into him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you. I&#39;m so sorry.&#34; Her voice rasped. He normally would argue with her about that apology, but it wasn&#39;t worth it. Peppering kisses on her forehead, nose, and each eye. He repeated the words to her. His gut clentched and he couldn&#39;t remember the last time he&#39;d been so terrified to try a spell. Especially one he knew as well as releasing magic into the void, no less.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at her belly, the black veins over her porceline skin were terrifying. He wondered if that&#39;s what his skin looked like to others. Caressing her briefly, his hand pulled away as she sobbed. His touch was causing too much pain for her, and his stomache roiled for it. If she did this the entire time he would likely panic. His heart already felt like it was going to burst from his chest. He needed both hands on her, to do what had to be done. His left would watch, with his creation magic, to make sure he didn&#39;t get too close to the babe. With his right hand, he drew out the ruine and had to keep it moving in order to draw out the magic to be tossed into the void.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When his hand made contact, she inhailed, becoming as stiff as a board. Her sobs and moans destroying him. But as he started to trace the ruines on her skin to collect the nihility magic boiling in her system, she started screaming. He was able to pull only a little out before complete panic overtook him, and he broke the connection, pulling her into his arms as they sobbed together. &#34;I&#39;m so sorry I don&#39;t think I can do this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please. We don&#39;t have a choice.&#34; She clung to him. &#34;Don&#39;t worry about me. I&#39;ll be fine.&#34; Her voice was hoarse, and even with her whispering in his ear, he was having a hard time hearing what she said. Breathing in her scent, he tried to calm his nerves. If he lost her, his entire world would be over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damion, you&#39;re going to have to push through.&#34; Gladia put a soft hand on his shoulder. &#34;I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll last much longer if you don&#39;t do something. I know it&#39;s hard, but it will likely save at least her life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay, love.&#34; Her hand came up to cup his face, but she was too weak, and her fingers only lightly touch his chin before her hand fell. Venron sat beside her, pulling her into his arms and leaning her against his chest. She clung to her father&#39;s arms as Damion&#39;s hands hovered over her belly. He looked at her with concern again. Wishing like hell Travion was here. If he were, he would have taken her pain just like he did with the unicorns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Squeezing his eyes closed, Damion called upon his magic. He started with creation, to help him view and protect the baby. But once he started tracing the ruines to pull the nihility magic from her into the void, she arched. She bit her lip, trying desperately not to scream, but he could still hear it. Deep in his mind and throughout his entire soul. It was killing him, but he couldn&#39;t stop. Peeking a look, he saw the vining black curls over her belly fading away. The further down into her belly he had to go, the more pain it seemed to cause her. Her leg kicked up, and the blanket started to fall off her. It was Gladia who reached over pulling the blanket back in place to keep her modestly covered. The closer he got to the baby, the slower he forced the draw to go. Ebbing his way ever closer to the little life growing in Volencia&#39;s belly. Though it felt like forever, it did finally end, and Damion pulled his hands away from her, tears still streaming down his face. He sat back on his heals, watching the relief flood over her features as she relaxed back against her father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment of resting, Volencia&#39;s eyes slowly opened. Damion was on the floor, his head pressed between his knees. Sitting up, she pulled the blanket up and over her exposed belly. &#34;Are you okay, Damion?&#34; She scootched over on the sofa leaning forward to run her fingers through his hair. He only shook his head, crawling over to lay against her lap. He started sobbing, wrapping his arms around her legs, whispering how sorry he was. She leaned over, kissing the top of his head in her lap continuing to sooth his hair. She kept telling him it was okay, and she was fine now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Venron stood, touching her cheek. &#34;The healers, Gregron, and I are going to step out and leave you two alone. Let you get dressed. Do either of you need anything? You both look exhausted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; She shook her head. &#34;I think we might head up to our room to nap for a while. I know I&#39;m exhausted and I have no doubt he is too. We&#39;ll meet you for supper if you&#39;d like.&#34; She smiled up at her father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would like that. Clearly we have a lot to catch up on.&#34; He bent over, placing a hand on Damion&#39;s shoulder. &#34;Once again, you leave me wondering, what the hell would we do without you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This was my fault. Without me, your daughter wouldn&#39;t have been in danger in the first place.&#34; Damion mumbled into her leg, only half turning his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Venron shrugged, patting his shoulder. &#34;Perhaps your right. This one is your fault. But it&#39;s still better than rape, torture, and losing our entire kingdom. And I get a son I actually like, not to mention a grandchild. Overall, I have to admit that I&#39;m looking forward to the beginning of a big happy family. But before a blessing will be dolled out, we&#39;ll all need to have a chat. I have some news for you too.&#34; He waved, pushing everyone else out of the room before leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34; He whispered again, crawling up to sit beside her and pull her into his arms. &#34;I had no idea it would be dangerous for you to carry my baby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wiping away his tears, she kissed his lips softly. &#34;How could you have known? Besides, it&#39;s not like you had much of an option.&#34; His hand settled on her belly, leaning his head against hers. &#34;Why don&#39;t you find my pants, and we&#39;ll go upstairs. I think we both need to lay down and rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded, proffering the riding pants to her a moment later. He took her hand, pulling her up. But she was still sore, and her stomach wasn&#39;t feeling well, so she asked him for help. He did take advantage of her standing before him half naked, trailing gentle kisses up her thigh, over her hip, and to her lower stomach where their baby nestled. &#34;I love you, so much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you, too.&#34; She sighed. Once in her room, they both pulled themselves from their travel clothes. Damion poored a small pot of water, and they took turns washing each other down. Though they both were too tired for it to go beyond a few light kisses and butterfly touches. Damion slipped into bed, and she hunkered down beside him, laying her head on his shoulder. It did not take long for them to fall asleep clinging to each other.</p>
