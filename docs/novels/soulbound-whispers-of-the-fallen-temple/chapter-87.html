                <p>Eighty-one</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cala moved slowly toward Avaline, who was already standing before the crevice, working her magic. Much like her father&#39;s magic, she was growing vines from the ground. As Cala stepped in, the earth trembled as dirt and sand sprayed into the breeze. Though the magic moved at Cala&#39;s pace, which was slower than Avaline&#39;s, a dirt bridge supported with thick vines was made. Avaline waved the others forward, not wanting Cala to have to hold it up for too long. But there was no one to fight for them now, and soldiers were crowding around the other side. Gareth hesitated, knowing he wouldn&#39;t be able to take them all on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment his foot touched the bridge, a roar rang out, and the soldier waiting for them on the other side flew back, as massive black horns smashed against them. One soldier was quick enough to jab his sword in the beast&#39;s face before he was trampled underfoot. The beast turned back to the elf that was barely alive removing his head with his massive jowls. It was clear the beast was tiring. Its breathing had become labored, and it was moving more slowly. Arrows and swords protruded from the thing like a porcupine&#39;s quills. Gareth dropped the sword to his side as the beast stopped at the bridge and looked over at him. It didn&#39;t even turn as the red dragon charged back, blocking the other soldiers from being able to close in on them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gareth gasped as he saw it, the sword that the soldier had jammed into it&#39;s face has hit it square in the eye. Sheathing his sword, Gareth held his hands up like a white flag as he made his way toward the beast. &#34;I don&#39;t want to hurt you. But we need to get that out of there.&#34; The creature clawed at the ground, but let Gareth walk up to it. As he did this, the other escapees followed, trailing behind by Avaline and Cala.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the red dragon dropped to the sand behind the beast, the women shied away from the monsters, clinging to each other. Chirbon was nodding in silent conversation with the creature. Gareth knew he could do this with others who carried the nihility magic, but hadn&#39;t realized it was good for talking to dragons. &#34;Something is happening near the tower, the other dragon went to intervene. The Council members have gathered there, so we should have an easier time making it there. Getting past them, into the tower, will be the hardest part.&#34; Chirbon pointed his sword forward where they needed to go. &#34;The dragon and the black beast shall continue to work as our shields as best they can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The beast let out a terrifying roar as Gareth pulled the sword from it&#39;s eye, putting as much pressure on the tender flesh to keep the eye from coming out of the socket. &#34;Here.&#34; Gareth pulled his tunic off, pressing it to the eye. The beast shook him off though, taking shaky steps away from them. &#34;Is it going to be okay?&#34; Gareth turned to Chirbon and Gregron. One shrugged and one shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can only hope so. Unlike with the dragons, I cannot really speak to him properly. He&#39;s in a lot of pain right now, that&#39;s all I can tell.&#34; Chirbon said, watching the beast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gregron repositioned Mary in his arms again, &#34;My princess is going to kill me when we return.&#34; He sighed. The dragon lifted off the ground, creating more fire walls for them to move through. The beast didn&#39;t run off into the crowd like it had earlier. Instead, it lead them on the path to the tower. When magic came in, the beast put himself between the caster and those he was helping to escape, and it fizzled out without ever actually reaching them. The closer they got to the towers, the less the soldiers seemed to gain leverage on them, which worried Gregron. It made more sense for the fight to become worse the closer they got, why would they be backing off? The beast stumbled. As if being in the middle of battle had been the only thing that had kept him going. The closer they got to the tower, the more nervous they all became.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The area was charged with the likes of magic Gregron had never felt before. From here, they could see the entire tower shimmering with glowing manna. Likely the council members holding the tower hostage. How they would make it past the council was a question everyone in the group worried about. The purplish dragon was nowhere to be seen, but they could hear it in the distance. Both the dragon and the beast seemed to tense as they grew closer. The beast, raising its muzzle in the air seeming to smell something. His head whipped back to look at them for no more than a moment before he went bounding away from them heading for the tower. They were far enough out of the city by now that the soldiers hadn&#39;t followed and the red dragon stayed with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The princess of Thambair has come. She is holding the tower from the council.&#34; Chirbon&#39;s eyes swept over the worn and haggard crew. &#34;Perhaps, we should split up.&#34; His hands twisted one of the long dred locks falling over his shoulder in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gregron had placed Mary in Gareth&#39;s arms and they were sitting currently as they thought up a plan. &#34;I&#39;m not entirely sure this is a risk we should take. What advantage would there be to splitting up?&#34; Gregron watched Chirbon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I think you should take the women and head around the tower. Avaline can cloak you all and possible to get you close enough where the princess can get you in the shield. You&#39;ll at least be able to get them to safety as planned. Cala, Gareth, and I can create a distraction with the dragons. We&#39;re not going to get through the other council members easily, especially with them and you carrying Mary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to be able to make it that far with her? You were starting to look tired.&#34; Gareth asked, watching Gregron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rubbing the back of his neck, Gregron sighed &#34;I am about at my end. But I also can&#39;t fight because of an armistice agreement that Thambair created with the council.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then be the shield.&#34; Cherbet said, and everyone turned to look at her no longer just naked but bruised and bloodied as well. Though every time someone tried to offer her clothes, she simply passed them off to one of the others. Gregron found he couldn&#39;t keep eye contact, so opted for turning away. &#34;I&#39;ll take Mary with me. I wouldn&#39;t have made it this far with her as you have, but I can carry her to the tower.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This brough Gregron&#39;s eyes around again. Looking at the Chirobi&#39;s small frame, he worried. But she wasn&#39;t like others. She had held her own and was a good warrior. Her magic skills were better than his own too. His hesitation came from knowing she would be a better shield. &#34;I have nihility magic, but it&#39;s not strong. You would be better served helping to protect the others.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perhaps, but this will all be for naught if you can&#39;t get the others to safety. Not only will you need to get them to the tower and into the shield, you&#39;ll need to do so quickly while the distraction still works. None of the others can do this, as you&#39;ll all be the ones the council will expect to see. If none of the imprisoned show for the battle, they may assume we&#39;re in hiding. It&#39;ll given us a better advantage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chirbon was nodding his head in agreement, though Cala was grumbling. &#34;If you have reservations or a better plan, now&#39;s the time to share.&#34; Gareth squinted at Cala.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dwarf huffed, &#34;It&#39;s just, more than I was expecting. Some of us will die here, and I&#39;m fully aware I will be the first target. Other than mayhap, Gregron, considering what they did today there are probably some hurt feelings there.&#34; Cala gave him a long glance before looking away. &#34;We don&#39;t know what&#39;s become of the beast. Only that the protection the princess evoked still stands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They could just as likely go after any of us.&#34; Gareth said, looking up from his wife solemnly. &#34;We&#39;re all traitors now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Chirbon who shook his head, &#34;Calazerthlegle is right. His magic will be the first they&#39;ll want to extinguish. Especially because his magic works well with Avaline&#39;s. They won&#39;t want to keep him around. He&#39;s also not needed to maintain order in Aidelzeg.&#34; Chirbon frowned at Cala, obviously uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cala waived his hand in in the air, &#34;Does nay matter though, it&#39;s nay like I won&#39;t go running inta battle.&#34; His eyes skimmed over Avaline who was curled into his side. &#34;I&#39;d give my life a hundred times over afore I give up and let them get her back.&#34; He lifted her face to his, kissing her forehead lightly, &#34;And ye better stay with Princess Volencia an not go running back to Quimbled to keep fighting. If yer father gets ya again&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flittering up, Avaline pressed her lips to his to stop him from talking. &#34;I&#39;ll do my best, but it is important to win this fight. Though now that Thambair is joining and already looking to make more allies, we might actually stand half a chance again.&#34; The glimmer in her eyes as she looked around at the motley crew made Gregron&#39;s chest swell. Damion had been right the whole time. This was exactly what the different kingdoms needed. Even if they didn&#39;t get Damion back, this plan was worth it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The allies formed here and now would be invaluable in the fight against the Empirical Rule they were trying to institute. Gareth&#39;s eyes swept over the shivering slave women, and they all wondered how many more would be born simply because they refused to leave any one behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, they weren&#39;t out of the desert yet. Gregron was pretty sure that the Council Members would look to kill the women before allowing them to escape. &#34;We&#39;ll just all need to be-&#34; Gregron was cut off by a beastly scream. His head whipped around, looking toward the tower. Panic rose in his chest and he stumbled a few steps before his mind started working out that Damion was in trouble. Behind him, he could hear Gareth and Chirbon calling orders, and the thunder of their feet behind him. The General could only pray, he wouldn&#39;t be too late to do what he could for him.</p>
