                <p>chapter Fifty-three</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia had wanted to come with him, but he&#39;d asked her to let him do it alone. He didn&#39;t want his mom to feel pressured in anyway. And he certainly didn&#39;t want to leave, which he expected to do the next day, with any of this animosity hanging over them. He should have just conceded to her request to begin with. It wasn&#39;t worth the fight, or her being upset. It was just difficult to keep his hands to himself now that he&#39;d decided that he would marry her it wasn&#39;t impossible. The worst part was that she only worried that he was going to upset the gods, and he didn&#39;t care less. If they were real, which he was finally beginning to wonder, he didn&#39;t really care what they thought of his relationship. Morally, he was doing nothing wrong, and he knew it. They were both concenting adults. Hell, they were engaged and already pregnant. What difference would a shared bath make for them now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion knocked on the door, his dad called out, &#34;Come in, Damion.&#34; Dipping through the door he frowned. His mom was on the floor, crying into his dad&#39;s lap. Kneeling beside her, he wrapped his arms around Kirna&#39;s shoulder and laid his head on her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry. I know that I upset you.&#34; He whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damion, I&#39;m just so worried about you. You&#39;re giving so much into this, and it&#39;s so fast. Not only could the King deny you, but you could find out that it really isn&#39;t the life you want to be involved in. Your heart is gentle, and kind, and you don&#39;t know that world like your dad and I. It&#39;s a cruel and aweful place. And likely so much worse now than when we lived in it. I don&#39;t want to see it break you, and that&#39;s all I have been able to imagine. Especially if this is the path you chose. You don&#39;t know how much it broke Venron and we loved him like a brother. I know he would never, ever, choose do to it over again. But you will be hated, and hunted, and they will do everything in their power to destroy us all if you put yourself right there on stage for them all to see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom,&#34; He placed his hand on top of where hers rested on his dad&#39;s knobbed knee, &#34;I am already wanted by those men, if not already hated. Right now they want me to join them. The moment I say no, I&#39;m already going to be hunted because of what happened when I rescued Volencia. My only way out of that is to join them. And I can promise you, she&#39;s a better choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kirna flipped her hand, entwining her fingers with him. &#34;I know, love. Your dad and I have seen it all happen before. We watched Venron go through this and they don&#39;t fight fair. He didn&#39;t understand what he was getting into and he lived in that world his whole life. I&#39;m terrified of what it will do to you. Especially when we think about the reactions you&#39;ve had to other similar hardships where folk you love were put into danger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking her words in, he calculated them in his mind. Though he knew his and Venron&#39;s stories ran a relatively perpendicular line, he&#39;d not realized they were so close as to refrence them together. He flet his dad&#39;s hand rest on his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re contemplating too hard. Don&#39;t over think it.&#34; Lennion said, smiling at them both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, that tends to happen when the beast is brought up. I see the after math and I hear the stories, but I will never know what it&#39;s like for those who have to deal with it in the chaos.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion sighed, &#34;But should that deter me from her? Is it too dangerous?&#34; His head lifted from his mom&#39;s shoulders and looked between her and his dad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s something you need to consider.&#34; His dad said, patting his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another knock sounded at the door, &#34;Come in, Travion.&#34; Lennion called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trey waltzed though, ducking as he entered the house. &#34;Hey, I felt like an important family meeting was taking place and came to be part of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damion called you to come save him, didn&#39;t he?&#34; Kirna frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;On the contrary, I went to see Damion at home and Volencia told me what happened. So, here I am, checking on everyone. I had called out to him,&#34; Damion looked surprised, &#34;But he was protecting against any interference, which is usually a sign that something big is happening. That he left Volencia alone to come here says a lot too.&#34; Trey didn&#39;t get in their space, he sat at the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think my beast will be dangerous to Volencia?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Travion sighed, leaning back in his chair and crossing his legs before him. He was often too lax when it came to such seious things and it annoyed Damion to no end. &#34;Honestly, that side of you is a danger to everyone. In all our years together, I&#39;ve seen it six times. Four of those I even saw it starting and wasn&#39;t able to stop it. I realize Volencia was an exception. I saw it starting in the caven and was ready to run with her, but as she calmly went to you and offered help and I saw that pain and fear ease in you, I was relieved. Finally, I thought, someone who can handle him better than me. Though I can&#39;t attest that the actual beast wouldn&#39;t be a danger, it never attacked me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion felt the anxiety the question had plowed over him with ease at Travion&#39;s explanation. Though he was forever the optimist, he did take Damion&#39;s dark side more seriously than anything else. Trey wouldn&#39;t ease his fear without reason, so this was a good sign. Travion trusted his darkness with Volencia. That was something he was sure would be a rare thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That doesn&#39;t negate the fact that we must still be very careful with how you handle yourself out there especially with those who may wish you, us, or her harm.&#34; Lennion said stoicly, patting his hand that was still clasped with his mom&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or the fact you are putting yourself at an unnecessary risk. The deeper you get into their world the more dangerous it will become for you and everyone around you.&#34; Kirna wiped at her tears, finally getting her emotions under control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then what was the point in sending me to Thambair if you didn&#39;t want me involved? How am I supposed to walk away now knowing the danger Volencia is in? I can&#39;t even wrap me head around why we&#39;re even talking about it.&#34; Damion was appalled that his mom would suugest Volencia wasn&#39;t worth the risk. Or anyone, for that matter. He&#39;d already explained what she had to face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The point was for you to free Venron so that he could take the needed actions against the Council. Not for you to become directly involved.&#34; Kirna said. The three of them, Lennion, Damion, and Travion all looked at each other. His dad and brother both shaking their heads. &#34;You both knew he was going to end up over his head and you let him go anyway.&#34; The betrayal on her visage was as clear as glass, soon to be replaced by anger as Lennion sighed, answering:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damion was always meant to find Volencia. This was nothing we haven&#39;t talked about, Kirna. Yes, it&#39;s a dangerous path, but we always knew that it would be. But our goal is to help Volencia stay safe and our son has the power to do that. We cannot secluster him here with guilt trips when he has more ability than anyone else to change the direction of our future. Don&#39;t give me that look, love.&#34; Kirna was openly glaring at her husband now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Besides, mom,&#34; Travion jumped in, &#34;Damion engagement to her is the perfect answer to protecting her to the best of his ability. And protecting her reputation, considering she&#39;s pregnant. Can you imagine her going home to her father alone now? That is a sure way to guarantee the King would want him dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pitter patter of rain started to tinkle on the roof and windowsills. Kirna got up to close the shutters against the rain. Damion remained silent, watching the rain pick up outside before the windows were completely shuttered. He was glad Trey and did were backing him up. Though he worried as dark clouds engulfed the sky. He&#39;d learned the hard way that Volencia is terrified of storms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why can&#39;t you find a less complicated girl to bring home. Someone who could stay here with us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom!&#34; Damion and Trey both gasped. &#34;Do you think she&#39;d rather be there, threatened by the other kingdoms, forced into a loveless marriage and raped? Thrown into war  you of all folk should be proud of me for standing up for her!&#34; His hands curled into fists as he stood, he couldn&#39;t remember ever being so angry at her. &#34;I can&#39;t believe you would even suggest otherwise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind the shutters, lighting flashed, seeping in through the cracks. The storm had come in hard and fast. He needed to get home to Volencia. &#34;It&#39;s just-&#34; his mom started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look, I&#39;ve made my decision.&#34; His hand went through his hair and he paced the house. &#34;Regardless of whatever dangers come of it, I won&#39;t abandon her to them. I can appreciate your concern, and if you feel I&#39;m being disrespectful by being intimate with my pregnant fiancé while in the comfort of my own home, I&#39;ll respect your wishes and stop. Even if I think you&#39;re being ludicrous.&#34; Thunder rolled over head, crashing like waves against rock. &#34;Anyway. I&#39;m sorry. But I have to go. Volencia is terrified of storms and is probably working herself into a frenzy right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion headed toward the door, but Kirna grabbed his arm. &#34;It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t like her. I&#39;m just so worried about you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he was angry with her for what she&#39;d said, he hugged her tight. &#34;I know, mom. But I hope you understand my side better, and realize that despite everything, I care deeply for her. And I&#39;m happier now than I ever have been.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know.&#34; Kirna held him tight. &#34;I&#39;m sorry. She needs you, and makes you happy. I know you&#39;ll do everything in your power to keep her safe, and that&#39;s honorable, love. I&#39;m just so worried about you. I am glad you found her, and I&#39;m sorry if I sound like I don&#39;t care. She is a wonderful elf. I don&#39;t want her to be hurt either. You must think I&#39;m awful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay. I love you.&#34; Damion kissed the top of her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you too, sweetheart. Don&#39;t tell her any of this, please?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t.&#34;</p>
