                <p>&#34;There has to be another explanation that we&#39;re not seeing.&#34; Damion&#39;s strained voice drifts into my consciousness before I have the chance to open my eyes. There&#39;s a tension in his voice that resounds like a bowstring tugged too tightly. It makes me want to force my eyes open to try to make that stress disappear somehow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought so too at first,&#34; Orm&#39;s familiar voice responds, &#34;Yet, when I went through my research records, it was the only thing that made sense. The symptoms line up with what she told me she&#39;s been experiencing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Traveling with her in this condition could prove to do more damage to her if this doesn&#39;t work,&#34; Damion growls, &#34;So I need to know you&#39;re sure, Orm, or else you&#39;re going to have to search for another solution.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There *is* no other solution. Of that I am certain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat courses through my skin pounding through my head and despite my best efforts, a whimper slips between my clenched lips. A large hand rests on my shoulder, another softly brushing sweat soaked strands of hair away from my forehead. I don&#39;t know how, but I know that it&#39;s Damion without needing to open my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His skin feels cool against my flushed skin and I lean into his soothing touch to absorb some of that coolness. His fingers brush through my hair again, more gentle than I&#39;d ever thought possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever you decide, you need to do it quickly,&#34; Orm tells him in a low voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There&#39;s a long drawn out pause before Damion lets out a low resolved breath, &#34;Xavier,&#34; he calls out, louder this time, and there&#39;s a creak of the door opening, &#34;I need you to make preparations for us to travel north. We&#39;ll be leaving within the hour. Wake Leif and inform him as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Commander.&#34; Xavier says, and the door creaks shut behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll prepare something to help keep her asleep while you travel,&#34; Orm says, &#34;It&#39;s imperative that she conserve as much energy as possible until you reach Elfhame.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elfhame? I want to ask what&#39;s going on, but I can&#39;t find the strength to find my lips to ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of someone settling their weight next to me on the edge of the mattress shifts the bed, &#34;Lily,&#34; Damion says, in that deep voice of his. I feel my eyelids flutter with the need to open them and see him, but I can&#39;t get my eyes opened the rest of the way, &#34;You&#39;re going to be fine,&#34; he says. &#34;We&#39;re going to get you to what we believe is a cure. We&#39;ll need to ride for a few days, but all you need to worry about is resting. I&#39;ll do whatever it takes to get you better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His warm hand finds mine, and I squeeze his fingers gently to let him know that I can hear him. The mattress shifts and I feel him lean in closer before something warm lips press to my forehead making my stomach flutter and are gone the next moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get some more rest. I&#39;ll come and get you when it&#39;s time to leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether I want to or not, I do as he says and drift back into unconsciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I wake again, I realize right away that I&#39;m no longer in bed. I&#39;m being held up in a sitting position, the uneven gait of a horse thumping beneath me.  The cold wind that whips into my face is a relief against my feverish skin, and while the air is frigid, I feel snug and warm tucked against the person behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing my eyes open, the first thing I see is the pile of pelts and quilts I&#39;ve been bundled into. I&#39;ve been swaddled up like an infant, and while I may look ridiculous, I feel so snug and warm there&#39;s no way I&#39;m going to complain. A large set of arms cage me into a sturdy body behind me keeping me from tumbling off the horse as we pass through unfamiliar terrain at suck a fast pace the surroundings are only a blur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t understand how I know that it&#39;s Damion&#39;s body pressed into mine, but my entire body prickles with warm electrifying tingles that tell me it&#39;s him I&#39;m resting against. Where my cheek is pressed against his chest, I can hear the steady thumping of his heartbeat above the thundering hoofbeats beneath us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My swirling foggy thoughts can&#39;t remember what I&#39;m doing here or what&#39;s happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damion?&#34; I ask sleepily, &#34;What&#39;s going on? Why are we on a horse?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know how he hears me over the sounds of the wind and galloping horses, but he does. It&#39;s probably due to the fact that his shifter hearing is so much better than mine is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re getting you somewhere you can get better,&#34; he says, glancing down at me. His eyes are the usual dark shade-a black so dark that it&#39;s hard to tell where his pupil ends and his iris begins. This close to him though, I can see flecks of silver streaking through the iris making his eyes look like a starry sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharp corner of his jaw flexes, the skin there now covered by a fine layer of stubble that hadn&#39;t been there before, &#34;Are you in pain at all?&#34; He asks me, &#34;Do you need more medicine?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head is still pounding and my stomach clenches uncomfortably with nausea, but it&#39;s a a pain that I&#39;m accustomed to so it barely registers anymore. I&#39;m a little surprised that the gait of the horse doesn&#39;t make my stomach more queasy than it is, but I&#39;m tucked in so tightly against Damion that I don&#39;t really feel the movement as much as I would normally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m alright,&#34; I hurry to assure him, &#34;How long have we been riding for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flexing my feet and legs that are cocooned so tightly in blankets I can&#39;t move them much, I can feel a stiffness in my muscles that tells me I&#39;ve been sleeping for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About a day and a half,&#34; he says, his eyes still trained on the terrain surrounding us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A day and a half? My brain stutters over that fact, trying to figure out where we could possibly be riding to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*We&#39;re getting you somewhere you can get better.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My stomach stinks in my stomach as the only real possibility of where we could be riding to dawns on me. I can&#39;t go back to the Seelie Court, I *can&#39;t*. The second I step back in my father&#39;s court, I&#39;ll be shipped back to the Unseelie to bind our contract with them. With Damion&#39;s help, I&#39;d barely been able to slip through their fingers last time. If they managed to get their hands on me again, they&#39;d be more prepared. They&#39;d put so many guards on my that it would be impossible for me to escape</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shift in my seat again, the sudden wave of anxiety making me throat and chest so tight I can barely suck in enough air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion must hear the way my heartbeat and breathing escalate by the second, because he looks away from the road to check on me. His black eyes have shifted to a deep shade of purple, &#34;*Lily*?&#34; He rasps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With my heart in my throat, I manage to say, &#34;You&#39;reyou&#39;re not taking me back home, are you?&#34;</p>
