                <p>Checking to make sure that Lucia is still sleeping, I slide out of bed and quietly make my way across the hall, bare feet brushing softly on cool stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitate for only a moment at the door across from my own, then knock. Damion must have been standing near his door because it only takes a second for the door to pull open and he&#39;s suddenly there, staring down at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;s not wearing a shirt, like he was in the middle of undressing when I interrupted, and my mouth goes dry at the unexpected sight of his bare skin. At the swirling black lines of black tattoos that I love tracing my fingers over. The hard planes of sculpted muscles that I just want to press into. He&#39;s a work of art that I could stare at for hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He blinks down at me with hooded black eyes, &#34;Why are you knocking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His question takes me aback, &#34;Sorry, I know you&#39;re probably tired,&#34; I say, &#34;I just wanted to see you, to make sure you&#39;re alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His dark eyebrows draw together in confusion, then understanding dawns in his eyes. His arms snakes out to grab me, gently tugging me through the doorway, &#34;That&#39;s not what I meant, darling. I wasn&#39;t asking why you were knocking because I wanted to know what you were doing here. What I was asking you was why did you *knock*. You don&#39;t *knock* on my door, this space is as much yours as it is mine. I *want* you here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words send a spear of warmth through me, &#34;Oh,&#34; I say and it comes out more breathily than I mean it to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips tilt up at the corners, &#34;Yeah, *oh*.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shutting the door behind us, he pulls me in for a quick heated kiss --a fast greeting that doesn&#39;t last more than a few seconds, but still takes my breath away and makes my heart beat in a stutter. As he pulls away, there&#39;s a barely perceptible stiffness to his motions- not quite a wince, but close. But it&#39;s so unlike his normally smooth movements that I notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I pull away to get a better look at him, I see bloody lines on his side half bandaged and I suck in a quiet gasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gods, Damion, are you alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What- oh, that.&#34; He looks like he wants to brush it off like it&#39;s nothing, but it&#39;s *not* nothing, emphasized by the fact that there&#39;s blood still dripping down his side, staining the top band of his black riding pants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, that! What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There was a small incident at the border-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Small?* I&#39;ve seen Damion fight, and if he&#39;d managed to get injured like this it must have been more serious than something small.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright?&#34; I ask again, eyeing the large piercing cut, worry making my voice tight, &#34;We should get you to a healer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s really nothing,&#34; he says with a tilt to his lips that says that he finds my worry over him endearing, &#34;Shifters tend to heal more quickly than others. This isn&#39;t as bad as it probably looks to you- it should heal by itself by morning. It probably won&#39;t even leave a mark.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chew worriedly over my bottom lip as I consider his words, taking in the gash again -if I had a cut like that, it would take at least a few weeks to scab over and heal up. &#34;Do you have any bandages?&#34; I ask,  &#34;At least let me help you get it cleaned up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyebrows come together, something in his eyes flickering like he&#39;s not used to having someone worry over him, &#34;You don&#39;t have to, Lily-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I *want* to,&#34; I say, pushing him to sit down on the couch near his fireplace, and he lets me- his frame so sizable that I know I wouldn&#39;t be able to push him around anywhere he didn&#39;t want to go unless he allowed me to, &#34;Now where do you keep the bandages?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tells me where to find it, and I feel his eyes on me as I move around the room collecting the supplies I need from the chest near his bed before stopping off in the bathing chamber to grab a dampened washing cloth. Supplies in hand, I hurry back over to where he&#39;s waiting for me and kneel down on the couch beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I move the warm damp fabric over his skin, cleaning up the dripping blood, careful not to get too close to the wound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stray arrow,&#34; he says nonchalantly, like it&#39;s nothing, but my eyes still widen as I work, &#34;The arrow wasn&#39;t even meant for me, but the Unseelie can&#39;t aim for shit. The shot didn&#39;t stick, it just grazed past me while I was finishing with a few others. I barely felt it when it happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chew on the inside of my cheek as I move on to drying the area, &#34;It must have more serious than that if it managed to get past your fighting leathers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grimaces and admits, &#34;You&#39;d be right if I&#39;d been wearing my leathers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes flash up to him with a worried look, but his eyes aren&#39;t on my face, they&#39;re stuck on where my fingers work on his warm skin, &#34;We hadn&#39;t been expecting a fight, we were scouting along the border where we had last seen a group of Seelie soldiers around the area where they&#39;re usually spotted attempting to do their mining. We were only meant to be doing a bit of reconnaissance, but a group of unseelie managed to surprise us. You don&#39;t need to worry about it though, there were more of us than of them so it was over quickly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a slow breath, making a mental note to ask more about that later, before putting my focus back on the task in front of me. With gentle fingers, I smooth on a bit of salve onto the wound that will keep it from getting infected and as I work, he sucks in a breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck me,&#34; he groans under his breath, his voice strained like he&#39;s in pain, and my fingers stop moving on his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did I hurt you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes fly to his, which are squeezed closed in what looks like discomfort, but when they open, they&#39;ve shifted to a sparkling wine shade of red- it&#39;s a shade of red that I recognize easily after last night. It&#39;s a color that has my thighs squeezing together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t hurt me,&#34; he explains, voice strained. His jaw flexes, and he rubs a hand over his eyes, &#34;Those gowns you wear at night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance down at the thin white material that dips a little low on my collar bone  but isn&#39;t scandalous by any means, &#34;My night clothes?&#34; I ask him bewildered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swallows roughly, the pulse jumping in his neck, &#34;The memory of you in those has kept me up at night more than is probably healthy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grin, a silent laugh shaking through me as I go back to finishing placing the bandage over the now clean wound, &#34;You mean from that night during the earth storm?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nods, his lips tilting up in a wry grin, though his eyes still pulse with that same deep shade of red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remember that night a little too well myself. The night he&#39;d barged into my room in the middle of the night and carried me up to the gardens. He&#39;d been shirtless that night, and I&#39;d be lying if I hadn&#39;t thought extensively of the feel of his hot skin through the thin material of my night dress on more than one occasion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night he&#39;d kissed me for the first time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Crouching over you,&#34; he says, &#34;while you were wearing *that*. It was like my own personal hell and heaven all at once.&#34; He rubs a hand roughly over his jaw, &#34;I knew I shouldn&#39;t have kissed you, but every part of me was so drawn to every part of you-&#34; his voice cuts off, strained, as I lean in closer.</p>
