                <p>About an hour after resuming our brisk pace through the forest&#39;s jostling terrain, someone approaches the Unseeie soldiers. I&#39;m so caught up in sorting through my options that I don&#39;t hear the gallop of advancing horse hooves at first. The nearing, unfamiliar, group moves nearly soundlessly-approaching swiftly enough that my ears only just pick up the subtle difference only a minute or two before one of the Unseelie soldiers shouts a guttural warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The carriage jerks to a sudden halt, nearly throwing me from the seat and there&#39;s a clattering slide of blades being withdrawn. We&#39;re being attacked by robbers, maybe? I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening out there, but I do know that I&#39;ve been sorting through my options of escape and this is as good an opportunity as I&#39;m likely to get. I&#39;m desperate enough to take my chances with the robbers. Anything&#39;s better than this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stand on shaking legs, pushing open the carriage door enough to assess my best course forward. A few of the Unseelie soldiers have drawn their swords and battle axes and are facing off against the other, seemingly better-armed, group. The newcomers aren&#39;t in uniform, but wear sturdy-looking battle leathers, easily fending off swings from the Unseelie like its child&#39;s play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They don&#39;t look like robbers, but it&#39;s not like I&#39;m an expert on what thieves should look like. A fever-induced sweat mists my forehead, and I swipe it away with trembling fingers. The soldiers are all so focused on each other, that no one notices me stumble gracelessly out of the carriage. *This is it. This is my chance.* It couldn&#39;t be more perfect if the Mother herself handcrafted this diversion for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resolve thrums to life through me as I take a determined step backward and out of sight from the majority of soldiers. If I can just get one of the horses unbuckled from the carriage, there&#39;s a good chance I can use the soldier&#39;s distraction to get away. I&#39;ve ridden without a saddle before, so I&#39;m confident enough in my chances of escape if I can just get the straps disconnected before I&#39;m noticed. Riding without a saddle through unfamiliar terrain while weak with a fever isn&#39;t an ideal situation, but it&#39;s the best option I have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I&#39;m out of direct sight, I begin making quick work of freeing the horse of the leather straps holding her to the carriage. Her large brown head swivels down at me and huffs out a disbelieving whinny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, it&#39;s okay,&#34; I whisper up at her. I get the distinct feeling that she somehow understands my frantic pleadings because all she does is huff out a soft snort and let me continue working to get her free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Put your weapons down and state your business here.&#34; One of the new arrivals demands of the Unseelie soldiers, his voice ringing out clearly over the clamor of unrest. The man&#39;s words project with an air of calmness that&#39;s at complete odds with the tension radiating from both parties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the Unseelie snarls, &#34;Our business is none of yours, fucking shifter scum.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait, did he just say*Shifters*?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There&#39;s no sane or rational explanation for why that thought sends an emotion that feels oddly like hope streaking through the center of my chest. I can only blame it on the fever running rampant under my skin and clouding my mind. Because a small and utterly unhinged part of me wonders if there&#39;s a chance I might recognize one of the soldiers among the group questioning the Unseelie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Sure, Lily, go look for one of your previous kidnappers instead of taking this brief window of opportunity to get away from your new abusers. What a great use of your time.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I push my fingers to work faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the Unseelie&#39;s impertinence, the Shifter soldier who spoke before doesn&#39;t lose his calm confidence as he says, &#34;Are you aware of whose territory it is that you&#39;re crossing through?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There&#39;s only the grating hocking of phlegm as one of the Unseelie spits into the dirt by way of response. The Unseelie&#39;s level of class is astounding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There&#39;s the stamping sound as another set of hoofbeats approach, and the horse I&#39;m working unstrap stamps its feet nervously. My fingers pause their scraping against the leather and I reach up to gently pat her neck to keep her calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shhh,&#34; I whisper to her under my breath, &#34;I&#39;m almost done. Just one more minute.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The horse miraculously calms under my touch just enough that I can finish unknotting the last of the ties. I throw up a grateful prayer to the gods and quietly begin the last task of tugging the remaining ropes from where they&#39;re looped around the mare&#39;s body, all the while keeping a careful ear on the soldiers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rider I heard approaching comes to a halt near where the standoff is happening between the Unseelie and the Shifters, &#34;What&#39;s the problem here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smooth and clear, deeply timbered voice of the new arrival has my stomach clenching and a hot fluttering sensation dances its way up my veins. Even weeks later, I knew I&#39;d recognize that shadowy rasp of that voice anywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Commander Damion Lothbrook is here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart rate takes off in a staggering gallop, and without my permission, my hands are still where they&#39;re working on the horse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your majesty! We weren&#39;t expecting you until tomorrow, but it&#39;s good you got here when you did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So it would seem,&#34; Damion&#39;s voice holds a thread of dry humor to it before turning serious, &#34;What&#39;s your business here, soldiers?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There&#39;s the sound of a throat pointedly clearing, &#34;We are crossing back to the palace,&#34; I hear Pieter&#39;s voice grind out between clenched jaws, &#34;On the Crown&#39;s business.&#34; It seems even he knows better than to deny information to a foreign King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shifter soldier from before huffs out a humorless laugh, &#34;A bit of a churlish bunch, this one. But it appears as if they&#39;re telling the truth; Not enough men or weapons to be launching any sort of attack. Looks as though they&#39;re just passing through as he says.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I can think better of it, I cast a curious, searching glance over my shoulder to where I know the King is standing. It&#39;s like an invisible cord&#39;s been hooked to where my heartbeat is racing in my chest. That cord gives a solid tug and it&#39;s like I can&#39;t help myself. My eyes, my attention, draw there of their own accord, finding the King&#39;s broad muscular form standing among the others immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looks the same as the last time I saw him-tall sturdy frame swathed in black riding leathers. A few strands of his black curling hair droop onto his forehead, windswept from riding. The shining black horns curve back away from his face along with the deadly-looking spikes on his shoulders giving him a menacing edge as he eyes the Unseelie with that sharp, too-discerning gaze. That same gaze that I&#39;d become familiar with in my brief time with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like he can sense my stare, his head turns sharply in my direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a single tense heartbeat, my gaze tangles with his darker one. His dark eyes flicker, and his head ticks to the side as he takes in the sight of me half-hidden behind the horses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Princess?&#34; There&#39;s a subtle softening of his voice that makes that single word sound like a caress. Or maybe the fever mixed with my frantic heartbeat has me imagining it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shit. *Why did I have to look*? Why couldn&#39;t I have just done the smart thing and get on the damn horse when I had the chance? Now every soldier in the vicinity swivels their heads in my direction to see who the Shifter Commander is talking to. So much for my escape plans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion Lothbrook doesn&#39;t hesitate as he immediately strides toward me, closing the distance between us in only a few sweeping footsteps, &#34;Sweetheart, what in the gods&#39; name are you doing with this putrid lot?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any attempts at riding away now would be futile-this formidable male would have no trouble stopping me before I could even get my leg over the horse. I sigh, shoulders drooping tiredly as I turn to face him fully. And my heart stops when it does. Because the Shifter King comes to a dead stop in his tracks, his broad form going unnaturally still. His eyes go dark before blazing a brilliant flaming shade of amber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice is a lethal darkness that sends a shudder up my spine as he growls, &#34;*How the hell did you get that mark on your face?* Who did that to you?&#34;</p>
