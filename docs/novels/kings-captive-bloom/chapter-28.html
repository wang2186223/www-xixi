                <p>He said that simple phrase like he knows me. Knows something about what sort of things I like and dislike-would draw me in. The soothing atmosphere of the garden shifts to something electric, the air now crackling with a sort of fiery charge as if the very air buzzes with anticipation.

                <p>His face shifts with confusion before understanding dawns, &#34;Ah. *That* agreement. And I wasn&#39;t *hiding away.* I asked your guards to inform you that I was held up in a meeting with my second. Did they not tell you?&#34; He looks genuinely alarmed by this, his brow furrowing with his concern. The sight of his genuine uncertainty sends another grin streaking across my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t look so worried,&#34; I say, smothering down a snicker, &#34;I was only joking. Xavier and Arden *did* tell me that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good thing,&#34; he says dryly, &#34;They would have needed to be transferred for something as egregious as that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It takes me a moment to process the fact that he&#39;s teasing back with me. He made a *joke*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turns to lower himself onto the bench beside me and I work to school my expression so he won&#39;t read from my face the way his body is so close is mine sends a thousand little electric shocks through my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As discreetly as I can be, I rub at the tiny goosebumps forming on my skin from his proximity. He notices, though. Of course, he does.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you cold? Here.&#34; Before I can object, he removes the formal overcoat he&#39;s wearing and tucks it onto my shoulders. I instantly feel much warmer, with the soft fabric draped over me. I would much rather him think that I&#39;m cold than know the real reason I&#39;m shivering is from simply being so close to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; I tuck my arms down the too-large sleeves, pulling it closed around me. The rustling fabric brings his scent along with it-pine salt and warmth. The smell has me breathing it in deeper, making heat bloom in my cheeks and low in my stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clears his throat, turning his gaze to stare off into the gardens around us, &#34;Your question from before,&#34; he says, &#34;you wanted to know how I came upon who you are?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod, biting worriedly into my lower lip, &#34;How long have you known? Did you realize it when you took me the first time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes flash down to my face as if surprised by the assumption, &#34;No,&#34; he tells me, tone suddenly serious, &#34;Unfortunately, it wasn&#39;t something I discovered until later. Your existence isn&#39;t common knowledge among your Court or beyond it. Though I admit that I suspected something wasn&#39;t quite right during negotiations with your father, I didn&#39;t discover the truth of who you are until dropping you back at the Seelie Palace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could be a skilled liar, but there&#39;s a note of sincerity ringing in his voice as he speaks that&#39;s impossible to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What finally clued you into the truth?&#34; I ask, staring off into the surrounding flowers, blossoms swaying as a slight breeze rolls through. A single butterfly lands on the bench beside me, its blue wings flicking back and forth as I watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took him longer than I anticipated to begin speaking again. Long enough that the butterfly takes flight again and I turn my gaze back up to him curiously. His dark eyes are already on me, &#34;The smells were off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait what? That&#39;s not what I&#39;d been expecting him to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;*What*?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something in my shocked expression makes the corner of his lip tilt up, the tip of one of his sharp teeth peeking through, &#34;When I got us into the rooms that were supposed to belong to Princess Lucia, the smells were similar, but they didn&#39;t match up the way they were supposed to. And while the rooms were lived-in and safe enough that I could have left you there, I was curious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind pitches uncomfortably and I rub at my eyes as I try to make sense of what he&#39;s telling me, &#34;Okay, back up for a second, you can *smell* me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He huffs out a small laugh, &#34;Compared to the fae, shifters have a strong sense of smell, among other things. I&#39;m surprised that this wasn&#39;t something that was covered in your studies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In my studies, growing up I&#39;d learned quite a bit about the different species inhabiting the continent-humans, seelies, unseelies, dwarves, merfolk, centaurs, elves, shifters, and the now extinct dragons. The fae courts mostly keep to themselves, -until recently that is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our last war with the elves left many other species with an aversion to dealing with either of the fae courts, which I can&#39;t blame them for at all. But, embarrassingly, aside from the strengths and weaknesses of the other species, I was never taught much else. My tutor mainly kept to the fae histories, and I&#39;m a little embarrassed that it never occurred to me to wonder about it until now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I purse my lips, considering, &#34;I was told that shifters are strong--typically stronger than an average fae. That you can change forms on command. But I wasn&#39;t aware that your senses are so much stronger than ours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hums low under his breath, &#34;When compared to other species, Fae senses aren&#39;t something to look down on either. And while the Fae&#39;s have a vastly superior affinity and access to magic when compared to shifters, a shifter usually has stronger physical senses and strength when compared to the fae.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take a moment to let this information sink in then say, &#34;So after you knew I didn&#39;t smell right to be the person living in Lucia&#39;s rooms, what then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips tilt up in the corners, a subtle hint of his amusement, &#34;Like I said, I was curious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raise my eyebrows at him in question, and while I want to pepper him with a million questions, I force myself to wait. He chuckles under his breath at the expectant look on my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I eventually caught a hint of your scent and followed that to your rooms. Aside from it smelling like you, the setup in those rooms just felt more like you.&#34; His eyebrows curve up as he watches me, studying me for any sort of reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m not sure what to think about that and instead decided to consider all that later when I was alone. I move away from that, asking him another question, &#34;And when did you find my real name? Did you see something in my rooms?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, it wasn&#39;t in your rooms. In the weeks after I left you back home, I did a bit of digging until I found out that King Tarquin did indeed have a second daughter named Liliana.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lily.&#34; I quickly correct him, a small smile playing on my lips as I stare off into the gardens, &#34;Only my father calls me Liliana. Call me Lily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There&#39;s a soft undercurrent in his richly deep voice that surprises me, as he says, &#34;Lily, then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And in that moment, for the first time in my life, my name sounded like a caress. Like a promise that it&#39;ll be safe in his mouth. It&#39;s an effort to force back the shivers that wrack their way through my body at that single word. And I have no idea what that means.</p>
