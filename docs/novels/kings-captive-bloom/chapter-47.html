                <p>*&#34;I&#39;m sorry, did you say a Bond pair?&#34;* I ask elder Aelrie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her chin tilts, angling to the side as she takes in my shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I could sense it between you immediately,&#34; she says carefully, &#34;You and the King are most definitely a Bond pair. I&#39;m sorry, I assumed you were aware.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*A Bond pair?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the back of my mind, memories of my time in the shifter&#39;s library where the elaborate tapestry depicting a shifter and an elf couple hangs flash through my mind.The librarian&#39;s words echo in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;Years ago,&#34; the librarian had told me, &#34;it was also discovered that shifters can feel a mate pull beyond other shifters, drawing them to some elves as well. Those pairings were revered because they were said to have a stronger pull toward each other than even Mates and were known to create the most powerful combination of offspring. We call those types of pairings between shifters and elves, &#39;Bonds&#39;. Bond couplings were said to reap benefits from each other that not even Mates do.&#34;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remembering those words now brings a new level of gravity to them. They settle over me about as gently as getting run down by a carriage would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Damion and me? A shifter and elf bond pair? That can&#39;t be right, can it? Was it possible that elder Aelrie was somehow mistaken?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart thumps unsteadily against my ribs so hard it&#39;s almost painful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re certain?&#34; I ask her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nods, not a shred of uncertainty or doubt in her face, &#34;More than certain. Part of my magic is discerning others&#39; energies and auras. From the moment I saw you and the king in the tunnels I could tell. I could feel that *your* personal energy was faint due to the Fading, but I could also sense the way his energy clings to yours. The way it shielded and protected yours, bolstering it up. It&#39;s been many many years since I&#39;ve seen it, but it was unmistakable. I could see right away that your energies are already mixing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes skate over me, &#34;I apologize for springing that information on you. I assumed you were already aware of that fact.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I force myself to blink away the dazed shock that has my breath catching in my throat. I clench my hands into balls at my sides to stop their shaking, &#34;It&#39;s okay, I&#39;m glad you told me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it possible that Damion knows all of this? And if he does, how *long* has he known? More importantly, if he knows why didn&#39;t he tell me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Is there a chance that he doesn&#39;t want to be bonded to me? Is it possible that he&#39;s hoping that if I didn&#39;t know we were a bond pair that we wouldn&#39;t have to commit to anything? We did kissbut he&#39;s always stopped it from going any further than that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uncertainty and unease trickle through me making my stomach turn over in a sickening swoop. I need to talk to Damion before my imagination runs away from me completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elder Aelrie puts a hand on my shoulder and gently squeezes, a comforting gesture that pulls me back to the present, and I tilt my face back up toward her to meet her warm brown eyes. She hesitates a moment then says, &#34;Growing up among the fae the way that you did, I imagine that you don&#39;t have a lot of knowledge about bonded pairings between shifters and elves. But it&#39;s not something you need to be anxious about. The bond is something revered among our kind. The connection between you will be celebrated amongst both of our people.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For some reason the thought of that makes me panic even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So many people would be watching us with expectations I wasn&#39;t even aware of. Watching and waiting and demanding things from me that I didn&#39;t even know I could deliver. What had felt easy between Damion and me so far now felt infinitely more complicated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d spent my entire life trying and failing to meet the expectations of my father and the Seelie court. The idea of now failing Damion&#39;s people-of failing *Damion* after everything he&#39;s done for me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t even sure if this-this bond- was something that I want. It was all too new. It was too much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aelrie gives my shoulder one last squeeze before letting her hand fall back to her side, and her lips thin into something resembling a grimace, &#34;I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ve probably already said too much. I think this is something that you and the King need to discuss together. But I want you to know that you can always come to me with any questions you may have about bonded pairings. While I don&#39;t have any personal experience in the matter, I do know a thing or two about it from our records. You&#39;re welcome to come and find me any time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallow hard, my bare feet shuffling on the soft soil. I twist the edge of my robe&#39;s sleeve between my fingers, &#34;Thank you, elder Aelrie. With everything that&#39;s happened, I know I&#39;m going to have a lot to sort through and figure out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I haven&#39;t even had a moment to come to grips with the fact that my parents aren&#39;t who I had believed them to be my entire life. And it was only a few weeks ago that I realized how lacking my knowledge is where it comes to elves and even shifters for that matter. Once the shock faded, I was sure I&#39;d have too many questions to even consider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everything will work itself out, Lily,&#34; she says kindly, her serene voice calming my apprehensiveness, &#34;There is a lot, but just take on one thing at a time-one day at a time-and it won&#39;t be as overwhelming. And you have many many people who are here for you wanting to help. You&#39;re not alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a heavy breath I hadn&#39;t even realized I&#39;d been holding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One thing at time. One question at a time. *One answer at a time*. That&#39;s how I would get through this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I knew where I need to start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Squaring my shoulders, I brace myself for what I know I need to do next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know where I can find Damion?&#34; I ask her.</p>
