                <p>The wolf&#39;s fur is a pure white that&#39;s spotless enough that it shines with the light from the sun. He stands probably four our five feet tall, even crouching in the bush of flowers ahead of us. The beast&#39;s dark eyes track over us glinting with something that looks like interest- his large head tips curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my right, Xavier&#39;s form shifts away from me and his figure ripples as a tearing sound rips through the garden. Suddenly, in the space Xavier had stood before, now stands a thickly- built grizzly bear. My breath catches in my chest, my heart thundering as a threatening grumble rips from the bear&#39;s throat, taking a protective step between the wolf and me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is the first time I&#39;ve ever seen him shift- seen *any* shifter change into their other form for that matter - and my lips part with my shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wolf doesn&#39;t move, doesn&#39;t even flinch at the sight of Xavier&#39;s bear form, just continues to stare at me with his large dark eyes. And then, a warm prickling sensation heats under my skin--- slowly, so slowly at first as if it&#39;s waking up from a deep sleep. It&#39;s a prickling electric feeling that feels similar to what I feel heating my skin when I&#39;m in the springs. Like a lightning strike. A brush of magic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As my skin heats, I feel a tug in my chest like an invisible rope is directing my attention to the wolf. I can *sense* him. The wolf. Sense the heat of his life form in front of me like a palpable thing. And I know - without knowing *how*- that he&#39;s not going to attack us. That the beast is calm, even with Xavier&#39;s bear form practically ready to tear into him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Xavier, don&#39;t hurt him,&#34; I say quickly, heart pounding in my chest. *Can he understand me in this form?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xavier keeps his eyes trained on the wolf, though his head tilts in my direction letting me know he&#39;s listening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s not going to attack us,&#34; I say, trying to let the assurance I feel at that fact seep into my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you know that?&#34; Arden asks, eyeing me from her defensive position in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t knowI can just tell. I think he&#39;s just curious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I step out from around Arden&#39;s shoulder and am surprised when she lets me. Xavier lets out a low grumbling growl from deep in his chest that I ignore as I take a slow step up toward the wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;s even more massive up close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reach out a hand cautiously, and the wolf notes the movement with cautious, watchful eyes before leaning forward to smell the exposed skin there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lily,&#34; Arden says in a low warning, &#34;Not that I don&#39;t trust you and all, but is it really the wisest decision in the world to be putting yourself within chomping distance of that thing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s not going to bite me,&#34; I say, feeling the wolf&#39;s curiosity stemming and transforming to something akin to satisfaction before bending its neck back to lick me across the face. My lips split into a wide grin, a shocked laugh tumbling out of me as I run my fingers over the wolf&#39;s soft fur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;*What the actual fuck*,&#34; Arden mutters, shock and horror echoing through her voice in equal measure. Xavier&#39;s bear form grunts by way of agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see you&#39;ve met Rison,&#34; says a deep, calming voice from behind us. I glance over my shoulder and vaguely recognize the tall and willowy figure. He was the the male who had discovered us in the tunnel with elder Aelrie. Damion had said that he was another of the elven elders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The long snowy white hair that hangs in sleek sheets down his shoulders is easily recognizable. And while he&#39;s almost the same height as Damion reaches when he&#39;s standing beside me, the elf isn&#39;t nearly as broad as the shifter King is- he&#39;s thinner, less muscled and more lithe. Like Aelrie, his skin is pristine, not a wrinkle in sight, but there&#39;s a certain agelessness about his eyes that makes me think that he&#39;s not nearly as young as he appears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have,&#34; I say, letting my fingers drag over his fur again, and the wolf tilts his head towards me welcoming the touch, &#34;Is he yours?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In a way,&#34; the elf says, &#34;He seems to have taken a liking to you, which is an oddity for him.&#34; He blinks curiously at the large white wolf for a single moment before turning back to face me, &#34;I&#39;m afraid I haven&#39;t had the opportunity to introduce myself to you properly. I am Elandorr. I was there that day in the tunnels when you arrived.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod, &#34;I remember you, it&#39;s good to see you again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m glad we crossed paths when we did, you see I was hoping I would get the chance to speak with you while you were here in Elfhame.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Distantly, I notice Arden and Xavier- still in his bear form - stiffen, sharing a look. &#34;What was it you were hoping to talk to me about?&#34; I ask, curiosity and wariness warring inside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>____________________________________________________</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At elder Elandorr&#39;s insistence, we follow him through the garden to a small sitting area. Xavier since shifted back into his human form, and both of my guards sit stiffly beside me as we gather against a small round table set up at the edge of a sprawling silver gazebo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cup of tea rests on the table- still steaming - as if he had just been about to settle in for a cup when we stumbled upon Rison. As we settle into the seats opposite elder Elandorr&#39;s the white wolf settles in at my feet, settling his large furry head on my toes, warming them. I smile down at him stroking a hand down his back and he grunts happily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ve always known that I&#39;ve had a sort of connection of sorts to animals, but I&#39;ve never experienced it in this way before. If the prickling under my skin-the one similar to the springs where I&#39;ve been reconnecting to Elfhame&#39;s source of magic and energy - has strengthened that connection for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion had mentioned that my energy- the magical signature that makes me *me* - had strengthened with my time connected to the source. Maybe this was another part of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elandorr settles in and takes a prim sip of his tea, &#34;From what I&#39;ve heard, your elfin heritage has come as much as a shock to you as it has to us. We had no knowledge of any of our kind being beyond the borders. We retreated here after the war and only a few political parties have been out past the wall since then. Knowing that one of our younglings was out there without access to the source has been almost too horrible for us to come to terms with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It has been a bit of a shock,&#34; I admit, &#34;I&#39;m not sure what elder Aelrie mentioned to you about the conversation I had with her yesterday, but I grew up in the Seelie fae court believing I was one of them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nods, &#34;She did mention that, but I have to ask,&#34; he hesitates for a moment then sits his mug down as if bracing himself for his next question, &#34;You&#39;re Marion Montegard&#39;s daughter, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel my eyebrows come together and I twist the hem of my robe between my fingers. It had been a while since I&#39;d last heard my mother&#39;s name spoken and it comes as a bit of a shock. &#34;She was my mother, though I never knew her. She passed away when I was born.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nods as if he were expecting this answer, his long graceful body going unnaturally still, followed by a drawn out pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, he breaks that silence to say, in a somewhat strained voice, &#34;I don&#39;t know how to say this, Lily, but I believe my son was your father.&#34;</p>
