                <p>That&#39;s how I spend the majority of my day-curled up in the bed and riffling through the pages of the book. Interspersed among the reading, though, with so much time on my hands, I can&#39;t help but mull over the conversation I&#39;d had with the king earlier.  I&#39;m halfway through the book in my lap when there&#39;s another knock at the door-this one much firmer than the last. The door opens again before I have the chance to reply and a man and a woman stride into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can tell they&#39;re guards immediately, just from the way they carry themselves. They peer around the room, eyes flickering over every surface in search of a threat. I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re expecting me to do to them chained up to the bed the way I am. I meet their suspicious gazes with a wary one of my own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They&#39;re each in lightweight gear-swords strapped to each of their backs and clad in dark heavy-duty fabrics. Their armor appears to be much more lightweight than the shining gold-plaited armor of the guards I&#39;m used to seeing around the palace back at home. After their initial glance in my direction, they ignore me, prowling the perimeter of the room, their hands lingering on the hilts of their weapons as if expecting someone to jump out at them at any moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watch them prowl around the room for a few long moments, and when they still don&#39;t say anything to me, my curiosity gets the better of me and I say, &#34;Not that you aren&#39;t welcome here, but what exactly are you two looking for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The male doesn&#39;t deign me with a response, just a singular grunt as he searches around the nightstand beside the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The female guard, though, pauses at my question, throwing a glance over her shoulder, &#34;Never you mind, Princess. Just go back to what you were doing. We won&#39;t be long.&#34; There&#39;s something familiar about her voice, but I can&#39;t quite place it before she disappears into the connecting bathing chamber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I purse my lips, gingerly eyeing the male guard who&#39;s now prowling the space beside my bed. I know I&#39;m a prisoner, but, there&#39;s something so undignifying about sitting chained to a bed in a rumpled nightgown while strangers search the room. I may not have magic like my sister, but even she wouldn&#39;t be able to pull setting up some trap while chained in iron to a headboard. Something inside me prickles and I say blandly, &#34;Whatever you do, don&#39;t look under the bed. That&#39;s where I keep my hidden stash of explosives, and they&#39;ve been known to be quite temperamental. &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The male guard shoots me an irritated look but doesn&#39;t say anything as he crouches down to check beneath the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh, clutching the book tightly to my chest, &#34;Jeez, I was only joking... I&#39;m not an idiot. Everyone knows it&#39;s better to keep explosives in the closet. &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the books clutched in my hands, I suddenly get the urge to hide them-what if they take them away? Butit&#39;s already too late. I only manage to tuck one under the blanket before the female guard strides back into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;After your recent brush with death, His Highness wants us to check in on you directly for as long as you&#39;re here. Make sure that you don&#39;t take ill again or have someone sneak in and try to murder you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right,&#34; I nod as if this makes perfect sense, tone dry, &#34;Of course. We can&#39;t have the King&#39;s leverage to die unexpectedly before he has a chance to use her, can we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Glad to see we&#39;re all on the same page.&#34; The male guard grumbles under his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes trail back to the female guard who&#39;s slowing down-coming to the end of her sweep of the room. I blink, suddenly remember why her voice sounds somewhat familiar. It was her voice I&#39;d heard in the dungeon. She was the female guard who found me, making sure I didn&#39;t stop breathing while the other guard went to fetch the King. I turn my full focus to her and say, &#34;It&#39;s good to see that you weren&#39;t demoted by my almost dying like you were expecting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The female guard&#39;s face whips in my direction, her mouth stretching into an amused grin before she can stop it, &#34;You heard that, did you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The male guard glances between us suspiciously, thick arms crossed over his chest, &#34;What are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing,&#34; the female guard rocks lightly on her feet, adjusting the neckline of her gear, &#34;I just didn&#39;t think the Princess was conscious enough to hear me rambling to myself in the dungeons while I waited for Erik to come back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anyone who could stay unconscious with your boot jamming into their side the way it was.&#34; I don&#39;t know where those words come from-I don&#39;t usually rib other people aside from my sister. No one in the palace back at home has ever quite known what to make of me and tend to avoid me like the plague whenever possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So it&#39;s not my utter shock when the female guard throws her head back and laughs. It&#39;s a deep throaty sound that warms something in my chest-just a little bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What can I say, I have a sharp kick,&#34; She jabs her elbow into the male guard&#39;s ribs and he rolls his eyes. &#34;You&#39;re not the only one who&#39;s been on the wrong end of my boot. Isn&#39;t that right, Xavier?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I attempt to fight back a small smile, and fail, &#34;It&#39;s very impressive, I can see why you got promoted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The female guard chuckles again and even the male guard&#39;s mouth twitches around the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clear my throat, fingers twitching along the blankets tucked around my lap, &#34;Have either of you heard any news of me going home? Any word from my father?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both of the guard&#39;s faces turn sober as soon as the words are out of my mouth. It&#39;s the male guard who answers, &#34;We can&#39;t divulge any information to you, Princess. If the King has anything he wishes for you to know, he&#39;ll inform you himself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The King had been about as forthcoming as a stone wall since I&#39;d been here. Letting nothing slip. I didn&#39;t want to risk pressing them for more information though-don&#39;t want them to grow suspicious for any reason. I nod, biting the inside of my cheek to stop myself from peppering them with a million other questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The male guard, Xavier, grumbles, &#34;There are guards stationed right outside your room, so don&#39;t attempt anything. Any untoward actions on your part will only land you right back into the dungeons.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll be back to do another check-in tomorrow.&#34; The female guard says, voice as stern as the males, but she shoots me a wink as they both turn to leave. Something about the simple action reminds me of my sister for the second time. Thinking of my Lucia sends a shot of pain through my chest. I miss her, desperately. What if they keep me here and I never see Lucia again? I very well could have died in that dungeon. Would my family have ever been told what happened to me? Would Lucia spend the rest of her life wondering where I was? I would do anything to be with my sister again-and I know she&#39;s doing everything in her power along with father to get me back. I just have to believe in that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lock clicks behind the guards as they disappear into the hallway. Alone, in the silence of the room, I stare after them long after they leave.</p>
