                <p>Wrapped in the warm towel he&#39;d given me, I walk out of the bathing room to find Damion standing by the large dark bed, muscled back to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay borrowing one of my shirts tonight?&#34; He asks as he rummages around in the trunk near his bed. I come up behind him, and when I don&#39;t respond he turns around, eyes questioning. With a hand flat on his chest, I push into him and he lets me, falling backward onto the massive bed. Still wrapped in my own towel, I climb on top of him, my legs straddle around his thighs, &#34;You&#39;re crazy if you think you&#39;re going to find a way to get out of me reciprocating this time, Damion,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lily-&#34; he starts to warn me, but I cut him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, that&#39;s not going to work on me this time.&#34; I say, grinning down at him as I let my fingers trace down the hard planes of his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swallows hard, staring up at me beneath hooded deep red eyes, &#34;I&#39;m worried that once I give in, I&#39;m going to going to lose myself to my berserker side. That I won&#39;t be able to stop.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words make my insides heat to dangerous levels, &#34;Lucia always said I&#39;m drawn in by wild things too much,&#34; I say biting into my bottom lip and he watches the movement with rapt fascination, &#34;It&#39;s a weakness of mine, always has been.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He groans in a way that sounds pained, &#34;Well, you definitely draw out the crazed insatiable monster side of me that can&#39;t get enough of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bend forward to trail kisses up his muscled chest, &#34;Good, because I want it,&#34; I say in between kisses, &#34;I want *every*  part of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pause with my hands at the edge of his towel, and glance up to meet his eyes. My eyebrows tip up, making sure he&#39;s okay with it. He stares at me for a long moment, breathing hard. Slowly, he snakes his hands up to take hold of my fingers where they&#39;re latched onto the edge of his towel and directs my hands to unwrap the tie at the top. His towel loosens and the fabric falls to either side of his waist and his impressive cock stands at attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holy gods. My mouth goes dry at the sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;s huge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looks up at me with a lazy, heated smile watching as I obsessively take him in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fingers stroke up the length of him and he shudders. As I reach the end of his length, my fingers hover over the rounded, nearly bulbous base at the end of his cock that I don&#39;t recall having been a part of my last and only sexual encounter, &#34;What is this?&#34; I ask in a hoarse voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion&#39;s grin turns all smug arrogance, &#34;My knot. It comes with the berserker territory. Once I&#39;m buried to the hilt inside you it will expand, locking us together. It will probably take some time for you to work up to being able to take it, so we won&#39;t go that far *this* time. When you think you&#39;re ready for it, though, let me know. Don&#39;t let it scare you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holy shit. *Holy shit.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trust me,&#34; I say weakly before taking the time to think about what I&#39;m saying, &#34;I&#39;m anything but scared right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion laughs quietly at my breathless admission, lying on the bed beneath me, his chiseled frame dominating the space. I yank off my own towel, fully naked for him again and stretch over him, my inner thighs burning slightly as I straddle his hips. Bracing myself with my hands on his chest, I lower my hips and rub the now drenched folds of my hot center over his hard length.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He groans loudly as I continue sliding over him, his muscles impossibly tense. His hands move from my hips, gliding up the curve of my sides to my breasts. He cups them in his large palms, tweaking at my nipples watching me with wine-colored hooded eyes as I writhe over him like he can&#39;t take his eyes off me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we&#39;re both panting with need, he flips us over in a single easy motion and takes the position on top. He drops his hips and presses his enormous cock teasingly over my swollen clit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ready for me?&#34; He asks on a low growl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes. Gods, yes. More than ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are *you* ready for *me*?&#34; I respond teasingly, giving him an arch look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My coy response shocks a laugh out of him, &#34;Fuck, you&#39;re perfect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smirks, lining up the head of his cock at my entrance, then oh so slowly pushes forward. I suck in a surprised breath at the hot hard feel of him pressing into me. A whimper escapes me at the impossible fullness of it, my nails digging into his back as he slides that hard length stopping only when he reaches the base of what he called his knot, not pushing it further like he&#39;d said. His knot looks wide enough I wonder if I&#39;ll *ever* be able to take it inside of me. I&#39;ll look forward to trying it at some point, though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And it feels *right*. Right in a way that nothing else ever has.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion&#39;s eyes scrunch shut like the pleasure is as overwhelmingly good for him as it is for me, which can&#39;t possibly be true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasp as he pulls out to the tip before he pushes back in, working up to a mind melting rhythm. All there is, is heat and feeling and an insane amount of blissful pleasure as we rock our hips together, meeting each other stroke for stroke. He twists his hips, changing angles to reach down impossibly farther into me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, gods,&#34; I moan, my breaths not coming easily anymore as pleasure jolts through me in sparks. He takes my mouth in a scorching kiss before pulling away to look down into my face, not breaking his punishing rhythm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re mine now darling,&#34; he growls down at me, &#34;There&#39;s no going back now. There&#39;s nowhere you could go that I wouldn&#39;t follow you. You&#39;re mine. Only mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words have pussy pulsing around him, squeezing his cock in a death grip that has a groaning growl ripping up his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damion,&#34; I gasp, clenching around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let go for me,&#34; he says, pounding into me unrelentingly with thrust after mind blowing thrust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My orgasm takes me out of nowhere, crashing over me in a wave so hard that I scream, my nails clawing into his broad back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He continues pounding into me as I come down from my high, with jerking wild thrusts, and the flash in his eyes is anything but tame. The sight makes my inner walls clench around him even tighter. I love it. Seeing him lose control is everything. He follows me over the edge with a shout. His hips crash into mine in a slowing rhythm and I cling to him tightly, not ready for it to end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kisses the damp hair at my temple, and I lean into his lips, soaking up the last dregs of the high still pumping through me, my entire body going boneless in the aftershocks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warm feeling pumping through my chest as I stare up into his gorgeous face is unlike anything I&#39;ve never felt in my entire life. And I don&#39;t know if it should scare me or not. All I know is that right now, everything in the world finally feels right.</p>
