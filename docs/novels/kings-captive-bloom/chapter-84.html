                <p>*Three days later*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night is perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Up in the gardens of the shifter castle roof, lights have been strung up, giving the night a magical glow. The garden has always been my favorite place in the mountain castle. I&#39;ve always thought that the spacious, open ceiling room like something from out of a fairytale. The stone roof opens up revealing a sky full of stars that look like cut crystal embedded in black satin skies. The garden&#39;s white barked trees rustle in the shifting breeze and walls of wisteria, bright pink sweet pea, blooming jasmine, and marigolds surrounds a stone path diving into the fray of greenery. The scent of honeysuckle tickles my nose and I breathe it in deeply, feeling like I&#39;ve stepped into a little piece of my own personal heaven.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We&#39;d only arrived back from the border late last night, and the news that the earth storms would no longer wreak havoc through the mountains along with the end of attacks from both he Seelie and Unseelie fae were more than reason enough for the shifters to throw together a celebration, welcoming in a time of peace for us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Up in the gardens, the place is overflowing with food, dancing, music and laughter, everyone dressed up in formal wear with sparkling drinks in hand. I&#39;ve spent the majority of the night so far on the makeshift dance floor, living out the hope I&#39;d always had to spend celebrations like this among the graceful sway of the dancers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s as magical as I&#39;d hoped it would moving with the music with my friends and even Damion from time to time. As the night goes on, my feet ache so much my dancing turns more to a breathless limping motion and I&#39;m forced to stop when a chuckling Damion resorts to hoisting me up into his arms and carrying me off the floor to rest. He plyies a glass of water into my hand which I gulp down greedily. Happiness sparkles through me as warm and bright as the shimmering stars overhead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucia follows us off the dance floor, plopping down in the chair next to me eyeing where Xavier and Lucia are playing a drinking game with a few other soldiers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My sister leans over to me, &#34;He&#39;s cute,&#34; she murmurs in a low voice, &#34;What&#39;s his story? Is he spoken for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Xavier?&#34; I blink over at her and then grin, &#34;From what he&#39;s told me, he prefers his bed partners to be of the male variety.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure he&#39;d be flattered to hear you&#39;re interested if you still want to make an attempt. Though,&#34; I tease, and she follows my gesture to the corner where Leif is watching my sister with a not- so- subtle longing in his eyes, &#34;I think there&#39;s someone else you could ask who&#39;d be much more willing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She snorts, but her golden cheeks heat to a pretty shade of pink, &#34;If only he were so lucky.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know what had happened between Leif and my sister after Damion&#39;s berserker had carried me off into the mountains, but what I *do* know is that the interactions between them since we&#39;d gotten back have fraught with tension. If I had to put money down on which kind of tension, the looks Leif&#39;s been leveling at Lucia hint toward something I&#39;m not so sure I want to know the details of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take another sip of water, then ask the question I&#39;ve been putting off for the past few days, &#34;When you do you have to leave?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>According to the information that the elves had sent us, when the Dragon had settled in its new home, the dragon hadn&#39;t left the Seelie King alive for long after he had taken him. That left the Seelie with an empty throne. And with Lucia being the heir, she would need to go see to what were now *her* people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already sent word to the advisors that I would be making the journey back to the palace tomorrow morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My stomach drops and I reach out to squeeze her hand. As much as I don&#39;t want her to leave, as much as I&#39;ll miss having my sister with me, we both know where she&#39;s needed right now. As much as the Seelie have always disliked me, they&#39;ve always adored Lucia and they&#39;ll be missing her, especially at a time like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can go with you if you want- if you think it would help,&#34; I offer. Though I&#39;m sure the court would be less than enthused to see me after everything that&#39;s happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucia grins, &#34;It&#39;s not necessary, though I expect you to be waiting for your invitation to my upcoming coronation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I match her smile with my own, &#34;Of course I&#39;ll be, I wouldn&#39;t miss it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>__________________________________________________</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the night winds down to a close, when the gardens start to empty, most of the shifters too tired to continue the celebration, Lucia, Xavier, Arden, and I continue the celebration back in my room. As we leave the gardens, Damion sends me off with a kiss and a promise go meet us down after he finishes the discussion he&#39;s found himself in with Leif and another captain. Though I feel the weight of his heated gaze on me the entire walk out of the gardens as I had throughout the entire night when during the short times he had been pulled from my side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in my room, Arden cracks open another bottle of champagne as we play a few hands of cards. We spend the time laughing and joking so much we barely make it through the last hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Play us a song, Lily,&#34; Lucia requests. She&#39;s already on her third glass of champagne and her cheeks are flushed. I&#39;ve had a little too much to drink myself and a warm haze has already pumped its way through my blood stream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arden takes another bite of cake she&#39;d snagged when she&#39;d left, her eyes drifting over to the corner where the harp sits beside the bookcase, &#34;I was wondering why the Commander asked one of these to be brought in here. You never told us that you play.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrug, &#34;Back when I was sick, I had a lot of time on my hands. You both know how easily I got tired. Playing the harp was one of the few things I could do while siting that kept me busy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucia scoffs loudly, &#34;Don&#39;t let her false modesty fool you, she&#39;s a natural. It&#39;s like magic when she plays.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Believe me,&#34; Xavier drawls, leaning back in his seat, &#34;we&#39;ve gotten to know her well enough to not let her get away with that shit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I narrow my eyes at each of them, &#34;This ganging up on me thing you have going on better not become a common occurrence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Play for us, Lily,&#34; Lucia says again, voice slurring a little,  &#34;It&#39;s been *so* long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All three of them look at me expectantly, waiting, and I sigh, giving in, &#34;Alright, fine. But just a few songs,&#34; I wobble a little on my feet making my way over to the harp, strumming my fingers over the strings as I get close enough, then slowly lower myself to the stool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucia was right when she said that it really has been a while since I&#39;ve played anything. But the familiar motion of plucking my way down the strings to get acquainted with the new instrument is as natural as breathing. The harp Damion had brought in is gorgeous. Despite going unplayed for so long, it somehow managed to stay in tune for the most part as I slowly test out the strings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, I settle back and begin to play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My friends go silent as I start out with the song that Lucia had always claimed to be her favorite. It&#39;s a flowing, cheerful song that sounds like early springtime. It flies easily through my fingertips, my fingers grazing and plucking over the strings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Lucia&#39;s favorite draws to a close, I immediately dive into another song that&#39;s a little deeper, more melancholy and hopeful that I tended to play more on the days when I was alone. I close my eyes, opening myself up to feelings and memories the music brings back. It&#39;s crazy to think how much my life has changed over the past few months compared to the last time I&#39;d played it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I barely recognize that life anymore- that loneliness that had threatened to drown me. My life now is filled with so much love and joy and freedom- the kind of life I&#39;d always wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last note of the song rings in the air for a drawn out moment. When I open my eyes again, my gaze lands on an unexpected set of blazing golden eyes from where he stands in the doorway of my room.</p>
