                <p>I lean up my toes and his lips crash into mine in a heated desperate kiss. I gasp as his tongue parts the seam of my lips and I stumble at the sudden intensity of his taste in my mouth. It&#39;s addictive and overpowering and purely *him*. His tongue strokes mine, and one of his hands lands on my hip as he steps closer, pressing against me as he deepens the kiss with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fingers lift to the rough fabric of his shirt and dig into him with my nails as he starts to walk me backward without pulling away. The heels of my feet stumble into the wall behind me and my back follows until I&#39;m pressed firmly between both it and Damion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every inch of me is hot as my heart pumps hard in my chest, my hands sliding further up his neck as I hang onto him desperately, pulling him even closer to me. One of my legs lifts up to hook around his waist and he lifts me higher until both of my thighs wrap around his hips. I groan into his mouth when his erection meets my core, hitting me perfectly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck, you taste incredible,&#34; he growls against me, releasing my mouth long enough to drag his lips and tongue down the sensitive column of my throat. He leaves a trail of heat in his wake. I struggle for air, clinging to the strong line of his shoulders as he makes me feel things I&#39;ve only ever dreamed of before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The back of my head hits the wall as he sucks lightly on the skin above the curve of my breast that&#39;s peeking out above the line of my robes, making me desperate for even more. He shifts to the side just a little, still holding me up against him easily and his hand finds the apex of my thighs. I gasp at the contact, and he captures my lips again as he slowly strokes my clit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers are strong, the callouses from hours of training and fighting rougher than what I&#39;d expected or was used to. But his touch, his every movement against my sensitive flesh is so damned perfect at it that it takes my breath away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hips rock and swivel desperately against those magical fingers as he works me slowly through my undergarment, dragging me closer and closer to the edge. His mouth is a hot brand on mine and he swallows every sound I make.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fingers bury in his hair, gripping the strands and the warm smooth curve of his horns to anchor myself as he brings me even closer to my climax. And finally it all becomes too much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shatter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pleasure hits harder than I&#39;ve ever experienced before and lasts longer too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mouth stays on mine as his fingers drag every bit of bliss out for me as I come down from my high. His touch is soft but confident as the tips of his fingers continue to circle the fabric there that&#39;s now soaked with my pleasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good girl. You&#39;re doing so well for me,&#34; He growls into my mouth and his words make my toes curl, and heat swell in my abdomen. He recaptures my lips then, but I ease them away from him so I can tug his shirt over his head. He lets me, helping me to get the material off of him. As the dark fabric of his shirt drops to the ground and reveals his perfect form, my mouth goes dry. I&#39;ve seen his naked chest before-in fact it couldn&#39;t have been more than an hour since the last time I saw it- and yet that doesn&#39;t stop me from studying his body with thinly-veiled desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s like my eyes have a mind of their own and dip lower to trace the hard lines of muscle again. Of their own accord they follow the hypnotizing array of dark lines and carve their way into the sharp contrast of shadows where they dip into his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m surrounded on all sides by the wild, frantic beating of his heart that matches my own frantic pulse against me and his piney scent envelopes me. I greedily drink in the sight of him, eyes skim over the familiar swirling lines of black tattoos that curl over nearly every inch of his chest. I suddenly forget how to breathe again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man is a masterpiece.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still plastered between his chest and the wall, he grips my thighs tighter between his large hands. He lifts me up and holds me closer as he strides across the room to splay me out across his bed. His mouth recaptures mine and I part my lips for him without waiting for a nudge and his tongue strokes mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All thoughts disappear from my mind as he kisses me slowly and intimately, as if there&#39;s nothing else in the world he would rather be doing. My thighs are still wrapped around his waist, the hardness of his cock straining against his riding pants and I rock against him, body starting to move again as I roll my hips against his erection. The hardness of his hard length hits me perfectly, dragging me closer to the edge, making him growl against my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grip on my body grows rougher, his hands on my ass tightening as he helps me move against him. His mouth is still on mine, swallowing my cries as I lose control once more. I come down from the high panting, and he releases my lips to let me catch my breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warmth of his mouth brushes against my ear, &#34;You&#39;re so damned gorgeous, Lily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m too dazed by the double hit of pleasure to respond. My lips feel as if they&#39;re going to be swollen for hours after all the kissing, yet I&#39;m already wondering how I can get his mouth on mine again. My body is blissfully warm, and yet I&#39;m already aching for more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stroke my hands down the tight lines of his perfect body, the smoothness of his chest, and his lips crash down on mine again. My fingers slide into his hair, tangling in the thick, soft strands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been dreaming about tasting you from the moment I laid eyes on you,&#34; he growls, the broad expanse of his body shifting further down the bed, tugging on my hips until they reach the edge, &#34;Can I?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t think of anything I want more, so I glance down at him and nod, unsure if my voice will even work after the intensity of the pleasure he&#39;s already wrung out of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to hear you say it, darling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;*Please*,&#34; I finally manage to get out on a ragged breath, &#34;Don&#39;t even think about stopping.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank the gods,&#34; he growls, as he settles between my thighs, lifting back the edge of silky material of my robes.</p>
