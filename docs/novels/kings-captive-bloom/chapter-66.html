                <p>Feeling too restless to stay in bed much longer, I slip into the shower to clean off any remaining evidence of last night from my skin. Spending so much time with Arden and Xavier the past few weeks in Elhame taught me a lot about shifters and their heightened sense of smell and sight. I&#39;m not about to risk leaving anything on me from last night that the shifters might be able to pick up with their superior senses. That would be asking to be the center of Arden and Xavier&#39;s suggestive comments and bawdy jokes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Coming out of the shower, I find that Mitra&#39;s laid out breakfast for me along with a set of clothing she&#39;d laid out for me that she must have picked out closet. Seeing them brings a wave of relief because I wouldn&#39;t have to sneak across the corridor to my room like I&#39;d been planning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d been embarrassed earlier about the fact of running into Mitra in Damion&#39;s room- when it would be more than obvious *why* I was here. But seeing as how she&#39;d slipped in and out - to give me privacy no doubt - leaves me with a pang of disappointment. I&#39;d missed the shifter woman in the weeks I was gone and was looking forward to giving her a hug. Especially after the way she&#39;d taken care of me before Damion had taken me to Elfhame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dress she&#39;d picked out for me is gorgeous- it&#39;s in a sunny shade of yellow that immediately reminds me of the color of Damien&#39;s when he&#39;s happy. The sleeves dipped off my shoulders and the light flowing skirt is easy to move in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take a few bites of breakfast at Damion&#39;s table near the massive black fire place before I decide that it feels too strange to just be lounging around in his room without him. I clear up the table for Mitra and head to the door, more than happy to go and spend some time in my own room across the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I&#39;m pulling Damion&#39;s bedroom door firmly closed, I&#39;m startled when an unexpected voice sounds behind me, making me jump.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, well, well,&#34; Arden drawls, teasingly, &#34;Look who&#39;s sneaking out of the king&#39;s private chambers&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>_______________________________________________________</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Apparently the King has been in *quite* the mood these past few weeks,&#34; Arden tells me from where she&#39;s crouched beside me, with a suggestive smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pause what I&#39;m doing, my hands half buried in the soft garden soil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d asked Arden and Xavier if they could take me somewhere I could help with repairs and clean up after yesterday&#39;s storm. A part of me had been expecting for them to take me back to the library- the place I&#39;d helped out last time- but I&#39;d been pleasantly surprised when they had led me to the highest levels out into the massive gardens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the last few hours I&#39;ve been helping weed and plant and pick vegetables. The feel of the sunshine on my face is heavenly. I&#39;ve always loved spending time in the gardens, but ever since my time in Elfhame, I&#39;ve found a new love for the outdoors. I&#39;m still getting used to the new flurries of energies that have been fluttering through me the past few weeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My newfound ability in sensing the essence of the various plants and animals around me adds another layer to my enjoyment as I sift through how each plant and chirping bird and bug *feels* while I work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;According to the soldiers who were here while we were gone,&#34; Arden continues, &#34;our cold and collected, all- powerful leader has been *irascible* since he&#39;s returned from Elfhame. Apparently, he&#39;s been growling at anyone and everyone about even the littlest things.Very unlike him considering he&#39;s usually a rock when it comes to emotions. Sounds to me like a certain somebody missed you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance over at Xavier for confirmation, and he nods grimly, &#34;It&#39;s no wonder Leif risked his neck to get you back here. No one wants to deal with an irritable berserker. It&#39;s like asking for problems.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I roll my eyes, trying not to laugh at their dramatics and failing, &#34;You two are by far the worst gossips I&#39;ve ever met- and that&#39;s saying something considering I grew up in the fae courts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arden snorts, &#34;I mean, is it really gossip if it&#39;s *true*?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;*Yes*,&#34; I laugh, &#34;It is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I like to think we&#39;re just passing along the news,&#34; Xavier drawls, dusting off soil from the leg of his trousers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I huff, fighting back my smile as I shimmy my shovel through the dirt again, &#34;You two are incorrigible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s why you love us,&#34; Arden croons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t deny that fact at all, and shake my head in defeat, &#34;True.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We work out in the gardens through the entire morning, stopping for lunch in the early afternoon. All three of us are a mess when we make our way to the dining hall, though my mess is a little harder to hide in my light colored dress than their black uniforms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loose strands of my hair that managed to slip from my braid cling to the beads of sweat on the back of my neck. Streaks of dirt cling to my dress and there&#39;s mud under my nails that I can&#39;t get out no matter how long I wash them. I find that I don&#39;t mind it though- being outside has energized me in the best way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the dining hall, we&#39;re stopped by two guards. The pair of intense looking shifters are in full- uniform . I&#39;m fairly sure I&#39;ve never met them before, but Arden and Xavier clearly know them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fiona, Pieter,&#34; Xavier greets them with a nod, his face shifting back to the serious guard expression he wears when he&#39;s all- business, &#34;Do you need something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Captain Alfson asked us to fetch the Princess and bring her to the King&#39;s meeting chambers,&#34; the woman, Fiona, says. Captain Alfson- she&#39;s talking about Leif, Damion&#39;s second in command. Why is he calling me in?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xavier, Arden, and I share a brief look between us and Arden nods, &#34;Lead the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>_________________________________________________________</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion and Leif are the only two people left in the meeting chambers when we arrive, though from the crooked state of the chairs and empty plates around the room, it looks to have been recently vacated. The two males appear to be deep in conversation, their voices low and tense as we&#39;re led into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the sound of our entrance, they both turn toward us. Leif appears stressed as he thanks Fiona and Pieter for bringing me before dismissing them. Damion&#39;s eyes find me immediately, the strained lines around his eyes and in his shoulders softening as his gaze roves over every inch of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He crosses the room in a few quick strides, pulling me into a quick searing kiss that leaves me blushing by the time he pulls away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did your meeting go?&#34; I ask him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About as I expected it would,&#34; he murmurs into my ear, &#34;It was much longer than it needed to be considering how *distracted* I was.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A grin splits across my face at the call back to our conversation we&#39;d had right before he&#39;d left me in his bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What have you been up to this morning?&#34; He asks, tucking a strand of my loose braid behind my ear and a flash of heat prickles up my spine at the contact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve been helping out in the gardens,&#34; I tell him, showing him my still dirt streaked hands, &#34;And I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll probably need help if I&#39;m ever going to get all this dirt off of me later.&#34; I murmur quietly, flashing him a wicked smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes flash red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can all hear you, you know, &#34; Leif grumbles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then plug your ears,&#34; Damion snaps while Xavier and Arden try to fight their snickers and do a horrible job at it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have mercy on them and change the subject, &#34;Is everything okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leif clears his throat, &#34;We brought you here because there&#39;s some news we thought you should be aware of.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I spare him a quick glance before glancing worriedly back up at Damion,&#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion hesitates for only a moment, watching my reaction carefully as he says, &#34;Your sister is here.&#34;</p>
