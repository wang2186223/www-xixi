                <p>I fade in and out of edge of sleep, pulled to the edge of consciousness by the feel of something hard and heated pressing into my lower back. My thighs clench together in an attempt to relieve some of the needy pressure building there. White hot heat flashes through me and I rock into the solid body behind me a whimper on my lips. I rock back up against his muscled chest letting him feel my body pressing back, feeling *him*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The feel and smell of his body against me is familiar even half asleep the way I am. Suddenly, the hot press of his body against my back moves away, and I cry out in protest. Before I have the chance to be too disappointed, the warm blankets shift around me until large familiar hands are pressing me back into the soft ground. My clothes are shoved aside, then something slick and hard runs up and down my the length of my core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mouth, a tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slick heat glides through my folds and I press a hand to my forehead because it feels so so good. Better than good. Heat and bliss flash through me as that devastatingly hot tongue works itself in circles along the edges. Soft rumbling sounds come from nearby, almost like language except I can&#39;t understand a word of. And somewhere in the midst of those *unfamiliar* noises, I remember where I am and who it is that brought me here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The berserker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The berserker is devouring me like his life depends on it. While somewhat unexpected, I don&#39;t mind the Berserker&#39;s touch at all, in fact I like it. His skin is different, still that  familiar shade of dark grayish it had shifted to yesterday. I had thought it would feel rough against my fingers, but it has a velvety texture to it. It&#39;s different than Damion&#39;s normal touch, but is still *him* in an entirely new and unexpected way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even still, I stiffen for a moment as the memories from yesterday flow back in and Damion&#39;s berserker form lifts his head and nuzzles at my lower stomach purring deep in his chest. I lick my lips and then look down into those shining amber eyes. The way he&#39;s staring at me right now, the fiery wild intensity focused entirely on me as he rises up over me has a small whimper escaping my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As our gazes lock and he slides his hand down to my center where he drags his fingers over my folds. His grayish skin is rough against me, and my eyes roll back, my thighs shaking with the intensity of the pleasure he&#39;s wringing out of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh gods,&#34; I whisper on a low rasping breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those heated sparks of electricity pumping through my veins, I reach out with unsteady hands to grasp onto his horns, pushing his head *down, down, down* until he&#39;s back where I need him to be. I watch as he drags his tongue over me again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knows exactly what I want, working long, slow, delicious licks right down the slick folds of my center. And the berserker is really, really good at licking. Something ridged and lined slicks against the entrance of my core, and I realize he&#39;s got a texture on his tongue that isn&#39;t normally there. And it feels incredible. I&#39;m barely even breathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One big hand pushes on my inner thighs, urging me to spread my legs wider, and I open up further for him. He rewards me by grazing his tongue against the needy aching ball of nerves of my clit. It&#39;s especially sensitive, and he&#39;s been avoiding it until now. Another hoarse whimper escapes me and the berserker picks up speed, his fingers spread my folds and he devours every inch of me, drinking down my essence as if he&#39;s a drowning man and I&#39;m his oxygen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He continues his devouring pace until the tip of his fangs brushing over my clit in a sharp brush that feels so *so* good. And then he rolls it between the sharp points of his teeth. My hips buck against him and I cry out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He growls, sounding pleased, and continues to lick and suck at my clit until my thighs are shaking. I&#39;m going to come. He&#39;s making me feel incredible. Those bumps and ridges on his tongue move against my clit one final time and my entire body explodes in wave after wave of bliss as I come *hard*. Over and over, my pussy clenches and the orgasm rocks through me, my entire body locked and tense with the strain of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, when after what feels like ages, I collapse onto the blankets, exhausted. My hand goes over my eyes and I rub my face. When I&#39;m finally able to open my eyes again, the look on Damion&#39;s face- the berserker&#39;s face- is fierce, and there&#39;s no mistaking the look of masculine pride pulling over his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I come down in the after shocks, the berserker tucks us back into the cocoons of blankets, nuzzling into my neck, breathing in my scent as I drift off into comfortable hazy sleep once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>__________________________________________________</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wake up feeling better than I have in days. With the stress of the impending meeting with the fae and planning for the dragon&#39;s removal, I haven&#39;t slept well lately. But as I peek open my eyes, I&#39;m met with the sight of warm morning light creeping through the cave&#39;s opening. I&#39;m warm under the thick spread of blankets, cuddled up against a big hard form that&#39;s warmer than the fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m pressed up against Damion&#39;s chest, soaking in the peaceful feel of his finger tips tracing idly over my skin. As his hand moves lower, trailing gently along my wrist, I notice the shade of that hand for the first time.His fingers are no longer the deep stormy gray they&#39;d turned into yesterday, but are once again the normal pale shade of moonlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every muscle in my body stiffens and fling myself over towards him tackling him to the padded cave floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re back!&#34; I cry out excitedly, happiness and relief rushing through me. I assault him with a barrage of enthusiastic kisses over his face and neck and chest and his responding chuckle is a low gravelly sound deep in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cut off that laugh by pressing my lips into his, stealing him in for a deep thorough kiss. It&#39;s a kiss that says everything I don&#39;t quite have the words to say. A kiss that shows how much I need him here with me, and not just physically, but *him*. As our lips press and twist together, the worried fog that had slowly been creeping in since he disappeared yesterday that I hadn&#39;t fully realized was there dissipates bringing with it the warmth and love and home that is purely Damion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pull back from our kiss to peer down at him with narrowed eyes, &#34;As much as I enjoyed getting to know the berserker side of you that I&#39;ve heard so much about, I&#39;d really appreciate it if you never leave me for so long again. I missed you *entirely* too much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The grin he levels at me is devastating enough that it sends my heart careening in my chest, &#34;Noted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After another long drawn out kiss, I tell him everything he&#39;d missed during the time his berserker had taken over. The dragon, the fae, our trip into the mountain. He laughs when I get to the part about his berserker hiding us out in this cave for the past day. He was still somewhat aware of what was happening while his baser nature had taken over and had flashes of memory from the time after the battle to now, so he hadn&#39;t missed too much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stares thoughtfully around the cave, tracing lazy patterns across my bare shoulder while he considers what I&#39;ve told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does it bother youthat weyou knowwhen you weren&#39;t completely aware of what was happening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion doesn&#39;t look bothered in the least though, snorting under his breath in amusement, &#34;No, it doesn&#39;t bother me, Lily. I&#39;m mostly surprised that the berserker didn&#39;t try to mark you while he was in control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blink at him in surprise. &#34;I wouldn&#39;t have let that part of you make that decision without you being aware of it,&#34; I assure him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes flash that shade of gold that I love so much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happens now?&#34; I ask him from where I&#39;m sprawled out across his broad chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As much as I&#39;d like to keep you here all to myself, we have to get back to the others and see what the damage is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;s right- while we&#39;ve been up here playing house in a cave, the other people we love have been left to deal with the aftermath of our battle with the fae.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod in agreement, &#34;Let&#39;s go home.&#34;</p>
