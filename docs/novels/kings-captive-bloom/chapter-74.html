                <p>Damion and I get ready for the day together, each of us helping the other to wash off the activities from last night in the shower. After showering, wrapped in towels, I follow him back into the bedroom where I pause half way across the room as realization dawns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll need to go back across to my room to get clothes,&#34; I tell him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion turns back to me, rubbing a hand along the sharp edge of his jaw, as he clears his throat, &#34;Actually, after last night, I asked Mitra bring a few of your spare dresses over yesterday morning.&#34; He admits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; I ask, blinking in surprise. He studies my face carefully as he watches for my reaction. Like he&#39;s worried I&#39;ll be upset by this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opens the door to his closet and steps back to reveal where a few of my dresses now hang next to his shirts, stowed in their own spot. Something about seeing both of our clothes tucked into his closet together makes a warmth spread through my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile pulls at my lips, &#34;Smart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;s still watching me warily as I step up beside him and raise up to my toes to plant a quick kiss on his lips. He lets out a breath as I move around him to pick out a day dress in a rosy shade of pink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doing something so normal- so mundane as getting dressed together, it feels comforting. It&#39;s still strange seeing my reflection in the mirror- seeing all the changes my body went through after being in Elfhame and gaining a strength that had never been there before. The bright dress brings out the healthy flush glowing in my cheeks, and more importantly, I *feel* strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The days I&#39;ve spent away from Elfhame&#39;s charge of power doesn&#39;t seem to have done anything to diminish the changes it had brought out in me either. From what elder Aelrie told me before I left Elfhame, I would eventually have to return to power source when I felt my energy levels receding. But she&#39;d been optimistic that I&#39;d be stable enough to be away from it for a few months before I started feeling any side effects.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as we finish dressing, as I&#39;m starting to comb through the tangles in my hair, the door to Damion&#39;s bedroom bangs open and I jump as my eyes turn to see Leif barge into the room with swaggering steps without bothering to knock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve got another long line up of meetings to get to today-&#34; Leif starts without looking up from a ledger in his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, Damion pushes me behind him so he&#39;s blocking me from Leif&#39;s direct line of sight. My entire body freezes as a blood chilling growl rips from his chest. I&#39;m not the only one who freezes either, Leif stops dead in his tracks, head whipping up at us- more toward Damion as I&#39;m still hidden behind his back, barely peeking out from around his shoulder. I watch as Leif&#39;s pale features settle as understanding dawns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The frenzy&#39;s taking over then, eh Lothbrook?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion just lets out another terrifyingly black growl that has the hairs on the back of my neck standing on end and goose bumps prickling on my arms. I&#39;ve never heard anything so nightmare- inducing in my life. And while my body is reacting to the sound physically, I also know that I don&#39;t have anything to fear from Damion. I know deep down to my very center that Damion would never hurt me, but I *am* worried for his friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s a frenzy?&#34; I ask slowly, carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leif&#39;s eyes stay carefully locked on his King, hands up in a placating show of being non- threatening as he answers my question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A frenzy is what we shifters call the state of madness that overcomes shifter males when they&#39;re in the process of forming a mating bond with a female,&#34; Leif explains, and there&#39;s a slight glimmer of amusement in his eyes that&#39;s nearly overshadowed by the grim look on his face, &#34;The males tend to be overwhelmed with a phase of mania where they become obsessed with their female&#39;s safety. Their bodies begin functioning entirely off of a deeply ingrained territorial instinct that takes over and doesn&#39;t really have a rhyme or reason to when it comes and goes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion takes a slow, threatening step forward and another chilling rumble emanates from deep in his chest. Leif responds with a compliant step back toward the door, keeping his hands up in a mollifying gesture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what does that mean?&#34; I ask Leif in a voice riddled with forced calm, &#34;He&#39;s not going to be acting like himself for a while?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leif still doesn&#39;t take his careful focus off of Damion, and I can&#39;t really blame him with the way Damion&#39;s muscles are coiled as if readying to strike out, &#34;It&#39;s different for everyone, but it&#39;s fairly common among the first phases of shifter mating relationships. It comes and goes. I can&#39;t say I know how it will work for a *Bonded* couple or if there will be any differences, but the frenzy will eventually taper off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this because we didn&#39;t seal the Bond last night?&#34; I ask, somewhat hesitantly. I really hope this isn&#39;t because of anything I did. But, I&#39;d told him I wanted to seal it with him- wanted him to mark me and make things permanent. Damion hadn&#39;t wanted to make any sudden decisions that I&#39;d regret. At my question, Leif&#39;s eyes do flicker to me for a moment in his shock, which sets off another warning growl from Damion. Leif moves his gaze firmly back to Damion, away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without thinking, my hand shoots out and grasps onto his muscled forearm. There&#39;s no way I&#39;m going to stand back and let him hurt his closest friend while his mind isn&#39;t really *his*. A shudder ripples through Damion at my touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leif considers my question for a moment before saying, &#34;No, from what I can tell, there&#39;s not really any reason behind them. Frenzies are all based off instincts and the body&#39;s natural reaction to what the shifter side views as threats to you and your Bonding. Over time he&#39;ll be able to control those baser instincts, but for now with the Bonding being so new, it&#39;ll take some time to adjust. That&#39;s not to say that he won&#39;t still get pulled into the madness from time to time, just that they&#39;ll become less frequent as he adjusts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What can we do? Is there something I can do to help?&#34; I ask, my grip tightening on Damion&#39;s arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing we can do really, except wait it out,&#34; Leif admits, &#34;He&#39;ll come back to himself soon enough. Though, I&#39;ve been told that*alone time* can help ease it up a little.&#34; The usual mischief I&#39;ve seen in his Leif&#39;s eyes returns for a brief second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Alone time.* It&#39;s easy to hear the innuendo in those words and a flash of a blush warms my cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leif takes a slow step backward toward the door, keeping his front to the tense male crouched in front of me, &#34;Lothbrook, I&#39;m going to step out into the hallway. We have planning meetings in a half an hour, so try to pull it together, brother. Aside from that, you&#39;re freaking Lily out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To me he says, &#34;I&#39;ll be out here if you need anything, Princess. He&#39;s not going to hurt you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know he won&#39;t,&#34; I say, ignoring his use of princess instead of my name, &#34;But thanks, Leif.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door closes behind him, leaving me alone with a frenzied Damion.</p>
