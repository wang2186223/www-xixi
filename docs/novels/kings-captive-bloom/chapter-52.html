                <p>His gaze is scorching hot as he takes in every inch of me. Any fear I would have had about him seeing me bare is gone thanks to those moments we already shared naked in the springs together. When he&#39;d seen my glowing skin and told me how beautiful he thought it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gods, you&#39;re absolutely drenched for me. Fuck, I can&#39;t wait to have my tongue on you. Spread your legs wider for me, darling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My abdomen is tight with desire as I do just that, watching as the heated burgundy of his gaze goes even hotter. His hands slide up the inner skin of my thighs making me fight to keep my hips from jerking. My entire body clenches in response to the sight of his face above my core. His eyes are still locked with mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck you&#39;re beautiful.&#34; He says, his voice a ragged growl. I can&#39;t take my eyes from his gorgeous, massive man. &#34;You have no idea how badly I&#39;ve wanted to touch you all these weeks. To run my tongue over every last inch of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lowers his lips to my core and lightly drags the tip of his tongue over my clit. I barely manage to keep from screaming out at the intensity of the sensation of the hot slick slide of him over that sensitive bud of nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Holy gods.You taste so fucking good,&#34; he growls deep in his chest, &#34;so much better than I ever could have imagined.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cry out as he slowly continues to work me, in no hurry to pick up the pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hips start to buck and my grip in his hair grows tighter. It takes every ounce of my effort to keep myself from screaming as he makes love to me with his mouth, dragging me back to the edge of my pleasure with far too much ease. His hand lands on my hips and holds me I place when my motions grow too desperate, and the heat of his grip is too much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shatter again, biting my cheek so hard that it bleeds as the pleasure cuts through me so forcefully. He doesn&#39;t pull away from my core or even slow down, the strokes of his tongue still steady on my clit. Lapping me up with a groaning growl that echoes deep in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;s wrung so much pleasure out of me, the intensity wringing moisture from my eyes and they drip down my sides of my cheeks. I&#39;m not sure I can keep going, my body drained and exhausted in the best way possible. Waves of aftershocks still rolling through me from the last powerful release he gave me, my body still overly sensitive from the waves of bliss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;s still going though, his hot tongue stroking over me in lazy strokes, tasting the pleasure now dripping down me, his eyes riveted on every emotion drawn out on my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I start to tell him as much, &#34;I don&#39;t know if I can handle-*oh*,&#34; I&#39;m cut off when the tip of one of his thick hot fingers presses into my seam, stretching me. I gasp and moan, as that finger continues working me, stretching me, dipping even deeper as he sucks my clit into his mouth. It&#39;s enough to drive me to insanity. It&#39;s so much more intense than anything I&#39;ve done or felt before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The feel of him pressing into my wet center is smooth and rough and so insanely hot I don&#39;t think I can take any more. He glides the tip of his finger at my entrance as he sucks at my clit before finally dipping all the way inside my channel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any lingering thoughts and sounds die with the feel of my body tightening and clenching around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swears as his finger bottoms out, a strangled breath roughly passing through his lips, &#34;You&#39;re so fucking tight, Lily. I can&#39;t wait to feel you around my cock.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t think it can possibly get any more intense, and then it somehow does when he adds a second finger. He slides them in and out, a delicious friction building as he stretches me, sliding impossibly deeper. And it&#39;s over impossibly fast after that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cry out with my release, making sounds I never even knew I was capable of. My body tightening with waves of pleasure around his fingers. His words-the thought of his thick cock inside me and what it will feel like when it finally does makes the pleasure drag on and on and on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I finally come down from my high, Damion drags his tongue and finger through the slickness of my release and over my clit one last time before he pulls from me, leaving me feel impossibly empty. He lifts those thick fingers to his lips. I can&#39;t take my eyes off him as with dark, wicked eyes, he sucks his fingers clean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight sends another pulse of pleasure through my already blissfully sore core. I&#39;m so wet between my thighs, I can feel the intensity of my pleasure rolling down between my legs. All I can do is lay there, basking in the impossibility of how incredible I feel. How insanely good that was. How wrung out and blissfully pliable every inch of my body feels as I revel in the aftershocks sparking in my veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holy shit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What *was* that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I never knew I could feel like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d had sex with one other person years ago-and while I had enjoyed it at the time, it hadn&#39;t even remotely compared to whatever *that* just was. And we hadn&#39;t even gotten to his cock yet. I can&#39;t imagine how much better that will be when we do</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m struggling to catch my breath as Damion pulls himself up from where he&#39;s been kneeling at the foot of the bed. His eyes raking over me, the scarlet in his eyes almost completely flooded over by the dark depths of his blown out pupils.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You spread out across my bed is the most stunning sight I&#39;ve ever seen,&#34; he growls, voice thick as he leans over me, bringing his lips to mine for one last lingering kiss. I savor the taste of him on my tongue before he pulls back so I can catch my breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I trace my fingers lightly over my face, struck by his sharp overwhelming beauty of him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was-&#34; I start, breathlessly, but can&#39;t find the right words to describe how intense it had been. How perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was.&#34; He nods, smiling down at me, staring at me like I&#39;m something precious. No one&#39;s ever looked at me like that before and it makes my heart feel like its swelling to impossible sizes in my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then.my stomach clenches in a quiet growl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I want to tell my stomach to shut up. To let me finish enjoying this moment with Damion, but it&#39;s already too late. Because Damion heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tenses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His entire body tightens above mine, as he swears, &#34;I can&#39;t believe I forgot to feed you. You&#39;ve barely eaten anything in *days*. You&#39;re probably starving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I *am* pretty hungry, but it&#39;s the last thing on my mind right now as I drag my eyes and fingers down his sculpted torso tracing the lines and indentations there, &#34;I&#39;m fine, don&#39;t worry-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He catches my hand, pulling my fingers to his lips in a scorching kiss before releasing it as he leans up from where he&#39;s been stretched over me, &#34;Let&#39;s get you something to eat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blink up at him, scowling, &#34;But we haven&#39;t even gotten to *you*, yet,&#34; I protest, stroking a hand down the front of his trousers, feeling the straining erection twitch in response to my touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face twists into a glower, &#34;If you think I could do anything more before I know you&#39;re taken care of, then you&#39;re in for a bit of a surprise, princess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damion-&#34; I start again in protest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leans forward to grab my hand, helping me to a sitting position on his bed with a gentle tug of his hand, &#34;Don&#39;t worry,&#34; he says in a low voice that I feel reverberating all the way down to my core, &#34;We have all night to get to everything else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*All night*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I really, really like the sound of that.</p>
