                <p>The bathing room consists of a massive in ground bathing pool off to the side, but what catches my attention is the shower in the corner. We have showers in the Seelie court, but for some reason I never expected them to have them here. I&#39;m not sure I even want to consider how they managed to get running water through these stone walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion turns a lever in the shower, starting it for me and water pours from the ceiling. With his back to me, he stands in front of it, testing the temperature as he waits for it to heat. The thought of standing under hot water and letting it rinse away days worth of sweat and dirt sounds heavenly enough my knees go a little weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I step up behind him, wrapping my arms around his waist. I snag the hem of his shirt and tug it up to pull over his head. He&#39;s tall enough that he has to help get it off the last bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mouth goes dry when he turns back around to face me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His body is perfect. There&#39;s no other way to describe the chiseled and tattooed man standing in front of me. My fingers run over the muscles there before dropping to the buckle of his pants. He lets me tug his pants down his legs until he&#39;s standing in his underclothes, same as me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes darken to that familiar shade of deep red I&#39;ve begun associating with his arousal as I strip of the remainder of my clothes until I&#39;m standing bare in front of him. The hard protruding line of his erection strains against the last shred of clothes he wears, his pulse pounding in his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He groans, &#34;You are so fucking beautiful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His throat works in a swallow as guides me the rest of the way to the shower. He doesn&#39;t bother pulling off the rest of his clothes as he pushes me into the steaming water and I moan at the first contact of hot water on my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the water runs over me, Damion reaches behind me to grab a bar of soap. He hesitates for only a moment, eyes locked with mine as he drags the thick bar over my shoulders, my neck. He works it into a lather and rubs it down the the soft edges of my stomach, the curves of my hips. His body is so close to mine that I can feel him breathe. When he turns me around to get my back, the long line of his erection presses against my lower back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grabbing a bottle of oils for my hair, he works the rough tips of his fingers into my hair, my scalp. He&#39;s gentle around the still- healing wounds there as he rinses away the caked on blood. The feel of his hands gliding over my scalp, my body, is pure bliss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that bliss sends waves of need humming through me. That need becomes more and more persistent to the point of being almost painful. Impossible to ignore any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I spin around in his hold and press him into the side of the shower and stand up on the tips of my toes so I can press my lips into his. The feel of my now tight nipples sliding across the hard plains of his chest sends electricity through my body and I whimper into the kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spins us around so quickly, that I barely realized what&#39;s happened when he&#39;s suddenly pressing me into the stone side of the shower. His hands form a vice grip on my wrists, holding them above my head and he he drags his lips away from mine. He doesn&#39;t go far, though. We breathe in the steaming heat of the shower, catching our breathes with our lips only inches apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;*Lily*,&#34; he growls down at me, his voice a warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damion,&#34; I breathe back, matching my tone to his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We shouldn&#39;t,&#34; he says, &#34;What you need is *rest* so your body has time to heal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need rest,&#34; I say, my voice so throaty and breathless that I barely recognize it as my own, &#34;What I *need* is you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A growl vibrates through his chest, as he fights a battle within himself that we both know he won&#39;t win. Finally, his hands loosen on my wrists and I take it for what it is and lean into him. Our bodies slide against each other in slick disjointed movements as we deepen the kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fingers land on his chest while his own hands skim their way down the sides of my body. Lowering until they&#39;re right where I want them. Where I&#39;m aching for his touch. I take a staggering breath in as his fingers slide between my thighs. He strokes me lightly, pressing me harder against the wall. His touch is like fire and light- better than I even remember. How does it feel *so* good?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body flushes and arches in response to his stroking touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The intense pleasure builds much too quickly and before I know it, I cry out against his lips as I shatter on his fingers. Damion hums low in throat as he kisses up the side of my neck while I come down from my high. I feel him pull his hand away from my throbbing core, and when I&#39;m able to open my eyes, I see him bring those same fingers to his lips, his gorgeous eyes locked with mine. His chest rumbles at the taste of me as he sucks my pleasure from his fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight sends a white hot flash of heat through me again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then, still holding my gaze with the deep burgundy of his own, he pulls away from me and lowers to his knees. My chest heaves as he pauses, waiting for me to say no. And when I don&#39;t, he gently but firmly pushes my thighs apart. He lifts one of my legs over his shoulder, giving him better access to me. I grab onto the hard curves of his horns for support as he opens me up for him, parting my folds, his entire body taut like a bowstring against me. My heart nearly stops when he leans in close, breathing me in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every inch of my body flushes with heat. The flush only grows when he presses in even closer and flicks his tongue over the bundle of nerves there. His lips follow, brushing against my core as he says &#34;Fuck, you somehow taste even better than I remember. I don&#39;t know how that&#39;s possible, since that single memory was incredible enough that it&#39;s been keeping me up at night every day since then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tongue drags over me again and a cry escapes me. My hips jerk against him and my body trembles. His finger teases at my opening, and I cry out again as he slides that finger inside me, stretching me. His tongue moves faster, the pressure growing more intense as he drags me closer and closer to the edge. When he adds a second finger, stretching me even further, I lose control of my body as it rocks and writhes in desperation against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gods this is insane- the fire racing through my veins -it&#39;s all too much in the best way possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands fist and squeeze around the base of his horns to keep myself upright and a rasping groan rips from his throat. My eyes crack open at the sound and flick hazily down at where Damion is kneeling in front of me. Seeing that sharp gorgeous face at the apex of my thighs, his hands gripping me, his fingers filling me up. That single image tips me over the edge for a second time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a hoarse cry as I lose control again, my body clenching around his fingers as the waves of pleasure roll through me. The back of my head presses harder to the wall as I struggle to catch my breath. When I&#39;m steady enough on my feet, he gently lowers my leg from my shoulder to the shower floor before standing in front of me at his full height again.</p>
