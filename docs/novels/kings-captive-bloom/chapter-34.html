                <p>After Arden and Xavier drop me at the door of my room, I toss and turn in my bed all night. I&#39;m exhausted, but stare up at the ceiling, much too wired to sleep. I&#39;m so jittery that I eventually move to the bath, hoping that the heat will relax my muscles enough to lull me off to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at my reflection in the mirror as the tub filled, I look as frazzled as I feel, my eyes feverish, pale cheeks flushed. Stripping off my dirt streaked night gown, I can&#39;t help but think about how that dirt got there. It&#39;s like my mind can&#39;t stop from going to that moment again and again. Firmly pressed into Damion&#39;s marble hard chest, both of our heartbeats racing in unison like they were entwined in some frenzied dance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Get it together, Lily.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the tub close to full, I sink into the steaming water and let the heat drag me under. Grabbing one of the bottles of luxurious soaps lining the wall of the tub at random, I begin scrubbing the dirt from my feet and legs. If only I could scrub away the memories of how they got there just as easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s not as if I haven&#39;t kissed someone before. Done more than kiss, even. When I was younger, and a bit more daring, I&#39;d gotten caught up with one of the stable hands. Troy. He had been the first person I&#39;d met who didn&#39;t look at me like I was carrying the plague. I&#39;d taken his kindness and ran with it. Because when you don&#39;t have much experience with warmth, it&#39;s easy to mistake a brisk day for what you think is a midsummer afternoon. I&#39;d taken his kindness for something it wasn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My time with Troy hadn&#39;t lasted long. Once my father had caught wind of what was happening between us, he&#39;d shipped him across the kingdom over the course of a single night. For my own good, he&#39;d said. It had stung at the time, even though things could have never gone any further between the two of us, and I&#39;d known that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*What had happened tonight, though*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That wasn&#39;t a kiss, it was something else entirely. Something so consuming, and entirely new to me that it deserved to be called something else-deserved to have its own name. A branding of tongue and lips and teeth. Just thinking about it has my thighs clenching together heat rising to my cheeks again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ve never felt something like this for another person and I don&#39;t know what to do about it. Don&#39;t know what to make of it. I can&#39;t do anything about it, can I? There&#39;s no way that I can act on the irrational feelings I&#39;m having for a man that had me kidnapped and held hostage in his underground prison cells for days on end. It would be madnesswouldn&#39;t it? If only I could get my body on the same page as my brain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finish bathing, rinsing myself clean. Wrapped in a soft towel, I go searching for a clean night dress, and resign myself to the fact that I&#39;m not going to get any more sleep tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I must have nodded off sometime in the early hours of the morning because I groggily open my eyes to a fully-risen sun shining through the window. The book I had been reading is still clutched to my chest. Someone is knocking at the bedroom door and as it creaks open, Mitra steps in with her usual sure-footed shuffle, a tray of food in her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thank her as best as I can, but my brain is too foggy with exhaustion to remember how to say as much in the hand language I&#39;ve been learning from the book I borrowed from the library. She sets the tray down on the bed for me, making a quiet tsking noise under her breath at seeing my haggard state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I barely manage to keep myself to keep from flinching back in surprise when she presses the back of her cool palm against my forehead in a familiar gesture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think I have a fever,&#34; I say, my voice coming out as a tired croak, and I hurriedly clear my dry throat, &#34;Just overtired.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shoots me a look that&#39;s doesn&#39;t need words to explain, her skepticism rolling off of her in waves. Her expression has me chuckling under my breath, &#34;I&#39;m fine, really.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She waves me off with a hand, tittering around the room like a mother hen . I watch her dust the already spotless bookshelves before shuffling over to the armoire to reorganize the clothes in the closet before running off to go and get a tray of steaming ginger tea for me. I obediently drink it down, even though it strong enough that it burns my throat while Mitra watches over me like a hawk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever&#39;s in the ginger tea works a little, because while I&#39;m still exhausted, I feel like I&#39;ve perked up a little by the time that Xavier and Arden come by. They barge through the door without knocking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing still in bed?&#34; Xavier demands in his usual stern voice, looking over me critically, &#34;You weren&#39;t still sleeping, were you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Time to get going, Princess,&#34; Arden pulls open the shutters to let in more sunshine, &#34;we&#39;ve got places to be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; I can&#39;t hide the excitement I feel from bleeding into my voice, and begin shimmying out of the bed, &#34;Where are we going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The library needs help getting the books re-shelved after the storm last night and we got assigned to book duty,&#34; Arden tells me, &#34;We thought that since you have a thing for books you might want to come along.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Helping out in the library sounds like just what I need today. After the way I tossed and turned in bed all night, I need a distraction. Something to keep me from going around in the same mental circles as I&#39;ve been doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me get dressed really quick,&#34; I start to say, until I catch sight of Mitra&#39;s stern expression, &#34;I&#39;m only going to the library. I&#39;ll won&#39;t overwork myself, I promise.&#34; I say to the older woman, giving her my most winning smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She huffs, but turns back to the armoire to tug out a dress in a sunny shade of yellow and gestures to the two guards to step outside so she can help me dress. I don&#39;t bother trying to argue with her, just let her help me slip the dress on before settling me in a low chair to comb through my hair. She twists it into a smooth braid and clips it back with gemstone embedded hair clasps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With one last stringent expression from Mitra, I send as reassuring a smile as I can, my chest warming with her concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll come back if I get tired,&#34; I promise her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She simply waves me off and I hurry to the door where my guards are waiting.</p>
