                <p>On one of our afternoon tours of the markets in Elfhame with Xavier and Arden, our small group is approached by elder Aelrie. The female elf appears to float through the loose crowd, her head bobbing above the others with her usual graceful strides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grin up at her when I see her, &#34;Elder Aelrie!&#34; I call out to her in greeting, and a few surrounding elves glance over to me in shock before nodding quick bows to their elven elder, &#34;Did you change your mind about coming to buy some chocolate tarts with us?&#34; I joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mouth twitches at the edges into a smile, &#34;I wish that were the reason I&#39;m here. But, I came searching for you was because I need to deliver you some news we just received from beyond the wall.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*News from outside the wall?* My heart gives a heavy thump in my chest. Did we finally receive an update from Damion? Is he returning?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aelrie&#39;s typical serene expression smooths into something more serious than it had been when I&#39;d met with her at the pools earlier that morning, &#34;A small group of shifter soldiers delivered a missive at the gates addressed to the council of elders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it an update from the King?&#34; Xavier asks her, stepping forward to reach for the parchment she offers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is not from your king, but from his second, Captain Alfson,&#34; Aelrie informs us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My entire body stiffens, anxiety trickling through me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;From *Leif*?&#34; Arden asks, surprise coloring her voice, &#34;What did he have to say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside me, Xavier&#39;s eyes trail over the text, but my stomach is twisting itself into a knot and I&#39;m tense enough that I don&#39;t have it in me to attempt to read what it says over his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elf woman&#39;s eyes focus on to me, &#34;Captain Alfson was inquiring over how long we believed it would be until you are able to suspend your current sessions regaining your power.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands anxiously clench at the fabric of my robe, &#34;Why, has something happened? Is Damion-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your King is safe,&#34; Aelrie assures me with a soothing pat on my shoulder. Relief is a palpable thing, a long exhale collapses its way out from my lungs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*He&#39;s safe. He&#39;s safe. He&#39;s safe.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aelrie continues, &#34;From what the Captain explained in his letter, though, he believes that your King is under the effects of withdrawals within your Bond connection. He says that while your King refuses to risk your safety or health in any sense of the word and would rather you stay behind the wall until the attacks have withdrawn and he can come for you himself, the Captain thought it would be best to rely upon our expertise in the matter of your health.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xavier lets out a muted snort and Arden and I glance over at him in question, &#34;Leif is going behind the Commander&#39;s back to ask for the Princess&#39;s return to the mountain,&#34; he adds, explaining, &#34;The attacks are taking longer to resolve than was expected and the Commander is being stubborn about your safety.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arden echoes his reaction with a low whistle, rolling her eyes, &#34;Brave bastard,&#34; she snickers under her breath, &#34;The King&#39;s going to be pissed when he finds out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course I&#39;ll go,&#34; the words rush out of me without hesitation. Without a second thought. I look to Aelrie, &#34;I&#39;ve been spending time at the springs every day, and I&#39;ve been doing better than I ever have. There&#39;s no reason that Damion should suffer because of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aelrie nods once. Her expression remains smooth, but there&#39;s a glint of approval in her brown eyes, &#34;As the elder assigned to take point on getting your energy levels stabilized, and seeing the vast improvement you&#39;ve undergone these past two weeks, I have to agree with you. I don&#39;t believe your health is under any danger if you decide to make the journey back to your Bond partner. As long as you feel well enough and that&#39;s something you want to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course I want to go to him. The ache in my chest that I&#39;ve been feeling from the moment he left gives a throbbing jolt as if in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then it&#39;s decided,&#34; Xavier nods, refolding the parchment and handing it back to elder Aelrie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arden throws her arm over my shoulder excitement practically radiating from her, &#34;Let&#39;s go home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>__________________________________________________________</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Home.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though I hadn&#39;t spent much time in the Northern Mountains the shifters claimed as their home, the term feels more than right. There&#39;s a palpable electric feeling of excitement that buzzes through the air as we spend the next few days traveling by horseback through the trails that lead back to the castle in the mountain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elves had freely gifted us with supplies necessary for the journey and had found some non-elven riding clothes- so I could blend in with the people outside the wall should we be spotted - for me as a parting gift. The small group of shifters who had delivered the message from Leif had waited outside the gates for us and accompanied us as protection for the journey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The journey by horseback is the longest I&#39;ve ever done on my own - conscious anyway -and though the ride is long and rigorous, I don&#39;t mind it in the least. Breathing in the wild mountain air, I study the wooded scenery in awe, taking in everything like it&#39;s the first time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colors feel brighter, everything feels fresher and more alive, and as we ride I take stock of the surrounding animals I find that I can sense along the trails. The way I can sense the pulsing essence of the various plants and animals around me adds another layer to my enjoyment along the journey. Xavier and Arden watch my wide-eyed excitement and wonder with amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have more fun watching *you* see things than actually seeing them myself,&#34; Arden jokes one day as we stop for lunch. A few of the other soldiers had changed into their second animal forms to keep track of the surroundings, vigilant in their patrols, always on the lookout for Unseelie who may have snuck past the borders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t make fun of me,&#34; I roll my eyes, shoving her shoulder playfully. Even fully healed the way I am now, the shifter woman is still much more solidly built than I am and barely moves when I push into her which only makes her and Xavier laugh harder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not making fun of you,&#34; Arden chuckles, &#34;I guess I&#39;ve just been desensitized to most things, so it&#39;s been eyeopening to see it all from someone else&#39;s perspective.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keeps things exciting,&#34; Xavier agrees from his spot on a nearby stump as he goes back to sharpening one of his daggers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How much further do we have until we get there?&#34; I ask, changing the subject. My back pops as I reach over my head to stretch out the stiff muscles that have slowly been piling up from the long stints of riding we&#39;ve done over the past few days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xavier doesn&#39;t look up when he says, &#34;I imagine this will be our last stop. Maybe a few more hours max?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few more hours until I get to see Damion again. The prospect of being with him again sends my pulse skittering through my veins. Without being able to be connected to the power that had kept the worst of my withdrawals at bay, the aching in my chest had grown. But it was easier to ignore knowing that we were getting so close. That I&#39;d be able to see him today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My thoughts are cut off as a grating pulse of energy ripples up my spine. The sensation feels like something slowly waking up-a growing haze of old energy writhing its way from the soles of my boots past my shoulders. Goosebumps skitter up my arms, making my hairs stand on ends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lily?&#34; Arden asks, notices my sudden tension, &#34;You alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something feels off,&#34; I say slowly, and Xavier&#39;s attention shifts in my direction, &#34;I don&#39;t know, I can&#39;t explain it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the earth rumbles beneath us shuddering under the soles of my feet. Arden grabs hold of me as I lose my balance. With her other hand, she grips onto a tree to keep us both upright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What-&#34; I start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a storm!&#34; One of the patrolling shifters shouts, &#34;Take cover!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fucking hell,&#34; Xavier curses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another rolling groan of the forest&#39;s floor nearly brings me to my knees and there&#39;s a distant sound of someone screaming that has my blood turning to ice in my veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Earth Storm*.</p>
