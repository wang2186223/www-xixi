                <p>He flips us over until I&#39;m the one pressed into the mattress and he&#39;s the one hovering over me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Legs up,&#34; he demands. And I happily comply, throwing my thighs over his shoulders. I grab the back of my knees pulling them back to my chest, opening myself up for him. My calves bouncing on his muscular shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slowly begins to rock his hips, sliding in and out of me- starting in small slow grinds and working his way to longer deeper thrusts. Rocking into me over and over, making my pussy convulse and my brain go blank, my only coherent thought is that I hope he doesn&#39;t stop. *Oh, gods, don&#39;t stop.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers grip tightly to my hips, getting better leverage and it&#39;s the most gloriously satisfying feeling. I&#39;m barely able to remember how to breathe it&#39;s so good. And then that thick press of his knot presses against my center seeking access. That first heavy press reminds me how big he his- how massive his knot is and a single pulse of worry threads through me on if he&#39;ll *fit*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grins down at me wickedly, like he can read my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Relax for me, darling,&#34; he hums, voice rumbling through his chest, &#34;you can take it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I focus on doing what he says, on relaxing my inner walls - he waits until he feels my body relax beneath him, waits until I rock my hips in an urge for him to continue forward and then he does.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*It. Is. So. Much.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My inner walls stretch impossibly wide for him. Like he&#39;s permanently imprinting himself on my body, on me. I love it. I love every single thing about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at you. You&#39;re taking me so well,&#34; Damion groans, pressing all the way forward. I make a noise somewhere between a squeal and a sigh as his knot settles inside of me and seems to inflate even bigger, &#34;My good, sweet little Bond.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can feel him everywhere. I feel his knot, fusing us together. Despite the impossibility of it all, his massive size, he feels made for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long will we stay like this?&#34; I ask breathlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grins heatedly down at me, &#34;Hopefully a good long while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laugh a little but it quickly turns into a surprised moan as my movements make me shift on his knot. His jaw tightens as my pussy clenches around him tightly. I shift my hips slightly and just that small movement stimulates everything. And an orgasm I hadn&#39;t even felt coming tears through me. My back arches and a scream of pleasure rips up my throat as I ride out the stringing waves of pleasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion groans low in his throat as I clench around him, the walls of my core fluttering around him with aftershocks. &#34;*Too good. Too fucking perfect.*&#34; He says. His words have pussy pulsing around his cock, squeezing it in a death grip that has a groaning growl ripping up his throat. His fingers dig into my hips as his cock flexes and swells inside me, with his own pleasure. He shouts as he tumbles over the edge behind me, pouring into me with heated liquid again and again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he comes down from his own high, he scoops me up and flips us over again to where  his back is propped against the headboard, with me straddling his lap, my legs wrapped around his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, my gods,&#34; I pant into him, his hot chest pressed against mine as I try to breathe through it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It is so much sensation that it borders on overwhelming, and yet there&#39;s something missing. Because as wave after wave of pleasure rolls through me, I feel an ache in my neck and anoverwhelming desire to *bitten*. My body craving a slice of sharp to counterbalance the rolling waves of blissful pleasure racking through me. I claw at his chest, at the sheet beneath him, trying to ground myself. All of these orgasms are obviously making me not think clearly, messing with my head. Because that&#39;s*insane*, isn&#39;t it? Wanting to be bitten like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Except, for a moment, I wonder if it&#39;s a shared moment of insanity because I could have sworn that Damion&#39;s maroon shade of eyes are fixated on my neck before he scrunches them closed, holding his entire body still for a moment until he regains his composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*He felt it too, right?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As blissed out as I am, I don&#39;t worry as much about what his reaction will be to the madness of it all as I ask him, &#34;Why do I want you to bite me right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My sudden question makes his body tense under mine which sends off another wave of orgasms rippling through us and I barely suppress another scream of pleasure as  the waves of heat ripple through me again and again.  My toes curl as Damion now tenses beneath me for an entirely different reason.  I shudder uncontrollably as one peak rolls right into the next, my inner walls squeezing down on his knot until he curses as his pleasure takes him again. More heat spills into me as his head falls back against the back of the headboard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On a shuddering breath, he says in a low voice, his breath a warm brush against the shell of my ear, making me shiver, &#34;It&#39;s a shifter thing,&#34; he admits, &#34;Shifters bite their mates necks in a way to mark them from other shifters. To warn others off-  it&#39;s a physical marking that they&#39;re spoken for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My sweat slicked chest shudders against him as I try to catch my breath, &#34;A shifter thing, not just a berserker thing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His head tilts up and down against me in a nod, &#34;Every mated shifter pair feels the urge to bite and mark their mates, not just berserkers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, I&#39;m not crazy then,&#34; I say with a relieved laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not crazy at all,&#34; he says, voice rough, as his hands stroke a path down my sides, &#34;I just wasn&#39;t expecting you to feel those same urges, with you not being a shifter.&#34; His lips press to my neck in a kiss, working his way to my jaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to bite me, then, Damion?&#34; I ask breathlessly.</p>
