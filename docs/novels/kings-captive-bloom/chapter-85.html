                <p>Damion&#39;s eyes are fire and light- red and gold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You weren&#39;t kidding-&#34; Arden slurs to my sister, &#34;That was-*oh*&#34; Arden cuts herself off as she follows my gaze over to where Damion is standing in the doorway, &#34;Nice for you to join us, Commander.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion nods at her, not taking his eyes off me.The heated look in his eyes has a hoard of butterflies ricocheting through my veins. Hot insistent need blares to life in my lower stomach and a flush flares to life in my cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, I&#39;m able to find my voice, and I clear my now dry throat, &#34;I&#39;ll, uh, catch up with you guys later-&#34; I tell them as casually as I&#39;m able to. And I&#39;m met with a trio barely stifled, alcohol-infused, snickers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure, sure,&#34; Arden calls out to us, waving us away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>______________________________________</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With my hand firmly grasped in Damion&#39;s warm one, he leads me back up toward the now empty gardens. It&#39;s quiet and peaceful, the fae lights still strung up though much dimmer now, making it easier to make out the speckling array of stars overhead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t give myself much time to admire them though, the stifling heat from before still pounding through my veins. I lean up my toes and his lips crash into mine in a heated desperate kiss. I gasp as his tongue parts the seam of my lips and I stumble at the sudden intensity of his taste in my mouth. It&#39;s addictive and overpowering and purely *him*. His tongue strokes mine, and one of his hands lands on my hip as he steps closer, pressing against me as he deepens the kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fingers lift to the smooth fabric of his dress shirt and dig into him with my nails as he starts to walk me backward without pulling away until he sets me on the edge of one of the tables that had been brought up here. Still not breaking the kiss, he lifts me up my my hips until I&#39;m pressed firmly between both the table and Damion as he tastes and enjoys every inch of my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every part of me is hot as my heart pumps hard in my chest, my hands sliding further up his neck as I hang onto him desperately, pulling him even closer to me. My legs lifts up to wrap around his hips and I groan into his mouth when his erection meets my core, hitting me perfectly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever get over how incredible you taste,&#34; he growls against me, releasing my mouth long enough to drag his lips and tongue down the sensitive column of my throat. He leaves a trail of heat in his wake. I struggle for air, clinging to the strong line of his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever was on the table before crashes to the ground as he sweeps it off to give us enough room. My back presses back into the table as he sucks lightly on the skin above the curve of my breast that&#39;s peeking out above the line of my dress, making me desperate for even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;More,&#34; I tell him on a ragged gasp, &#34;I need more Damion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grins down me, his eyes blazing, reflecting the need for him I feel back at me,&#34;Demanding little thing, aren&#39;t you?&#34; He says, echoing one of the first things he had ever said to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grin, &#34;You like it, though,&#34; I say on a gasping breath as his hands move over the curve of my hips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I more than like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hips rock against his magical fingers as he works off the silk and lace of my undergarment, his mouth is a hot brand on mine and he swallows every sound I make.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Put your legs over my shoulders,&#34; he demands. And I happily comply, leaning further back in order to throw my thighs over him. I grab the back of my knees pulling them back to my chest, opening myself up for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He works off his belt buckle with nimble fingers and between one heartbeat and the next he&#39;s pressing the tip of his hot length at my entrance. He doesn&#39;t go slowly this time and I&#39;m glad that he&#39;s as desperate for me as I am for him. I gasp out as with a final press, his knot buries itself inside of me until I feel impossibly deliciously full.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gods, I missed this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shifts to the side just a little, still holding me up against him easily and his hand finds the apex of my thighs. I gasp at the contact, and he captures my lips again as he slowly strokes my clit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of these overwhelming sensations are too much and I cry out as I&#39;m shoved over the edge of euphoria where Damion quickly follows me. I never want this to end. Never want to be without him- this monstrous shifter who took me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion kisses his way up my neck as he comes down from his high.. Pleasure continues rolling through me, and I&#39;m lost to the sensation of it all for a while until there&#39;s a small break when I&#39;m finally able to open my eyes. The feeling rippling through me is light and long lasting. It&#39;s something I&#39;ve been feeling for a while, but staring up into Damion&#39;s steady gold eyes gives me the final push I needed to finally say it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you, Damion,&#34; I tell him on a rasping breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes widen, then deepen to something darker, shining a deep burnished gold. His voice is rough as he says, &#34;I&#39;ve loved you for longer that should be possible. I&#39;ve found something with you I never thought was possible for me. I was drawn to you from the moment you came barreling into my life, and that feeling has only grown by the day. I want to spend the rest of my days with you. &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart swells up, thudding wildly in my chest. And suddenly I know what the gold in his eyes means- the feeling behind it. *Love.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind goes blank for a moment as another wave of orgasms wrack their way through my body matched with Damion&#39;s own pleasure. I&#39;m brought back to the moment by that familiar insistent ache in my neck followed by that overwhelming desire to be *bitten*. My body craving a slice of sharp to counterbalance the rolling waves of blissful pleasure racking through me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s nothing I want more than a life with you too.&#34; I tilt my chin back to expose my neck to him, giving him full, unfettered access. My body, my heart, my love- it all belongs to him. Just as I know that all of him belongs to me, &#34;I told you I wasn&#39;t going to change my mind.&#34; I tell him with a smile, &#34;and I meant it. I want you. Always.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He levels me with heated golden eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no one else for me, Lily. Every part of me belongs to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leans in those last few inches between us. When the sharp tips of his canines pierce my skin, all I feel is bliss. Being here with him, wearing his mark on me, being bound to him in every sense of the word- I can&#39;t imagine anything better, anything more perfect. And for a time, we&#39;re lost in a world all our own. A world and a life that we&#39;ll now share.</p>
