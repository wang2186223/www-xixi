                <p>We had arrived home safely, Chad had woken up halfway through the plane ride and was already looking a little healthier, his wolf must be healing him. Allison was still sleeping, but Lena told me that the power she used today was something she wasn&#39;t used to, so it used up a lot of energy. We insisted on Chad going to the hospital, he argued about it for a little bit but eventually gave in. We brought Allison in as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chad was disharged by the end of the day but Allison but still sleeping. The doctors said her vitals looked normal, so they put her on an IV drip just to make sure she stays hydrated until she wakes up. Lena never left her side. I can see the love in her eyes that she holds for Allison. Allison always looked like a replica of her mother, so maybe Lena sees this as her chance to do things over, the way she wanted to do things with her daughter if her situation was different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had just checked on Allison, she was still sleeping and Lena was watching over her. Told me to go ahead and do anything that needed to be done, that she would mindlink me if anything changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had one thing I knew I wanted to do for quite some time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hey, where are you? I need to talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m just at the pack house, where are you, I can meet you?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ll come to you. I said through the link.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made my way from the hospital towards the pack house. Once entering I found Chad in the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Chad I have a proposition for you.&#34; I said</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you to be Alpha, share the title with me, I know it&#39;s unheard of but you deserve it. You took on this role no questions asked when I was at my lowest. You never once challenged me for my title, even though you definitely could have. I respect you. Pack decisions would be made together, along with Allison. If you find a mate, and Allison agrees, she can share the title of Luna with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chad stared at me speechless. &#34;Are you sure about this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, we will announce it to the pack when Allison wakes up. Speaking of, I&#39;m going to head back to her now. Catch ya later, Alpha.&#34; I teased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I genuinly meant it, it would split the workload in half, and I think the pack would benefit from this choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made my way back to the hospital and straight to Allisons&#39; room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing yet?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, nothing.&#34; Lena sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled the chair opposite Lena up to Allisons&#39; bed and got comfortable. Looks like we might be spending the night. I prayed she would be okay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allison POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up in an unfamiliar place, it was nighttime. I couldn&#39;t really see much. The last thing I could remember was passing out right as we were escaping that awful place, the worst possible time to pass out. I felt satisfaction knowing I had the pleasure of killing Summer and Dean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat up out of the bed I was in, it looked like a hospital bed. I had on a white hospital gown and an IV sticking out of my arm. I ripped the IV out and slid out of the bed, there was no one in the hospital, almost like it was abandoned. That&#39;s weird, normally there are night shift workers at most hospitals. I padded down the long corridor in my barefeet. It was eerily quiet in this place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I headed towards the front door, needing a breath of fresh air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon exiting the hospital I took a long deep breath in. The air was cool, but felt nice against my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked around the hospital parking lot, there was nothing and no one around. I recognized it now as the pack hospital, we made it home. I breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started to walk around, I haven&#39;t been here in years. I saw a small brown wolf in the distance by the edge of the woods, sitting there as if waiting for me to follow. Of course being curious, I followed. As soon as I got close, the wolf started to trot through the forest, slow enough that I could keep up in a jog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We traveled like that for what felt like forever, we came to a clearing and there was the beutiful stream I used to come read at as a teenager. I loved this place. Like a little safe haven. I then noticed the tall angelic woman standing before me. She had long  glowing white hair, she wore a long white-hooded cloak with gold flowers embroided on it. She had white eyes, and I knew exactly who she was. I have read about her many times. Selene, the moon goddess. The small brown wolf walked up to her and sat down beside her, wagging her tail. I then got a better look at the wolf, &#34;Aspen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded her head and then looked at the moon goddess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello my child.&#34; She said while petting Aspen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, what are you doing here, why is Aspen here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well my dear, the power that you and Aspen used was a lot, too much for you both to handle. There was a choice to be made, either you die and Aspen goes with you. Or, Aspen dies and you get to live. She sacrificed herself so you could live on. It was a very brave thing to do.&#34; Selene said looking down at Aspen with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh Aspen, I&#39;m so sorry.&#34; I had tears in my eyes, my poor wolf. She was always so good to me, we were two halves of the same whole. Aspen came running over to me licking my face while I giggled and pet her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She can no longer talk to you, but she will be safe with me. That I can promise. There is something else you must know.&#34; Selene then lifted her arm and waved her hand, I thought she was gesturing for me to come closer, but then I heard the sound of running coming from behind me. I turned around just in time to come face to face with a large white wolf, she had the most magnificent blue eyes. As if made of a ball of electricity. She was massive, standing taller than Aspen. Larger than any Alpha wolf I had ever remembered seeing. She then stuck her large tongue out and licked right up my face. Leaving a trail of slobber behind. Laughing and wiping my face, I turned back to the moon goddess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You still have a prochecy to fulfill. Bring all supernaturals together. It won&#39;t be easy. You will need strength. This is your new wolf, Eve, you have lots you must learn about her in order to take this challenge on. You will still hold your mate bond with Damon, even with the change of wolves. But there is one last thing you must know before I go. With your new wolf, comes the possibilty of a second mate. You can hold this mate bond with both Damon and the other person. Or you may break the bond with one. This decisions falls into your hands.&#34; It was information overload from Selene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aspen then gave me one last nudge and made her way back to Selene, where they both disapeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned back to Eve,&#34;I&#39;m Allison.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I need to enter into your mind, we must become one. It will hurt, and I am sorry in advance. Eve said into my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and braced myself for what was to come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then placed her paw on my foot and there was a bright light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt this excruciating pain course through my body, a fire being burnt along my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I screamed and my legs buckled as I tried to bear this pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost in an instant, the pain was gone and so was Eve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eve, are you there? Did it work?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, it worked. We must wake up now. Damon and your grandmother are very worried about you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wake up, I thought I was awake, how do I wake up?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moon goddess can only contact people in dreams, you must return to your body. The moment you touch it, you will wake up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I obeyed and made my way through the forest back to the pack hospital. I reached my room, and sure enough my sleeping body was still there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Touching my own hand, I felt a small tingling sensation, I sat up in my hospital bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon and who I assume must be my grandmother, judging by the familiar green eyes, were awake in an instant, worried expressions on their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll never believe what just happened.&#34; I said to them both, hell I could barely believe what happened.</p>
