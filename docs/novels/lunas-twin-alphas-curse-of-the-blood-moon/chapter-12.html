                <p>After Summer&#39;s little introduction, I was full of rage. My claws started to extend as I planned my attack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I know you want to kill me, but you must know. I&#39;m more powerful than you could ever imagine. Dean, why don&#39;t you come out my love?&#34; Summer said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hand came and grabbed the still kneeling Lena by the hair, pulling her to her feet as she whimpered in pain. He shoved her out of his way and threw her to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was tall and lean, but no where near the size that I was. He had raven black hair and black beady eyes. His aura felt evil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I growled at him, my eyes flickering to show Apollo at the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, now, calm down Mr. Alpha wolf. Dean, be a doll and taken him to the cell, I&#39;d like us to pay Allison a visit.&#34; She taunted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing there was a chance to save Allison if I didn&#39;t fight them, I instead stood there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s no fun, I was hoping for a sexy man on man fight or something insteresting. Dean drug him, I want to see Allison&#39;s face when she sees him being brought in there all helpless. See what she thinks of you then.&#34; She giggled at her own plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later I felt a prick and then darkness consumed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up and groaned, my head was throbbing. I wiped my eyes with the back of my hand as my eyes adjusted to the darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could smell Allison next to me, her delicous smell of lavender and fresh roses. She sat up and I watched with a smirk as she gawked at me. She raked her gorgeous green eyes slowly over my body and I was trying to control myself but my cock was instantly hard from her prescence. I too, took in her appearance. She was sexy in a little hot pink dress, her long brown hair looked disheveled but she pulled it off perfectly. Her perfect full lips, I wanted to kiss them and savour every inch of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed how much skinnier she looked, her skin a sickly pale, I had to fight to supress the growl that wanted to come out. That witch made her this way. She was still my beautiful mate, and I would be sure to give her anything she could ever want for, once I kill Summer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our eyes met, and together we proclaimed our mate bond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course that b*tch Summer had to ruin the perfect the moment with her prescence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allison started asking questions that I had anticipated, I answered every single one of them to the best of my abilities. I felt awful that she had no idea it had been 3 years. I couldn&#39;t imagine how she must be feeling. She looked happy when I told her about her Grandmother Lena, but then that emotion quickly turned to sadness and guilt when I told her what had happened to Chad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She told me about Summer toying with her mind, the fake sickness, the pills and the memory loss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had more questions about all of the new information, I growled when she mentioned Dean. I hated that f*cker just as much as I hated that witch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt guilty for being the reason she went into the pack house and I expressed that. She comforted me, and layed her head on my chest. It was the best feeling in the world, a feeling I never thought I would experience. Her scent wrapped around me like a warm blanket, it was a welcomed feeling. It felt perfect, I was on cloud nine feeling the sparks that came with her touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help get enough of her, I wrapped my arms around her tiny frame and lifted her so she was laying ontop of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to tell her how I truly felt, I waited years for this moment, and I couldn&#39;t wait any longer. She had to know. I confessed my love for her. I felt so vulnerable. Her forest green eyes met my own, I could get lost in those eyes. Her silence worried me, was it too soon for me to say that? Just as I was feeling a slight panic creep up on me, she said it back and all of my worries drifted away. I let out a sigh of relief and couldn&#39;t help but squeeze her a little tighter, I never wanted this moment to end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But of course, Summer enjoyed ruining the perfects moments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She appeared in our cell and I put Allison behind us, Apollo pushed to the surface, feeling protective of his mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reappeared right next to me, I tried to get to her, wanting to rip her throat our and be done with this. But I was stuck in place, I could hear Allison behind me yell at Summer as she too fought with invisible restraints. I felt the all too familiar prick of a needle in my neck. This b*tch really likes drugging people it seems. I felt the needle push the substance into my body, a few moments later, darkness started spotting my vision. I was no longer going to rip Summers throat out, no, I was going to torture her, make her feel the pain of every person she took from me and I wouldn&#39;t stop, no matter how much she would beg and pleade me too. I would do it until she died. A slow, painful, death. I felt myself losing consiousness and fell to the floor. Helpless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allison POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon had only been out for a few minutes before Summer reappeared, what was she a damn magician?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got up from my spot on the floor, and stood in front of him protectively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get away from him, you don&#39;t need him. Let him go and take me, you don&#39;t need him for your stupid ritual.&#34; I spat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need him at all, but I like to play games, and your little mate bond with him, will make for a very fun game.&#34; Sarcasm laced Summer&#39;s tone, a moment later I was thrown into an invisbile chair, my arms and legs strapped with invisble binds to the chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried breaking free but couldn&#39;t move a muscle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing, let me go!&#34; I yelled as I tried and failed once again at escaping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh I think you might enjoy what I&#39;m about to do.&#34; With that, she started walking towards Damon&#39;s resting body. I growled at her closeness to my mate and she laughed in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then knelt down beside him and started caressing up his body with her hand, starting at his thigh, making her way up his stomach, and to his neck. My marking spot. Then she grabbed his face in her hands, and kissed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop touching him you b*tch!!&#34; I yelled, feeling sick to my stomach that she was touching my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ooo someone&#39;s a little feisty, too bad theres nothing you can do about it. Now shush, I would like to concentrate.&#34; She flicked her wrist and I felt a bind around my mouth. I thrashed and tried screaming but it was hopeless, the more I moved the tighter they got.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In one swift motion she ripped his shirt, showing off his bare chest. That&#39;s when I saw it, he had a tattoo of a large A with green wolf eyes under it on his chest. I got butterflies from this, my mate was the sweetest man in the world. That feeling was quickly replaced with anger and disgust as I watched Summer kiss down his body. She then ripped his pants, he only had on boxers now, I could feel the rage coursing through my body in waves. I squeezed my eyes close, I couldn&#39;t stand to watch any longer, not being able to help Damon when he&#39;s in his drug induced state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where would the fun be in this if your eyes are closed? Open them or I kill him.&#34; Summer hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I obeyed and opened my eyes. She was taking her time, she looked right at me when she reacked for the top of his boxers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a blinding rage pass through me at this sight, a fire burning its way through my body, I had to get to my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I welcomed the burning sensation, I could feel it coursing through me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel the binds around my body loosing their grip, I stood up and in a second I was next to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;RELEASE HIM!&#34; I shouted, but it wasn&#39;t my voice. It was a strong voice. Like that of a goddess, angelic but powerful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grabbed Summers&#39; head in my hands and she tried fighting against me, chanting spells. But she was useless. I laughed as I crushed her skull, her blood spraying all over my face. I whipped her limp body against the wall. Shocked at the force behind my throw. I would be weak no longer. I knelt down to Damon. I noticed my entire body was glowing white. My pink dress, replaced with a long white dress, it had small pink flowers embroided on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;WAKE UP.&#34; I tried saying to Damon, but it came out in the powerful goddess voice again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes snapped open and he stared at me, shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Allison? You&#39;re...well you&#39;re glowing.&#34; He said as he took in my appearance, &#34;That dress is wow, you look amazing. Is that blood in your face? Are you okay?!&#34; He then noticed he had only boxers on,&#34;What the hell did I miss?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with the situation we were in, he still took a moment to appreciate my changes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;WE MUST GO NOW!&#34; I tried saying, but it was the same loud goddess voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon, shocked at my voice, nodded and obeyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked up to the cell bars, and they blew to pieces. Together we stepped over the rubble and towards the steel door, it flew off its hinges when we neared it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allison, you must hurry. I can&#39;t keep up with this rush of power Aspen weakly spoke into my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together Damon and I ran through the empty doorframe the steel door once occupied, it came into what looked like a cellar room, it had creaky wooden stairs and a cellar door. We pushed the door open, and found ourselves coming out of a bedroom floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then I saw Dean come through the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the f*ck did you do to Summer!&#34; He yelled as he held his heart, probably the pain of his mates death. I snickered at the thought. I wanted him to die the same way she did, just as that thought came to mind, his skull crushed down as if it was being compressed by something, his body then flung to the nearest wall. Damon and I were shocked, but didn&#39;t want to waste anytime so we continued our escape. We exited the bedroom and came into a small hallway, Damon seemed to recognize it, probably from when he first tried to rescue me, he grabbed my hand and led the way to what was left of a front door. I could feel the surge of power leaving my body, and a tiredness set in. I felt weak, and couldn&#39;t walk any farther. Like the power had completely drained my energy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon noticed my hand slip from his as I fell and was quick to catch me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Allison?&#34; He asked worry filled his tone. That was the last thing I remebered before sleep took me.</p>
