                <p>Three years ago</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today I turn 21 and have a chance to find my fated mate. I already have an idea of who it might be. My best friend Allison, who just so happens to be the Alpha and Lunas&#39; daughter. We have been best friends since she was born. My mom and dad, the betas&#39;, said that from the moment she was born I was already so protective of her that even though I was only 3 at the time, I growled at any doctor or nurse that tried to enter the room to check up on her. I wouldn&#39;t even let my own parents near her. That&#39;s how I have always been with her, fiercely protective. Growing up, I had to warn off every boy from her, making it clear that she was mine. Though she was clueless about all of this because I always did it from a distance. We started to grow apart the older we got. I was busy with my training to take over as Alpha of the Rivermoon Pack, which was made up of around 500 wolves. The second largest pack in the North America region. Allison and my parents knew from the start that we would be mates, so I was required to start my training early so that I could one day become a strong leader when Alpha Chase and Luna Rachel pass the title down to us. I started to get ready for my day, throwing on some gray sweatpants, some black runners and a gray v-neckshirt. I usually go for a jog every morning to keep up my physique. I was 6&#39;5&#34; and all muscle. With dirty blonde hair, light hazel eyes and sun-kissed skin, I wasn&#39;t too hard on the eyes, not to toot my own horn or anything. Grabbing my water bottle, I headed out of my room and down the stairs of the pack house. The pack house was mostly for ranked members of our pack but not exclusively. It was a large rustic-style log mansion. With 3 levels and 50 rooms. It was also where visiting allied pack members would come to stay, or injured members. Some people gather here for meals, but most people eat in their own homes, except if there is an important event happening. Going out the front door, the smell hit me; lavender and a hint of fresh roses. I started walking towards the large oak tree that she sat at to read a book and drink coffee every morning. Goddess, she looked absolutely breathtaking with her long brown hair and her short-curvy figure looked delicious in her shape-hugging, baby-blue dress. She won&#39;t know that we are mates until she turns 21. I wanted her to find out on her own. My wolf was trying to break free and run to his mate, but I managed to have an internal battle with him and keep him contained for now. 3 years and then she will know. 3 years and we can finally hold our mate. She must&#39;ve heard me approaching her because she started to peer up at me from over her book. Her gorgeous dark green eyes meeting mine, I was holding my breath trying to make sure I didn&#39;t just shout the word mate and take her that moment. I wanted it to be on her terms. It&#39;s going to be a long 3 years.</p>

                <p>Grace POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Present Day</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasping, I quickly pulled my hand away. It almost felt like a shock went through my body when we touched. Dean didn&#39;t seem surprised by this sensation. Maybe I was just imagining it. I looked away from him and tried to look out the window at the passing houses. I noticed Summer glancing at me in her side-view mirror smiling. Did she not notice my reaction to our hand shake? Why did she seem happy about it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We pulled up to our school, North-Manor College. It was a large, white brick building with 4 floors. It had a giant marble fountain in the middle of a large pond that was filled with goldfish and coi-fish. The school had green vines filled with pink flowers, crawling up every side of it. It was truly a sight. I wish I could take all of my classes outdoors just to enjoy this scenery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I jumped out of the car the second it stopped, not giving anyone the chance to say anything and not sparing them a second glance. Why did I get that feeling when I touched Dean? I couldn&#39;t have imagined it, it felt all too real. Pushing through the large oak doors, I tried to navigate my way to my first class, which was just an introductory course for all new students. The hallways were a lot more difficult to navigate through than I had originally planned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing my way through the herd of students all rushing to find their classes, I finally found a big banner that stated &#34;NEW STUDENTS&#34; with a large black arrow pointing to the left. Entering this room, I found that it was already full of students and I couldn&#39;t see a chair for myself. Trying to make myself as invisible as possible, I tried to walk up the steps against the wall to watch the class from the back. Looking at my boots on my way up the steps, hoping to draw little attention to myself. When I reached the top, I looked up just as I ran into a solid chest. An electric shockwave went through my body as he tried to keep me from falling. I quickly recovered and put some space between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, I wasn&#39;t watching where I was going. I&#39;m super clumsy&#34; I said, with a nervous laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean seemed distracted, his eyes were focused on the dress I was wearing. After what felt like an eternity he finally spoke, &#34;You should wear brighter colors. I think it would suit you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re the one to talk. You&#39;re eyes match your damn attire.&#34; I retorted sarcastically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t reply after that, just let out a soft chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, after an hour, the class was dismissed. The rest of the day went by easily and thankfully without running into Dean again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deciding I wanted to continue avoiding him, I opted for walking home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, as my luck would have it, the second I walked out of the school&#39;s oak doors, I ran into him. Again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I recovered faster this time, still not trusting the fact that everytime I touched him I felt the shock. There is no way I can imagine it 3 times in a row.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At this point, you are obviously running into me on purpose&#34; he all but laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated, I tried to walk around him without replying. He stuck his arm out to stop me and I stopped just to avoid touching him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34; I sighed, annoyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Relax, I just wanted to invite you to a party tonight. It&#39;s a welcome party for all new students.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not a party go-er, thanks anyways. I&#39;ll be heading out now&#34; I stated as I ducked quickly under his arm, successful with my escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Summer and Nate will be there. It&#39;s two doors down from your house, see you tonight!&#34; He shouted at my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said I&#39;m not....&#34; I started to turn around to reply but he was nowhere in sight. How the hell did he leave so fast? Clearly, someone is keeping up with their cardio.</p>
