                <p>I slowly backed away from the bar, I didn&#39;t want to chance Lucy finding out that I knew. I needed to come up with a plan. Even if I was able to escape the cell, how powerful was Lucy if I ran into her? She was centuries old, she had tons of experience on me. I have only just started using my magic. If I had to fight her, what if I ended up passing out again?</p>

                <p>What is it Eve?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We need to mate and mark Raidon. It will strengthen both of you, enough that, together and with my abilities, we might be able to escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Are you insane?! I am not marking and mating him, I just met him?! Damon will lose it if I come back marked and mated. How did you even know Raidon&#39;s name?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon will understand. Please trust me, Allison. I was sedated, but I could still hear the conversation with him. I could also hear your thoughts on his body, she snickered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I do trust you Eve, but this seems crazy. If we are so powerful, why can&#39;t we escape without mating him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We are strong, but Lucy is powerful and has had a lot of practice. We are strongest with our mates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How will I even pull off marking and mating him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We need Lucy to believe that you are agreeing to provide her with a child in return for your escape. It would be risky. The ritual she plans to perform will speed up the process of your pregnancy. You&#39;ll be pregnant for a day or two at most. So once you are marked and mated, you both need to work fast to escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m not ready to be pregnant Eve! Damon would reject me if I were to come home pregnant with another man&#39;s baby. I couldn&#39;t do that to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s just the thing, Allison, it wouldn&#39;t just be Raidon&#39;s baby. It would be Damon&#39;s too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What are you talking about?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You and Damon have already marked and mated, and he didn&#39;t exactly have a good pull out game afterwards. If this ritual is performed with Raidon, Damon&#39;s seed is still inside of you, the baby would be both of theirs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You&#39;re insane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A little, but this is the only way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This all felt like a bad idea, but I did trust Eve. So I would do what needed to be done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I was pondering what to do, I heard heavy footsteps coming towards me, along with the intoxicating smell of citrus and cedar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raidon approached my cell, our eyes clashing and in unison we both said &#34;MATE!&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that Eve was awake, I could recognize him as my mate. So he was telling the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen, Allison. I&#39;m sorry I stormed out of here. It was just a lot to take in. I brought you a sandwich..&#34; He handed the sandwich through the cell,. It seemed he already knew they weren&#39;t actually powered. I took it, grateful to have some food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thank you, I know how to get us out of here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What do you mean?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We will go through with the ritual, agree to provide her with a child to use. But if we mark and mate each other, we will be strong enough to escape her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know, she can read people well, Allison. She has this place heavily guarded. She only allows me to come here and back. Besides that, she has me in a cell across the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just trust me. Tell her we will perform the ritual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay, if you say so. I have to go now. I&#39;ll be seeing you soon Ali.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he walked away. I had an idea, but I would need to practice it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eve, if we turn invisible, can we turn others invisible too?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We can if we practice together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the next few hours, Eve and I practiced turning invisible. Careful not to get caught by Lucy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Eve had already mastered all of her powers, she explained that with each human counterpart she has, it is like relearning it all over again. The human and wolf parts need to move in sync when using these powers, otherwise they don&#39;t work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stopped practicing the moment we heard light footsteps making their way towards us. I stood next to the bars. Careful not to touch them, so she thought I was still under the impression that they would hurt me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard you were willing to perform the ritual?&#34; Lucy asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I am ready. I will do it in exchange for our freedom,&#34; I stated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Deal, let&#39;s get you ready then.&#34; She waved her hand and the cell door opened, the light around it turned off. I was not expecting to do this so soon. I could feel my confidence wavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitantly followed her, we walked down a hallway and reached a heavy wooden door. She waved it open. We entered a second area with one single cell. Raidon was in there. She waved his cell door open. He immediately got up and followed, giving me a quizzical look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She led us down a hallway that had large wooden doors down each side. She stopped at the last door and waved that one open. We followed her inside and it was a large bedroom. A king-sized bed in the center, large bookshelves covered the walls. There was a window but it had bars covering it, holding the same glow as my cell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled up a rocking chair from the corner and sat in it,&#34;Well, you two can get to work. I&#39;ll be here. Now, Raidon, you must plant your seed inside of her. There will be no marking. If either of you attempts it, I will kill you both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shit. We needed to mark each other, we both shared a look. This might not work after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you just going to watch us?&#34; I snapped, trying to figure out what we would do if we couldn&#39;t mark eachother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I need to make sure that the ritual starts the second he finishes, otherwise it won&#39;t work. I also need to make sure you don&#39;t mark each other.&#34; She leaned back in her chair, making it clear she wasn&#39;t going anywhere ,&#34;If you don&#39;t start in the next minute, I will kill him anyway. I don&#39;t actually need him alive for this, it&#39;s just more entertaining this way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panicked, I awkwardly climbed onto the bed, Raidon copying my every movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pull him close to me, my arms wrapping around his neck, my hands finding their way into his hair. Our eyes met, then his traveled to my lips. I leaned in, our lips clashing together, as sparks filled my body. A warm, tingling sensation in my lower belly as my panties became immediately wet. We kissed slowly and passionately. I reached for the buttons on his shirt, and started unbuttoning each one, taking my time. He brought his large hands to my waist, gently caressing my stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached for my shirt as his tongue found it&#39;s way inside of my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our tongues played together, while we stripped each other&#39;s shirts off. His body a mix of tattoos and muscles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached for his dress pants, I unbuttoned them and found the zipper pulling it down, I could already feel his bulge fighting to escape. It felt like it was just us in the room. I knew Lucy was there but it didn&#39;t matter in the moment, all I could see was him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I broke the kiss and quickly slid off my pajamas and panties. Leaving myself completely bare. My nipples were hard under his gaze. He too slipped off his pants and boxers, a giant erection springing free. I gulped at the size.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We embraced each other again. I played on the bed as he climbed over me. I looked down, a bead of pre-cum formed on his tip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lowered himself onto me, and looked at me. Waiting for permission, I nodded. Feeling nervous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lined himself up as he went in for another kiss. I could feel his tip touching my entrance. He took his time, and slowly pushed his large member into me. I could feel myself being stretched to the maximum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took in a sharp breath as he was in me completely. He didn&#39;t move for a moment, letting me adjust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Are you okay? He asked through the link.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, what are we going to do if we can&#39;t mark each other?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We will have to find another way, love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blushed at his nickname. He then started pumping into me, slowly at first. Then, picking up the pace, moans escaped me as I was hit with intense pleasure with every thrust he drove into me. I could hear grunts of satisfaction coming from him, he kissed me hard and sloppy on the lips. I returned the kiss, hungry for each other. I could feel the orgasm building within me. My core gripping him tighter, I felt a gush escape me as I came. I screamed his name as my nails dug into his back, my body shaking with pleasure as my back arched. He groaned and I felt him grow within me, his cum spilling inside of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could hear the witch clapping, clearly happy with the show. She then started chanting something in a foreign language. I gasped as I felt my stomach growing at a painful rate. Raidon was still inside of me. He too looked shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of a sudden, the door flew off of the hinges, shocking everyone in the room. We all froze just when the familiar scent hit me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon stormed into the room, growling, he looked ready to rip Raidon to pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS!&#34; Damon yelled. Shaking the entire room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A:N/ Hello readers, what do you think so far? Please show any support you can! Lots of love &lt;3</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Betrayal</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had woken up to Allison being ripped from my grip. I was up in a flash. I growled, warning off whoever dare disturb us. I could see the fear in Allison&#39;s eyes. But saw no one around her. I went to jump up from the bed but found myself being thrown by an invisible force. In an instant, the whole world turned black as I heard my mate scream my name. We couldn&#39;t catch a f*cking break, could we?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up to Lena shaking my shoulders violently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damon! Damon! Please wake up, someone&#39;s taken Allison!&#34; She pleaded to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I groaned and tried to sit up, but my entire body was on fire. I winced as the pain coursed through my body, defeated, I lay there. I felt so powerless. What kind of Alpha has his mate kidnipped twice?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chad, Allison has been taken. I need an immediate search party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>WHAT?! Yes, right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A search party will be organized. Could you do a locator spell?&#34; I asked Lena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I need something of hers. Now that I have a closer connection to her, it&#39;ll be easier to find her. Are you okay? What happened?&#34; She threw questions my way, with good reason. She just got Allison, and she was taken again right from under our noses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I honestly don&#39;t understand what happened. One moment we were sleeping, the next Allison was ripped out of bed, but the weird thing is, is that I couldn&#39;t see anyone. But I could tell from the fear in Allison&#39;s eyes that there was someone here. I tried to help her but I was thrown against the wall before I must have passed out. I don&#39;t know who or what took her, they didn&#39;t have a scent, or they are masking it somehow.&#34; I forced myself to get up, I held my breath as I tried not to scream in agony. My body truly felt horrible. What could throw someone of my size with such force and so easily at that? I put my hands on the floor and pushed myself up into a standing position. It was painful as all hell, but I needed to find Allison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No smell, threw you against the wall and you couldn&#39;t see them?&#34; She confirmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have a reveal spell, I might be able to uncover who is behind this.&#34; Lena then rushed out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to follow but found my body weak. I held onto the bed for support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena came back a moment later with a large book in her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sit down, I can heal you.&#34; I obeyed and sat on the bed. Welcoming the comfort that resting my body gave me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then pulled some kind of plant out of her pocket, and started to sprinkle it over my body. She then started chanting in a foreign language, and the plants along my body lit up. I felt my pain easing awake and noticed the plants shriveling and dying around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, my pain was completely gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, how did you do that?&#34; I inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not a healer, but I can put someone&#39;s pain into something else living, like those plants. You were in so much pain that they wilted and died. Now, I need something of Allison&#39;s, we will try the locator spell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got up as Lena grabbed some candles from around the room and placed them in a circle on the floor. I found one of Allison&#39;s favorite books on her dresser. She used to read this book over and over again. I handed it to Lena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took it and sat down, &#34;I will need one of your hands, you are connected to her too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I placed my hand in hers, and she placed her opposite hand on the book. Her swaying began as she chanted. The room getting windy, the furniture shaking as Lena shouted her chants. I looked at the wall, as if being played by a movie projector. An image appeared on it. It was Allison, in a cell again. She didn&#39;t look scared, she was holding her own, talking to a man and a small woman. The woman looked to be very old. I looked at Lena, but her eyes were completely white. I realized this image was being played through her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gasped and the entire room went completely still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it? Do you know where she is?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t believe my eyes, I was always told she was dead. This isn&#39;t good at all, no, no no, dammit&#34; Lena muttered to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lena, what is going on?&#34; I panicked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lucy Hunt, Lucy Hunt is still alive. She was supposed to have died decades ago.&#34; She sighed in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh shit, what are we going to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t waste any time, I got up from the bed and went straight to the pack boardroom, knowing that was where Chad would be organizing the search party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened up the door, the room was filled with warriors alongside Chad and Leroy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We know who took her, Leroy, I need you to look into any homes under the name Lucy Hunt. It&#39;s most likely not the cabin, so for now we will rule that place out. We are going to need more people. It&#39;s not going to be easy to get Allison back. We need to be strategic,&#34; I instructed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half an hour was spent organizing more people together. In total, we had 200 warriors prepped for battle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leroy had found multiple properties under Lucy&#39;s name, but the one that stuck out to me was the brick mansion-style house. Something about it was almost calling my name, like I was drawn to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is the place.&#34; I pointed to the mansion on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will have to scout the area first, figure out how many guards there are, what their shifts look like. What do you think, Damon?&#34; Chad asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you and I scout, the rest of the warriors stay close, but not so close that they can scent you all out. Chad, you and I are going to mask our smells. Let&#39;s move out.&#34; Chad and I led everyone out of the packhouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena was waiting outside for us,&#34;I want to go, but I wouldn&#39;t be able to live with myself if someone got killed while looking out for me. Now I have a potion for you and Chad. I overheard your plan. This will mask your scent entirely for an hour, it&#39;ll kick in the moment you drink it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed with relief, thankful I didn&#39;t have to argue with her to convince her to stay. Chad took the bottle and placed it into his bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you Lena, I promise we will get her back.&#34; I genuinely meant it, I would do anything to get Allison back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do me another favor and kill that b*tch Lucy while you&#39;re at it.&#34; She snarled, angry that her granddaughter was taken again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckled, I could see where Allison got her sassy side from,&#34;Of course,&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that we were off, we decided to travel in wolf form to get there faster. The warriors all ran half a mile behind Chad and I.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After an hour of running, we knew we were getting close. Chad and I shifted and I sent out a mind-link to all the warriors that traveled with us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stop here, stay alert and wait for direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chad and I both shifted into our human form, retrieving our clothes from his bag. Then we both drank out of the potion bottle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sniffed the air, making sure it worked. I couldn&#39;t scent Chad at all, just as Lena said, it had kicked in instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both walked quietly towards the large bushes that surrounded the entire property. We walked into the bushes, being sure not to make a sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stood at the edge of the bush. We could see the mansion clearly from this point. We watched as guards walked around the outside of the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After watching for 45 minutes, we picked up on their routine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards switched positions every 15 minutes on the dot. There were ten guards out front, ten out back, and 3 on each side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our biggest mystery was how many guards awaited us inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I want to keep this as quiet as possible. We have no idea how many are inside, but we can say for sure how many are outside. I want to take them out with bows. We need to move fast because they will smell everyone. We need ten archers out front, ten out back and three on each side. I want two warriors per archer to protect them while they take out their targets. The moment you take out the outdoor guards, I want all the warriors surrounding the house. Chad and I are going inside. When I send the all clear, I want twenty warriors to enter the house, you will travel in form as one. Let&#39;s move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We came prepared, every warrior had brought a bag with the weapon they did best with. We had archers, we had some that could fight with swords, and others that brought snipers. We wanted to be as quiet as possible, so right now archers were our most silent choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chad and I moved undetected across the lawn, hiding behind the decorative bushes as we moved. Taking advantage of our last fifteen minutes of being scentless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We waited behind a large fountain while the archers took out the outdoor guards, not wanting to give them a chance to signal others that there was a threat. We entered the mansion, and it seemed empty, except for the smell of my mate. I couldn&#39;t help myself. I started to run, following her delicious smell. I didn&#39;t care who was in my way, I would kill them instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could hear Chad close on my heels. I stopped dead in my tracks, I heard a scream, Allison&#39;s scream. I took off, running at wolf speed. I stopped at the door where her scent was strongest. I kicked it straight off of the hinges.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stormed into the room and what I saw next shocked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allison, with another man inside of her. All I could see was red, I wanted to rip that f*cker to shreds. I was so angry I didn&#39;t even notice the witch in the room, she looked just as shocked to see me. I yelled. I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just when I didn&#39;t think it could get any worse, Allison marked him and he began to mark her. Before he could finish marking her, I ran to them. I ripped him off of her. How could she do this to me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gripped his throat tightly, ready to break his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard a choking sound coming from the bed. I dropped the man immediately. The witch had Allison with a knife to her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Make another move and I will kill her.&#34; She pushed the knife into her neck, enough to draw blood to prove her point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allison looked at me with guilty eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I will explain everything once we get out of here. Don&#39;t kill him Damon, please trust me. I love you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allison pleaded into my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted so badly to leave her here with this man, but I would never. I loved her no matter what. This cut deep but I would never leave my Allison in danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A:N/ Hello readers, going to start updating every other night.
