                <p>Allison POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up the next morning still wrapped up in Damon&#39;s arms. I was about to pee my pants so I tried wriggling out of his grip, only for him to groan and hold me tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damon, please! I need to pee!&#34; I giggled, he groaned again and released me. I got up and rushed to the bathroom, still naked from the night before. My body felt like it was on fire. My muscles were sore, and my lady bits felt like they were about to fall apart. I finished peeing and opted for a quick shower. I smelt like sweat and sex from last night. The mark on my neck burned ever so slightly, but it filled my heart with pride and joy to carry my mate&#39;s mark on my neck. Eve was awake, purring in my mind, content with being marked. I stepped into the shower once the water was nice and hot. I let the water fall down my body as I stood there in my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eve, what else do I need to learn about you?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being the very first wolf, I am powerful. But you are a descendant of the first witch-werewolf hybrid, making you powerful too. The moon goddess believes that us being paired together creates an unstoppable creature. One that can bring all supernaturals together, and if anyone is brave enough to question us, we have the strength to prove them wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What are your gifts?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, with me being your wolf, they are our gifts. I have the ability to do many things. Things that I have learnt from the many people I have accompanied as their wolf. You have the ability to move objects and people with your mind. You crushed the skull of Dean and threw his body like it weighed nothing, you didn&#39;t even have to lay a hand on him. I can read minds, and can control minds. We can shapeshift, be someone or something else. We can become invisible. There are many other things that are my gifts that are now yours too. But first, you have to figure out how to control your magic, practice it so that it doesn&#39;t make you pass out when you use it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wow, that&#39;s a lot of things we can do. There&#39;s more?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, much more actually. But you will learn about it in time. We need to share our first shift together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay, I&#39;ll shower and see if Damon wants to go for a run, then you can meet his wolf Apollo!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finished talking with Eve for now. There was a lot of information to take in. The amount of things she said she could do was crazy. How can a wolf hold so much power? I knew she was the first wolf and all, but still. It seems like so much power for one being to have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was excited about mastering my magic, and learning more about Eve. Something about her brought me more confidence. I noticed the changes in myself too. I looked healthy, my body filled out, my hair no longer looked dull, and my eyes were bright, full of life. I didn&#39;t look sick anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of these changes in such a short period of time, it was phenominal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I poured some shampoo into my hand and started scrubbing my hair, I then heard the shower curtain open and close behind me, two large-muscled arms wrapped around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What, no invite?&#34; Damon laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you were sleeping, I had to wash myself. I smell like sex and sweat.&#34; I giggled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely nothing wrong with that smell, I thought you smelt delicious.&#34; Damon tucked his head down to my neck and a ruble of satisfaction came from his chest at the sight of his mark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There is when we are living with my grandmother, I don&#39;t think she wants to know what about what we are doing in here!&#34; I turned around to face him. Just the sight of him in all of his naked glory had my p*ssy getting slick, ready for him to take me again, sore or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Woman, I can smell your arousal. Your grandmother knows exactly what happened here last night. You weren&#39;t exactly subtle when you screamed my name last night. Hell, I think the whole pack heard you. Not that I&#39;m complaining. I loved every moment of it. I love you.&#34; Damon said as he used his large hands to massage the shampoo on my scalp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help the moan that left my lips, it felt so damn good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He growled as he spun me around in one swift motion, pressing the front of my body against the cold tiles of the shower, my back facing him. He grabbed both of my wrists in one hand and held them behind my back, the other hand grabbed a handful of my hair as he rubbed his thick c*ck against my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;F*ck Allison, keep making sounds like that and we might never leave this shower.&#34; Damon said in a raspy, lust-filled tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I loved the effect I had on him. Hell, he had the same effect on me. I wanted to get him back for his teasing last night, I pushed my butt up firmly against his throbbing c*ck,&#34;Damon.&#34; I moaned, knowing damn well what I was doing to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled my hair back towards him, causing my back to arch. My neck was against his lips. His breathing got ragged the more turned on he got.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt his fangs gently touch his mark on my neck, before slowly sinking into it. He then lined himself up at my entrance and thrust his big c*ck all of the way into me in one movement, shoving it as deep as he could into my core. A gasp of both shock and pleasure left my mouth. He pulled his fangs out and licked at his marking spot, before pulling out and thrusting into me again, harder this time. He let go of my wrists and hair, as he pulled almost all of the way out again. I thought he had changed his mind about shower sex, but he then grabbed me by my hips, and thrust into me again, each time harder and faster. He started pumping in and out of me, hitting all of the sweet spots within my body. Just when I thought I was going to reach my climax, he stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I groaned in annoyance, but then his one hand reached around my front, his fingers finding my clit immediately. He started tracing circles on my clit, while he continued pumping in and out of me at a rough but pleasurable pace. I could feel the knot building in my lower belly, my moans turned into screams as I came undone around his c*ck. Clenching and unclenching as I sprayed my juices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt his c*ck pulsate as he released inside of me with a groan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled out of me, the familiar ache returning to my body. I tried to stand but my legs were still shaking violently from my orgasm. Damon noticed this and laughed as he picked me up bridal style, he washed the remaining shampoo from my hair and stepped out of the shower. He gently played me back in bed and wrapped me back up in his arms. The run together could wait, this moment together felt so perfect, and my body felt so sore. I could hear Damon already snoring with no idea how he is able to fall asleep so fast. I decided to try and join him. Some rest might help my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A:N/ Hello, what do you think so far? Apologies for the short chapter today. Will try to write two tomorrow. Thank you for your support &lt;3</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Changes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allison POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up and took in my surroundings. I was still in my bedroom, but the bed beside me was cold and empty. Where had Damon gone? I decided it was time for me to get up anyway. I wanted to start practicing my magic, and learn more about Eve. I also promised her a run earlier before Damon and I got preoccupied. Maybe even start training with the warriors. I refused to ever be helpless again, I wanted to be able to defend myself. Defend the people most important to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got up out of bed, my body was killing me. Everything ached and felt sore. I went to my closet and grabbed a baby blue sundress. It ended just above my knees, easy enough to strip off for a run, and easy to move around in to practice my magic. I then exited my room and walked down the stairs towards the kitchen in the pack house, I was starving after all of the action between Damon and I.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened the fridge and found some leftover spaghetti. I was too hungry and impatient to heat it up, so I scarfed down the whole container of the cold spaghetti.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put my dishes in the sink and made my way towards the front door. I checked the clock on the wall and it read 4:05 pm. Wow, I sure slept a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I exited the house and made my way to the old oak tree. I used to love reading here. It was always so peaceful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked past the tree and towards the edge of the forest, I slipped my dress off and placed it beside one of the trees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ready Eve? I asked into my mind. I received a howl of excitement in response. Before I knew it, I was shifting into Eve for the first time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had shifted into Aspen many times before I was kidnapped, so I was familiar with the slight pain that came with it. But shifting into Eve, I was hit with a surge of power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shift was completed quickly and there stood Eve. She started running through the forest, no particular direction in mind. Just excited to be out of my body, she drove her nose into a mud puddle before rolling in it. She then kept running around, chasing squirrels and birds. She came up to the familiar stream where I had first met her and Selene. She stopped for a drink and I couldn&#39;t help but burst out laughing at our reflection. Her beautiful white fur was caked in mud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eve!! Look at us. I laughed at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was having fun. She chortled back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then jumped into the cool water of the stream, she paddled around before coming out again, vigorously shaking out her wet fur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allison! Where are you?! I heard Damon yell down the mindlink, he sounded angry. I realized I should have told him about my plans to go for a run, or invite him like I intended to earlier. I had just forgotten, I was so excited to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m coming, I&#39;m sorry. Eve and I went for a run.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We started heading back towards the pack house, I could feel Damon&#39;s angry aura the closer I got, nervousness creeping up on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was just about to get my dress when I saw him standing there holding it in his hands. Sniffing it as if it&#39;s the only thing keeping him sane. He noticed me right away, Eve gave me control back and we shifted into human form. I jogged the rest of the way to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell were you thinking running off like that and not telling anyone?! Lena and I were worried sick about you. We just got you back, Allison, and the first thing you do is take off.&#34; He yelled, he was mad, but I could also see the fear in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry Damon, I didn&#39;t mean to worry you both. I was excited about shifting into Eve for the first time, I&#39;m excited to be home. I forgot to tell anyone what I was doing. It won&#39;t happen again.&#34; Guilt filled my body. I felt awful for causing Damon and Grandma to worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just get dressed. Lena is waiting for us in the packhouse.&#34; He tossed my dress at me and started to walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I caught it and slipped it on before following.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The walk to the packhouse was quiet between us, before I broke the silence,&#34;So what happened with Chad. I thought you saw him die?&#39;&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed,&#34;I thought I did too. It turns out it was another one of Summer&#39;s tricks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, well I&#39;m glad he is okay.&#34; He didn&#39;t say anything after that. I took the hint and walked the rest of the way without saying anything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked through the doors of the pack house, holding it open for me. Grandma was sitting at the kitchen island.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank goodness you are alright. It gave us quite a scare young lady. Let someone know next time please.&#34; Grandma waved her finger at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry grams, won&#39;t happen again.&#34; I looked down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, I have two things I need to get off of my chest. The first is, I will take you up on your offer, Damon. I would like a house near the pack house. I heard some things I really did not want to last night, involving you two,&#34;She pointed between the two of us,&#34;Now I know that&#39;s to be expected with mates, but it doesn&#39;t mean I need to hear it. Secondly, Selene paid me a visit. She said we are running out of time to bring all supernaturals together. She said a war is coming if we do not act fast, so we need to practice your magic. She also said there is a lot for you to learn from Eve.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A war? I can&#39;t let this happen. I didn&#39;t know where to begin in my attempt to bring all supernaturals together in an alliance, but I had to, I would feel completely at fault if a war happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will start practicing my magic with you grams, and Eve told me some of her abilities, so we can practice those too. I thought I should also start training with the warriors. I need to be stronger. I can&#39;t pull this off if I am weak,&#34; I stated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon growled,&#34;You are not training with the warriors, they fight dirty, they have to. It&#39;s how they build strength and maintain quick reflexes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I placed a hand on my hip,&#34;Damon, I wasn&#39;t asking you. I am training, I need this. I will not feel helpless ever again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Allison, I will train you. I would feel much better if I did it.&#34; He said, his tone turning gentle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No Damon, I know you will take it easy on me. I really appreciate your offer but I need someone to be hard on me. It&#39;s the only way I will learn to properly defend myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, why don&#39;t we sleep on this and come back to it in the morning,&#34; Grams said as she clapped her hands together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and headed up to my room. I could hear Damon following close on my heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s not that I was trying to be unreasonable with him, it&#39;s just that I wanted to be prepared for anything. I love Damon, but I know he won&#39;t take me down or surprise attack me the way the warriors do. I felt guilty denying his offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I entered my room, Damon followed behind me. I could see in his eyes that he was annoyed, but I didn&#39;r have the energy to argue, the run with Eve tired me out more than I expected it to. But I guess that might be because I hadn&#39;t shifted in the past three years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we please rest and talk about this in the morning? I am tired.&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ran his fingers through his hair, wanting to talk more but conflicted on whether he should or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then stripped himself down to his boxers and climbed into bed. I stripped off my dress and crawled in next to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held me close to him as I could hear his heart rate slow as he fell asleep. It didn&#39;t take long before I too drifted off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up with a start, feeling sweaty. I got up to splash my face with some cool water. It didn&#39;t help so I threw on a bathrobe and headed down to the kitchen. Maybe a snack and a drink of juice would help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was about to reach into the pantry when I could hear a voice calling me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allison, I&#39;m outside</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice said into my head, I knew who it was right away, so I walked to the front door and opened it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Selene, what are you doing here? I guess I&#39;m dreaming right now?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes my dear, I have limited time. Remember when I told you that you would be gifted a second mate?&#34; She asked in her angelic voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you that you could choose to keep both or reject one or the other. But I&#39;m afraid those circumstances have changed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you talking about, I&#39;m not going to reject Damon if that&#39;s where this is going. I love him.&#34; I stated in a no-nonsense tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, no, my dear. You will not be forced to reject Damon. Quite the opposite actually. You must accept both Damon and your second mate. They will both be your mates, together.&#34; Her glowing white eyes bore into mine as I processed this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why must I accept this second mate? What if he is awful?&#34; I questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Having two mates will strengthen you and your wolf. I can&#39;t go into detail but you will require this strength to bring all supernaturals together, I had a vision of what would happen if you went into this with only one mate. It did not end well. But the vision where you have both mates at your side, has a happy ending. I want you to be able to succeed Allison. If you pull this off, it could be the end of war between all kinds. Peace, after centuries of war. It&#39;s for the greater good. I must go now, trust Eve, trust in your grandma and your mates. Goodbye child.&#34; She touched my cheek before disappearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran up the stairs back to my sleeping body. I had to tell Damon right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went back into my body and shook Damon awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Allison, are you okay?&#34; He asked, rubbing sleep from his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Selene just visited me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I explained everything to him that she told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He roared,&#34;I will not share you with another man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damon, you have to understand, I don&#39;t know what the consequences are if I go against Selene. I trust her.&#34; I pleaded with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is ridiculous, you&#39;re okay with having a second man?&#34; I could feel his anger coming off of him in waves, How dare he assume I was okay with this? I had no say in it, I am doing it to help bring peace to all kinds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel the anger bubbling in my body, I felt like I was on fire. The anger was spiraling out of control. It felt like there was wind picking up in my room. It started shaking the angrier I felt. Damon looked up at me,&#34;Allison, it&#39;s okay. I&#39;m sorry. Please, come here. We will sleep it off and talk more tomorrow. I shouldn&#39;t have gotten so worked up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His apology started to calm the wildfire burning within me. The wind in the room and shaking came to a halt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked up to Damon once, I felt calm and breathed in his scent to maintain this calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Allison, I think we should talk to Lena.&#34; Damon whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why, what&#39;s wrong? I&#39;m sorry, my emotions just got the best of me, and I need to practice my magic more.&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go look in the mirror, Allison.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon was acting really weird so I walked over to the bathroom mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holy sh*t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hair was completely white, glowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes a piercing blue. What was going on with me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We are merging into one, Allison. Eve spoke into my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Come to think of it, the white hair, the blue eyes. It was just like Eve&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A:N/ Hello lovely readers, what do you think so far? Please show your support in any way you can! Lots of love &lt;3</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Strangled</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allison POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My own appearance was becoming that of my wolf. I ran out of the bathroom and looked at Damon, he seemed just about as confused about it as I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eve said we are merging as one. She is a white wolf with blue eyes. What does this mean, Damon?&#34; I gulped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I really don&#39;t know Allison, we should go see your grandmother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both quickly put on our clothes we were wearing earlier and made our way to grams room. She was still staying in the Alpha and Luna&#39;s room until her house was ready for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knocked on the door and she answered right away, not at all shocked by my new appearance ,&#34;Selene told me you would be paying a visit tonight.&#34; She said as she gestured for us to follow her. We all took a seat on the large kingsized bed. I looked at her expectantly, hoping for some answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did Eve tell you much about these changes?&#34; Grams asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, she just said we are merging into one,&#34; I muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My dear, Eve is a very special wolf. I believe she told you about some of her gifts. With her being the very first wolf, she has lived a long life, she holds great power. But all good things must eventually come to an end. The moon goddess tied your lives together. You will be the last life that Eve is apart of. With this merge between the two of you, when you die she will too, but she will not come back as another&#39;s wolf. She will be gone for good. You will both travel to the afterlife together. But, that is not for a long time yet. You are still young, my dear. You and Eve will live a full life together. Eve was supposed to travel to the afterlife with her last human counterpart, but the moon goddess saw the future, and knew that Eve is the only wolf powerful enough to pull off what is to come.&#34; She paused before continuing,&#34;I believe Selene has already filled you in on the mate bond?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low rumble came from beside me where Damon was. I knew how he felt about this second mate bond. But it was our reality, we needed to be open and talk about it. I didn&#39;t even know who this second mate was supposed to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, she told me I must accept both mates. Having both mates by my side will give me the strength I need to do this, along with basically transforming into Eve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, you must accept this second mate bond, just as you have accepted Damon. Selene told me she saw you and Damon die at the hands of an old warlock, but in her second vision with both mates by your side, you were able to make him submit to you.&#34; Grams stated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can protect her, we know about this warlock now. Tell me what he looks like, I&#39;ll kill him on sight!&#34; He grumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, now Damon. What would be the point of trying to bring peace to all kinds if you kill this warlock? People will see you as a threat, and therefore Allison as a threat. Everything would go to sh*t and you two would die at the hands of everyone who believed you would make a difference and end the war.&#34; She said in a no-nonsense tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damon, Grams is right. I&#39;m not saying I want a second mate, because to be quite honest, I don&#39;t. I love you with all of my heart. I just got you, but this is for the greater good. I would never forgive myself if you died because I chose not to accept this second mate. I want peace for all kinds. I want us to live our happy ever after. Who knows, maybe once this is all said and done, this second mate will decide to reject me and move on with their life. We have no idea what will happen. But what we do know is right now, we need all of the help we can get. We need to find whoever this mate is,&#34; I insisted. I could understand where Damon was coming from, I knew why he was upset about this. A mate&#39;s natural instinct is to be possessive over their mate. But I hoped that he could see the bigger picture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well you two, I need to get some sleep. I am old and I am damn tired. So, whatever you two need to sort out, it&#39;ll have to be in your own room. Goodnight my dears.&#34; She ruffled the hair on both of our heads and lay down in bed. We both got up. I could feel how tense Damon was next to me, but he respected Grandma&#39;s wishes and kept it to himself. We both said goodnight to Grandma, and made our way to my bedroom. Once in, Damon sighed before saying,&#34;I don&#39;t like it, but I understand why it must be done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could understand how hard that must have been for him to agree to, so without adding anything, I closed the gap between us and wrapped his large frame in a hug. Going up on my tiptoes, then tucking my nose into his neck, breathing in his scent really helped calm my nerves about this whole situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you so much Damon.&#34; I whispered into his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gently picked me up, I wrapped my legs around him and he lay me on the bed. His entire massive body covering my small build.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lifted his head and his brilliant hazel eyes met with my now electric blue eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you Allison.&#34; He placed a gentle peck on my lips and rolled off of me to lay beside me. He pulled me on top of him and started gently stroking my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fell asleep in his embrace with the feeling of him playing with my hair. I felt safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a cold hand grip my arm and roughly yank me from my mate. Damon woke up in an instant and growled. I whipped my head each way trying to see who grabbed me, but saw nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon went to jump up from the bed, his body was then thrown violently against the wall. His arms and legs twisted in the wrong directions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;DAMON!!!&#34; I yelled. I tried to fight the cold grip holding me in place but found it getting stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That will be enough out of you, Allison.&#34; It was an old voice that spoke, rough, but sounded like a woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34; I said. I hoped one of my powers would surface. I needed to get to my mate. I tried focusing on this stranger being thrown against the wall. I put every last ounce of thought into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have nothing on me, I have been mastering the craft of magic for centuries. You will not be able to kill me.&#34; The voice cackled, this time right next to my ear. I turned my head and was met with what felt like a brick wall to the face. I gasped, I could feel the familiar flame rising up my body, I could feel myself heating up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see introductions will have to wait then. Hold still, this will only hurt for a second,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt my airways crushed, as if someone was strangling me. I gasped and grabbed at my neck but no hands were there, I was trying to get any small breath I could into my body, but they were crushed tightly. No air getting in or out. I could feel the darkness creeping in, &#34;I could have just spelled you to sleep but this was much more fun&#34; Came the voice right before I passed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A:N/Hello readers, hope you are enjoying so far. Sorry I missed the update last night and night before, my children and I have been under the weather lately.
