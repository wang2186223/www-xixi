                <p>Since my birthday, three years ago today. The day that I lost the people I loved most. I have vowed to find her,  my Allison, my mate. By now she would be old enough to recognize me as her mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For 3 years, I searched high and low for her. The only shred of hope I held of her being alive was picking up her scent that day by the stream. It was faint, but I will never forget it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had been officially sworn in to take over as Alpha of the Rivermoon Pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But with my wolf, Apollo, constantly pacing in my mind, restless without his mate, I had to appoint my Beta and childhood best friend, Chad, to lead the pack for now while I searched for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know how selfish it is of me to put her before the pack. As an Alpha, you are always supposed to put the pack first, no matter what. But without her, I would never feel like a true leader.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t even sleep in the designated Alpha and Luna room. I sleep in her bedroom, her scent isn&#39;t there anymore after all of these years, it is just my own scent that coats her things. Her bedroom was the only room left untouched in the fire, the packhouse was rebuilt exactly the same as per my request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it is still her space and that&#39;s enough for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at the large wall clock, I see that it was already noon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I must&#39;ve slept through the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before this happened, I used to be awake at 5am every morning to start my workout and training.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, I barely crawl out of bed at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I used to have a drive like no other, a drive to do better, to be better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A drive to be faster, stronger, smarter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, without my sweet Allison, I am nothing but a shell of a man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have failed everyone in my pack, I have failed my parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have failed the late Alpha and Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worst of all, I have failed my mate, the one person that you are destined to love and protect forever. I failed her before she even had the chance to know what I truly was to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling the covers off, and dragging myself out of her bed. I made my way to her ensuite bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking in my appearance, really looking at myself in the mirror for the first time in years. I am shocked at what I saw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m not as bulky and strong as I used to be. My once bright hazel eyes that would shine with pride and happiness are dull and lifeless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My skin looked pale, not the usual sun-kissed shade. My hair was greasy and disheveled. My face looked hollow and sick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t recognize the person staring back at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They say a wolf that isn&#39;t around their mate for a period of time starts to decay and go crazy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This couldn&#39;t be more true. My wolf hadn&#39;t come out of my mind in years, he barely talks to me anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just claws away inside my brain, trying to push the pain of losing our mate onto me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pack would be better off with Chad as their Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I should step down and let them have the leader they deserve. I think the only reason I haven&#39;t stepped down yet, is because late Luna Rachel&#39;s dying wish was for me to lead. It feels like if I step down, I am denying her last request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Splashing some cold water on my face, I attempt to compose myself. I need to stay strong for Allison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t find her if I am too busy feeling sorry for myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting dressed in some gray shorts, and a blue polo. I headed out of her room and down the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting to the main floor, I saw my Beta Chad waiting for me. An expression on his face that I can&#39;t quite pinpoint. Chad was a big guy, one of my best fighters. Standing at 6 feet 3 inches, with long blonde hair in a low ponytail and piercing blue eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bared his neck to me as a sign of respect, nodding at him. I was about to walk out the door when his next words stopped me dead in my tracks, &#34; Alpha, I think we found Allison.&#34; He stated, almost nervously. That was the expression he had. He was nervous. My Beta never showed nervousness, even in the face of death. He stayed strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afraid that what he said couldn&#39;t possibly be true, I didn&#39;t turn to face him. With my back to him, I asked him in a tone so quiet that if he wasn&#39;t a wolf he wouldn&#39;t have heard it, &#34;You found her? Where is she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard him shuffling on his feet, almost debating if he should say what he was thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it Chad, spit it out!&#34; Turning around, I shouted, rolling whatever Alpha aura I had left at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stumbling back, shocked that I projected my aura at him, he continued, &#34;Our spies think that they have found her at a college in Texas. But sir, she is under the name Grace Young... My concern is, what if she doesn&#39;t want to be found?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped closer to him, &#34;Texas, that&#39;s on the other side of the f*ckig world! How dare you assume that your Luna would run away from me. What are you insinuating, Beta? She killed her own parents and mine just to run away? The sweet Allison that wouldn&#39;t hurt a fly?&#34; My tone threatening. Since she has been gone, I have had a hard time keeping my anger in control. I find myself snapping at everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping back and baring his neck in submission, Chad spoke again, &#34; No Alpha, I would never assume that of Allison, I am sorry sir. What would you like us to do with this information?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without needing to think about it, I had made up my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want our private jet to be ready within a half hour, along with our best warriors. You included Chad, I trust you most.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Avoiding eye contact, he asked, &#34; But Alpha, who will lead the pack in our absence?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You decide Chad! You&#39;ve been doing it for years anyway. I&#39;m going to get my mate!&#34; With that, I stormed out of the house to ready weapons and anything else we might need. Whoever took her, and I know someone took her, I needed to be prepared for whatever battle was to happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I realized with this news this is the most alive I have felt in the past 3 years, I was finally going to get my mate back. I had a shot at happiness. She would be safe again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing could have prepared me for what I saw when I got to Texas.</p>
