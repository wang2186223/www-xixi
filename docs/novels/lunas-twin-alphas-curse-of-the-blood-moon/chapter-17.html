                <p>I woke up coughing, my throat sore and felt raw. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;ve only been home a few nights and I got f*cking kidnaped again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took in my surroundings. It was a cell similar to the one Summer had me in, only this one had wider bars, and a glow around it, as if they had strong electric currents flowing through them. I had touched electric fences as a kid when we had horses. I knew better than to touch these damn bars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cell was made up of concrete walls and floors matching the last one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eve, do you know where we are?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No answer, whoever took me must have given me wolfsbane. The situation is all too familiar from what I just went through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got up and walked around, the only thing lighting it was the power radiating off of the cell bars. I didn&#39;t dare get too close, not wanting to get hurt. Without Eve right now, I wouldn&#39;t be able to heal quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard two sets of steps heading my way, one heavy and one light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For some reason, I didn&#39;t feel scared. If anything, I felt annoyed to find myself in this situation again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made sure my stance was confident, preparing for whoever was nearing my cell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh good, you&#39;re awake.&#34; The same old, rough voice from earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was a small old woman, frail looking. With long gray knotted hair, wrinkly pale skin, and sunken brown eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man next to her, though, was a sight. I felt guilty for the thoughts that came to mind when I laid eyes on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was tall, as tall as Damon. Built like a big biker, full of tattooed arms, chunky gold rings on his fingers, he wore a fitted black dress shirt, his muscles threatening to break free with his every subtle movement, he had on fitted black dress pants to match, that showed off very clearly how big his man hood was. I blushed, realizing I was staring at his junk. What is going on with me? I&#39;m locked in a cell, I already have a mate. But yet here I am thinking some very dirty thoughts about this sexy stranger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked up to meet his eyes. They were sea green, gorgeous eyes that stood out against his jet-black hair and mocha skin. He had a perfectly chiseled face as if carved out by the goddess herself. His full lips tugged into a grin, knowing he had caught me checking him out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I suppose I can introduce myself now. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re wondering why I am here, Allison. I am Lucy Hunt. Summer was my great times about 100, grandaughter. I am here to finish what she apparently couldn&#39;t. How am I alive is probably what you are wondering. I have been feeding on the strongest supernatural children for centuries. I hope you have now pieced together why I am here now,&#34; Lucy said. Well, this did make more sense now. But I was not about to get pregnant for her twisted purposes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then who is he and why is he here?&#34; Curiousity killed the cat, knowing his name wouldn&#39;t hurt anyone, right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He will be who impregnates you for my ritual. He is a very powerful supernatural. Together you will  create strong offspring for me to bleed.&#34; She cackled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Raidon, I am a shifter of sorts.&#34; His deep, rough tone answered. The voice so gravely my body instantly reacted with goosebumps, my heart fluttering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What kind of shifter?&#34; I couldn&#39;t help myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can turn between a dragon, a wolf and my human form,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s enough chitchat, Allison. As much as I would love to torture you, I actually need you in good health for this ritual. So Raidon, here will bring you some food. I must be going now.&#34; She spoke as she walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allison? Raidons&#39; sexy voice spoke into my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hope you know there is no chance in hell you are going to get me pregnant. I snapped back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allison, the moon goddess, told me you would be here. I plan on getting you out. I offered myself to the witch, knowing that she would want to use me for my powerful genes. It&#39;s a trick to get you out, but we must be careful and only talk through the link. She is smart and very careful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yeah well, I thought Summer was smart too and I beheaded her. Why the hell are you helping me anyway?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because I am your mate, Allison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This confession sure got a reaction out of me. My eyes went wide with realization. Of course, that explained the attraction I had towards him. He was my second mate. I wouldn&#39;t have recognized him because Eve is asleep in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she take Damon too?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who&#39;s Damon?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah hell, Selene didn&#39;t tell you. I already have a mate. But I have to accept you as my second mate. Something about the two of you fueling me with enough power to fulfill the prophecy, yada yada. Anyways, I really just want to spend a night in my bed, completely undisturbed. So how am I getting out of here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You have another mate? He roared down the link, I could feel the anger rolling off of him. He must be an alpha of sorts. Only alphas could let off this much power with their emotions. Why were they so damn possessive? All of this was out of my control but I am the one who has to sit here and listen to jealous alphas complain about two mates. What about what I want? I didn&#39;t ask for any of this, selfish to say it, I know. But I&#39;m locked in a cell for a second time and I am feeling rather irritated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t say another word before storming off down the hall. It should be interesting when him and Damon meet, two possessive alphas as my mates, yay me. I&#39;m going to get the hell out of this cell and Lucy will suffer the same fate as Summer. I sat down. I needed Eve if I was going to pull this escape plan off. I had no idea if I for sure had Raidon&#39;s help or not, so I would just have to figure this out on my own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allison?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eve, thank goodness. Can you help get us out of here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cell is enchanted, I&#39;m not sure with what. You have to touch it, we need to know what kind of power we are dealing with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Touch it, are you nuts?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Please, Allison, trust me, I can heal you now that I&#39;m awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I huffed in annoyance. I really didn&#39;t want to do this but Eve was right, we needed to figure out what kind of power was holding us in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got up, pulled my shoulders back. I stormed to the cell, sucked in a breath and closed my eyes while I reached my hand up towards the bars. I cringed, worried about what power was about to hit me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I jumped when I felt a cool metal under my hand. I slowly opened my eyes. My hand was touching the metal. My hand held the same glow that the bars did. What the hell? I reached my second hand up and the same thing happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eve, what does this mean?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s a trick, Allison, she needs you alive. The power she used wasn&#39;t to hurt you, but to make you think it would hurt you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A:N/ Hello lovely readers, what do you think so far?</p>
