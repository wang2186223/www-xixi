                <p>A:N hello readers, I apologize for the delay in updates, been super busy with my kids and working on my degree! Doing my best to keep updating, thank you everyone for the positive comments, it really pushes me to do better and continue updating. Much love &lt;3</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s Time</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allison POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s been one month since Selene gave the gift of life to Aspen-Eve and I. I cannot begin to explain how thankful I am that she gave us this second chance. My baby girl is perfect, she is only one month old and already beginning to crawl. Werewolf babies grow faster than human babies, but Aspen-Eve&#39;s growth is even further accelerated by the mass amount of Alpha blood running through her veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raidon and Damon have been amazing fathers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I threw my covers off and rolled out of bed to check on Aspen-Eve. I peeked into her crib to find it empty. Panic set into me as I raced out of my bedroom. I called her name as I flew down the stairs. I had reached the bottom in a panicked frenzy to find her wrapped in a cozy blanket, napping peacefully in Damon&#39;s arms while Raidon stood in front of them gently stroking her hair and planting gentle kisses on her forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shhh, Allison. We just got her to sleep.&#34; Raidon placed a finger to his lips to make his point. I breathed a sigh of relief and couldn&#39;t help the smile that tugged up my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen that beautiful smile in a long time. We got this Ali, go have a nice shower. Get dressed, we have something planned for you today.&#34; Damon said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at them skeptically before giving in and making my way back up to my room. I turned the shower on and undressed while I waited for it to warm up. I looked at myself in the mirror and almost laughed out loud at my appearance. I guess motherhood has taken a little toll on me. I had bags under my eyes, my hair was standing messy in every direction. Although I looked like a disaster, it has all been worth it and I would do it a million times over. I stepped into the shower and enjoyed the feeling of the hot water caressing my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have been trying to cherish every moment that the moon goddess has gifted me with, but I knew that the time was coming where I would have to fulfill my prophecy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finished my shower and wrapped myself in a towel as I stepped out, I wiped the steam off of the mirror. I decided to put some effort into my appearance today, considering I have been living with messy-unwashed hair, sweatpants, and my breast milk stained shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I towel-dried my hair and let it go naturally wavy, I applied some red lipstick and some mascara. After taking a final look in the mirror, I decided to pick out my outfit. I picked out a black lace bra and panty set, and slipped into a red sequin mini-dress. I was suddenly feeling very sexy and the need to seduce my mates. We have been in full-on parent-mode and haven&#39;t had the time or the energy to do anything even close to sex. The most action any of us had is a quick peck on the lips at night before we all crash into bed. You would think that between the three of us plus grams helping out, we wouldn&#39;t be so tired out everyday. But raising a strong alpha-blooded baby is no easy gig.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked downstairs to find grams sitting on the floor playing with Aspen-Eve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up at me as she heard me getting closer,&#34;Oh Allison, you look stunning! Those two boys won&#39;t be able to control themselves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you grams, I&#39;m not sure what they are planning, but hopefully we aren&#39;t back too late. I have some breast-milk stored in the fridge that I pumped last night. Her pajamas are set out, her lotion and bath stuff are set up. Oh! I also put her favorite blankie in her crib. I&#39;m not sure if I am forgetting anything, ummm.&#34; I tapped my finger to my chin as I tried to remember if I was forgetting anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Allison, I am perfectly capable of taking care of her. You all go and enjoy yourselves. I promise she will be okay. I will even send you updates every hour if that puts your mind at ease, I understand it may be stressful going out for the first time without her, but she is in the best hands possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you grams, I appreciate this. I will make sure there are warriors stationed around the house.&#34; I sighed, it was going to be difficult to not stress about leaving my baby girl behind, but I knew that I could trust grams to keep her safe. I walked over to Aspen-Eve and picked her up. I showered her face with kisses,&#34;Mommy loves you so so much my sweet little angel. I promise I will see you soon, you be good for your great grandmother.&#34; I gave her one last kiss before placing her back on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grams smacked my leg before saying, &#34;Don&#39;t say great grandmother anymore. It makes me sound old child!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both laughed before I heard footsteps coming down the stairs. I turned around just in time to see both of my mates, dressed to the nines and looking sexier than ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raked my eyes over both of them, slowly drinking them in. They were matching, both wearing black dress pants that showed off the giant bulges they were both blessed with. I gulped, realizing that eventually I may or may not end up having both of them inside of me at the same time. The thought of that scared me but also aroused me. Maybe I have a kinky side I didn&#39;t know about? I pushed those thoughts away, trying not to fill the room with the smell of my horniness in front of my child and grandmother. My eyes worked their way up their bodies, they were in matching black dress shirts that showed off every movement of every bulging muscle. Finally, I looked up to see two sets of perfect eyes clash with mine, one set of sea-green and one set of hazel, both perfect in their own ways. I noticed that their eyes were filled with hunger and desire. Damon&#39;s dirty blonde hair was tousled and sexy, while Raidon&#39;s black hair was slicked back and sleek looking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You all should really be getting on your way before you start doing nasty things right here in this living room.&#34; Grams coughed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all burst out laughing and made our way out the door where a black Cadillac escalade was waiting for us. Damon opened the back door and Raidon lifted me up bridal style and placed me on the seat. I scooched to the middle as Damon got in on one side, and Raidon on the other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed Chad in the driver&#39;s seat, looking at me through the rear-view mirror with a friendly smile. I returned the smile and then we were off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So where exactly are we going?&#34; I asked, looking back and forth between my two men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a surprise, Ali,&#34; Damon responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll love it doll&#34;, said Raidon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I realized they weren&#39;t going to tell me, so I gave up and sat back in my seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt Damon&#39;s hand rest on my knee while Raidon&#39;s hand was tracing up and down my arm. Sparks were flying in every spot they touched. It was twice as electrifying when they both touched me at the same time. I couldn&#39;t help the small moan that escaped my lips, they were barely touching me and my senses were already flooded with pleasure. I clenched my legs together as I felt my panties getting wet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both men sniffed the air and I noticed how the bulges in their pants grew rock-hard, only turning me on more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon let his claws out and drug on slowly up my leg, while Raidon stopped tracing my arm and made his way to my breasts. He began squeezing it. I felt Damon retract his claws and almost whimpered at the loss of touch, but within a second his hand was back on me, rubbing circles gently on my clit. He moved his finger down and felt my wetness through my panties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is so wet for us, I can&#39;t wait to have a taste.&#34; Damon said, more to Raidon than to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard Chad clear his throat, suddenly feeling embarrassed. I was so caught up in the moment that I had forgotten we were going somewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh, I hate to interrupt but we are here.&#34;Chad said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three of us piled out of the vehicle, Chad leaving a moment later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took in our surroundings and gasped at the beauty. It was a giant log home with a green tin roof. A covered deck with rocking chairs, it was surrounded by tall trees with flower pots hanging off of every beam. We walked up the walkway that had rose bushes on each side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raidon took out a key and unlocked the door, Damon picked me up bridal style and carried me up the stairs into the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where did you guys find this place?&#34; I asked, still in awe with its beauty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We had it built, for all of us. Aspen-Eve and grams too. It&#39;s a place to go whenever we want. It&#39;s safe because it is still in pack territory, and as an extra precaution, Lena charmed the whole place. Anyone that belongs to our pack can see the house, but to any outsider it looks and even smells like a swamp.&#34; Damon explained. I was impressed. I had no idea that they were doing this. The amount of thought that went into it was amazing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, but how can Raidon see it?&#34; I asked. As far as I knew, Raidon was never officially sworn into our pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I actually swore him into our pack about three weeks ago.&#34; Damon responded as he placed me on my feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tsk. Tsk. You men and your secrets.&#34; I giggled, I hugged Damon and hugged Raidon, &#34;thank you both for this. It&#39;s beautiful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not as beautiful as you doll, now go explore quickly because you have about five minutes before I rip that tight little dress off of you.&#34; Raidon said as he slapped my ass. I squeaked and quickly ran away to look around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s Time Continued</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were large log beams along the roof, with big windows to let in all of the natural light. I found my way into the kitchen. It had white marble countertops with a large black granite sink. I continued on into a living room that had a black leather sectional with a large flatscreen TV hanging off the opposite wall. I turned a corner and came across a spiral staircase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Running out of time doll.&#34; Raidon&#39;s voice carried across the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I giggled and quickly ran up the stairs. There were 4 doors along the hallway. I opened the first one. It was a bathroom with the biggest bathtub I have ever seen. The entire ceiling above the tub was one large shower-head. There was his and her sinks and a rectangular mirror with gold trim around it. The next bedroom looked like a guest room. I was about to open the third door when I felt a pair of large hands pick me up by my waist, followed by the rush of sparks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Time&#39;s up doll&#34; Raidon growled in my ear. I guess I will have to explore another time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raidon then threw me over his shoulder and took me to the last door. He then opened it and placed me gently onto a bed. I didn&#39;t even have time to look at the bedroom before he extended his claws and made a slice down the side of my dress, careful not to cut me. Once the dress was cut, he ripped it away from my body, leaving me in my lace bra and panties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clenched my legs together in anticipation, feeling the familiar wetness between them. Raidon sniffed the air and licked his lips. Desire and lust filled his sea-green eyes. I was waiting for him to make a move but when he stood there frozen, drinking me in. I took things into my own hands. I extended a claw and slowly traced it from my neck to in between my breasts. Raidon was watching my every movement. I sliced the material of my bra open, both breasts bounced free and Raidon growled, unable to control himself, he grabbed my panties and ripped them off. Before I could say or do anything, he got down on his knees and buried his face between my legs. I wrapped them around his head as he licked my clit with so much passion and force I was barely holding it together. I could feel the knot building in my stomach, my moans grew louder, turning into screams of pleasure as I neared my orgasm. Without any warning, Raidon slammed his thick finger into my wet pussy, curling it up as he rammed it in and out of me. He added a second finger and I gripped his hair with both hands as if silently begging him not to stop. I screamed as I felt myself cum over and over again spraying him with my juices. My entire body was twitching with ecstasy, but he didn&#39;t stop, he kept finger f*cking me completely unforgiving. My body felt like it was on the most intense high but my greedy *ss wanted more, so much more, &#34; Raidon, please I need to feel you inside of me.&#34; I begged. He pulled his fingers out of me and sucked my juices off, never once breaking eye contact. I heard some movement beside the bed and noticed Damon, sitting on a chair. His pants were around his ankles and he was stroking his rock-hard shaft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watching you cum is the hottest f*cking thing I&#39;ve ever seen.&#34; Damon growled as he got up from the chair, kicking his pants off and  tearing off his shirt. I looked back to see Raidon completely naked. Damon came up beside me and picked me up, moving me to the head of the bed, gently laying my head on the pillows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please do continue.&#34; Damon said as he began stroking himself again. Raidon didn&#39;t wait another moment before climbing in between my legs. I felt the tip of his cock brush my entrance. I looked over at Damon before Raidon gripped my chin and turned my head to look at him, &#34; Look at me doll, if you look away I&#39;ll stop.&#34; Raidon said before shoving his entire cock inside of me at once. My eyes rolled back from the perfect intrusion and I felt him pull completely out of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did I say doll?&#34; Raidon growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I snapped my eyes back to his and he rammed it in me again, this time with more force. He gripped one of my legs over his shoulder as he f*cked me with such force I didn&#39;t think I would last much longer before I came undone again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Flip her over.&#34; I heard Damon say from the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raidon did so and I was flipped on my hands and knees. Raidon landed a smack to my ass. It stung but I found pleasure in the sweet pain of it. Raidon then grabbed a fistful of my hair and lined himself up with my entrance before he pushed himself inside of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t wait to fill that pretty little mouth of yours&#34; Damon growls, I noticed his eyes change from his usual hazel to a shade darker than night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon climbed onto the bed and positioned his throbbing cock in front of my face, I licked my lips as I noticed a bead of pre-cum forming at the tip. Raidon released my hair and Damon grabbed it. I licked the pre-cum off of his tip, never breaking eye-contact. I grabbed his shaft with one hand and began stroking him slowly, teasing him. Raidon began thrusting in and out of me from behind, this time slower, taking his time with me. I licked down Damon&#39;s cock before gently sucking on his balls. I then licked back up his cock and opened my mouth, deepthroating the entire thing in one motion. I gagged as his length filled my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;F*ck.&#34; I heard Damon groan under his breath as his grip on my hair tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He began thrusting inside of my mouth as Raidon thrust into me from behind, all of us in perfect sync.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both picked up their pace and I was being f*cked roughly from the front and back. I was gagging, saliva was dripping from my mouth as Damon slammed himself in and out of my mouth. Tears of ecstasy sprang to my eyes from the pleasure we were all sharing through our bond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raidon leaned down and bit into his mark on my neck. I felt his cock throb and grow as he released his cum inside of me. He then pulled out slowly while Damon took his place behind me. Damon pushed his cock deep inside of my pussy, I felt the knot building within me while he f*cked me from behind. He gripped my throat, pulling my back flush with his chest as he continued pumping in and out of me. I felt his cock grow as he neared his climax. I screamed as my juices sprayed us both, my body began shaking and I saw stars across my vision, Damon held me up as I felt his cock twitch as he released his cum inside of me as he bit down into his mark on my neck. He then pulled out and my body collapsed against the bed. I felt exhausted but full of energy at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could hear water running before I felt a pair of strong arms pick me up and place me in a warm tub. Raidon washed my hair, massaging my scalp. Damon took a cloth and gently washed each part of my body. I felt my eyelids getting droopy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sleep doll.&#34; I heard Raidon whisper next to my ear. I closed my eyes and let sleep take me, knowing that I was completely safe and taken care of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could hear my name being called, so I woke up. Or so I thought I woke up. But when I opened my eyes, I found myself in the same field where I last saw the moon goddess. She must be trying to reach me through my dream, I thought. I walked around, following the sound of my name being called.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello my child.&#34; I heard Selene say from behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello Goddess, it&#39;s been awhile.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, it has. I&#39;m afraid it is time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought that might be what this is about. I appreciate the time you have given me with my family, it has been a true blessing.&#34; I said, genuinely thankful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I tried to allow it as long as possible, but I am afraid that if you don&#39;t get to work soon there will be a war, one that will take the lives of many supernaturals. This war will happen in a weeks&#39; time if you can&#39;t fulfill the prochecy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand Goddess, what do I need to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must get every kind on your side. Vampires, Fae, Witches, Dragons and Werewolves. You visit those five kingdoms and convince each king or queen to hold peace with each other and every other species. They won&#39;t be easy to convince, some may challenge you. But you are strong, Allison, and you have two strong men at your side. You will succeed, child. I know you will. You can bring peace to all kinds. Now, I must go. Good luck dear.&#34; She reached her hand out and stroked my cheek before I disappeared back into the darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up with a jump. Damon and Raidon both sat up and looked at me, concern evident on their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s time,&#34; I said as they both nodded in understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A:N Hello readers, I am terribly sorry for the massive delay in update. My province has multiple wildfires throughout it. My kids and I are currently evacuated from our home so it has been super hectic but I have been trying my best to give my readers something. I hope you enjoy this chapter and I genuinely appreciate every kind comment that has been left. You all inspire me to continue this writing journey. &lt;3</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meeting</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allison POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sun was peeking through the dark curtains, waking me up. I stretched my body as a loud yawn escaped me. Last night with my mates had been mindblowing. But now it was time to get down to business. I had lots to do in a very limited amount of time and I still had no idea how I was going to accomplish any of this. I noticed the bed was empty, and got up to look for my mates. I walked out of the bedroom, groaning from how sore the previous night had made me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could smell bacon and eggs being cooked and that made me forget how sore I was as I raced down the stairs to eat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran into the kitchen to find Damon and Raidon both cooking up a storm. Both wore matching black aprons with no shirts underneath. Damn, this was something I could get used to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, good morning gentlemen.&#34; I giggled as I tried to snatch a piece of bacon from the plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon was quick to smack my hand away, &#34;Not so fast. This is our last calm morning before everything turns hectic. Go sit down. We will serve you our Queen.&#34; He said as he bowed to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help the laugh that escaped me from his little bow and the &#34;Queen&#34; comment, but I obeyed and plopped down on the couch. Moments later, Raidon placed a plate in front of me piled high with bacon and fried eggs. &#34;Your food my Queen.&#34; He bowed and ran away laughing before I could smack him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you both for the food,&#34; I started while shoveling food into my mouth, &#34;But I&#39;m not a Queen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not yet&#34; they said in unison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After breakfast, we realised we couldn&#39;t delay the inevitable any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would like to run with our mates.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eve spoke into my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eve wants to run back home, what do ya say we race?&#34; I giggled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, considering you don&#39;t know exactly where this cabin is located, I say you&#39;re on!&#34; Raidon exclaimed while Damon high-fived him in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I swear you two have the cutest bro-mance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to get the upperhand on them in the race because they were right. I wasn&#39;t exactly sure where this cabin was located. Of course, I knew it was in pack borders but our pack is massive, we could be anywhere right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look over there what&#39;s that!&#34; I pointed towards the kitchen window. They both whipped around ready to attack whatever threat they thought was near. Check. Mate. Well, mates. I took this distraction to race out the front door and Eve took over in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could hear them both swearing on the way out of the cabin but I wasn&#39;t about to stick around and find out just how mad they were at my trick. We raced through the forest. Eve covered herself in mud to get them off of our scent. I could no longer hear them, Eve is a massive wolf though. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if she could outrun them both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think we lost them!&#34; I exclaimed to Eve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t be so sure, Allison. Listen closely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started listening to our surroundings through the sound of Eve&#39;s paws hitting the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I heard it. Paws thudding against the ground not too far behind us, and something else a little closer. Sh*t! I forgot Raidon could choose between being a wolf or a dragon. I could hear his wings pushing through the sky gaining on us quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They almost caught us! What do we do?!&#34; I asked Eve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have many different powers, teleportation being one of them. Try it. Focus on our home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put all of my effort into picturing our home, getting back to my baby girl, snuggling her after our short time away. At first I didn&#39;t feel any different, but then I felt something, like a rope in my mind, begging me to follow. I tugged at this rope, focusing every bit of energy on it. All of a sudden, I heard a loud crash and Eve went crashing through a wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eve gave control to me and as I shifted back I took in my surroundings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see you&#39;ve been practising your powers, Allison.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whipped my head around to see Grams standing there with a sundress in hand and a smile on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I think I need to work on my landing.&#34; I laughed as I slipped the sundress on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I win suckers!&#34; I mind-linked Damon and Raidon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two men came through the door moments later, sweaty and naked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, you two look like you ran a marathon!&#34; I giggled at them as I tried not to stare at my two Greek gods standing in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You cheated! Don&#39;t think we see that little stunt you pulled,&#34; Damon stated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won fair and square, now let&#39;s get cleaned up. I want to see Aspen-Eve and then we must plan our first meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually, about your first meeting. The Alpha King is here. He is waiting in the office. He just got here moments before you came tumbling through the wall. He said the moon goddess requested him to help you with achieving your prophecy.&#34; Grams said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sh*t, I am filthy. How will I earn any respect looking like this?&#34; I tried smoothing out my hair and giving my face a quick wipe. I knew I must look like a disaster. I started making my way up the stairs towards the office. I couldn&#39;t keep the Alpha King waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed two royal guards stationed outside of the office. I nodded at them and made my way into the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting at the desk was a middle-aged man. He had his gray hair neatly slicked back and was wearing a black suit. He was muscular and his aura screamed power. I looked up and noticed his dark eyes watching me. I quickly bowed in respect,&#34;My king, it is such an honour to have you here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need for formalities, you can call me Tim. The moon goddess calling a favor in is very rare, so of course, I had to come and see what all of the fuss was about. You must be Allison.&#34; He stood up from his chair and placed a kiss on the back of my hand. He pulled back immediately as if my hand had shocked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are very powerful, Allison, perhaps more powerful than you realize. These powers will be extremely useful.&#34; He said with a grin, one that I wasn&#39;t so sure I could trust.</p>
