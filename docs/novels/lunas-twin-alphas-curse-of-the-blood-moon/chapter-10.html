                <p>Flashback</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was walking around a house I didn&#39;t recognize. I wanted to explore but I had no control over my body, it&#39;s like I was just watching through my eyes everything I was doing with no real control. It was a beautiful home, with large log pillars, and a very rustic style. I watched as I made a coffee for myself. I then walked down a hallway, coffee in hand, through large, stained glass French doors. Upon entering, I saw giant oak bookshelves along the walls, filled with books from top to bottom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked to one of the shelves and plucked a book with bindings that looked worn as if someone had read it a thousand times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I carried my book and coffee back through the French doors and made my way back down the hallway the way I came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made my way towards the front door and exited. I started heading to a large oak tree. It was a beautiful spot. I sat down and started reading. A few minutes had gone by and then I heard someone approaching, so I looked up from my book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holy shit. The sexiest man ever was standing in front of me, staring at me with gorgeous hazel eyes. They were magnificent and filled with lust? Desire? It was a stare that was making my panties wet with anticipation. I don&#39;t why I was so drawn to him, but I wanted him to take me here and now under this tree, I didn&#39;t care who saw. His tall, muscular figure loomed over me, and those gray sweats left nothing to the imagination. The man was packing and I wanted to discover every inch of him. His dirty blonde hair, damn I just wanted to run my fingers through it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon disappeared and I found myself back in my cell. Wait, Damon? Oh my god, I gasped as I remembered. I saw memories of us playing together as kids. Memories of us going to school together, we were always so close. Playing together in our wolf form, His was Apollo, a beautiful black wolf with black eyes. Massive next to my small brown wolf, Aspen, she had green eyes to match my own. I had the biggest crush on him, but as we got older he was always too busy with training. He was my first kiss, hell my only kiss. I suddenly remembered that moment. We were 17, walking back to the pack house after a run, sweating and laughing. It was dark, but with our enhanced sight we could see each other perfectly. The moon illuminated his perfectly chiseled face. His full pink lips, sun-kissed skin. His tousled hair and piercing hazel eyes. His body was full of muscles, he was shirtless, wearing those damn gray sweats, I felt heat pool in between my legs as the sight of him had me wanting more. He stopped and caught me staring at him, his bright eyes started to darken, as I blushed and tried to look away, embarrassed, realizing he could probably smell my arousal. I was about to continue walking when he wrapped a large muscled arm around me, pulling me flush against his skin. He used his other hand, and tipped my chin up to look him in the eyes. I felt his bulge growing against my stomach. We stood like that, staring at each other for what felt like hours. Finally, he broke the silence with his deep, baritone voice,&#34;Ali.&#34; Was all he said, the nickname sent butterflies coursing through my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damon?&#34; I replied in a quiet voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I shouldn&#39;t do this, but I need to taste you just once. I&#39;ve waited so long. It&#39;s selfish but f*ck it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damon, what&#39;re you....&#34; Before I could finish my sentence, he grabbed my face with both of his hands and dipped down to meet my lips, I had never felt this amazing before. Soft, gentle sparks went along my lips where he kissed, I tilted my head to the side as he swiped his tongue along my bottom lip, as if silently asking to enter. I parted my lips, allowing his tongue access. Our tongues dance together to a beautiful harmony. My arms reached up and played with his hair as his hands dipped to my lower back. Everything about this felt so right. He kissed me with such delicacy, like I was the most fragile thing in the world. But it also had a hidden passion behind it, as if he wanted to do that forever. He had pulled away and we locked eyes. I instantly missed the feeling that his closeness brought. He then turned and walked away. I touched my lips. I had never been more confused. He wanted me one moment and the next he was walking away. Leaving me there with my thoughts. That was around the time we started to grow apart. Was I really that bad of a kisser?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More memories flooded me, my parents, oh my goddess. My parents, I remember the fire. Summer had started it. She tried taking me but my mom and dad came to my defense. She used some kind of magic to behead my father and then drove a sword through my mother. I remember watching my parents collapse to the ground. I started sobbing violently as the memory of their death had returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I collapsed back onto the concrete floor, I wanted to scream, I wanted to kill Summer for the pain she caused us. I held my knees close to my chest, shaking as the sadness took over. I felt exhausted from the information overload. I welcomed the darkness with open arms, hoping that some sleep could help heal these wounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A:N/Hello lovely readers, what do you think so far?? Unknown POV was finally revealed as Damon &lt;3 I wanted to keep his name a secret until Allison got her memories back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cabin</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon POV (Previously unknown pov)</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt defeated, but I knew that I needed to be strong for my Allison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If we can&#39;t find her through magic, we need to try something else. She would most likely hide her somewhere abandoned or remote, Chad, get ahold of Leroy. We need to look for any houses that may be under Summer&#39;s name. Lena, do you know what Summer&#39;s last name is, or do you know of any abandoned houses she might use?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena thought for a moment before speaking, &#34;If she carried on Lucy&#39;s last name then it would be Hunt. But if she didn&#39;t take that last name, I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t know what else it would be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another idea had come to me, &#34;Wait, Allison was with a guy when she got drugged, do we know who the guy is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena sighed, &#34;If he is the one that lured her to getting drugged, then I am worried he might be Summers&#39; mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How would you know that he is Summer&#39;s mate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, when Selene, the moon goddess, provided a mate for each of Macy&#39;s descendants, it came with a price. She had to find a balance, so she was required to give Lucy&#39;s descendants a mate too. Ones that are strong supernatural beings, that would create strong offspring required for the rituals.&#34; Just as I was about to reply, Chad spoke up, &#34;Alpha, Leroy says he can&#39;t find anything under the name Summer Hunt. That name doesn&#39;t exist in any of the records. But he did find something else. It is a property 2 hours from here, in the middle of the woods. There is no road or driveway to it. It&#39;s like it was just plopped there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do we know that&#39;s where Allison could be? What ties that house to this?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, Leroy found an ancient deed for this property. The name on it is Lucy Hunt. It might be a dead end lead, but it&#39;s the only thing we have to go off of right now. It&#39;s worth checking out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chad was right, it&#39;s the only lead we have had so far, so what other choice did we have?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, Chad get the address from Leroy. If there are no roads, we will travel in wolf form. Lena, how can we contact you if we find her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh dear, I&#39;ve been hiding for far too long. I failed to save my daughter. I&#39;ll be damned if I fail to save my granddaughter too. I&#39;m going with you.&#34; Lena spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t know what kind of danger could be there, I would never forgive myself if something happened to you before Allison got to meet you.&#34; I said softly, hoping she stayed here where she was safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boy, I can handle my damn self, and my going is not up to you. I said I&#39;m going and I mean it. Now get up and get your asses out the door. We are leaving.&#34; Lena stubbornly stated as she grabbed her jacket and walked out the door, &#34;Well, are you wolves coming or not? We ain&#39;t got all day!&#34; She shouted from outside. We didn&#39;t waste another moment and all hurried out the door. Chad showed us all the location of the house, and with that we stripped our clothes and packed them in a bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all shifted into our wolves quickly. Lena was picking some herbs and stuffing them into a small leather fanny pack hanging around her waist. Apollo chortled at the woman. Zipping up her fanny pack. She was looking around at the wolves surrounding her.  I was about to offer her to ride on Apollo, worried that maybe shifting was painful for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, turn around, dammit. I&#39;m not about to strip in front of you boys.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all obeyed and turned around. A moment later, a small gray wolf with green eyes trotted up beside me carrying our bag of clothes. Her wolf was so small that her fanny pack remained around her waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is my wolf Leah, and just for your information, she may be small but she will beat any of you in a race.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena spoke into my mind, and with that her wolf Leah was off. My 4 warriors, Chad and I all followed her. True to her word, she kept up with all of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It only took us just under an hour to make it near the house. We didn&#39;t want to get too close, as we wanted to assess the situation first and see how many people were guarding it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a small log cabin, with moss and vines covering it. The wood looked like it was rotting, there were two windows on the front of the house, the glass in them was cracked and some of the panels had fallen out. The front door was a simple wooden door. It looked like it had been kicked in, it sat ajar halfway off of the hinges.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Either nobody is here, or it&#39;s the perfect place to keep someone hidden. I shot down the link.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t hear any movement. Should we go investigate? Chad responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chad and I are going inside. I want one warrior on each side of the house stay in wolf form and be alert, Lena, please stay here until we know it&#39;s safe? If anything happens to us, I want you to take two of my warriors and get out of here. Does everyone understand? I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>4 &#34;Yes Alphas&#39;&#34; Came down the link as my warriors took their places around the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena growled at me,&#34;I don&#39;t take orders from you young man. I will stay here on one condition. The second you are in trouble, you tell me right away. You&#39;re forgetting I am also part witch. You may just underestimate my power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We shifted into our human forms, our wolves wouldn&#39;t exactly be stealthy in a such a small cabin. Putting on our clothes, we started  walking into the clearing towards the cabin. As we got closer, we paused to listen for any movement inside, or any heartbearts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing nothing, we continued closer. We slowly crept up to the front door and squeezed through, trying not to knock it down or push it open further in fear it would draw attention to us. Inside the cabin, it was covered in dust and cobwebs as if someone hadn&#39;t occupied the space for years. There were broken pictures hanging on the wall. I stopped for a moment. I smelt something; lavender, fresh roses, and... shit, that&#39;s blood. I smelt blood mingled in with the scent of Allison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chad, I can smell her, but I also smell blood. I felt my heart rate increase at the possibility of my mate being hurt. I couldn&#39;t wait to rip out the throats of the f*ckers that dare lay a hand on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t see anything. Maybe they had her here at one point and moved her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel it, I feel her here, she has to be here somewhere. I started searching the house, not caring about how loud I was anymore. It wasn&#39;t a large area to search through, it was only the main floor, which consisted of a living room, kitchen, and a small bedroom and bathroom. I tried sniffing the air, trying to see where her smell was the strongest. It led me into the bedroom. It consisted of a small single bed and a small bookshelf tucked into the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ALPH....  I heard Chad start to shout down the link, but he was cut off. I heard two loud thuds. I whipped around to exit the room and was met with a horrible sight. Chad&#39;s head was rolling its way towards me, his body lying limp and bloody by the front door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chad, my childhood best friend, the person that was always there for me in my darkest times. An Alpha-blooded wolf. How the hell did they get the upper hand on him? I&#39;ve seen him fight. He was ruthless when he needed to be. I felt a sadness like no other for my lost friend, but I couldn&#39;t let my sadness consume me. Next to his body was Lena. She was in human form, kneeling down in the opening of the front door, blood was sprayed across her face. She looked at me in fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m so sorry Damon, I should&#39;ve listened, I should&#39;ve stayed put. You were gone for so long, I was worried something had happened to you both. I distracted Chad when I came in, he&#39;s dead because of me. Lena sobbed down the link to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of a sudden, I heard a deep laugh come from behind the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was about to walk over there when a blonde girl appeared out of thin air in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, your arrival wasn&#39;t exactly a part of my plan, but I suppose we can make this work. I&#39;m Summer, it&#39;s a pleasure to meet you Damon. Wow, you look almost identical to your father, he had that same look on his face when I killed him.&#34; All I saw was red, this is the b*tch that took my Allison. She killed Allison&#39;s parents, she killed my parents. This is the b*tch that killed my best friend. I would make her pay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A:N/ Hello lovely readers, what do you think so far?
