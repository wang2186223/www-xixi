                <p>&#34;Uh, hey Dean.&#34; I said awkwardly to break the silence. Noticing he was wearing the same outfit as earlier, minus the leather jacket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Grace, I knew you&#39;d come&#34; he finally peeled his eyes off of my body and looked at my face. Moving to the side, he gestured with his hand for us to come in.</p>

                <p>&#34;Wait, Summer!&#34; I tried to grab her arm, but it was pointless. She snuck off before I could catch her. Little sh*t planned it this way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing it was just Dean and I, I shuffled awkwardly on my feet, praying he would break the ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you, uh, want a drink or something?&#34; He asked while he scratched the back of his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, please. Something strong&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughing, he motioned for me to follow him through the crowd of people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were people that were already drunk trying to run out the front door to puke, some were making out and practically dry humping each other as if completely unaware that they were surrounded by other people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The house was hazy and smelt like a mixture of beer, weed and sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This may be my first and last college party, this is definitely not my scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to watch where I was walking, trying not to trip on the empty beer cans and solo cups that littered the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The house was not only identical to ours on the outside, but the inside was also laid out the same, making it easy to find the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean walked to the pantry and grabbed a bottle of vodka and sprite, as well as two solo cups off of a big stack on the counter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He placed the cups down and began to pour a generous amount of vodka into each cup. He poured the Sprite into the first and before he could pour it into the second, I snatched the cup with only vodka and swallowed it in one gulp. I started coughing as the strong liquid burned the whole way down my throat, reaching for anything to soothe this feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could hear Dean laughing at me as he handed me the bottle of sprite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking it from him, careful not to touch his hand, I tried to gulp it down. That was also a fail, stupid carbonated drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The coughing intensified until I had pop coming out of my nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Help...me... please&#34; I tried saying in between coughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now Dean was hunched over, holding his stomach, laughing at me. Thanks for the help ass-hat, I thought to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All at once, Dean stopped and grabbed a bottle of water. Handing it to me, he said, &#34; Jeez, you can sure be sassy, here ya go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to facepalm. I must&#39;ve called him an ass-hat out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing there was nothing I could say to recover from that one, I reached for the water and our fingers brushed each other. Feeling the same shock as the times before I dropped the water bottle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly my coughing fit was done. I know for a fact I&#39;m not imagining this feeling now, it happened too many times to be fake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being freaked out by this, I started to walk away when I felt a large hand grasp my arm and that same electric shock shoot its way up my arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grace, we should talk. Maybe somewhere a little more private.&#34; Dean said as I began to turn around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know what to say so I just nodded. He must feel it too then. Why else would he want to talk?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not releasing my arm, he led me up the stairs to a bedroom, in my own house. That would be where my bedroom was located.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why am I blindly following this man into a bedroom? I barely know him. This suddenly feels like a dumb idea and I get a weird feeling in my stomach. Feeling like I&#39;m about to throw up, I run to the bathroom that&#39;s inside the bedroom and empty the contents of my stomach into the toilet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wiping my mouth when I finish, I turned to exit the bathroom, finding Dean standing next to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry about that, I don&#39;t really feel the best. I am going to find Summer and let her know I&#39;m going home.&#34; I said as I started walking towards the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean bumps the door shut with his boot and stands in my way of exiting, &#34;Actually Grace, we are having this talk now.&#34; He said in a threatening tone, different from the way he was talking to me before. His whole demeanor changed, he seemed almost dangerous now. Like a lion waiting for its prey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Judging by the look in his eyes, I&#39;m that prey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just when I was about to say something, I heard a shuffling sound behind me of someone approaching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could turn around to see who else was in the room, I felt the prick of a needle in my neck, followed by a burning sensation of the liquid being injected into my blood stream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear, fear is what I felt. I was terrified. What is in that needle? Who did that? Who else is in the room with us?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why would Dean lead me in here, and what kind of twisted plan does he and this mystery person have in mind for me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started to feel light on my feet, staring at Dean in shock as the mystery liquid worked fast. He started to smile. Not a cute smile, a sick and twisted smile. The one that screamed danger. He captured his prey. I started swaying, and everything started to turn black.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt myself fall to the floor before the darkness completely overtook me.</p>
