                <p>Unknown POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who do you think did this? Why weren&#39;t you ever in Allison&#39;s life, or your daughters?&#34; I had so many questions, I didn&#39;t know where to start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now boy, one thing at a time. If I am right about who is behind this, then there is no telling if they have already gone ahead with the ritual or not. I&#39;ll start from the beginning to help you put the pieces of the puzzle together,&#34; Lena stopped to take a sip of her tea before she continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This all started centuries ago, when an unlikely pairing happened. A witch was fated to a werewolf. Witches and werewolves have never gotten along. Werewolves were always so quick to kill them, believing them all to be cruel and manipulative without giving them a chance. This pairing was the first of its kind at the time. It was common for werewolves to have mates, but for a witch and a werewolf, it was completely unheard of.&#34; she paused before continuing,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This particular witch was the most powerful of her kind. Macy was her name.The werewolf that she was mated to was Alpha King Theo. The Alpha of all Alphas. He was the strongest Alpha to have ever ruled. The Alpha King knew he would be stripped of his title if anyone ever discovered who his mate was, so they kept it hidden, always sneaking around at night, hoping to never be caught. But, eventually, they did get caught. Theo was given an ultimatum: lose his title and go rouge to be with his mate, or kill her to prove his loyalty to his kind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s so cruel, why couldn&#39;t she be accepted by his kingdom?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because werewolves were intimidated by the powers they did not possess and they didn&#39;t like that they couldn&#39;t control witches, hell werewolves are still like that. But to sum up the rest of the story, he declared that he would kill her to keep his title, stupid power-hungry wolf. Upon ripping her head off, he discovered she was with child. Before Macy died, she prayed to the mood goddess to protect her baby. The goddess did. This baby was the very first witch-werewolf hybrid. With Macy&#39;s death, the witches needed a new leader. An old witch named Lucy took her place as the leader of witches. Lucy was a very powerful witch, but she fueled her magic in the worst way. She used the blood of supernatural children because it was pure. She discovered that the more powerful the creatures, the stronger her magic became. She passed these awful ways down to her daughter, and the horrible act continued through generations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened to Macy&#39;s baby? What does Lucy have to do with this? I&#39;m so confused. How does any of this apply to Allison?&#34; I still didn&#39;t know where to begin trying to figure any of this out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, if you wait a damn minute, I will get to it. Macy&#39;s baby, being the first of its kind and coming from powerful parents, captured Lucy&#39;s attention. She knew that draining the blood of this child would make her the strongest witch to have ever lived. The Moon Goddess kept her promise of protecting this child, so Lucy was never able to drain its blood. So instead, Lucy cursed the child, that every second generation, from this child and on, they would develop a gene, one that made it possible to bear the most powerful supernatural beings the world has ever seen. She did this so that herself and every generation after her, could perform a ritual on Macys&#39; descendants, one that would impregnate them with any kind of powerful beast they wanted. All they would need to do this was a father, or sperm donor, so to speak, one that was so power hungry, they would be willing to drain their offspring&#39;s blood if it meant gaining strength.&#34; Lena looked at me as she spoke the next part,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Moon Goddess knew that this baby was special, being the first of its kind, and she wanted to ensure that witch-werewolf hybrids continued in hopes of one day bringing the two species together. So she made sure that Macy&#39;s baby was mated to a werewolf, one that could always protect her, one that was fierce and strong. She did this for every generation after Macy&#39;s baby too. They were all gifted a strong mate to always protect them. Allison and I are descendants of Macy, and you, my dear, were gifted as her protector and mate. Everything the Moon Goddess does, must come at a cost. So when she gave you peace and strength, she gave Allison a prophecy to fulfill. She must bring all supernatural creatures together as one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As for who took her, she is a descendant of Lucy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a lot to process. The Moon Goddess saw me fit to be her protector, but I have already failed her and, because of that, she is in the slimy hands of some demented witch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s her name? How did she get Allison? This still doesn&#39;t answer where you were all of these years.&#34; So many things still weren&#39;t adding up to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Her name is Summer. The fire that killed Alpha Chase, my daughter and your parents, was caused by Summer. She used it as a distraction to take Allison. Now, to explain how I know all of this and where I have been all of these years. My mate, George, was such a kind and strong man, we did everything together. He was my everything. He was the Alpha of the largest pack in the world, the Blood River Pack. With that title, came a lot of enemies. He went to war with one of the most ruthless packs. It was a blood bath, his borders were breached, and he knew he couldn&#39;t let his people fight without him. He had hidden me no matter how much I begged him to let me help fight. But he couldn&#39;t bear to have me on the battlefield in harms way. I was stubborn. I followed him into battle after he left. When he noticed me out there, he got distracted from the fight he was in, and his head was ripped from his body.&#34; She stopped to wipe the tears flowing from her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The pain of losing George was too much, it was all my fault and I couldn&#39;t live with myself. I knew in my state. I found out I was pregnant a week after his death. At that point, I was already living here, away from everyone and everything. I was in so much pain every day, I would scream and cry until my voice would give out. Until I had no more tears to shed. I wish I could say that I was strong and became the mother that my daughter needed me to be, but I wasn&#39;t. I wasn&#39;t fit to be a mother and I knew that I couldn&#39;t give her the happiness she deserved. When Rachel was born, I traveled all of the way to Canada, where there was a kind Alpha and Luna. I met them when George was alive. I knew that they had been trying to conceive for years. They agreed to raise her as their own and not mention me. They always sent me pictures as she grew up and kept me updated, as luck would have it she met her mate there too, Alpha Chase. I would often go to that pack to watch her from a distance. It was selfish of me. But I never stopped loving her. I just wanted what was best for her.&#34; She took a long exhale before continuing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had dreamt about the fire that killed them, I dreamt about Allison being taken. I knew I had to warn everyone, so I had started my journey back. But I was too late. By the time I got there, the fire was already out and Allison nowhere to be found. I searched for her for years. I tried using locator spells, but the witch that took her is smart and very powerful. She has been blocking me from finding her, it&#39;s like she knows every time I try. I don&#39;t know where she kept Allison all of these years, or why she suddenly let her out just to trap her again. My dreams show me some things, but not everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So far we know that she had Allison under a different name, Grace Young, and she had Allison believing that they were best friends. Other than that, we aren&#39;t sure what else she has done to her.&#34; I stated, worried about my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She might just be more powerful than we think if she could toy with Allison&#39;s brain for that many years. I&#39;m worried that whatever she&#39;s done might not be reversible.&#34; Lena said, her face showed genuine concern for her granddaughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now that you know the whole story, I say it&#39;s time we find my granddaughter,&#34; Lena said as she got up, placing her tea cup on the kitchen counter. She then grabbed some candles, &#34;Place these in a circle around me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Obeying, Chad and I got up from our spots and placed them around her as she sat on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want us to light them for you?&#34; I asked as I started scanning for a lighter or match.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think I can read minds but not light my own candles?&#34; She retorted as all of the candles came to life with an orange flame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then started closed her eyes, crossed her legs and placed her hands on her knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was whispering something in Latin, and she was rocking gently side to side as if there was a light breeze swaying her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m being blocked again, that damn witch.&#34; She spoke as her chants got gradually louder and her swaying got more aggressive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her house was shaking as she was shouting her chants, cupboards were smacking open and shut aggressively, her teacup fell and smashed to the floor. It felt like a tornado coming through the house, everybody braced themselves as if it may be lifted off the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a flash, her eyes snapped open and everything in the house stilled. Silence filled the air as we all waited in anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s too strong, she got into my thoughts, she knows we are coming for Allison.&#34; Lena looked terrified for her granddaughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A:N/Hey readers, this chapter was a little longer and a lot of info to take in so I am sorry if it was a little confusing, tried to break the paragraphs up a bit to make it easier to read, what do you think so far? The unknown pov will be revealed in the next chapter!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace/Allison POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I must have dozed off after my conversation with Summer. I woke up to a throbbing head and aching body. I was cold, hungry and distressed. As if to prove my point, my stomach let out a loud growling sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rubbed my eyes to clear the sleep out of them. I can see clearly in here today, as if a light is on, but I don&#39;t see any lights around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe the drug they gave me is wearing off and my senses are coming back. That same strong rust smell hit my senses. I turned to look and jumped up at what I saw. I had fallen asleep in a pool of blood. Who&#39;s blood? I checked over my body quickly, it was sore from sleeping on the concrete floor, but I had no injuries as far as I could tell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I also noticed how I was able to jump up without a problem. Maybe that was just a burst of adrenaline?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started walking around to look for a way to escape, now that I could see clearly, I noticed I was in a cell with large metal bars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked closer to the cell door to see if maybe I could find something to pick the lock with, but there was no sign of a knob or lock anywhere. That&#39;s weird. How did they get me in here? All I could see was a short hallway to my left, with a big steel door at the end. No windows. A small vent was above my head, but nothing I could squeeze through. It was the size of a book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allison, can you hear me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell, where did that come from? I spun each way, but saw nothing other than the concrete floor and concrete walls. There was no one outside of the cell. What does the voice mean, Allison? Was there someone else that was kidnapped with me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, is anyone there?&#34; I was met with silence. Wait, was Summer behind this again, messing with my brain?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Summer, this isn&#39;t funny. Just let go, I&#39;ve never done anything to you or Dean.&#34; Silence again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allison, it&#39;s me, your wolf Aspen. I&#39;m in your head. Nobody is messing with you right now, I promise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean my wolf, why do you keep calling me Allison? My name is Grace,&#34; I said aloud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allison please, you need to communicate with me in your head, we probably don&#39;t have much time before she realizes you got me back. I&#39;ll explain everything when we get out of here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still skeptical, I replied out-loud again, &#34;How do I know I can trust you and that this isn&#39;t another trick?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Please, don&#39;t you find it odd that you have no memories of your childhood, your life before college, your friendship with Summer? You magically woke up best friends with someone you don&#39;t even know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought about what she said. It is true my earliest memory was the day I woke up for college.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I decided to try and respond in my head this time, not really sure how it worked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lose my memory constantly because of my disease. If you knew me you would know about my disease. I literally take pills for it every day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You don&#39;t have a disease, Allison. Have you puked since you&#39;ve been here? No. Those pills were silver and wolfsbane, they were used to weaken you and keep me sleeping. She needed you weak to play with your mind. We don&#39;t have a lot of time to waste, but I need you to trust me. So I will do my best to heal your memories and help you remember who you truly are.</p>
