                <p>I woke up in a cold,dark place. I couldn&#39;t see anything. A musty, rotten smell filled the air, another smell I couldn&#39;t quite place like metallic or copper. I tried moving my hands, to feel my surroundings, but it was like I was paralyzed. I couldn&#39;t feel my hands, my toes. Starting to panic, I tried to scream, but nothing came out. My throat was so dry, it felt like it was on fire. It hurt to breathe, I felt anxiety and fear crawling up my body, like one thousand little bugs, but I couldn&#39;t swat them away. The feeling felt suffocating, like a heavy weight pushing down on my chest, squeezing my head with so much force. I felt myself forgetting how to breathe, I was fighting, trying to regulate myself, but the anxiety was taking over, consuming me. I couldn&#39;t breathe, I couldn&#39;t move, I couldn&#39;t scream. The darkness in the room feels like it is going to swallow me whole. I am losing the willpower to fight this feeling, I decide to welcome it. I feel myself losing consciousness. Just as I was about to completely give up, I heard a familiar voice,&#34;Did you enjoy the mind tricks? It&#39;s one of my favorite abilities to use. The anxiety, the fear,, oh no it&#39;s consuming you, yada yada yada. My limbs, oh my god, I can&#39;t move, I can&#39;t scream, I&#39;m paralyzed. Somebody help me.&#34; She mocked before she continued,&#34; That is just the tip of the iceberg compared to what I have planned for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want with me? What did I ever do to you? I have been nothing but kind to you.&#34; I muttered, betrayal in my tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now where would the fun be in that? You&#39;ll see very soon. For now you can spend some time here with your thoughts, well, the thoughts that I put in your head. It&#39;s so easy to place images and feelings in your head when you are this weak. It&#39;s so much fun.&#34; She exclaimed while clapping in excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I am famished, I really must be going now, toodooloo darling.&#34; She continued while she walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To say I was shocked was an understatement. How could my best friend do this to me? I considered Summer to be like a sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alone with my own thoughts, I started to feel around now that my mind wasn&#39;t being toyed with by Summer. How was she doing that. I don&#39;t understand. How can someone make you think and feel something so real, to the point I didn&#39;t know how to breathe. I thought I was dying. How long have I been here? Is it day or night?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last thing I remember was trying to leave the bedroom Dean led me to, and then darkness. Dean was in on this? What could I have possibly done to upset two people so much for them to drug me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried moving my arms. This time was successful. Dragging my hand along the cold, concrete floor, I felt something wet, placing my now wet fingers to my nose, I sniffed the strange liquid. It was the same metallic smell I noticed earlier, almost the same as rust. I was praying it wasn&#39;t what I thought it was. It was too dark in here to see what it was. I hope there was just an old leaky pipe nearby. But that smell is so distinct, it was identical to the smell of blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to stand but my legs were shaky and weak. I fell back onto my butt. I would have to conserve my energy if I wanted to get out of here. I thought my best option might be to rest. Maybe that would replenish my strength. It was difficult to fall asleep on the concrete floor, but the exhaustion eventually settled in me and sleep took over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waking up with a start, I realized I was no longer on a concrete floor, but what felt like a soft, memory foam bed. I felt silky sheets around me, and a large soft quilt. I felt comfortable. Could it be this was all a bad dream? That can&#39;t be right though, because this bed does not feel like my own. It must be night time because I couldn&#39;t see any of my surroundings. I knew one thing though, wherever I was, I needed to get out and get help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as I sat up, I heard the sound of heavy-work boots making their way across the floor towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who, who&#39;s there?&#34; I asked, frightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you know who I am darlin&#39;.&#34; Said Deans&#39; gruff voice right next to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dean, what do you guys want with me? I don&#39;t understand. Have I done something to upset you both?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What I want is for you to shut up while I do this.&#34; He growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dean, what are you talking about? Do wha...AH!!&#34; I screamed as I was thrown back onto the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard a low rumble in his chest, then I felt something dragging slowly up my arm. Was that a claw...? Frozen in fear, goosebumps sprouted where he touched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;P..p...please, don&#39;t... don&#39;t do this.&#34; My voice was barely a whisper, stuttering with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next moment, I felt a large-calloused hand fold tightly over my mouth, making it difficult to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sweat started beading on my skin, tears started streaming from my eyes down the sides of my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whimpered as I felt the weight of his body over mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started thrashing with every ounce of strength I had left, kicking and clawing, but it was pointless. He was too strong for my frail build. He grabbed both of my wrists in his other hand and used his legs to pin mine down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave up fighting, my energy was gone. Defeat settled in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He released my wrists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a sharp pain across my skin as my clothes were ripped off of me. I felt a warm liquid trickling down my body where he tore through my clothing. I felt sick to my stomach, everywhere he touched it felt like spiders crawling up my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The top half of his body came off of mine, and I felt relieved, I thought this was some sick joke and maybe he was letting me go. That feeling disappeared and was replaced with terror when I heard the sound of a belt unbuckling and the boots hitting the floor with a heavy thud. A moment later, I heard the rest of his clothes falling on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart rate increased as he put his body back over mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fresh tears and silent sobs escaped me as the reality of what was about to happen sunk in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt him line himself up with my entrance. I inhaled a sharp breath as I prepared for the pain that was to come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of a sudden, the weight of Dean was gone. Like he vanished into thin air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard a slow clap followed by an evil cackle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Girl, that was hilarious, you&#39;re so easy to mess with. You were so scared, as if Dean would ever want you that way. Not when he has me, I mean look at you, bleh.&#34; She made a gagging sound to emphasize her disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Part of me relived that it was just her mind games, but another part was furious, disgusted with her, attempted r*pe was not something to joke about, but here she was laughing about it. Summer is far from the person I thought she was. She is a foul and disturbing person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Summer, that was horrible. What kind of sick person does that to someone? You&#39;re evil.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh hunny, evil is an understatement of what I am.&#34;</p>
