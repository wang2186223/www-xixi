                <p>**Philip**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I sat on the hotel&#39;s third floor, engaged in a meeting and enjoying a cup of coffee, my attention was drawn to Sarah and Jane, visible through the expansive floor-to-ceiling windows. Positioned in the open-air restaurant nestled within the garden below, I had a clear line of sight of my ex-wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Bronn Martin appeared, clutching a bouquet. Witnessing Sarah accept the floral gesture with evident delight, I couldn&#39;t help but clench my jaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;President Cornell?&#34; The private investigator I had hired pulled me from my reverie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss?&#34; echoed Alex, detecting my distraction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snapping back to attention, I turned to face them. &#34;My apologies. What were you saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearing his throat, the investigator continued, &#34;Here are the files you requested. According to my sources, Madam Cornell and Dr. Smith have known each other for over two decades. They hail from the same hometown.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached out and accepted the thick envelope containing the compiled information.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And where is Dr. Smith now?&#34; I inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All the information regarding Dr. Smith is enclosed in that file: her educational background, family details, properties, and her current whereabouts, President Cornell,&#34; the investigator explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But, President Cornell, I must caution you. There may be details in the report that you find displeasing,&#34; he warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can handle it,&#34; I assured him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What else could be more upsetting than knowing they were involved in Sarah&#39;s miscarriage?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the investigator departed, I could not muster the will to review the files. My thoughts were consumed by Sarah, who lingered downstairs. I couldn&#39;t shake the ache in my heart. I felt Alex&#39;s sympathetic gaze, silently recognizing the pain I was going through as he also looked in her direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, why are you letting Madam Sarah&#39;s distress escalate? Have you decided to let her be with Mr. Martin?&#34; Alex inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah is not going to marry Bronn Martin,&#34; I stated plainly. I knew Alex wouldn&#39;t fully grasp my intentions. However, deep within me, I solemnly vowed that Sarah would never, under any circumstances, be with that man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a profound sense of vulnerability, which is why I&#39;m allowing her to slip away. The weight of my inadequacy burdens me. I yearned to be a man of greater wealth and strength, to protect her from harm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mother&#39;s actions had put Sarah in grave danger. During my trip to Dubai, I uncovered her sinister plot involving a doctor swiftly escorted out of Mr. Mitchell&#39;s mansion by security.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of guilt was suffocating. Everything Sarah had experienced, every ounce of pain inflicted upon her, ultimately traced back to my own failings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Discovering Sarah&#39;s true identity as a Benner had initially stung, but it paled compared to the horrors she had faced. I knew she would continue to suffer, which is why I had to deceive Mother into believing I had severed ties with Sarah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lost in my thoughts, I was jolted back to reality when Sarah excused herself from Bronn and Jane. I followed her to the ladies&#39; room, overwhelmed by a sudden surge of emotion. I could no longer restrain myself!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to kiss her caress her feel her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That kiss ignited a fire within me, momentarily easing the burden of my worries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I reviewed the files the investigator prepared, it hit me hard: he was right!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The awful things my mother did were laid out in front of me, and it was too much to handle. Every piece of information about the evil deeds my mother had committed was nauseating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Sarah**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The afternoon, just after my meeting with Bronn, I made my way to Aspire Financial Group, an exclusive association of wealthy financial investors.  Even from the opulent marble lobby, the lavish interior decor caught my eye immediately. Security was extremely tight, requiring identification before accessing the elevators.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked up to the rounded front desk made of polished mahogany, where a smartly dressed man and two neatly groomed women were stationed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi, I&#39;m Sarah Mitchell. I&#39;m here for a meeting-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could finish, a familiar voice cut in. &#34;Well, well Isn&#39;t this the bitch Sarah Mitchell?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Madam Cornell obviously just concluded some meeting of her own and wasted no time launching accusations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trying to seduce another wealthy man with your sleazy tricks?&#34; she loudly accused, clearly trying to make a scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring her, I persisted with the receptionist. &#34;As I was saying-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t believe a word she says. This shameless gold-digger is simply here to entrap and seduce wealthy men, just like all those other escort girls,&#34; Madam Cornell cut me once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed the staff was swayed by Madam Cornell&#39;s words. It&#39;s unfortunate, but Philip&#39;s mother was right that there have been incidents of escorts and sugar babies managing to slip through security to prowl for billionaire prey here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss, I&#39;m here on business, with a meeting in five minutes. Could you please call my assistant-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Madam Cornell laughed. &#34;Tsk tsk tsk... Nice try, Sarah,&#34; pulling out her fancy checkbook and pen. With a smirk, she wrote out a check for $5, waving it at me. &#34;Here&#39;s your taxi fare. This place isn&#39;t for the likes of you Shooo!&#34; She flicked her crimson-lacquered nails in a dismissive shoo-ing motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I struggled to maintain my composure, but her provocation was testing my limits. If only murder were legal, I would have been tempted to throttle her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The receptionist intervened, maintaining professionalism. &#34;Ma&#39;am, who are you scheduled to meet with?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring Madam Cornell&#39;s antics, I affirmed, &#34;I have a meeting with Mr. Johnson, the association&#39;s president.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The receptionist typed into her computer and then looked up at me. &#34;So you&#39;re part of the afternoon executive meeting in the Manhattan Boardroom?&#34; she clarified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t it standard procedure for investors to carry identification?&#34; the receptionist said sternly, giving me a questioning look as to why I did not have my ID ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s precisely why I&#39;m reaching out to you for assistance.&#34; Frustration tinged my voice. &#34;My meeting starts in five minutes, and I should already be inside. I assume my assistant has taken care of my security IDs. However, it&#39;s my first day, and I only know her name. I was instructed to contact her, but unfortunately, I do not yet have her phone number.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah, that&#39;s quite a story you&#39;ve got there! Maybe those drugs you took are still messing with your head,&#34; Madam Cornell said, looking at the receptionist. &#34;I think she&#39;s trying to pull a scam.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gritted my teeth hard as Madam Cornell&#39;s words brought back painful memories of how unfairly she and the doctor treated me. Philip&#39;s mother was purposely trying to anger me, pushing me to my limit.  If she kept it up, I might end up in jail for murder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One more word, woman! And you won&#39;t be welcome in Highland Hills any longer!&#34; I warned, narrowing my eyes at Madam Cornell before redirecting my attention to the receptionist. &#34;Call my assistant now, or I&#39;ll ensure you&#39;re escorted out of this town just like she will be!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my dismay, things went really bad. The three receptionists deemed my behavior unhinged and threatening. They promptly called building security, who firmly escorted me out!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Madam Cornell shook her head, strolling smugly over to her expensive luxury car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ugh!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Madam Sarah!&#34; My two bodyguards, who had remained stationed in our vehicle as they were prohibited from entering, rushed over upon witnessing the incident play out. &#34;What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Call your boss Amir immediately, and instruct him to contact Emily Carter to bring my security ID down here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Consumed by utter annoyance, I impulsively called Philip&#39;s number. &#34;Could you please send your mother away... anywhere? To the moon or wherever! Because if she keeps this up, I&#39;ll end up in jail for murdering her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I miss you...&#34; were the gentle words Philip uttered, calming the storm of frustration inside me. I fell silent, feeling embarrassed by my outburst, my cheeks turning red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hastily ended the call. I should not have called him. Damn it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shortly after, Emily, a tall, elegant woman adorned in a figure-hugging pencil skirt, emerged from the building, but she&#39;s not alone... The president also came down, likely getting scolded by my grandfather.</p>
