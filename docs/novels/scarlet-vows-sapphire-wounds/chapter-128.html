                <p>A few hours had passed since I last spoke with Philip on the phone. Now, he returned, but unconscious and covered in blood. Panic surged through me as I followed Ethan&#39;s group to the room where my husband was being taken, but I was stopped at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah, trust me on this. It&#39;s better if you stay outside for now,&#34; said Ethan before closing the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was then that I noticed Philip&#39;s assistant, who looked at me sadly. In his hands was a paper bag, grease stains showing what was inside-just the buns I&#39;d asked Philip to bring home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears spilled down my cheeks as I turned to Alex, my voice trembling and frantic, eager to get answers. &#34;What happened, Alex? Why is my husband covered in blood? Did something happen to him? Where did Philip go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alex took a deep breath, visibly burdened by what he was about to say. He briefly removed his glasses, rubbed the bridge of his nose, and then looked me straight in the eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s doing this for you, Madam Sarah. He did this to leave Mariano&#39;s group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The name sent a chill down my spine. Mariano. Again!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know how much you&#39;re aware of: Josh was allowed to leave and return to his normal life, which resulted in questions from some of Mariano&#39;s advisors and men. Boss Philip disagreed that Josh would leave without consequences.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alex paused, swallowing hard before continuing. &#34;The punishment is usually not a joke, especially since Josh&#39;s request was to leave Mariano&#39;s team-it often results in death to protect the secrets.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anxiously, I awaited Alex&#39;s following words. My thoughts were split: one part was trying to process this information, to understand the web of danger Philip had been entangled in, while the other remained fixed on the closed door where Ethan fought to save my husband&#39;s life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss Philip expressed his desire to leave the group as well... Ever since that day when Mariano&#39;s men chased you on your return to Dubai, Boss Philip has been looking for a way out. Your safety became his priority, especially now with the pregnancy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hand instinctively moved to my stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mariano agreed to the boss&#39;s request but had to contend with Josh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss Philip brought up the issue deliberately in this meeting to prevent Mariano from refusing. He ensured Mariano&#39;s key people were present as witnesses to prevent any changes to the agreement and to show he wasn&#39;t receiving special treatment. They agreed to physical confrontation. Only the survivor would be allowed to leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My lips trembled at the news. &#34;You... You mean...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Assistant Alex nodded. &#34;Yes, Madam Sarah! Josh is dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Oh, my God!&#39; My eyes widened in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alex refrained from saying more, knowing how close I was to Josh. Philip&#39;s bodyguard had been a great support to me, which made me cry even harder. I couldn&#39;t believe Philip had gone through this to break free from Mariano&#39;s grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did it have to come to this? With Josh gone, now Philip&#39;s life was also at risk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where... where is Josh now?&#34; I managed to ask through my tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mariano&#39;s group is handling the arrangements Madam Sarah, please... You also need to take care of yourself,&#34; Alex pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded numbly, knowing he was right. It would be a waste of their efforts if I didn&#39;t care for myself. Just months ago, all I had dreamed of was starting a family, but I never imagined facing such trials first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone rang, showing Jakob&#39;s number. He might already be waiting for our meeting link because I messaged him earlier to talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I declined the call, sending a quick message instead:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Me:*** *&#39;I&#39;m sorry, Jake. I already know what happened. This isn&#39;t the right time to talk.&#39;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Jakob:*** *&#39;Is everything okay?&#39;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fingers shook as I typed: *&#39;No. Philip is receiving treatment, and I&#39;m not okay.&#39;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Jakob:*** *&#39;Call me when you&#39;re ready. I want to hear what happened.&#39;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I left his message unanswered, my attention drawn back to the closed door where Ethan worked to save my husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath, I steeled myself. Questions whirled in my mind, but I pushed them aside. Philip&#39;s survival was all that mattered now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hours dragged on as I waited outside the makeshift operating room, each passing second stretching into eternity. Finally, Ethan emerged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah, I understand this is a challenging moment,&#34; Ethan spoke softly. &#34;I&#39;ve tended to most of his wounds, but I can&#39;t let you in yet. We need to keep the environment sterile to minimize infection risk. Only my medical team is allowed inside for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan seemed to notice my reddened eyes. He stepped forward and enveloped me in a comforting embrace. &#34;I know you&#39;re desperate to be by his side,&#34; he murmured. &#34;I promise I&#39;ll let you know when you can see him, alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded against his shoulder as he gently led me towards the master bedroom, Alex silently following behind us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip is stable for now,&#34; he assured me. &#34;But Sarah, you need to take care of yourself too. It&#39;s not just Philip who needs you.&#34; His eyes flickered briefly to my round belly. &#34;Remember, two others are depending on you now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded again, momentarily forgetting about the twins waiting for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, take some rest I won&#39;t let you stress yourself to the point of harm,&#34; Ethan urged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lying down on the bed, I endeavored to regain composure, holding back tears. Ethan knew about my history of panic attacks and shallow breathing. Despite months passing since my last episode, when my vision blurred and breathing became shallow, I still needed to calm myself down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The morning sun&#39;s warm rays filtered through the slightly open balcony door, waking me gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a jolt of realization hit me. &#34;Philip!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood up suddenly with my heart racing. My eyes adjusted to recognize the familiar master bedroom around me. Quickly, I grabbed the soft robe hanging on the nearby chair. I quickly tied the robe with shaking hands and rushed down the hallway. The house was eerily silent, making my rapid breathing seem louder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I approached Philip&#39;s room, I noticed a different guard standing watch outside, suggesting Assistant Alex and Ethan had likely gone home to rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;s your boss?&#34; I asked the guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard&#39;s expression stayed blank, revealing nothing. Before he could respond, the door opened with a soft click. A woman in pale blue scrubs emerged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I see Philip now?&#34; I asked eagerly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though a surgical mask covered half her face, I could see the corners of her eyes crinkle with a reassuring smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can go in, Ms. Mitchell,&#34; she replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Entering the room, I found Philip propped up in bed. Our gazes locked, and I felt a wave of relief wash over me. He looked better than I had feared-perhaps Alex, indeed, was a skilled surgeon. A clear IV bag hung next to the bed, with a thin tube running down under a bandage on his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You idiot!&#34; I scolded, and my voice broke as tears threatened to spill over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled softly. &#34;Come here,&#34; he said, his voice slightly hoarse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sniffling, I approached and sat on the edge of the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry if I worried you,&#34; Philip said, reaching out to gently caress my rounded belly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated, I slapped his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ow!&#34; he hissed, wincing slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry! I&#39;m annoyed that you made a deal with Mariano instead of prioritizing your life. What if...&#34; My words stuck in my throat, unable to express the terrifying thought that had plagued me all night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip looked pained. &#34;I know, babe. I know what I did was wrong. Please forgive me...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath, preparing myself for the question that had been bothering me. &#34;What about Josh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip&#39;s eyebrow quirked upward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you&#39;re jealous of him, Philip, but it&#39;s not right for him to die because of me. You should have let him go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, I&#39;m sorry... But Josh wasn&#39;t a good man either, Sarah. He said he&#39;d fuck you and would take our children. It&#39;s no excuse, but he insulted you, and that&#39;s not acceptable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence fell between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I almost thought I was the one who was dead,&#34; Philip continued after a moment. He brought my hand to his lips, pressing a gentle kiss against my knuckles. &#34;Now, I&#39;m free, Sarah... I will be your servant from now on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning carefully against Philip&#39;s side, mindful of his injuries, the steady rhythm of his heartbeat beneath my ear became the most beautiful sound in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a knock on the door interrupted the silent room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;M-Madam Sarah, you&#39;ve got a visitor. Your grandfather and Mr. Benner&#39;s car are outside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, shit!</p>
