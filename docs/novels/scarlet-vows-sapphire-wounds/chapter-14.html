                <p>**Sarah**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smirked as I watched Philip&#39;s eyes widen in disbelief, though I allowed indifference to settle within me as we reunited after a year of lost communication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a deft flick, I transferred the car key into the waiting hand of Amir&#39;s head secretary, Rey. Philip&#39;s stunned expression momentarily froze him in place, delaying his advance towards me. But before he could gather his wits, his team diverted his attention, providing me the perfect opening to vanish into the shadows of departure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With determined steps, I made my way toward the dome&#39;s exit, the weight of Philip&#39;s presence looming behind me like a relentless shadow. We traversed the hallway, a forbidden corridor reserved solely for the elite racers of the day, where only a scattering of staff dared to tread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah!&#34; His voice pierced the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Sht!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a backward glance, I instinctively sought refuge in the shadows near the staircase, holding my breath to evade detection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where the hell is that woman?!&#34; His frustrated expletives echoed against the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;That&#39;s right! Let frustration consume you,&#39; my inner voice whispered, a smirk dancing across my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip?&#34; A man&#39;s voice, presumably Orlie Petrov, interjected. &#34;What&#39;s going on? Why did you leave so suddenly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s Sarah! I saw her! She&#39;s Blaze Belle!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My wife!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Ex, you fool!&#39; I nearly let out a scream, but I restrained myself, crouching behind the stairs with them just on the other side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your wife? That&#39;s ludicrous, man! Are you sure you&#39;re talking about the right person? Isn&#39;t she a simple woman? I mentioned earlier that Blaze Bell has been in the industry for years. I thought your wife was uncomplicated. Can she even drive?&#34; Orlie questioned Philip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip remained silent, his composure intact, though I knew it wouldn&#39;t last. Their voices faded into the distance before I emerged from my hiding spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a frantic pace, I dashed towards the exit gate, where Jakob awaited, his grin visible even from a distance. Without hesitation, I leaped into the passenger seat from outside the car, the wind tousling my hair as I landed gracefully, the open hood of my sports car adding to the dramatic flair of our escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s get out of here!&#34; I urged Jakob, and without hesitation, he ignited the engine, propelling us away from the dome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tired already? And why did you let your ex-husband win the race?&#34; Jakob inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip isn&#39;t foolish. He knows what I&#39;ve done.&#34; The memory of Philip&#39;s handsome visage twisted into a mask of irritation haunting my mind as we drove.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fist tightened into a knot of tumultuous emotions, a tempest raging within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to know if Philip still occupied the same place in my heart, and frustratingly, he still did. I scolded myself for it, the anger at my weakness simmering beneath the surface. Yet, as my enduring affection for him lingered, so did the reservoir of memories that fueled my resentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you know Philip Cornell before you two met and got married?&#34; Jakob&#39;s inquiry sliced through the tension like a razor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I admitted, my voice tinged with a mix of fondness and bitterness. &#34;It&#39;s no secret that I have a passion for racing. I first caught sight of him in a magazine when I was just seventeen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can boldly declare that my infatuation with Philip predated our actual encounter, which is precisely why my heart raced like a wild stallion when Jane finally introduced us at the illustrious Cornell Mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for Jane, I couldn&#39;t shake the sense of longing for her presence. Despite the rift between me and her family, I sorely missed her! While she was upset with me, she empathized with my situation, having her history with Mrs. Cornell, which ultimately led to her leaving Highland Hills City to pursue studies in London.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane&#39;s relationship with my mother-in-law is anything but amicable, and I comprehend the reasons all too well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mrs. Cornell is a lunatic, jealous woman!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your husband was oblivious to your enrollment in university, your career as a computer software designer and engineer, and your involvement in racing? Is he an idiot?&#34; Jakob commented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, it just happened that Philip didn&#39;t care about me-that&#39;s the reason!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip didn&#39;t know I was a Benner princess, too, and my life became chaotic with him added to it. If only he had taken the time to care about me truly, he would have comprehended the depths of my existence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I attempted to push aside thoughts of Philip and promptly requested Jakob to drive me back to Grandpa Mitchell&#39;s mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anyway, I need to inform you that Philip Cornell is our client,&#34; Jakob disclosed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? What do you mean Philip is our client?&#34; I asked, bewildered. Thankfully, Jakob was driving because I would have likely swerved the car in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you recall the visual effects tools and application we submitted to BM Technologies three months ago? It turns out Bronn Martin offered the service to Luminary Production. Your ex-husband will be working on an action and sci-fi film. So, he&#39;s interested in the bidding that took place,&#34; Jakob explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This could be problematic. But technically, we only created a draft of the tools. Our main focus was on partnering with BM Technologies for the AI dating game app we&#39;re designing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three months ago, Jakob and I joined forces with BM Technologies. Freshly graduated, we sought protection from the industry&#39;s giants and preferred to keep our identities low-key. BM Technologies offered us the cover of a multi-million-dollar project, allowing us to operate discreetly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the motivations behind my actions was to evade Philip&#39;s detection. Alex leads a competent investigative team. If Philip were to discover my recent activities, it could jeopardize my partnership with Jakob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have a meeting scheduled with Luminary&#39;s production team next month,&#34; Jakob announced, his tone carrying a hint of bombshell revelation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve got to be kidding me!&#34; I retorted incredulously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not at all. Look, I know Philip Cornell is your ex-husband, but I&#39;m eager to see our work on the big screen, too! Besides, there&#39;s substantial potential for us with this project. Aren&#39;t you at least a bit excited about what your ex might offer us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While I couldn&#39;t deny Jakob&#39;s logic, I still felt compelled to argue. &#34;But let&#39;s not forget, he once suspected a romantic involvement between us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you concerned that your husband-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ex-husband!&#34; I corrected firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine, fine! Ex-husband! Are you worried he might believe his suspicions were valid?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nope. I have no ties with Philip anymore, and I don&#39;t care about what he thinks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Feisty!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All I could do was frown, wondering what good our skills, Jakob&#39;s and mine, were if we ignored the chance Philip had offered us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Jakob&#39;s halted my sport&#39;s car in front of Grandpa Mitchell&#39;s mansion gate, I stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks for the ride!&#34; I said. Despite being the owner of the vehicle, I allowed Jakob to use it, recognizing his significant contribution to my personal growth and development.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See you at Henderson!&#34; he yelled back, speeding off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That lunatic! His words would&#39;ve been lost on me entirely if I hadn&#39;t dared to step foot inside the mansion, where Grandpa Mitchell&#39;s scowl greeted me, emphasizing my presence in a racing suit, embracing my curve. It was at that moment that I realized he had company in the mansion&#39;s expansive living area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There stood a tall figure. As he turned, recognition dawned upon me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s Bronn Martin!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a coincidence, considering he&#39;s the current president of BM Technologies, where I will dedicate my time as a computer graphic engineer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But my main question is: Why is my ex-fiancé here? The one who made Grandpa Mitchell upset with me for three whole years!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; I pondered, my mind swirling with thoughts. Had he found out I applied for a job at his company? But all those concerns dissipated when my grandpa clarified Bronn&#39;s presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re going to resume your marriage with Bronn!&#34; Grandpa Mitchell announced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed a smirk on Bronn&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simultaneously, my phone beeped, and Jakob&#39;s message lit up my screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jakob: Your husband was quick! He&#39;s submitted your photos to the police and announced he&#39;d offer five million to whoever brings you to him. Should I send you to him? It&#39;s not a small sum (accompanied by a grin emoji.)</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That lunatic!</p>
