                <p>I&#39;m deeply grateful that Ethan, Dr. Ruth, and their daughter are safe. They left Chairman Benner&#39;s party early because Dr. Ruth was urgently needed at the hospital for a patient in premature labor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If my friend and his family had been caught in the accident, Sarah wouldn&#39;t have been saved; Ethan wouldn&#39;t have been her surgeon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan and I have an unspoken understanding; we know the situation without needing words. I&#39;ll always be grateful to him for his quick action and unwavering support during this crisis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I was wheeled out of my ward, I saw just how busy the Vanderbilt-owned hospital was for the first time. The corridors buzzed with activity-nurses rushing by with charts, doctors shouting orders into phones, and dazed victims being directed to different departments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Many were injured or killed in the attack. Hotel staff, guests, security personnel... One of your personal bodyguards didn&#39;t make it, and another was injured,&#34; Ethan informed me as he walked beside my wheelchair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stayed silent, but the pain was evident on my face. I was sure the person with me when we encountered Marcus was the one who died, and R1, who looked for Sarah, was the one injured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to Trey. &#34;Please arrange comprehensive compensation for your team.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, boss,&#34; he replied. &#34;I&#39;ll start working on it immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we moved through the maze of hospital corridors, I asked, &#34;What happened to Mr. Amir Benner and his wife?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trey&#39;s response painted a vivid picture of the chaos. &#34;They were at the scene. Ms. Margarette insisted on staying at the party, drawing attention from the other guests. Mr. Amir Benner had to escort Ms. Margarette and her daughter Lila out when the shooting started. Mr. Benner&#39;s wife survived by hiding under a banquet table. Sir Amir&#39;s group called the police because he was outside the hotel, outside the jammer&#39;s range.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we arrived in the ICU hallway, I was surprised to see Josh. The harsh fluorescent lights made deep shadows on his face, highlighting the haunted look in his eyes. His demeanor was dark, not aimed at anyone in particular, but at the cruel twist of fate that had brought us here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing us approach, Josh slowly stood up, his movements stiff as if he&#39;d been sitting there for hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t know your memory had returned,&#34; I remarked darkly. The last time we&#39;d met, Josh had seemed like a shell of himself, his mind fractured and unreliable. But now, as I looked into his eyes, I saw glimpses of the old Josh-the one who had been so close to Sarah and the same person who hated me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My memories began to resurface gradually after encountering Sarah. Aside from Mariano stopping me from causing trouble for both of you, I was also concerned about preserving Sarah&#39;s public image. She&#39;s a mother with a reputation to uphold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh came close to confirming his connection to Mariano. I recalled a fragment of my conversation with Grandpa Mitchell when I was close to death after the Viper Turf War:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I need to know the truth. Are you Mariano?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandpa Mitchell had replied, &#34;No, but I know who Mariano is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hadn&#39;t thought about Mariano for years, but I&#39;m grateful he had left Sarah and me peacefully. But now, the past was crashing into the present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s voice, choked with emotion, jolted me from my thoughts. &#34;I need to know how Sarah is!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Ethan, feeling my throat tighten. I couldn&#39;t bring myself to tell Josh or anyone else the harsh truth about Sarah&#39;s condition. Ethan saw my hesitation and took over. He calmly shared the grim details I had learned earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment of stunned silence, Josh left, respecting my role as Sarah&#39;s husband. The pain in his eyes was just like mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan guided me into the vast ICU ward. He made me put on a mask and then examined my injury before allowing me to enter Sarah&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have a few minutes,&#34; he cautioned. &#34;We can&#39;t risk stressing Sarah in her condition. And you need to return to your own room soon, Philip.&#34; His tone brooked no argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded silently. Ethan and the monitoring nurse stepped back, leaving me alone in the room. The monitor beside the bed beeped steadily in the dim light. Sarah lay in the slightly raised hospital bed, looking pale and fragile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears cascaded down my face the moment I saw her. I fought desperately to keep my grief in check, but the crushing weight of my sorrow was unbearable. At this moment, I felt the full weight of my past actions and the pain I had caused her. This, I realized, was my punishment-witnessing the person I loved most in the world hovering between life and death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Madam Cornell died, I felt the usual grief of losing a parent. But this... this was different. Sarah&#39;s condition felt like a deep wound in my soul as if she had taken part of my life with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah, please...&#34; My voice cracked, raw with emotion. &#34;I&#39;ve wronged you terribly, and I know that. I&#39;ll spend every waking moment of my life making amends. I&#39;ll do anything you ask, anything at all. Call me a brute, a scoundrel, whatever you want. Rage at me if you must, but please... don&#39;t leave me like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streamed down my face. My chest felt like it was being crushed in a vice, each ragged breath a stark reminder of the pain I&#39;d caused. The weight of my actions bore down on me, a cruel and fitting punishment for the hurt I&#39;d inflicted upon her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m in so much pain</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My love,&#34; I whispered, gently holding her hand. &#34;I can still picture the day we met as clearly as if it were yesterday. Your lips were slightly parted when Jane introduced you Your cheeks were flushed, and it was wonderful to imagine kissing them every day&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been ten years since that moment&#34; I continued, tears streaming down my face. &#34;I have a confession to make; that night at the Cornell mansion, I acted like a lovesick teenager and sneaked into your room. I couldn&#39;t help but kiss you while you were asleep. I I had a crush on you but you were only eighteen, a college freshman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You distanced yourself from me when you learned about Megan I was weak back then, trying to find my place in the industry and desperate for support. I didn&#39;t choose Megan as my girlfriend out of love. My mother pushed me towards her from the very beginning, and I followed like a leaf carried by the current, too cowardly to resist.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;On the first day of our marriage, I was secretly overjoyed, yet puzzled. Why would someone as young and full of life as you marry someone like me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I despised you, hated you when you said you only wanted my money! Was that all you saw in me? It hurt deeply. My mother only wanted money from the Cornell family, and telling me you wanted my money was an insult. I&#39;m not trying to justify my behavior, Sarah... I&#39;m asking for forgiveness, even though I don&#39;t deserve it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I want to stay by Sarah&#39;s side, watch over her, and show her how much I&#39;ve changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We haven&#39;t had the grand wedding you deserve, and our children still need both their parents so I&#39;m begging you, don&#39;t punish me like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The agony was too much to bear, and relentless sobs consumed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d give up everything-my life, my future-for yours, Sarah... I love you so much, my love...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept whispering those words, my heart aching. Why does it hurt so much?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nurse came in and told me I had to leave; my visit was over. Trey guided me back to the ward where I would rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we entered, I noticed three unexpected visitors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trey&#39;s alertness heightened when he saw Josh, Mariano&#39;s assistant whom I hadn&#39;t seen in four years, and the glamorous lady lounging on the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze, sharp and calculating, fixed upon me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to piece everything together. Even though my thoughts didn&#39;t make sense, I still found myself asking the question that popped into my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you Mariano?&#34; I gestured towards the lady.</p>
