                <p>**Jane**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strange tightness gripped my chest as I sat by the window in my bedroom, looking out at the neatly trimmed gardens below. I haven&#39;t been able to think clearly since last night. Madam Cornell manipulated me in the past, and I couldn&#39;t believe I was still falling for it now under Madam Olsen&#39;s influence. It left a bitter taste in my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hate Sarah as much as I love her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden knock at the door interrupted my thoughts. Quickly, I wiped my eyes with a lace-edged handkerchief, trying to hide any trace of tears. Taking a deep breath to compose myself, I walked over and opened the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock and fear must have been written all over my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler cleared his throat. &#34;Miss Jane, Madam Sarah wishes to speak with you. Were you available at that moment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My first instinct was to refuse, to slam the door and retreat into my solitude. But I knew I had no right to deny her this conversation. Sarah deserved answers, and it was my chance to voice the doubts that had plagued me. With a slight nod, I stepped back, allowing Sarah to enter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we were alone, she began to speak, &#34;Jane, have I done something wrong to you? To hurt you in some way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t expect her voice to crack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;On my way here, I was thinking carefully about whether I had done anything to deserve what you did to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remembered what Madam Olsen had said-that Sarah had made a fool of me. My friend pretended to be ignorant and weak, making it seem like she gave up studying in London when, in truth, she wanted to marry Philip. Sarah wanted me to feel indebted to her, but she was laughing at me because I still relied on the Cornell name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After reflecting on Madam Olsen&#39;s words, I stared intently at Sarah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Madam Olsen urged me to do it. She told me you were going to the club and said it was the perfect chance to create a rift between you and Brother Philip!&#34; I explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But why, Jane? What wrong have I done to you?&#34; Sarah asked, her brow furrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re the reason I&#39;m in this mess! Madam Cornell abducted me because of you!&#34; Tears streamed down my cheeks, hot and unstoppable. &#34;Do you know she blamed you every time she hurt me? I hold you accountable for everything I&#39;ve suffered because she wouldn&#39;t have targeted me if you were here in Highland Hills that day!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My chest heaved as I gasped for breath, words pouring out like a floodgate had opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were hiding in Dubai while Brother Philip lay in a coma. Madam Cornell used me as a pawn in her game to lure you back to the city. And now? Look at the mess left behind. The Cornell family is falling apart, and my reputation is ruined. But you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My words were bitter as I kept going, unable to hold back the flood of accusations. &#34;You&#39;ve got a perfect family, a great career, and your name shining in the industry. It seems like you&#39;re living a charmed life, doesn&#39;t it? Everything falls into place for Sarah Cornell in the end, doesn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My chest tightened with pain. Sarah left me hanging. I thought we were in this together. I continued, my voice trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You introduced me to Bronn! I created him in my dreams while I designed his non-player character. Bronn came to life in my imagination, my constant companion. He was everything to me, Sarah. Everything! And now I find out he was just another lie, another betrayal. How could you let me fall so deep into that fantasy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah spoke, disbelief in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wish you&#39;d told me you felt this way! Maybe it&#39;s my fault for letting you stay at Amir&#39;s mansion. I thought we&#39;d progress together, Jane... My life hasn&#39;t been easy, you know that! You&#39;ve seen the panic attacks and the mental health struggles that threaten to drown me. And the grief... God, the grief of losing my first child with Philip. It&#39;s a wound that never fully heals.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paused, surprised by the intense pain in Sarah&#39;s voice. Despite my anger, it was difficult to see her cry and to witness the pain on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You, more than anyone, know if I&#39;ve been happy... Jane, I included you in every prayer, in every wish I made. All I wanted was for you to be happy, too. I fought hard to find my own happiness, but my relationship with Philip and my family is far from perfect...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gazed at me, her eyes red and full of pleading. &#34;I never expected you to betray me like you did last night. Of all the people in this world who could have stabbed me in the back, you were the absolute last one I would have ever suspected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;During my first marriage with Philip, during my darkest moments when I felt like giving up, you were my anchor. I loved you not just as a friend but as the sister I never had But what you did last night... it didn&#39;t just hurt me, it shattered my heart into a million pieces.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah took a deep, shaky breath before continuing, her words heavy with finality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I tried to understand, to make sense of your actions, but I have to cut you out of my life It&#39;s not just about me anymore, and I have children who need protection.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Sarah moved towards the door, tears streamed down both our faces. The pain in her chest was palpable, mirroring the ache in my own heart. I could feel the weight of my betrayal, the irreparable damage I&#39;d caused to our bond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt her final severing of ties with me. I tried calling Sarah for forgiveness, but I think she blocked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that night, Dad summoned me to the dining table, clearly upset about the situation. Our family had just started to recover from the Madam Cornell scandal, and now we were thrown back into crisis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brother Philip had been tirelessly protecting my name, but if Sarah filed a complaint against the club, his efforts might not be enough to keep me safe. Dad surprised me with an announcement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The board has decided to remove you from the office... Jane, I don&#39;t know what else to do. I&#39;ve done what I could. I&#39;m sending you to London immediately while we attempt to salvage your reputation here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit my lower lip, fighting back tears as the reality of the situation sank in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dad&#39;s gaze met mine. &#34;You&#39;ve received a marriage proposal from the Martin Family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;But why London? Isn&#39;t Bronn&#39;s family in Nevada? And isn&#39;t he already married to Sarah&#39;s executive assistant?&#39; I kept my questions to myself. At this point, I couldn&#39;t complain; I couldn&#39;t ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three days later, I met the person I would marry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uncertain about what lay ahead, I instantly fell in love with him-a love that felt genuine from the moment our eyes met.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hope this isn&#39;t merely another dream...</p>
