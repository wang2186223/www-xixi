                <p>**Philip**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting beside a mahogany-framed square window, I gazed out at the vast expanse of the Caribbean Sea. The water, a mesmerizing blend of azure and turquoise, stretched to the horizon, its gentle waves kissing the pristine white sands of St. Barts. This tranquil paradise starkly contrasted with the tumultuous thoughts swirling in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept asking myself if what I was about to do was right. Would I be cast as the black sheep, the ungrateful son who turned against his mother? But then I remembered how she always tried to control things, didn&#39;t seem to care about anyone&#39;s feelings, and only cared about being powerful. It felt like I was just a pawn to my parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After finalizing my thoughts, I exhaled heavily and reviewed the long article again. Then, I picked up the phone and called Bronn. He answered immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;President Cornell, what a surprise!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got straight to the point. &#34;I heard you were looking for investors for your LoveLogic game app. I&#39;d like to get involved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane introduced me to Sarah and Jakob&#39;s project. She mentioned they were in the final stages of coding while my sister was crafting a unique non-player character-a virtual boyfriend designed to captivate users.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmmm...&#34; I knew he was likely speculating that my interest stemmed from my complicated relationship with Sarah. I also kept an eye on the stock market, and BM Technologies performed well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I am seeking investors,&#34; Bronn confirmed. &#34;My contract with Luminary and some other security software projects coincided, and that&#39;s where some of BM&#39;s investors&#39; funds went. Launching an app requires a lot of money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I agreed, nodding, though he couldn&#39;t see me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since you&#39;re expressing interest, President Cornell, why don&#39;t we have you join as a non-player character?&#34; he suggested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How does it work?&#34; I asked. I&#39;ve tried investing in game apps in the past, but LoveLogic is new ground for me-it&#39;s a dating app that mixes real life with make-believe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll earn a percentage whenever a player purchases your character as their virtual boyfriend. Since the app uses your appearance as a reference, players get a realistic vision of the character. And if it goes well, we might even get some big-name stars on board.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I winced, feeling uneasy. &#34;Isn&#39;t that... creepy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of people idolizing a digital me feels uncomfortably invasive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bronn chuckled. &#34;You wouldn&#39;t understand this generation, President Cornell. Believe it or not, many people create imaginary characters because, let&#39;s face it, real people are exhausting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bronn explained more details, and we reached an agreement. I invested in Sarah&#39;s project, trusting her entirely with my money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I placed a sell order in the stock market for my shares in Luminary Production. I immediately sold half because the company was doing well. Then, I called Megan&#39;s phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip?&#34; Megan answered</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just checking in to see if you&#39;re doing okay,&#34; I said. Five guards kept a close eye on her, ensuring she remained composed. With Sarah nearby, battling her own panic attack-a situation I had inadvertently triggered-I didn&#39;t want to exacerbate her distress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m alright, thanks for asking,&#34; Megan replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan, I&#39;ve been thinking. Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s time to move out of Serenity Pines?&#34; I interjected before she could protest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Philip-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cut her off, my tone firm but not unkind. &#34;It&#39;s not good that Jane is living with Sarah, and rumors about our relationship are spreading. You&#39;ve been staying at my place for weeks, and it&#39;s not helping the situation. That&#39;s all I wanted to say. Thanks!&#34; Before she could respond, I ended the call, knowing it was the right decision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As uncertainty clouded my thoughts, Trey, accompanied me on this trip, told me, &#34;Boss, the doctor is already at the restaurant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at my laptop screen, where the &#39;publish&#39; button sat innocently, waiting for my command. With a firm click, I released the article into the online world and then closed my laptop with a gentle thud. The article is set to spread quickly, thanks to a big group of internet users known for causing chaos. Surprisingly, they&#39;re everywhere online, always ready to make any scandal even bigger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here&#39;s Madam Cornell&#39;s cellphone,&#34; Trey handed me my mother&#39;s white device.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, immediately switching to airplane mode to ensure no unwanted calls would reach her. With her penchant for solitude, she wouldn&#39;t notice its absence amidst her card games with the maids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, it&#39;s dinner time,&#34; I announced as I descended the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We went to the island&#39;s premier restaurant, where the doctor was a regular patron. The woman&#39;s smile faltered upon spotting us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dr. Smith! What a surprise to see you here,&#34; my mother remarked, her tone dripping with sarcasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feigned surprise, my brows furrowing. &#34;You know each other, Mom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; my mother replied, her lips curling slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her composed demeanor, I sensed Dr. Smith&#39;s unease. &#34;What brings you here?&#34; she inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just vacationing. And you?&#34; my mother countered nonchalantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched Dr. Smith closely. A glance she shot my way said it all. She wasn&#39;t worried about my mom-she was concerned about me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I discreetly signaled Trey, who promptly alerted the nearby police. They had the warrant I&#39;d secured based on the mountain of evidence I&#39;d painstakingly gathered over the past weeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The international police have already issued &#39;Red Notices&#39; to alert authorities in Saint Barthélemy, and I am working with them closely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A group of local police burst into the restaurant. &#34;Dr. Elaine Smith,&#34; the lead officer announced, you are under arrest for the grievous offense of performing illegal abortions.&#34; They recited Miranda rights before handcuffing the unprepared Dr. Smith.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; she exclaimed. &#34;It&#39;s Madam Cornell! She&#39;s the one! Let me go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How dare you!&#34; Mother snarled. &#34;Don&#39;t you dare entangle me in your sordid affairs! You&#39;re the one in handcuffs, not me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, you have to believe me! Your mother orchestrated everything! I was merely following her directives! President Cornell, believe me!&#34; the doctor insisted as she was escorted outside to the waiting patrol car, her voice fading away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I maintained a façade of detachment, but what truly unsettled me was Mother&#39;s utter absence of remorse. She even had the audacity to complain, grumbling about the unfairness of being &#34;pulled into that wretched woman&#39;s fabrications.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s time we returned home, Mother,&#34; I suggested. &#34;It&#39;s time to cut short this vacation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even better! That woman! She&#39;s giving me a headache!&#34; Mother exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We boarded the private jet back to Highland Hills. As my mother searched for her phone, I had no intention of returning it to her just yet; I planned to do so once we reached Highland Hills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon landing, Trey warned the helpers not to say anything to my mother. Initially confused, they understood when we were accosted by a group of reporters at the airport. My mother clearly hadn&#39;t anticipated their presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Madam Cornell!&#34; one reporter yelled, shoving a microphone toward her. &#34;There&#39;s this anonymous blog stirring up trouble with some juicy accusations. What&#39;s your take on it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another, from a national network, chimed in, &#34;Did you really go as far as blackmail and shady stuff like that to keep your spot as Chairman Cornell&#39;s better half?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;President Cornell,&#34; a seasoned investigative journalist asked, her eyes boring into mine, &#34;any theories on who might be behind this exposé?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The barrage of questions unsettled my mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip, don&#39;t listen to them. I-I&#39;m innocent!&#34; she stammered, visibly shaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our security detail formed a human barrier, guiding us through the sea of flashing cameras and shouted questions. Mother seemed oblivious to the severity of the situation. The punishment awaiting her at home would undoubtedly be severe, especially with my father&#39;s wrath, particularly now with Luminary in jeopardy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had made millions by selling stocks before this scandal hit. However, for my parents and family, the losses were substantial</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening, shrouded in darkness, a fleet of police cars rolled up our expansive driveway to invite my mother for investigation. However, they were left empty-handed as my mother had fled the town</p>
