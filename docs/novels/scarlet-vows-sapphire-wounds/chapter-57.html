                <p>**Sarah**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Examining the envelope Josh handed me, I mulled over its contents, weighing the likelihood that it was a gesture of help rather than a potential threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could Jane be aware of Megan&#39;s ex&#39;s identity?&#34; Jakob inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Only Megan knows who that is. I&#39;m not even certain if Philip is aware,&#34; I responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chime from the gate startled me, my heart still racing from recent revelations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced towards the clock, its hands whispering tales of a time long past midnight. Who, in the dead of night, sought entry at this ungodly hour?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone&#39;s at the gate. Just a moment!&#34; I informed Jakob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swiftly navigated to the surveillance feed focused on the gate, surprised by the identity of the figure outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What could they possibly want from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Philip**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Sarah finished getting ready, I received a frantic call from Megan. Tears obscured her words, but the urgency was clear: there was a fire. Soon after, Ethan handed me a hospital report confirming the devastating news: Megan&#39;s villa was engulfed in flames, and preparations for potential injuries were underway. With Megan&#39;s parents away on a cruise, Ethan suggested we check on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We arrived at Megan&#39;s villa to a scene of chaos, muddy roads crowded with rescuers and firefighters battling the blaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goodness!&#34; Ethan voiced our shock at the sight as we surveyed the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To reassure Sarah, I quickly messaged her, trusting that Jane had already informed her of my whereabouts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Me: I&#39;ve got something important to attend to. Catch you later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip!&#34; Megan&#39;s voice called out, drawing our attention to her behind the emergency van. Wrapped in a thick blanket while her hair dripping wet, she was being tended to by a rescuer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Approaching her, she enveloped me in a tight hug, and I found myself soaked, mirroring her damp state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened? Why are you all soaked?&#34; I inquired, concern lacing my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not entirely sure myself. I attended an event tonight. Upon returning home, I encountered an unfamiliar vehicle on the road-a grimy old van. Other than that, everything seemed normal. I retired to bed, only roused by the acrid scent of smoke assaulting my senses. Opening the door revealed my villa engulfed in flames,&#34; Megan recounted, her voice trembling with the weight of the ordeal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic seized her as she continued, &#34;I was at a loss for what to do. Instinctively, I grabbed my phone and headed to the window. Luckily, my room overlooked the pool. Without hesitation, I plunged in, though I&#39;m feeling a bit sore now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wracked with sobs, Megan sought solace in my embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Concern etched Ethan&#39;s features as he inquired, &#34;What about your helpers? Are they safe?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s tears flowed more freely. &#34;That&#39;s my greatest worry. I have only two helpers. One had requested a 7-day vacation, and the other was inside the villa. I&#39;m unsure of her fate, but I pray she&#39;s unharmed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hours of battling the flames, the fire was finally subdued. The investigator then questioned Megan again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Thompson, we have yet to locate one of your helpers, leading us to assume the worst; she&#39;s probably dead by now. However, we&#39;re diligently working to uncover any leads. Additionally, we&#39;ve contacted your other helper, who is currently abroad. Furthermore, preliminary evidence suggests foul play. Have you had any disputes or conflicts with anyone recently?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s Sarah Mitchell,&#34; Megan replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My expression soured. &#34;Are you suggesting Sarah might be behind the arson at your villa?&#34; I asked, incredulous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion flickered across Megan&#39;s face as she glanced at me. &#34;I-I just answered the question.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But it&#39;s implausible for Sarah to be involved. She was at the salon owned by the Vanderbilts. Ethan and I were with her earlier before coming here,&#34; I interjected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But she could have orchestrated it through someone else,&#34; Megan replied tearfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Furrowing my brow, I sensed Megan&#39;s apprehension as she avoided my gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The investigator asked again, &#34;Ms. Thompson, what&#39;s behind your suspicion towards Ms. Mitchell as the instigator?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This morning, I visited Sarah&#39;s home to check on her, as I heard there&#39;s a possibility of us working together again since her return to Highland Hills. My concern lies in her well-being. Given her status as Mr. Cornell&#39;s ex-wife, I&#39;m uncertain of her intentions for returning. However, I haven&#39;t faced any threats or issues in the past few days or months.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There have been rumors circulating about my relationship with Philip, leading me to consider the possibility of jealousy and its potential influence on her actions toward me,&#34; Megan explained, her voice quivering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The investigator turned to me. &#34;Mr. Cornell, is what Ms. Thompson said true?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through clenched teeth, I responded, &#34;Yes, Sarah is my ex-wife; that much is true. But if you&#39;re asking whether she&#39;s capable of setting fire to Megan&#39;s villa upon returning to Highland Hills, it was I who engaged her services. And I vehemently disagree with the notion that jealousy alone would render her incapable of such actions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s eyes met mine, filled with anguish. &#34;Philip, I&#39;m just trying to tell you that things have been tough lately. When I went to see Sarah, she lashed out at me. You can ask your neighbors, and they&#39;ll tell you Sarah insulted me. She didn&#39;t want me there, Philip. She asked me to leave right in front of Mr. Benner&#39;s villa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streamed down Megan&#39;s cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Cornell, please don&#39;t stress about this. We&#39;ll look into your ex-wife&#39;s behavior but won&#39;t narrow our focus to just one angle. There could be other explanations,&#34; the investigator reassured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The interview with Megan left me feeling unsettled, and my mood soured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would it be alright if I stayed with you at Serenity Pines Estate for a while?&#34; Megan inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip, Megan is in a vulnerable state at the moment,&#34; Ethan pointed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, if Sarah found out, I was unsure how to broach the subject with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip, I have nowhere else to go. My home was completely destroyed,&#34; Megan explained, her voice trembling with emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Thompson, we also require your temporary address for the duration of the investigation,&#34; the investigator stated, directing his attention toward me. It almost felt like he was insinuating that I should welcome Megan as a friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very well. You may use Serenity Pines Estate as a temporary residence. I&#39;ll arrange for three bodyguards to ensure your security,&#34; I confirmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I escorted Megan to my villa, sensing her lingering fear and disbelief over the possible fate of her maid. As we stepped out of the car, Megan enveloped me in a grateful hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Philip! I&#39;m relieved you&#39;re letting me stay here at the Serenity Pines.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I returned her embrace, my hand soothingly tracing her back. &#34;It&#39;s fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trey arrived with Josh and three other bodyguards in tow. Josh shot me a pointed look before shifting his gaze to Megan, who clung tighter to my arm. Her apprehension was palpable, her throat tightening with anxiety. I maintained a neutral expression, understanding that she was still unsettled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss!&#34; Trey called out. &#34;We&#39;ve safely escorted Madam Sarah back to Mr. Benner&#39;s villa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan, these are my bodyguards,&#34; I introduced each of my men. Aside from Trey, Megan hadn&#39;t met the others I often brought out of town for business. Turning to Megan, I added, &#34;Three of them will stay with you in the villa while I&#39;m away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her grip tightened, panic flickering across her features. &#34;W-what do you mean they&#39;ll guard me while you&#39;re gone? Aren&#39;t you staying here with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nope! That&#39;s not going to work!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I maintained my composure. &#34;I&#39;ll allow you to stay at Serenity Pines Estate with them for protection. So, don&#39;t worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice trembled as she pressed further, &#34;W-where are you going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You needn&#39;t trouble yourself over that, Megan,&#34; I assured her gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I&#39;m not trying to meddle, Philip. I&#39;m feeling a bit anxious and embarrassed about being here alone while you&#39;re away,&#34; Megan explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, don&#39;t concern yourself with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I plan to ask Sarah if I can stay at her place tonight. That woman had the balls not to reside with me in Serenity Pines Estate, so I&#39;m grateful to have the opportunity to stir things up for her at Mr. Benner&#39;s villa!</p>
