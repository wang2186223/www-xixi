                <p>**Philip**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m here at Serenity Pines Estate, seeking a bit of solitude before midnight passes. Despite weeks of working nonstop, Sarah&#39;s presence lingered everywhere. Her hold on my heart hasn&#39;t faded with time or distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as I stepped through the door, it felt like I could see a younger Sarah sitting on the couch, waiting for me. In my mind&#39;s eye, she stood, a warm smile gracing her lips. &#34;Have you eaten?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reality hit hard as my fist clenched. These were just memories, as delicate as spun glass. I walked to the kitchen, where the marble countertops glowed in the moonlight. My hands shook as I reached for the crystal decanter, pouring a generous amount of aged scotch. The amber liquid shimmered, offering a brief escape from my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bought Serenity Pines on the second night Sarah and I were married, ensuring it had top-notch security. Sarah might not have noticed, but every part of this home was a tribute to her-from the soft cream bedroom walls to the handcrafted bookshelves filled with her favorite books, according to Jane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scotch burned a path down my throat as I lost myself in memories. One glass became two, and it became half the bottle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ve lost track of time. In the back of my mind, I knew Iris and Rowan were waiting in Villa Serafina, probably wondering why Daddy was late again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My feet shuffled across the soft carpet as I headed to our bedroom. My chest tightens at the thought of how much of a dishonorable husband I&#39;ve been. But this room also used to be filled with Sarah&#39;s scent, her laughter, her smiles</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like Sarah was sitting at the edge of the bed. Kneeling there, I clutched the cover, and tears streamed down my face. How long has it been since I last felt her hand in mine? How long have I been hurting like this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pain, which I had kept hidden during the day, came out in heavy sobs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please come back, my love&#34; I plead into the darkness. This morning&#39;s breakfast flashed through my mind-Rowan&#39;s innocent gray eyes looking up at me over a bowl of cereal, asking when we would visit Mommy. The question had lodged in my heart like a splinter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it&#39;s the alcohol deepening my emotions, but I can&#39;t stop the tears as I crouch on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip?&#34; The voice makes me freeze. I look toward the door, where the sound of my name came from. Our room is dark, but I see my wife&#39;s figure in a white dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah never wore white. In the four years she spent as Iris and Rowan&#39;s mother, she recovered from mourning our first child, but she only wore blue, gray, and black-nothing colorful, nothing bright, no white</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you an angel?&#34; I murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I miss you, Philip&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gray, round eyes offered me a sense of calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not going to leave me again, are you?&#34; I asked, my voice tinged with hurt and desperation. I must have been intoxicated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Sarah**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My car&#39;s wheels crunched on the gravel as I drove up to the gate of Serenity Pines. The estate stood dark and imposing, its windows like empty eyes in the night. I parked behind Philip&#39;s black sedan, my heart racing with anticipation and a bit of nervousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trey, Philip&#39;s bodyguard and driver, was leaning against his car. As recognition dawned in his eyes, he inhaled sharply. I pressed a finger to my lips, signaling him to keep quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;M-Madam Sarah!&#34; he exclaimed in a low tone as if he had seen a ghost. He approached me, eyes wide. &#34;It&#39;s true! It&#39;s really you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s Philip?&#34; I asked. &#34;Why are you still here? I&#39;ve been at Villa Serafina with the children for some time now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve been here for a while?&#34; His lips parted further. &#34;No one reported to us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted to surprise Philip,&#34; I explained. &#34;I&#39;ll go inside.&#34; I didn&#39;t wait for his response and entered through the slightly open gate. The lights throughout the villa were dim as if they had been intentionally kept dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The front door opened quietly at my touch. The living room was empty, showing signs of loneliness. In the kitchen, a half-empty bottle of scotch and a used glass hinted at lonely night and unspoken sorrows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My feet carried me up the stairs, and I found him in our bedroom, hunched over by the edge of the bed, his body wracked with sobs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight pierced my heart like a dagger. I used to think there was no hope that Philip would love me, but here was the evidence...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chose to keep our children away from Serenity Pines so they wouldn&#39;t see him at his lowest. He didn&#39;t want them to witness his sorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip...&#34; I called softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I never thought Philip could surpass the love I had for him. He loved me more deeply than I ever felt capable of loving him. Love is not a competition, but my feelings for him felt inadequate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart constricted when he asked if I wouldn&#39;t leave him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes...&#34; I replied, approaching him and offering my hand to help him stand. He took it but placed his weight on the bed to help himself up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you an angel?&#34; Philip asked, his rough hands gently holding my cheeks. The pungent smell of whiskey on his breath made me wonder if he was sober.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fought back a chuckle. &#34;No, Philip... just me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ran his fingers through my hair, his gaze moving from my cheek down to my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Happy birthday, Philip!&#34; I said, forcing a bright smile despite my jetlag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled me into a hug. &#34;Thank you, my love&#34; After a moment, he seemed to realize. &#34;I need to sober up. I can&#39;t go home like this. Iris would give me that disapproving look, and Rowan... would figure out I&#39;ve been drinking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve done well, Philip. Our kids are amazing!&#34; I felt tears prickling at the corners of my eyes, overwhelmed by the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thumb gently brushed away a stray tear. &#34;Don&#39;t cry... Will you stay with me for a while? Just until I&#39;m more... presentable?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course!&#34; Didn&#39;t he know I had just arrived from another country? Thankfully, I&#39;d slept through the entire flight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serenity Pines will always be our sanctuary of love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scent of pine and lavender filled the air as we settled into the soft bed with Philip&#39;s arms around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I silently prayed for smoother sailing ahead-no more earth-shattering revelations or family crises. We could navigate this new</p>
