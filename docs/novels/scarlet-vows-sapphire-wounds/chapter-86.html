                <p>**Sarah**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bronn and Jakob welcomed us at the airport. BM Technologies is located in a nearby metropolitan area. The presentation and launch of LoveLogic are set to take place in a hotel-casino, and Bronn has invited numerous personalities. Amanda accompanied me on the trip while Pepper was left in Jane&#39;s care at Amir&#39;s villa in Highland Hills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is part of a long list of business trips my assistant and I will attend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we walked, Jakob explained, &#34;The launch date for LoveLogic has been pushed up. It&#39;s a strategic move. It&#39;s better to introduce it to the market now than to face potential accusations of plagiarism later. Bronn says we&#39;ve got significant backing-venture firms, and angel investors. They pulled strings to get us a prime slot at the launch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, understanding the pressure. Me and Jakob have been working round the clock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve wrapped up five phases, laying a strong foundation that should captivate players for a few months. However, there&#39;s no time to pause. As they delve into these phases, we&#39;ll be hard at work coding new scenarios, crafting even more realistic characters, and bolstering our security measures. We&#39;ll unveil our special characters to our VIP players in two months.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And that, my friend, is why we&#39;re in this neon-lit, casino-studded town!&#34; Jakob said, smiling broadly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. That&#39;s when I noticed that Emily and Bronn, who were following us, were both quiet. Amanda was ahead, talking to the hotel staff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Hmmm What&#39;s up with those two?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey!&#34; I called to Jakob, not wanting to be overheard. &#34;You didn&#39;t answer my question about Emily&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jakob draped his arm over my shoulder, effectively shielding our conversation. &#34;Uh, you&#39;re safe with her, don&#39;t worry!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not just that She quit as my assistant, then changed her mind. Does she resent me? Did I push too hard?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I also wondered if she knew my true identity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah, you also have to trust your instincts. Do you think Emily is dangerous?&#34; my friend asked curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at Emily, observing her closely. She seemed tense but not hostile. When our eyes briefly met, I noticed fatigue and maybe a bit of worry but no sign of ill intent. &#34;No,&#34; I concluded. &#34;I don&#39;t think she&#39;s dangerous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then that&#39;s all that matters. You have to get to know her personally. Not every puzzle needs solving, and not everyone needs investigating. Sometimes, the best information comes from just talking to someone,&#34; Jakob reasoned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;s got a point! As time passes, I&#39;ll become even more acquainted with my assistant. I merely shrugged. What matters most is that I have yet to encounter any issues with her thus far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stepped into the luxurious suite, the door swinging open to reveal a space that was less a hotel room and more a high-end apartment, complete with three bedrooms. Amanda would occupy one of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your security team is booked in the adjacent room, so there shouldn&#39;t be any personal space concerns, but they&#39;ll still be close if needed,&#34; Bronn informed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about Emily?&#34; I inquired. &#34;I don&#39;t mind if she stays here in my suite.&#34; My eyes drifted to the third bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about your assistant. I&#39;ve also booked a separate room for her,&#34; Bronn assured. &#34;Is that arrangement acceptable to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No problem at all. That&#39;s thoughtful of you, Bronn! Thanks for sorting that out, too!&#34; I smiled and expressed gratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s a relief that Emily will have her own space. I realized I hadn&#39;t even asked if she had a spouse or family waiting for her back home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enjoy your evening, Sarah!&#34; Emily&#39;s voice cut through my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, dear! If you need anything, drop me a message. And please keep your phone on, if it&#39;s alright, so I can reach you easily if needed,&#34; I requested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded understandingly. &#34;Of course!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Per our agreement, Bronn escorted Emily to her room while Jakob and I settled in to discuss LoveLogic and our presentation to the investors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After two hours of planning, Jakob stood up from the comfy chair, stretching his long limbs. It was already nine o&#39;clock. &#34;I&#39;m famished,&#34; he said. &#34;Let&#39;s grab a late dinner or maybe even hit a party! My treat. Meet me at Prime Steakhouse in a bit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I agreed, but then I remembered. &#34;Oh, and make sure to dress up. They&#39;re strict about the dress code there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression soured. &#34;Should I change our plans to room service instead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, come on! You hardly ever get dressed up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine!&#34; Jakob grumbled as he left the suite, despite being the one who suggested going out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This rascal!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sent Bronn and Emily messages, inviting them to join us for the late dinner. I felt a little guilty as I texted Emily. I forgot to check if she had eaten already. Jakob and I were so focused on our work that it slipped my mind to ask. She might have already drifted off to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither of them replied, so I assumed they were resting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before heading out, I knocked on Amanda&#39;s door to inform her of my activity. She responded from within, sounding sleepy, but expressed her preference to catch some rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guided by a stoic guard, I weaved through the maze-like halls of the lavish estate, heading for Prime Steakhouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sent a quick message to Jakob: I&#39;ll wait for you at Prime Steakhouse. I&#39;m starving!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jakob&#39;s reply came soon after: I&#39;ll be there shortly. I&#39;m not accustomed to dressing up. I&#39;m cleaning up my thick layer of dirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What an idiot!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I strode through a corridor, I caught sight of Emily exiting a room. Ah, so her quarters are close to mine. She looked stunning in her blush chiffon dress, as though she had plans for the evening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Emily!&#34; I called out, but she had already disappeared around the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps she had already seen my message. In the hallway, she was with Bronn. They were having a heated argument, standing close with tense bodies and faces almost touching. They were so focused on their argument that they didn&#39;t see me or the other guests quickly moving by, stealing glances at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dimly lit hallway and my black attire allowed me to observe without being noticed. A few other people milled about, but my attention was solely on them, and this is where I gleaned all I needed to know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bronn stood in Emily&#39;s way, blocking her path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you leave, Emily?&#34; he demanded, his voice filled with both pain and rage. It was a tone I&#39;d never heard from him before, so full of emotion and vulnerability. Did they know each other outside of work?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me go, Mr. Martin!&#34; Emily&#39;s tone was firm, and her frustration was evident. I contemplated intervening, but curiosity kept me rooted in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Answer me, damn it!&#34; Bronn persisted. The calm mask he usually wore disappeared, showing a man deeply troubled by unanswered questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want an answer? Because you&#39;re marrying Ms. Benner! I left because it was the right thing to do! What did you expect? That I&#39;d stay, be your mistress? Be your special someone on the side? Your comfort in bed?&#34; Her voice trembled at the end. &#34;I have rules, Bronn. I do what&#39;s right, even if it hurts me. So don&#39;t you dare question my choices!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt as though I had walked right into the middle of a soap opera. The scene playing out in front of me was filled with such intense emotions and personal turmoil that I couldn&#39;t help but feel like I was intruding on something private.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why come back? You were gone. I Why return and stir everything up again?&#34; Bronn retorted, frustration evident in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to stay silent, I interjected, catching both of their attention. &#34;You know what I hate?&#34; I muttered, seizing the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily couldn&#39;t meet my gaze while Bronn released his grip on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Men who ask dumb questions when the answers are staring them right in the face! Now, you better start talking. What the hell is going on here?&#34; I directed my question at Bronn, convinced he held the key to the truth.</p>
