                <p>**Sarah**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fell silent momentarily, carefully considering the mysterious person on the motorcycle. He was clad in a black leather jacket, which made me doubtful it could be Philip. My former husband would never don such rebellious attire. Philip had also never brandished a gun before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only thing my ex-husband did was perv on me. That mysterious man&#39;s behavior is far from Philip&#39;s personality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, when I looked more closely at the person&#39;s body shape and height, an unsettling thought crept into my mind: it could indeed be Philip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you connect or think that person was Philip?&#34; I asked Jakob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because of this.&#34; Jakob showed me surveillance footage of the motorcycle passing through a particular street. &#34;That road leads to Dr. Ethan Vanderbilt&#39;s mansion. I also got a clear shot of the motorcycle&#39;s plate number, and guess what, the motorcycle is registered to Philip Cornell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My lips parted involuntarily in a small grimace of shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Before you think your rescuer might be Dr. Vanderbilt, remember it&#39;s impossible. The doctor is taller than Philip Cornell and has a different body shape. You were at the scene. Can you say that Dr. Vanderbilt was that mysterious man?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To this day, I still don&#39;t fully know Philip. &#34;He called me that night with such nonchalance, as if utterly oblivious to my situation. The tone of his voice was so normal, so casual when he inquired about my whereabouts. Are you saying he knew I was at the airport that evening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Sarah, because he&#39;s Philip Cornell! You were in Highland Hills, and he likely figured out where you were and tracked your movements.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not only that, but I even considered letting him stay at Amir&#39;s house! Damn it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jakob asked, &#34;You said earlier that you booked a ticket to Dubai at the Cornell office. Did anyone notice you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I spoke to Jane. I told her I wasn&#39;t going to Amir&#39;s villa because I had a business trip. I entrusted her with the security keys to the villa. However, when I returned to my workstation, I fear someone may have noticed my intended destination displayed on the computer screen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jakob&#39;s face soured. &#34;You didn&#39;t lock your computer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I forgot...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jakob could no longer hide his frustration and unleashed a stream of stern warnings. &#34;Sarah, I hate to say this, but if you add Philip to the many people who want to kill you, you&#39;re just digging your own grave. Madam Cornell wanted to kill you, and so did those bitches Jessica and Megan. Who else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Marcus!&#39; I inwardly reminded myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jakob remained unaware of the situation, and I was reluctant to burden him further. His words struck true, leaving me unable to offer a response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you truly desire, Sarah?&#34; Jakob pressed gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jake, the truth is, for the past few months, I&#39;ve been convinced I was battling heart failure. My sole ambition was to find someone who could love me. I wanted to experience the beauty of being loved by a man, something that was cruelly denied to me in the past. With my death looming, I doubted I&#39;d achieve much else. All I wanted was to embrace self-love while helping you fulfill your dreams...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My confession caught him off guard. &#34;I told Bronn not to include me in the official list of LoveLogic developers because I want to leave this world quietly when my time comes. I don&#39;t want people thinking I&#39;m trying to use my impending death as a marketing ploy for our game application.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But then,&#34; I continued heavily, &#34;I discovered the truth; I became confused. It was like being violently yanked back to square one! And then Philip reappeared. I find myself wanting to change my perception of him-to understand or maybe even justify to myself why I loved him so deeply before,&#34; I confessed to Jakob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah...&#34; Sadness clouded Jakob&#39;s expression. &#34;You&#39;re only complicating matters. Do you realize that? You know you two can&#39;t be together again, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded solemnly, hot tears pricking my eyes. &#34;I&#39;m painfully aware. With Madam Cornell and Megan in the picture, a future with Philip seems impossible. His whole family dislikes me, and as long as his mother is around, Philip and I can&#39;t move forward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;From what I&#39;ve witnessed, Philip Cornell isn&#39;t good for you. Haven&#39;t you forgotten how much pain and heartbreak he caused you? As your friend, I must remind you-you don&#39;t seem to realize he&#39;s still treating you like a doormat, just as he did before.&#34; Jakob spoke with earnest concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pursed my lips at his blunt assessment but offered no argument. As much as it stung to admit it, I knew Jakob spoke the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s a manipulative bastard, Sarah! You&#39;re not free to do as you please because Philip still has an unhealthy grip on you! Even the bodyguards he assigns to watch over you and supposedly protect you are untrustworthy. Well, I think Trey is different because he&#39;s the only one I&#39;ve seen who has no shadowy connection to Mariano.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trey had been there as Philip&#39;s bodyguard even before my ill-fated marriage to Philip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah, you need to safeguard your heart. Philip Cornell allowed his ex, Megan, to stay at Serenity Pines Estate. Do you still think they have no inappropriate relationship going on? He subjected you to so much mistreatment in the past! He confined you to Serenity Pines while he did as he pleased. I won&#39;t let you return to Luminary Productions for the sake of this project. I&#39;ll speak with Bronn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I no longer argued with Jakob because he made very rational points that resonated with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following my conversation with Jakob, I delved into Philip&#39;s messages. He was searching for me as if bewildered by my absence. I gathered my thoughts and confronted the full reality of how Philip had coldly betrayed me until the very bitter end. For a few misguided weeks, I had foolishly forgotten my original goal because Philip had been around me, trying to reel me back in no doubt. What an idiot I&#39;ve been!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss, it&#39;s time for dinner,&#34; Amanda roused me from my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and trailed behind her to the dining area, formulating my plans in my mind. Upon arrival, Grandpa Mitchell and Amir were already seated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I drew in a deep, steadying breath, ready to articulate my thoughts and intentions. &#34;I&#39;m accepting your offer, Grandpa,&#34; I declared with resolve. &#34;I&#39;m going to take charge of managing my late mother&#39;s stocks, funds, and assets that she left to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandpa Mitchell nodded in approval while Amir looked directly at me. &#34;Are you absolutely certain about this, Sarah? Remember, you might face opposition from Dad in the business. There are also plenty of others who will sadly underestimate your capabilities just because you&#39;re a woman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not worried. Grandpa will support me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandpa Mitchell smiled proudly at my resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Furthermore,&#34; I continued, &#34;I intend to strengthen my influence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh? How do you plan to do that?&#34; Amir asked, still sounding a bit conscious about what my plans fully entailed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll accept Bronn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before they could reply, Grandpa&#39;s security guard purposefully entered the dining area. &#34;Excuse me, sir, for interrupting your family time. We have visitors for Ms. Sarah...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both men seated at the table immediately directed their attention towards me. I shrugged, unaware of who the visitors might be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s President Cornell and Bronn Martin,&#34; the guard declared.</p>
