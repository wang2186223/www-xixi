                <p>**Sarah**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip!&#34; His name escaped my lips in a breathless gasp as waves of ecstasy crashed over me, reaching their crescendo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah...&#34; Philip spoke in a husky voice, rough with spent passion. Our eyes met, his dark to my molten gray, still charged with the aftershocks tingling through me. But then my stomach rumbled loudly, breaking the intimate silence and shattering the spell between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My cheeks grew warm as I couldn&#39;t help but burst into giggles. Philip&#39;s broad smile showed his affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I curled up on the couch, longing for his smile. He nuzzled against me, peppering tender kisses along my collarbone as his rough palm lovingly stroked my flushed cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Haven&#39;t you eaten yet?&#34; he asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have&#34; Jakob and I had snacks in my suite, but I grew tired from explaining the presentation. &#34;Anyway, you have a trip tonight too...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip took my hand, brushing featherlight kisses across my knuckles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure I can&#39;t come with you?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face turned serious as he shook his head. Philip pulled me close, wrapping his strong arms around me to prevent further questions. His masculine scent enveloped me, reminding me of him. He led me to a cozy dining area and seated me on a soft cushion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What would you like?&#34; Philip asked, eyeing the food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmmm... I want some of those blueberries and chocolate,&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He arranged a small plate with the juicy indigo orbs and sumptuous chocolate biscuits, placing it in front of me. Philip&#39;s smoldering gaze pierced me and I cleared my scratchy throat to calm my heart down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to thank you for investing in Jakob&#39;s project. Isn&#39;t Luminary Production still having issues? Won&#39;t Chairman Cornell question you?&#34; I asked curiously as I sipped my wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I&#39;m asked, I&#39;ll simply answer, &#39;I just supported my wife,&#39;&#34; he replied calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words made my cheeks flush. I continued eating while Philip watched me, occasionally sipping his wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, the doorbell rang again. Philip went to answer it, revealing Trey outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, it&#39;s time. We&#39;ll be late for the flight,&#34; Trey announced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give me five minutes,&#34; Philip replied before closing the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he returned, regret was evident on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re leaving?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gently held my face in his big, warm hands. &#34;I&#39;ll see you soon, my love...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;My love...&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As those words escaped his lips, my heart fluttered with joy. And so, we sealed our farewell with a tender, lingering kiss</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Philip left, I called for Josh. I couldn&#39;t stop worrying about Philip&#39;s trip. I hadn&#39;t seen any lists of races happening in Europe, so where exactly was Philip going?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I began to suspect that Philip might have another job for Mariano and used the trip as an excuse with me. Josh, being one of Mariano&#39;s informants within Philip&#39;s team, must know more. Since he already involved me in their affairs, I decided to seize this opportunity to find out what was going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss, Josh has arrived and is waiting outside,&#34; my guard informed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please let him in,&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh entered the suite, having already been friends with my guard after the incident the other night. He hadn&#39;t even taken a seat before asking about my condition. We couldn&#39;t speak freely when Philip was around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are you? Does your head still hurt?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. &#34;No, after those IV treatments, the pain has subsided for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t understand why trouble always seems to find you,&#34; he said, shaking his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shot him an annoyed glare. &#34;I&#39;m only human, you know! I get hurt sometimes, and I need to vent my frustrations. Besides, I had my guard there with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tsk! Who was nearly blinded after you sprayed him with pepper spray? Good thing your guard is patient. If I hadn&#39;t gone to the bar, he wouldn&#39;t be here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop scolding me, okay? I called you here to discuss Philip, not lecture me. Does Mariano have anything to do with Philip&#39;s sudden departure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s face soured. &#34;I just commented on your inclination to dangerous situations, and now you&#39;re actively seeking out more potential danger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is exactly why I can&#39;t feel any danger from Josh. He acts like an overbearing doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on! I&#39;m just curious! I wanted to watch his race. I&#39;m not planning to join the competition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see Josh holding back his annoyance. &#34;Fine! Since I know I can&#39;t stop your persistence in this matter, I&#39;ll tell you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grinned initially, but my smile gradually faded as Josh revealed the disturbing truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mariano told your husband he had to force you to join the race that happened two weeks ago. It&#39;s clear President Cornell didn&#39;t want you involved in Mariano&#39;s schemes, and now Mariano isn&#39;t pleased your husband didn&#39;t follow his lead. Unfortunately, this is the second time President Cornell has defied him. We already know Mariano punishes those who don&#39;t comply.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was momentarily stunned as I pieced together what had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What was the first instance of him not following orders?&#34; I asked Josh, nervous it might also involve me. &#34;Wait, is this related to what happened last month? The incident at Highland Hills?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right!&#34; Josh confirmed. &#34;Mariano killed his assistant after the assistant instructed his men to kill you, Sarah. You must realize by now that Mariano has an inexplicable fondness for your husband. President Cornell often acts on Mariano&#39;s behalf in business transactions. It seemed the assistant didn&#39;t like President Cornell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, so that must be why I was being tailed by that suspicious white van last month. T-then, Philip intervened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I trembled as I realized everything. I now understood Philip&#39;s change after our talk in Dubai and why he wanted to keep our sudden marriage in Las Vegas a secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;President Cornell didn&#39;t want to invite you in this race because he knows it&#39;s dangerous,&#34; Josh added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s another thing I don&#39;t understand. I checked all the major racing schedules and couldn&#39;t find any legitimate events happening in Europe soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh looked at me as if I had three heads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My face turned serious. &#34;Admit it, Josh what is Philip&#39;s punishment for disobeying Mariano this time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh hesitated before replying in a grave tone, &#34;This race, Sarah. You won&#39;t find any details because it&#39;s an illegal street racing event. Forcing President Cornell to compete is his punishment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shit!</p>
