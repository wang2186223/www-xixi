                <p>**Sarah**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was caught off guard when Amir&#39;s voice echoed through the phone. The cliché of being shocked barely captures the depth of my surprise. For a brief moment, my thoughts faltered as a wave of disbelief swept over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amir&#39;s resentment towards me stemmed from a misunderstanding regarding his girlfriend, an accusation I vehemently denied. Despite my attempts to explain, he stopped all communication for three long years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brother?&#34; I interjected, attempting to cloak my uncertainty with a hint of reassurance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, that&#39;s right!&#34; His confirmation echoed hollowly, a stark reminder of the chasm between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ache of longing for my brother pierced through me like a dagger. Yet, the cruel reality remained-he had already severed our ties. In the pregnant pause that followed, I believed he sensed the tumult of emotions raging within me, wordlessly echoing the void between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen, I understand there&#39;s been tension for three years, but blood runs deep between us. We&#39;ve always leaned on each other,&#34; Amir said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You severed that bond when you chose to believe and prioritize your toxic girlfriend over me!&#34; The words slipped from my lips, dripping with resentment. In my anger, I even forgot her name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah, Jess is a good woman. We&#39;re getting married soon,&#34; his voice rang through the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah, Jessica Woods! The name echoed in my mind like a sinister refrain. With a bitter laugh, I couldn&#39;t help but scoff at the cruel irony of it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, congratulations! Is that the sole purpose of your call? To flaunt in my face that despite her reprehensible actions, you&#39;re choosing to marry her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Join me in my foolishness!&#39; That&#39;s the sentiment I want to convey. It seems like folly has taken root within my family. I&#39;ve long confided in Amir about Jessica&#39;s true feelings towards him, how she doesn&#39;t truly love him and is only interested in Benner&#39;s wealth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But here&#39;s the kicker: Amir&#39;s infatuation with Jessica was so intense that he hung on her every word despite my warnings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went to the same college as Jessica and found out she was having an affair with a professor and flirting with other students. I told Amir about it, but like a viper slithering into the garden of trust, she poisoned his mind against me, weaving a tapestry of lies and manipulation that clouded his judgment and obscured the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In retaliation, Jessica subjected me to all manner of torment at school. She harassed me relentlessly, even spreading malicious rumors that I was pregnant and the father had an addiction. Naturally, none of it was true!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite my attempts to share this with Amir, he didn&#39;t listen, even going so far as to accuse me of causing the rift in his relationship due to alleged bullying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I should have reveled in their breakup, but I was overshadowed by Jessica&#39;s sinister manipulation of my brother, leaving me feeling utterly abandoned and betrayed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came the incident on the yacht when Jessica fell into the water; Amir not only ignored my pleas but also accused me of nearly causing her drowning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Faced with such unjust blame and betrayal, I transferred schools to Crestwood University and started anew in Highland Hills City.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen, that&#39;s just one reason I called you. I genuinely wanted to check on you. I brought you to the hospital last night after finding you outside your villa. But despite your lingering flu, your husband shamelessly insisted on taking you home. I assumed you were content with your life after leaving Grandpa Mitchell&#39;s estate, cutting ties with me, and marrying into the Cornells.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I thought so too... I thought my life would be happier.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His question reignited a tempest within me, threatening to unleash a torrent of tears once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You brought me to the hospital?&#34; The recollection of my dream, where Amir&#39;s face was a blur, suddenly felt real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, but your husband callously brought you back home. He showed no concern even if you were on the brink of illness in your villa!&#34; His tone betrayed his frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My lips twisted into a tight, bitter line as a surge of emotions threatened to engulf me. The validity of Amir&#39;s words cut deep, especially after encountering Philip&#39;s audacious ex-fiancée, who callously suggested I should leave my husband as if it were an easy undertaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll take you back to the hospital now to ensure you&#39;re okay,&#34; Amir offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As my strength waned and a deep longing to see Amir grew within me, I fervently agreed to his proposal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had the driver drop me off at the hospital where my brother and I had arranged to meet. Wanting to avoid any speculation or questions from Philip in case someone spotted Amir and me outside, I deemed it the safest option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I wandered down the echoing hallway, bathed in the sterile glow of fluorescent lights, a sudden beep interrupted the solemn silence. I glanced at my phone, revealing a message from my husband, like a whisper in the cacophony of my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip: Did you go to the hospital?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was sure the driver had informed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah: Yes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As expected, there was no further reply. Our communication typically followed this pattern: one question, one answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heading to the hospital garden, I spotted Amir sitting alone on a spacious bench, accompanied by a burly man who was his bodyguard. As his gaze fell upon me, he surged up from his perch and closed the distance between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me help you. Are you alright?&#34; He gently touched my neck and forehead, checking for any signs of flu.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His age was evident, bearing the unmistakable imprint of time&#39;s passage. Ten years my senior, he now stood at thirty-two. As he led me to the bench, the warmth of his touch grounded me, offering solace amidst the turmoil brewing within. Settling onto the seat, a wave of emotions threatened to overwhelm me, the sting of tears lingering at the corners of my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;God, I miss you so much,&#34; he muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hate you,&#34; I whispered, though it sounded more like it came out of my nose because I miss my brother too. &#34;Three years of silence, all because of Jessica!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He winced. &#34;I&#39;m sorry... I know I&#39;ve been a dick. Honestly, I didn&#39;t plan on seeing you, but when I saw you unconscious right in front of your villa, I couldn&#39;t help but worry about you. What happened to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made the dramatic choice to sweep the topic of his girlfriend under the rug, as he clearly avoided it whenever Jessica was mentioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine. It was a little miscommunication and misunderstanding between my husband and me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s a dick!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brother, please... It&#39;s unreasonable for us to talk about my husband when you constantly avoid the topic of Jessica,&#34; I couldn&#39;t help but complain, my tone tinged with frustration and disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pursed his lips and shrugged. Soon enough, we changed the subject. He asked about my studies and chosen life, and I responded with fabrications woven like a tangled web of deceit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know my brother, and he&#39;ll take action in ways I wouldn&#39;t expect if I told him about the mistreatment I received from my in-laws.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandpa Mitchell may be weak now, but he&#39;s still holding onto his disappointment about your choice in marriage,&#34; Amir expressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope he&#39;s managing okay,&#34; I responded, a tinge of sadness coloring my words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandpa Mitchell had always been my anchor support during the rocky times in my relationship with my father and Amir. But when I decided to marry Philip, he found it difficult to accept, ultimately leading him to cut ties with me. The idea of facing his friend&#39;s family, whom he had hoped I would marry, was too painful for him to bear, as it meant losing face in our circle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I acknowledge my mistakes. I abandoned everything positive in pursuit of a life with Philip. However, dwelling on regrets serves no purpose now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling unwell, I visited a clinic after catching up with Amir. Despite my reluctance to have him accompany me, Amir insisted on coming along. But to avoid any unwanted inquiries, I refrained from using my married name, introducing myself as Sarah Mitchell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They ran some tests on me. And then, like a thunderbolt in the night, his words pierced the air, &#34;Congratulations, Ms. Mitchell, you are pregnant!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that fleeting moment, the very fabric of my world shifted beneath my feet.</p>
