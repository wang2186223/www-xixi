                <p>**Sarah**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed Megan emerge from her vehicle and halt before Amir&#39;s villa&#39;s gate, her presence as unwelcome as a vulture at a feast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;What does this woman want now?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Activating my security system, I strode to the gate; my curiosity piqued yet tempered with disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes?&#34; I inquired, meeting her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face was a mask of contempt. &#34;So, it&#39;s true then? You&#39;ve taken up residence in this villa near Serenity Pines Estate! Why? Because you want to be close to Philip?&#34; She crossed her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I allowed a sweet smile to curve my lips. &#34;Megan, I live here to stay away from Philip. If I wanted to be close to him, I&#39;d live in Serenity Pines Estate, specifically in his bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fury was palpable. &#34;You&#39;re shameless! Since Philip broke up with you, now you&#39;re seducing Mr. Benner! Are you his bedmate now that Philip is ignoring you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes, weariness and amusement mingling. &#34;Honestly, I&#39;m more surprised you&#39;re the one paying attention to me. What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip is mine!&#34; Megan declared, her voice a shrill proclamation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, of course.&#34; These people are as annoying as Philip! Shaking my head, I picked up the hose from the lawn and, with a flick of my wrist, sent a stream of water cascading over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahhh! You wretch! Help! This woman is assaulting me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan, you came here to bother me. I have the right to do whatever it takes to make you leave because you&#39;re disturbing me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gritted her teeth and warned, &#34;Get ready for me in the office! Remember, I am your boss! I will make sure you leave Highland Hills!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I no longer care! Does she think I want to stay here in Highland Hills? I just shook my head as she sped off in her car. Why are the people around Philip, besides Jane, all crazy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Megan left, I checked my phone to see if Jane had responded. I had invited her to Amir&#39;s villa to catch up before I started on the project. I saw two messages: one from Philip and one from Jane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip: Let&#39;s meet tonight. Go to Serenity Pines Estate for dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I read Jane&#39;s message: Hi, love! Let&#39;s meet tonight at Quill Tavern. I am in a bad mood. I still can&#39;t fix my damaged hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought about what Madam Cornell did to her. That old woman! She&#39;s crazy!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because I&#39;m lazy, I decided to call Philip via video. With Jane being his sister, I needed his help. Philip answered almost immediately, his handsome face filling the screen. He looked impeccable in his perfectly tailored Armani suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, babe?&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you help me book at Coiffures?&#34; I asked. It&#39;s a famous salon near Luminary Productions, and most of their clients are celebrities from Philip&#39;s company. It&#39;s nearly impossible to get an appointment there. It could take weeks or even months for Jane and me to accommodate. But we might have a chance if Philip reserves a slot for us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t need to pretty yourself up just for our date later,&#34; he said casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was rendered speechless. Who on earth gave him the notion that I&#39;d be going on a date with him tonight? I watched as he subtly signaled to someone off-camera.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, I don&#39;t need to be pretty myself because I know I&#39;m already beautiful!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Besides, I don&#39;t have a date with you! I&#39;m meeting Jane. We&#39;re having a girl&#39;s day, so I&#39;m not going to Serenity Pines Estate! She&#39;s the one who needs an appointment at the salon, not me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, is that your wife?&#34; I heard someone ask on his end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, is there a problem?&#34; Philip replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! No problem at all, boss!&#34; a chorus of voices responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My cheeks flushed with heat. &#34;My goodness! Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re in a meeting; they all heard my complaints?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry! No one will dare mention that you scolded me and dared to stand me up on our date.&#34; Philip&#39;s eyes narrowed a silent warning to those around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was mortified. My words echoed in my mind, each one amplifying my embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled devilishly at the camera. &#34;I&#39;ll pick you up at Coiffures later. Bye!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was shocked when the connection with Philip was cut. That brute!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the call with Philip, I rifled through my wardrobe, searching for something to wear. The state of my attire struck me with sudden clarity-I desperately needed new clothes. As I glanced in the mirror, my eyes lingered on my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip had commented that it was so flat that he almost felt nothing. Irritated, I squeezed it, wondering if he was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That rascal! Mine are at least a B cup! He probably said that just to mess with me. What a pervert! He insulted my boobs like that!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly texted Jane, letting her know I would pick her up after Philip&#39;s driver fetched me at Amir&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I arrived at the Cornell mansion, I saw Jane waiting at the gate. She wore sunglasses, but they couldn&#39;t hide the telltale redness around her eyes, evidence of recent tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright?&#34; I asked her gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t fix my hair,&#34; she sighed. &#34;I booked an appointment at Coiffures, but next month is the earliest slot they could give me. There&#39;s a grand ball happening, and they&#39;re swamped with their celebrity clients.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane had been away from the city for a while, so it wasn&#39;t surprising that some establishments didn&#39;t recognize her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I called your brother,&#34; I said, hoping to ease her worries. &#34;Don&#39;t worry about it. He helped me get you an appointment today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to me, a hint of surprise in her eyes. &#34;It seems you and Brother Philip are getting along well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course not! He might do anything to get a slot for you. I told him I&#39;d bring you along. But if it were me needing help, he probably wouldn&#39;t care,&#34; I said casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane finally smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we rode in the vehicle, I caught up with Jane. She filled me in on our project at Luminary, which revolved around Philip&#39;s production work. Jane would handle the overall design while I represented BM Technologies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon arriving at our destination, we were intercepted by Jane&#39;s cousin Rebecca, who was already conversing with the woman at customer service.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, well, well, look who&#39;s here,&#34; Rebecca said, crossing her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ignored her and instead greeted the woman in the lobby. &#34;Hello there!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, Miss&#34; The woman paused, waiting for my name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Sarah Mitchell. We&#39;re here to see Brandy. We have an appointment this afternoon,&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And when did you book, Ma&#39;am?&#34; the woman asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About an hour ago, I believe,&#34; I answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rebecca burst into laughter. &#34;Gosh, Sarah! You seem to think that booking guarantees you an immediate slot! I also had a sudden outing, and just yesterday, I was pleading with them to fix my hair.&#34; She glanced at the woman in customer service. &#34;Don&#39;t trust them. She just wants to get ahead in the schedule.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman scrutinized me from head to toe. &#34;Ma&#39;am, I&#39;m sorry, but it&#39;s impossible to give you a slot right away if you just called now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Call Brandy. I&#39;m sure he knows what I&#39;m talking about, and he&#39;ll see me,&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah, I never thought you were so innocent. Don&#39;t you know that Brandy is the number one stylist in this salon? If others have full schedules, especially Brandy!&#34; Rebecca commented, her tone dripping with condescension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew about it! Because Brandy was my hairstylist, but instead, I responded, &#34;Why is there a buzzing bee in your shop? A certain someone has been commenting since earlier, even though we&#39;re not paying them any attention.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-!&#34; I didn&#39;t expect Rebecca to be so easily provoked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just look for my name or Jane Cornell,&#34; I instructed the receptionist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She checked the schedule, clearly irritated. With a sigh, she said, &#34;Ma&#39;am, there is no slot for Sarah Mitchell or Jane Cornell in our schedule. You&#39;re causing a disturbance in our salon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah, let&#39;s go...&#34; Jane said softly, trying to pull me away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But seeing Jane&#39;s earlier smile when she learned that Philip had made arrangements, I decided not to leave. I didn&#39;t want my friend to be disappointed. &#34;Tell Brandy to come here, or I will fire you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rebecca laughed loudly. &#34;She&#39;s lost it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman rolled her eyes. &#34;Security!&#34; she called out, clearly thinking I had lost my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The salon staff promptly escorted Jane and me out, which only fueled my anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Call your brother and tell him to buy this shop and blocklist your cousin!&#34; I demanded, turning to Jane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me? W-why me?&#34; she asked, bewildered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course! Because you are Jane Cornell! Tell him they kicked us out!&#34;</p>
