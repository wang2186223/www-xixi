                <p>**Sarah**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat exploded across my body, coursing down my chest to pool between my thighs. My pulse thundered wildly, my legs shaking as they squeezed together with an achy need for Philip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want me to do, Sarah?&#34; Philip gently laid me on the bed before towering over me. His fingers threaded through my hair, holding me with a tender yet firm grip, as if he was determined to remain entwined with me, no matter my protests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under different circumstances, I might have wanted him to leave me alone, but now I was wet, burning, craving him desperately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart yearned for his love, even if it seemed impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mouth crashed onto mine with searing passion. My legs snaked around his firm backside as I responded fervently to his damning kisses. After I nearly lost my breath from the intensity, his mouth trailed down to devour the sensitive skin of my neck. I could feel the throbbing need in my core pulsating with each passing moment, my body curling with pleasure against the soft bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn! What are you doing to me, Sarah?&#34; Philip groaned, breathing in my scent deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wondered the same question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ground his body against mine, ensuring I could feel his own aching need. &#34;Feel that? This isn&#39;t a lie, babe. I ache for you. My cock throbs for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I descended into delirium, my eyes fluttering closed as I slowly drew in ragged breaths, savoring the exquisite feeling despite the barrier of our clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He flipped me onto the bed, then murmured huskily, &#34;I must take you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My core shuddered at his promising words. Two strong palms caressed my legs, trailing upwards with deliberate slowness. His fingers teasingly hooked into my garter belt before rolling my panties down my thighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think we should skip right to the main course?&#34; he muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand roamed over my butt, firmly kneading my firm cheeks. &#34;Don&#39;t respond. This wasn&#39;t lying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widened as his fingers traced along my slippery, intimate flesh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a gasp as he sank his teeth into my buttocks. His powerful hands gripped me, lewdly spreading me open as I felt his hot breath against my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My face contorted in pleasure, eyes rolling back as his mouth descended between my thighs, covering me with his warmth. His tongue moved slowly, deliberately, through my most intimate lips, eliciting a squeal into the sheets and curling my toes in sheer delight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;God!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cried out again as his tongue pushed inside, delving deeply as if he were devouring my very soul. Wave after wave of pure bliss washed over me. My fingers clutched the bed linens as I gasped for air, completely lost in the pleasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tongue moved lower, swirling around my aching, needy clit. He wrapped his lips around the throbbing nub, sucking on it until my legs shook. My eyes squeezed shut, my brow furrowing as I moaned into delirium.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The heat between my legs grew more intense, throbbing with an insistent need. His tongue dragged across my pulsing clit, making my vision blur and my senses reel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gradually, his tongue descended, then retreated, going even further. His hands gripped tighter, widening my wetness as his tongue delved deeper into exploration. The sensation was so incredibly intense that I felt an urge to scream with pleasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You belong to me, Sarah. No matter how many times you deny it, no matter how your heart struggles to forgive, deep down, you know you&#39;re mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Belonging to someone is one thing, but resenting the circumstances is another-and that is our tragedy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I soon heard the distinct sound of his zipper and belt, hurriedly removed as if time were of the essence. He paid no heed to whether his top remained on or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My anticipation surged as I realized he was on the verge of taking me at any moment. In a heartbeat, the slick heat of my pussy met the immense, swollen head of his cock, aligning perfectly with my entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shiit!&#34; I gasped, my voice muffled by the sheets as if seeking solace in their embrace against the overwhelming intensity of Philip&#39;s thrusts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip relentlessly drove me towards unparalleled ecstasy as I moaned loudly. His hand tangled in my hair, strands dampened with tiny beads of sweat trailing down my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he relentlessly plunged into me, his pulsating shaft teased every nerve ending, his fervent gasps harmonizing with my fervent moans. I clenched around him, enveloping him in a vice grip as he delved deeper, every inch forging a connection that transcended mere physicality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments passed before I felt the warm rush of his release, his essence mingling with mine in a primal dance of passion. The sensation left me breathless, questioning the inexplicable allure of his touch as he remained within me, our bodies still intertwined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>God, why did it feel so good?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip&#39;s tender kisses trailed along my back, a gentle reassurance of our connection. We shifted positions on the bed, my back still to him. His arm secured my waist while his fingers teased my nipple, igniting a fire that still burned within us both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still hard, he delved into me once more, his body molding against mine as he resumed his rhythmic thrusts. His lips traced along my skin before tilting my chin to meet his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes bore into mine as he continued to penetrate deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m a man, Sarah. No matter what this may be between us, I promise to do everything to ensure our happiness above all else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our lips locked the promise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When morning came, I woke up feeling the aftermath of Philip&#39;s relentless demands, my body aching all over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Augh, God!&#34; I groaned, sitting up in bed. Philip&#39;s note lay on the bedside table, and I picked it up, bracing myself for its contents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I let you catch some more sleep, babe. Early meeting with Dad. See you soon!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How on earth does he still have energy after last night? Regardless, I prepared myself for the day ahead and headed to the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trey informed me that Philip was with Jane when I sought out my friend. I assumed it was some sort of family affair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arriving at the office well past noon, I was met with a sour mood from the head editor. &#34;Good heavens, our company is outsourcing BM, is it not? Surely, it&#39;s customary to arrive early. You&#39;ve merely begun working here, yet you&#39;re already tardy on your second day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I winced, knowing he had every right to reprimand me. He did have a point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you encounter any troubles with the tool?&#34; I inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not thus far. It&#39;s straightforward to navigate. But we still expect your presence in the office should any issues arise,&#34; he replied, then added, &#34;Anyhow, my team shall convene for a get-together this afternoon. Please, join us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body still ached, prompting me to decline. &#34;I must apologize. I have numerous tasks that require my attention. As you know, I&#39;m Mr. Jakob&#39;s secretary; my focus is elsewhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He frowned, creasing his brow. &#34;But are you not the representative of BM technologies for the tool we&#39;re utilizing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, that&#39;s correct,&#34; I replied casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then you should attend. Our team has already computed the bill; your name&#39;s on it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah, so that explained his insistence; getting me to share the expenses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My primary role here is to ensure that ChronoGrafix integrates smoothly with your operations. I still have obligations outside this project, excluding me from attending.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With much work looming at LoveLogic, my decision was justified as I neared the design phase of the NPC inspired by Bronn, a task requiring my utmost attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m occupied, so if you could kindly leave me be,&#34; I declared firmly before he could continue with his antics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I fixed my laptop and other items, I noticed Jane&#39;s somber demeanor; her red eyes betrayed recent tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Did I miss something?&#39; I pondered internally, feeling a pang of guilt for leaving her after inviting her to follow Madam Cornell the previous night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sent her a chat message instead of approaching her directly. Given my recent arrival at the office, I braced myself for a possible reprimand from the editor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Me:*** *Is everything alright? Sorry for leaving you last night at the restaurant.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane glanced up, silently gesturing for me to join her outside. Sensing her distress, I followed her to the women&#39;s restroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright, loves?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tears streamed down. &#34;Dad wants me to marry Mr. Olsen, Sarah. And Brother Philip agreed. No one in the family supports me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Awww&#34; I embraced her, offering what comfort I could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My wedding is planned for this weekend; that&#39;s why I&#39;m so distraught. I don&#39;t know what to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After talking to Jane, I went to my ex-husband&#39;s office because I didn&#39;t know why Philip supported the marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is Philip?&#34; I asked Alex, who was guarding the door like a post.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Madam Sarah, he&#39;s inside speaking with Madam Olsen and Madam Cornell,&#34; he replied, almost stuttering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is the meeting about Jane&#39;s wedding?&#34; I probed further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alex met my gaze, uncertain whether to confirm or deny my suspicions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Madam Cornell&#39;s desire to torment Jane was clear to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened, and three pairs of eyes locked onto mine. Philip&#39;s expression betrayed his surprise at my unexpected presence, while Madam Cornell&#39;s narrowed eyes hinted at her ulterior motives. However, it was Mrs. Olsen&#39;s unexpected presence that truly shocked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time seemed to stand still as I stood rooted to the spot, grappling with the realization that the woman before me, Mrs. Olsen, bore an uncanny resemblance to someone I never expected to encounter in such a context.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Mom?&#39; I froze, feeling ill as I stared at Madam Olsen. A wave of disbelief and nausea washed over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could this be? My mother had already passed away!</p>
