                <p>**Sarah**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outwardly, I appeared calm while waiting for midnight, but my mind was utterly restless. It was already ten o&#39;clock in the evening; I only had to endure the wait for two more hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since eight that evening, I had been on a group video call with Jakob and the rest of our LoveLogic team, my friend Jane included. I was sequestered alone in my bedroom while Jane participated from the living room. We managed to recruit five additional developers, one of whom had taken over my former coding responsibilities for the application.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The early download numbers are very promising,&#34; Jakob informed us, reading through some of the glowing app reviews we&#39;d received so far. A few thousand users and counting have installed LoveLogic, and the feedback has been tremendously positive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though my eyes were fixed on the screen, my mind couldn&#39;t focus on the meeting. It kept drifting elsewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah?&#34; Jakob&#39;s voice called out. &#34;Sarah! Jane, did you lose her video feed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion was evident on Jane&#39;s face. &#34;No, the connection seems fine on my end.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cleared my throat awkwardly. &#34;Sorry, guys, I&#39;m just tired...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massaging my temples, I forced a reassuring smile at the camera. But the truth was, I urgently needed this call to end so I could prepare for my risky meeting with Madam Olsen in two hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone may now rest except Sarah. We have something to discuss. Jane, you can also stay if you&#39;re not busy,&#34; said Jakob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some of our team logged out. Jane chose to stay on the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on, Sarah?&#34; Jakob asked with obvious concern. I couldn&#39;t lie to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think it&#39;s about Brother Philip...&#34; Jane answered for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah, tell us. President Cornell has been missing for days, but it&#39;s only now that you seem lost. What really happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;N-nothing. It&#39;s just that... I feel like I&#39;ve returned to a time when I was powerless... a time when I couldn&#39;t fight back,&#34; I explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that all? I want you to understand that you&#39;re not being returned to that time. Those people had no respect for you! Sarah, these people care for you, which is why they&#39;re protecting you and keeping you out of trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes started to tear up. Perhaps it&#39;s my fault for appearing unfazed in the previous days, leading them to question my current behavior. It could be because I could no longer hide the turmoil inside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew Jakob would eventually discover why I was acting this way, so it was better to tell them the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Madam Olsen found Philip... I don&#39;t know where she took him, but Jane&#39;s brother is now in her possession,&#34; I quietly responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane gasped, and Jakob looked straight at me through the video feed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I continued, &#34;Madam Olsen gave me a job. She wants to know who Mariano is. I think she might have had dealings with him, or there might be another reason&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jakob was the next to comment. &#34;Mariano has many enemies in the industry. Madam Olsen could use his identity against him. Now that something has happened to President Cornell, Mariano has surely lost an ally. He will definitely look for someone to replace President Cornell, especially for certain business transactions. Madam Olsen knows you&#39;re Mariano&#39;s target, so she made a deal with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane remained silent, just listening intently, though her confusion was evident-she didn&#39;t fully understand the web of secrets and threats we were discussing. I pursed my lips. Mariano also lost an assistant because of me, so it&#39;s highly possible that I am now his target.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah, what exactly are you planning?&#34; Jakob asked with a knitted brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just want to get Philip&#39;s body back safely. That&#39;s all I care about right now: to ensure Philip is safe. Madam Olsen is holding him captive, and she could do anything to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you understand that it&#39;s impossible to discover Mariano&#39;s identity, right? He uses multiple personas. We aren&#39;t even certain he ever directly revealed himself to President Cornell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, Jane voiced her concern. &#34;What about Brother Philip? Are we just going to leave him with Madam Olsen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll find a way. Don&#39;t worry, Jane...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah, please,&#34; Jakob urged. &#34;Whatever your plan is, you need to tell me the details.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave him a small smile before we ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane and I arrived at Serenity Pines Estate around eleven at night, accompanied by Josh and several guards who had been reassigned to Amir&#39;s villa following Philip&#39;s disappearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A frantic guard hurried towards me as we passed through the wrought-iron gates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; I asked him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Madam Sarah, I apologize for disturbing your evening... I received an anonymous call from one of the neighbors who said they saw a shadowy figure climbing over the high exterior wall. There appears to be a trespasser at Serenity Pines,&#34; he explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of Philip&#39;s security team, stationed to protect Megan, were reassigned to Amir&#39;s villa to bolster security around me during Philip&#39;s absence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you checked the surveillance footage?&#34; I inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane and I exchanged looks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my God! I think it could be Madam Cornell sneaking around!&#34; Jane gasped, her eyes going wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would you say that?&#34; I asked, feigning surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, my stepmother is the only one cunning enough to sneak in, right?&#34; my friend reasoned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards contemplated this. &#34;But Madam Cornell is too elderly to climb such a tall wall.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My stepmother has nowhere else to go now. With Philip gone, she might be hiding here,&#34; Jane argued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I issued a decisive command. &#34;All of you, search the villa! Whether it&#39;s Madam Cornell or not, we must ensure no intruder has entered!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards quickly sprang into action, spreading out across the expansive grounds to thoroughly search every room, closet, and hidden corner of the grand villa. With their focus now elsewhere, I saw my opportunity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I casually strolled out through the gate, the cool night air wrapping around me as I approached the waiting car. Just as I settled into the driver&#39;s seat and started the engine, I was caught off guard by Josh slipping into the passenger seat beside me, his expression a mix of suspicion and concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tsk! I can&#39;t believe you! Was it you or Jane who pretended to be the neighbor reporting someone climbing the wall?&#34; he accused, his gaze fixed on me in the dim light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chose not to respond. Let him think whatever he wants!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What he said is true: Madam Cornell is currently being sought by the authorities. My guards remained calm due to my recent actions, so they didn&#39;t suspect my intention to escape when I ordered them to scour every corner of Serenity Pines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they were distracted, I seized the opportunity. I rushed the car toward the airport; my curiosity about seeing Philip was overwhelming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah! You&#39;re an idiot!&#34; Josh exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I am. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here in the car! Madam Olsen wants to know who Mariano is. Well, you are going to pretend to be this Mariano!&#34; I declared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s face darkened. &#34;Explain to me what happened today that led us to this point.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I recounted everything to Josh as we drove, including how I received a letter from Madam Olsen informing me that she now has Philip in her possession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right! I can pretend to be Mariano! But that doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;ll believe me! Do you think Madam Olsen holds Mariano in such low regard? Sarah, I&#39;ve met Mariano before! If Madam Olsen wants information about him, I can provide it!&#34; Josh lectured passionately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m terrified about what might happen,&#34; I admitted to him in a small voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should be scared!&#34; Josh chided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should I simply allow fear to overwhelm me? What about Philip?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we arrived at the airport, there were only ten minutes left before my planned meeting with Madam Olsen was scheduled. As I hastily entered the airport, a chillingly familiar voice called out behind us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where do you think you&#39;re going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I turned around, I was met with Amir&#39;s piercing gaze. At this point, I knew escape was no longer an option.</p>
