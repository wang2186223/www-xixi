                <p>Emily was busy with her daughter, so I had no choice but to attend some gatherings that required my presence; they were important events for keeping my social and business connections strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip returned to the Luminary Production&#39;s office to handle pressing issues, and everything seems to be going well, except for Jane, who is still on vacation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I was leaving Serenity Pines, I chose Josh to accompany me to the Elite Annual Business Gala. I hadn&#39;t spoken to him for quite some time because Philip had been keeping an eye on me at the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth is, Josh and I have nothing to hide, but I feel like a wife keeping a secret with her lover. Josh&#39;s life is complicated, and it&#39;s not my place to disclose his background to everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard that Jane is still in recovery,&#34; Josh started, his eyes fixed on the winding road ahead, hands steady on the steering wheel, driving me to a hotel in a nearby town.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah she enrolled in therapy and counseling. I hope everything works out for her,&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about you? Are you okay? If you don&#39;t mind me saying, you also need counseling.&#34; Josh&#39;s eyes flicked to me momentarily</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s precisely why you&#39;re here, Josh. I don&#39;t feel comfortable opening up to just anyone. I am feeling better now, especially since I am pregnant. I am determined that my pregnancy should not go public,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we approached the hotel, it became clear this was no ordinary gathering. A line of sleek, expensive cars snaked towards the entrance, suggesting a star-studded event was taking place. It took a few minutes before I got out. I handed over the invitation while Josh quietly followed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just stepping into the grand foyer, Philip&#39;s call came through. I wasn&#39;t planning to answer, but I knew I needed to reassure him of my whereabouts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip&#39;s voice came through, a mix of irritation and what I could only describe as jealousy. &#34;You are with Josh? I left that guy at Serenity Pines because I couldn&#39;t stand seeing him, but it seems I made a miscalculation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip, you are annoying! Why are you picking on a bodyguard? Josh is excelling at his job, and you should be grateful that I have someone reliable watching over me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His following words left me momentarily speechless. &#34;What if our baby ends up bearing a resemblance to Josh because you two are always together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Here we go again. &#34;Philip, you know, if the baby looks like someone else, it&#39;s because the mother must have cheated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, you mean you cheated?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How had I suddenly become the villain in this scenario? My baby&#39;s form isn&#39;t even fully developed yet. This brute! I don&#39;t have time for him, seriously!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re giving me a headache! I&#39;m ending this call, Philip! Hmp!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head as I hung up. I saw some acquaintances at the event and mingled with them. After a while, Bronn arrived and kissed me on the cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey! I never thought you&#39;d be here!&#34; I remarked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could say the same. I thought you mentioned staying at Amir&#39;s villa?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He must have expected to see Emily at the gathering if that&#39;s the case. Bronn introduced me to some influential people who were surprised to learn that I was Grandpa Mitchell&#39;s granddaughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stayed at the gathering for a while before Bronn gathered the courage to invite me to the garden area to talk privately. He cleared his throat before seriously sharing what was on his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where where is Emily?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both had our own curiosities. I felt torn between my loyalty to Emily and my curiosity about Bronn&#39;s perspective. Why did he allow her to leave? I could understand why Emily might have walked away; I&#39;ll do the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s been... a complication in her home,&#34; I said carefully</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He frowned. &#34;What do you mean, a complication? Her mother passed away, didn&#39;t she? Does Emily have other relatives I don&#39;t know about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bronn had met Emily&#39;s mother. My assistant hadn&#39;t mentioned that to me; I only knew about Willow. I wouldn&#39;t tell Bronn about the child. It wasn&#39;t my place to reveal such personal information.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bronn, our engagement didn&#39;t happen. I mean, the planned wedding Why did you let Emily leave?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because she fell in love with me, Sarah&#34; he admitted, his voice thick with anguish. He quickly drank his scotch in one go as if trying to erase the painful memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard from Emily that her relationship with Bronn was contractual. Still, it saddened me to think these two people loved each other yet couldn&#39;t be together. But it wasn&#39;t my place to play matchmaker or confidante to them both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bronn continued, &#34;I couldn&#39;t give her the love she deserved, Sarah. You know the expectations our families have... Emily was just a young and innocent student back then. Our social circle would have torn her apart-everyone knew I was supposed to marry you. But when you married Philip, Emily disappeared too&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you try to find her?&#34; I asked, my curiosity piqued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did. That&#39;s when I discovered her mother had passed away while I was in Dubai...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My shoulders slumped at the news. For a while now, I had been contemplating the similarities between Emily and myself. We had both left the men we loved to pursue our paths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want now, Bronn?&#34; I asked, my curiosity tinged with accusation. &#34;Do you want Emily?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His piercing blue eyes darted away from mine, refusing to meet my gaze. &#34;She&#39;s not for me, Sarah...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held back a sigh and decided to disregard his apparent avoidance. It was his life and his decision, no matter how misguided it seemed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Bronn and I returned to the gathering, my attention was caught by two women being interviewed-the mistress of my father and her daughter, Lila.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Sarah Benner, it&#39;s been some time since you were last seen in public. As the sole princess of the Benners, what are your plans now that we&#39;ll see more of you in various high-profile activities?&#34; the eager reporter inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margarette, her mother, responded, &#34;She&#39;s managing some significant business responsibilities and has received invitations from several prestigious brands. She will certainly be sharing some of Amir Benner&#39;s burdens in the company, preparing for her future role.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lila followed her mother&#39;s lead, saying, &#34;Yes, I&#39;m also involved in designing the new line of vehicles at TerraTraxx Automotive. I&#39;m excited about my first appearance at the Elite Annual Business Gala and the invitations I&#39;ve received. It&#39;s truly heartwarming not to be forgotten by the industry, and I&#39;ll gladly accept these opportunities to contribute to our family&#39;s legacy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s happening, Sarah?&#34; Bronn turned to me. Among all the socialites and personalities here, he was the only one who knew the truth-that I was the real Sarah Benner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know, Bronn. But one thing&#39;s certain-those conniving mother and daughter are using my name!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My expression darkened as I observed them. Margarette seemed to sense someone watching them. Her eyes widened when she saw me, surprised because I hadn&#39;t attended such gatherings in years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, as if on cue, Lila noticed me too. Her perfectly plucked eyebrows rose, and unease flickered across her features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I allowed a cold, calculating smirk to play across my lips, subtly warning them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever game this ambitious mother-daughter duo was playing, it was clear I needed to confront Dad. He owed me an explanation for this deception-why he allowed them to take my identity as Sarah Benner.</p>
