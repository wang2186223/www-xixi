                <p>**Philip**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding Sarah close, I tried to ignore the searing pain from the knife wounds scattered across my body. Her warmth revitalized me, almost as if her presence alone could heal my injuries. I gently touched her belly, my fingers spreading out as if I could feel the new life growing inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pang of guilt about Josh flashed through my mind, but that&#39;s just the harsh reality of our world, the one I need to leave behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As my fingers roamed over her skin, my wife and I seemed to be on the same wavelength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t believe Josh is gone. You should have let him be, Philip,&#34; Sarah repeated, her voice tinged with sorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lifted her face and kissed her passionately, pouring all my emotions into that mind-blowing, toe-curling, cum-inducing kiss she deserved. When we finally parted, Sarah looked dazed, her lips slightly swollen and her cheeks flushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve already told you, haven&#39;t I? I hate it when you think about other men.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah frowned. &#34;You&#39;re impossible, Philip!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sneered. &#34;Anyway, I&#39;m just a bit bothered by Josh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tss! A bit? Your actions scream otherwise!&#34; she said, shaking her head. &#34;You and your-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;SDE!&#34; I interjected, completing her sentence, finally understanding what it meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her giggle was like music to my ears. I couldn&#39;t help but smile, drinking in the sight of her-hair tousled, eyes bright with a mix of emotions. I leaned in for another kiss, this one slower, more tender. My tongue traced the curve of her lips before delving deeper, tasting, exploring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even notice the blood spurting from my shoulder because all I wanted was her presence, her scent, oblivious to the pain screaming from different parts of my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh God, Philip! You&#39;re bleeding!&#34; She jerked back, her eyes wide with horror, staring at the reddened gauze on my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Geez, I won&#39;t faint from a panic attack, Philip; I&#39;ll faint from the blood!&#34; she murmured, her face adorably flushed in the sunlight. I wanted to live forever with this woman. I couldn&#39;t wait to see the babies growing inside her, my hand caressing her belly at the thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not as bad as it looks,&#34; I lied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to call the medical staff right now. Dr. Ethan will definitely scold me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The names she mentioned earlier were unimportant compared to her and the precious life she carried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shhh,&#34; I whispered, gently silencing her worried rambling. &#34;Just let me hold you for a moment, babe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My words caused Sarah&#39;s body to relax against mine, sensing my presence as if it were my own. I wanted to stay in this peaceful bubble, but fate had different plans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loud, persistent knocking shattered our peaceful moment. Each bang on the thick door carried urgency, making me tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of my guards spoke clearly: &#34;M-Madam Sarah, you have a visitor. Your grandfather and Mr. Benner&#39;s car are outside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah&#39;s eyes widened in panic. &#34;Ohhh, shit!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly flustered, she exclaimed, &#34;My God! Of all days, why now?&#34; My wife sighed. &#34;I don&#39;t know how I will explain to Grandpa Mitchell that you&#39;re recovering, Philip! The medical equipment, your injuries... there&#39;ll be many questions!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remained composed outwardly, but inside, I was distraught. The simultaneous arrival of both Amir and Grandpa Mitchell heightened my suspicions. Could Mariano be checking to confirm my survival?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nervously, Sarah said, &#34;I-I&#39;ll face them, love,&#34; as she got off the bed. &#34;I&#39;ll tell them you had an accident during car racing practice. That should cover it, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wincing at her hurried movements, I cautioned, &#34;Careful, Sarah!&#34; eyeing her swollen belly with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sometimes, I wondered if she forgot she was pregnant. She seemed so carefree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah exited, leaving me alone with my thoughts and suspicions. Time crawled before the door swung open again. Grandpa Mitchell and Amir entered first, trailed by my visibly anxious wife and a couple of vigilant guards stationed at the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their scrutinizing gazes scanned over me, noticing the IV drip and my bandaged wounds. Before they could say a word, I took charge of the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandpa Mitchell,&#34; I began, &#34;I apologize for not being able to return to Dubai. I&#39;ve been recuperating for months and have been immediately confronted with office issues and my mother&#39;s situation. Please understand it doesn&#39;t reflect my lack of respect for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah forced a laugh. &#34;See? We&#39;ve had some issues so that we couldn&#39;t visit you! He takes care of me, grandfather.&#34; Her eyes shifted nervously between me and the elderly man, silently seeking understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elderly man didn&#39;t acknowledge Sarah&#39;s comment. &#34;I heard you acquired a significant stake in the petroleum business in Venezuela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My wife&#39;s brow furrowed. &#34;Petroleum business?&#34; before glancing at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandpa Mitchell clarified, &#34;Your husband bought 10% of PetroVeneza Energy Corporation last year.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The company that had financial troubles last year? The one all over the financial news?&#34; Sarah asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Precisely,&#34; the old man nodded. &#34;While the company lost money, your husband increased his stake to 50%. Their CEO made a series of terrible decisions over three years, causing the stock to plummet. Philip then bought a controlling interest of 60%. He revamped the marketing strategy, and the company bounced back remarkably with the recent rise in global oil prices. Within months, they were earning far more than anyone had expected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I listened intently, understanding every word, but I struggled to discern the purpose behind this unexpected visit and impromptu business lecture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, love!&#34; Sarah forgot her earlier nervousness. &#34;You&#39;re not just rich; you&#39;re incredibly wealthy! I married a loaded man!&#34; she exclaimed proudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The old man grew contemplative before making a request, &#34;Can you all please leave Philip and me alone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A surge of nervousness swept over me. Grandpa Mitchell&#39;s detailed knowledge of my business dealings raised questions about his true identity. Could he possibly be Mariano?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amir&#39;s eyes narrowed as he turned to Sarah. &#34;You and I need to talk, too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, yeah. Why are you being so snarky?&#34; Sarah retorted, visibly annoyed, delivering her trump card. &#34;Careful with your words-I&#39;m pregnant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amir frowned. Soon after, everyone started to leave. Sarah shot me an apologetic glance before trailing after her brother, and then the door closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I faced Grandpa Mitchell&#39;s gray eyes. They seemed to bore into me as if trying to read my very thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He began, &#34;I don&#39;t trust you because of your past actions toward my granddaughter, but I&#39;ve spoken with Sarah, and despite my reservations, she seems genuinely happy Whatever I think doesn&#39;t matter anymore&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wait for him to continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re making quite a name for yourself in the business world, but what I want-what I need-is for you to take care of my Sarah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words softened my defenses. Despite our differences, we both shared the same goal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She has overcome more challenges than you know to reach where she is now. Please, love and take care of my granddaughter...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sincerely replied, &#34;You can count on me, Grandpa Mitchell. I&#39;m doing everything in my power for Sarah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I spoke, I noticed a strange gleam in his eyes. Taking a deep breath, I decided to address my suspicion directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I need to know the truth. Are you Mariano?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Sarah**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two long months have passed since that frightening incident, and I still carry the heavy burden of guilt over what happened to Josh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the time passing, I stayed watchful and focused on Lila&#39;s every move. Once the babies arrive, I can confront Lila without the concern of endangering my unborn children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was occupied with various tasks when Jakob called me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah, you&#39;re on social media outlets and porn sites!&#34; Jakob&#39;s voice was urgent and frantic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? What do you mean?&#34; Porn sites? Is he serious? At 32 weeks pregnant, this feels like a ridiculous joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I sent you the link. Check it now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding my phone, I quickly opened the link Jakob had sent. A video started playing. My eyes widened in horror as I recognized the scene. It was me and... Josh?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill ran down my spine, and a wave of nausea swept over me as I watched myself on screen, engaged in a sexual act with a man who had passed away!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These have to be filters! Help me get them removed from those sites!&#34; I demanded, my voice shaking with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um, the thing is, there&#39;s no sign that it&#39;s a filter, Sarah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mouth fell open. What does that even mean? How could this be happening?</p>
