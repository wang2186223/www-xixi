                <p>**Philip**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finding myself enveloped in darkness, I was at a loss upon hearing the news of Sarah&#39;s hospitalization, especially alongside the last person I would have expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My knowledge of Amir Benner stems from my engagement within the racing community; he presently holds the position of president at TerraTraxx Automotive, situated in Dubai.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As per my investigation,&#34; Alex began, &#34;Mr. Benner arrived in Highland Hills for business purposes. He&#39;s also collaborated with Luminary Productions to promote their latest car model.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I barely registered his words. I don&#39;t give a f\[u\]ck about Mr. Benner&#39;s affairs. What consumed me was understanding his connection to my wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeming to sense my agitation, Alex added, &#34;Boss, Mr. Benner just arrived recently. I doubt he&#39;s acquainted with Madam Sarah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how desperately I craved solace, his words were mere whispers against the tempest raging within me. Just moments ago, I had discovered Sarah in the company of another man. Gripped by anger, I&#39;m lost in a whirlwind of emotions, unable to discern what I feel now that she&#39;s with a different man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The relentless downpour had softened to a mere drizzle as the car pulled up in front of the hospital. Exiting the car with Alex at my heels, determination fueled my strides as we made our way through the hospital corridors, intensifying the urgency to reach the ward where my wife awaited me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Madam Sarah is in that room, Boss,&#34; Alex pointed out, indicating the direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an air of icy resolve, I flung the door open, revealing the sight of Amir perched on the bed, clutching my wife&#39;s hand. A storm brewed within me as I unleashed a voice that echoed with thunderous fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell are you doing with my wife?!&#34; I bellowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amir&#39;s gaze shifted towards me, his eyes narrowing in my direction as he lifted his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wife?&#34; He arched an eyebrow before straightening up. &#34;If she truly is your wife, why did you leave her outside your villa? Your wife is sick with the flu, yet you callously left her there until she passed out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every fiber of my being urged me to strike him for his intrusion, but I knew I had to maintain composure, especially considering my father&#39;s warnings about getting into trouble. Amir was here for business with Luminary Production at Highland Hills. I needed to keep my cool. But I wouldn&#39;t allow him to meddle in my affairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never imagined the president of TerraTraxx Automotive would stick his nose into my personal affairs. This is strictly between me and my wife! So, Mr. Benner, what exactly is your relationship with her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fist clenched tightly, the tension crackling in the air as he paused, carefully considering his next words. A smirk played across my lips as I anticipated his response. Without missing a beat, I confidently called out, &#34;Alex!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss?&#34; My assistant strode in from the hallway, his expression clouded with confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get my wife out of this hospital!&#34; I demanded sharply. Sarah couldn&#39;t stay here, and I had no intention of explaining why to anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve got to be kidding me!&#34; Amir&#39;s voice bristled with anger. &#34;Your wife is barely recovering from the flu!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way he dared to speak of Sarah like that ignited a raging inferno within me. My fists clenched so tightly I could feel the bones grinding against each other as I fought to contain the emotions threatening to erupt from within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s none of your concern! Where I take my wife is my decision alone. She&#39;s my wife!&#34; I snapped back, my tone cutting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re a real asshole,&#34; Amir seethed through gritted teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As our heated exchange echoed within the sterile confines of the ward, the tension spiked as a nurse and doctor burst in. My reputation had preceded me in the hospital nestled within the Highland Hills, a domain long associated with my family. Every soul within these walls recognized me as Philip Cornell!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Cornell...&#34; the doctor began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m taking my wife home,&#34; I spat, my frustration mounting. I demand to take Sarah home, far removed from the chaos and annoyance of these people!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Y-yes, Mr. Cornell,&#34; the doctor responded hesitantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t allow it! I brought Mrs. Cornell here because she&#39;s sick! Her fever hasn&#39;t gone down yet!&#34; Amir Benner shouted with frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lunged forward, forcefully pressing him against the unforgiving wall. The doctor and nurse recoiled in shock, their eyes widening with alarm, but Mr. Benner stood firm, unyielding in the face of my aggression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The surge of violence within me surged as I witnessed Mr. Benner&#39;s tender care for my wife. Our gazes locked in a silent battle, each glance piercing like a blade, slashing through the tension between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah is my wife! Whatever I do with her is none of your f\[u\]cking business!&#34; I snarled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Cornell, Mr. Benner, please Please refrain from violence here. We implore you. This is a hospital, and you&#39;re disturbing the patients,&#34; the nurse pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Benner, I&#39;m sorry, but Mr. Cornell is the patient&#39;s husband. We&#39;ll honor the wishes of the primary family,&#34; the doctor explained diplomatically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This hospital is worthless!&#34; Amir Benner exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor and nurse nervously swallowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scoffed. &#34;It&#39;s fortunate you don&#39;t run this place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to act further, he cast a final glance at my wife before exiting the ward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just moments later, Sarah was nestled in my embrace as we made our way down the hallway toward the exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The frigid air pierced her skin, causing her to tremble, while her heated breath danced against my neck. Her feverish, luminous skin seemed to ignite upon contact with mine. I paid no mind to any potential judgments from the hospital, taking my sick wife home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was resolute in my actions, my frustration a searing inferno burning within. Trust was a luxury that people couldn&#39;t afford, especially not when it came to Amir Benner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we reached the car, I turned to Alex with a command. &#34;Contact Ethan Vanderbilt. Tell him to meet us at Serenity Pines Estate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right away, boss,&#34; he replied dutifully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guiding Sarah into the car, she continued to cling to my arm as we settled into the backseat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-it&#39;s cold,&#34; she murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please turn the heater on,&#34; I instructed the driver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took a while for Sarah to ease into the warmth, but my mind was ablaze with turmoil, feeling like my chest was engulfed in flames.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah lay on the bed as my friend Ethan examined her. Despite being a surgeon currently assigned to a different hospital, I had called him over to Alex&#39;s even though it was late at night to check on my wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know when she was last given medication at the hospital?&#34; Ethan inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged, unable to provide a precise answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s sigh conveyed his exasperation at my vague response. &#34;I&#39;ll contact the hospital to confirm. What happened to cause your wife to fall ill?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing Ethan was not only a doctor but also a friend, I disclosed the truth. &#34;I let her stay outside the villa, leaving her in the pouring rain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good grief,&#34; he muttered under his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Ethan phoned the hospital, my gaze lingered on Sarah, my fists involuntarily clenching. The disturbing image that had haunted me earlier, standing at the bedside, seemed etched into my mind, refusing to fade. Before heading to the hospital, I instructed Alex to ensure they replaced the bedsheet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Momentarily consumed by the haunting vision of my wife, I was brought back to the present by Ethan&#39;s voice. &#34;I&#39;ll give her an IV now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Ethan administered the medication, Sarah continued to shiver from the cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll take my leave,&#34; Ethan announced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After seeing Ethan off outside Serenity Pines Estate, I headed back inside to change into fresh clothes and get ready for bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes crawled by before I reclaimed my place beside Sarah on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So cold...&#34; she murmured, her body shivering with an unseen chill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I drew her trembling form closer to mine, sharing whatever warmth I could offer. Her eyes fluttered open briefly, revealing a gaze filled with confusion and vulnerability. Her image was enough to awaken my raging libido.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not only to shield her from the cold but also because my overwhelming desire to possess her was escaping, I hovered over Sarah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Haah...&#34; Her moan echoed through the room, a visceral response to the overwhelming intensity of my arousal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remember that I am your husband, and no other man should dare to lay a hand on you.&#34;</p>
