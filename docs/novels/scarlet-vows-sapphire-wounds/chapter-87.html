                <p>From what I heard, Bronn and Emily had a past relationship, but she left. They met again just recently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had always wondered about Bronn&#39;s romantic history; now, it all makes sense. The truth came out like a bittersweet story: he and Emily had shared an intimate relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s discuss this privately,&#34; Bronn suggested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed Bronn&#39;s suggestion, and he invited us to a restaurant, bringing Emily along. I could feel Emily trembling slightly like a leaf in the wind, though she showed no emotion. Perhaps she was trying to be brave about the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We sat at a table inside the restaurant. Emily sat beside me but still couldn&#39;t look at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Speak!&#34; I demanded of Bronn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bronn glanced at Emily, silently asking if he could talk about their past together. &#34;I&#39;m not sure what you heard, but it&#39;s true. I had a relationship with Emily before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Should I be angry about that? No.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily followed Bronn&#39;s statement. &#34;I was Mr. Martin&#39;s mistress for two years. I ended the relationship four years ago when I heard about your marriage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mouth dropped at this revelation. That was when the Benners disowned me, and my wedding with Bronn didn&#39;t happen because I was in love with Philip. My lips formed a straight line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hadn&#39;t respected or seriously considered marrying Bronn back then. So, should I be upset that they were together? No.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I married another man, so why did you leave?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily opened her mouth, looking confused. &#34;I-I didn&#39;t know you married another man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pieced the scenarios together, which led me to say the following words. &#34;You thought I was still going to marry Bronn. And when you found out I&#39;m Sarah Benner, you filed your resignation. Is that the reason?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily slowly nodded, her head dipping as if to say yes. She was guilty, showing the pain of a woman who had loved deeply but had to leave because of it. Four years ago, she walked away from Bronn with her heart bleeding, believing he was marrying another woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what I don&#39;t get,&#34; I said, &#34;is why you changed your mind again...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Is Emily seeking revenge, viewing me as the one who destroyed her dreams? Or is her return linked to Bronn, an irresistible force she can&#39;t escape? Questions flooded my mind, multiplying like echoes in a cave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I... I&#39;d rather speak with you privately, Sarah. I can only say that Bronn and I are not involved romantically at this moment. I&#39;m aware of the rumors circulating about Mr. Martin&#39;s romantic interests, and I&#39;ve heard about your intentions to proceed with the wedding...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned my gaze towards Bronn, who was sitting across from me. His face wore a mask of stoic indifference. Earlier, I overheard him questioning Emily&#39;s presence as if she were the one who got away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could we step outside for a moment? I need to talk to you,&#34; I asked Bronn, rising from my seat and making my way to the garden, an elegantly landscaped extension of the high-end restaurant,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps that&#39;s why I couldn&#39;t muster genuine feelings of love or romance for him, even though we were engaged before, and our trial dates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I crossed my arms, the chill of the night air seeping in. Standing in the center of the garden, despite the relative seclusion, I could still hear the distant hum of the hotel and the party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt Bronn&#39;s presence behind me and turned to find him bathed in the gentle light of the garden, which softened his chiseled features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This isn&#39;t right, Bronn. I mean, you and I... A romantic relationship between us is just not feasible,&#34; I immediately led.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But why? I&#39;m not involved with Emily anymore,&#34; he interjected, his tone tinged with uncertainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then answer me this: you knew we were destined for marriage, yet Emily existed. I know it was more like a business deal than anything else, but still, it meant something. I didn&#39;t expect you to be faithful or to love me, not really. But why did you have someone else? What do I even call her? A side chick? A girlfriend? And why Emily? Why not anyone?&#34; My tone wasn&#39;t accusing, just curious about the man I was supposed to marry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know, Sarah... Because I&#39;m a man? That&#39;s a pathetic excuse, I know Look, you were only sixteen when Emily and I started. I called her a &#39;mistress&#39; because our families expected us to marry. I supported her financially-her school fees, apartment, designer clothes, everything...&#34; he explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, you were basically paying Emily to be your mistress until I turned eighteen?&#34; I clarified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s correct,&#34; he confirmed, his voice barely audible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having a mistress is utterly disgusting, yet it&#39;s an unfortunate reality. Many businessmen engage in extramarital affairs. My father is no exception; he has had mistresses. Even Chairman Cornell. This is precisely why I once suspected Philip of cheating with his secretary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you fell in love with Emily&#34; I was certain of that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I witnessed the way Bronn gazed at Emily earlier, a look that spoke of deep affection and longing. It was undeniable; it was clear they had a special connection like they were in their own little world. Seeing that made me realize I didn&#39;t have a chance with Bronn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steeling myself, I confronted him directly, &#34;Bronn, I came from a failed marriage. What I desperately want now is a lovely family, a man who would love me romantically and unconditionally, without reservation. We&#39;re good friends, but can you honestly picture yourself being romantically involved with me?&#34; I asked, already knowing the answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips trembled as he struggled to respond. &#34;I-I&#39;m sorry&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You see? I understand that pursuing you would only lead to heartache, Bronn.&#34; It was a difficult realization to grasp, but I had to acknowledge it: my hopes of love with him were nothing more than an impossible dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed I had to come to terms with the fact that Bronn and I would never be more than friends. As I was processing this, my phone rang, displaying Jakob&#39;s name. I spotted him inside the restaurant, apparently searching for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to take this call; we&#39;re not done yet,&#34; I informed Bronn sternly before answering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without exchanging pleasantries, I addressed Jakob, &#34;Come out here. We&#39;re in the garden area.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood, boss!&#34; Jakob replied, chuckling before I hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A restaurant server guided Jakob outside. He immediately saw that Bronn and I were having a serious talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You smell human!&#34; I blurted out, unable to contain my surprise at his decidedly business casual attire, just as he had promised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disregarding my comment, Jakob remarked, &#34;I saw Emily inside She&#39;s been drinking wine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes! She&#39;s with us Now, tell me the truth! Did you conspire with Bronn and not tell me about Emily&#39;s background?&#34; I felt a sense of betrayal. I had never imagined Jakob would choose loyalty to Bronn over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh&#34; Jakob hesitated, scratching his head as he searched for an explanation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was then that Bronn dropped a bombshell, &#34;Jakob is my brother... He&#39;s the only person who knows Emily because... we&#39;re brothers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I gasped, my eyes widening in utter disbelief and confusion. &#34;What the hell, Jakob?! The room whenever we had video chats, was it a rented room? Or a place in your mansion in Henderson?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth hit me hard. I had never visited Jakob in his supposed apartment in Henderson. All I remembered was him talking about having a roommate and a small bed. But he&#39;d been using my car, or my Netflix account, always dressed casually. Nothing hinted that he was Bronn&#39;s brother, the millionaire behind the tech giant BM Technology.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had met Bronn&#39;s grandfather previously and interacted with his parents on a few occasions, but I had never crossed paths with Jakob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jakob raised both his hands, seemingly understanding what was going through my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen, doll. I-I can explain Please, you&#39;ve got to understand; you hid who you really are from me too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt as if my own secrecy had rebounded on me like I was being punished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The two of you! I don&#39;t want to talk to you for the time being!&#34; I told them firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaving the restaurant alone, my bodyguard followed me until I found myself in a bar, drowning my thoughts in alcohol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like everyone in my life was playing a role, including myself, the biggest pretender of all. Damn it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I drank, I couldn&#39;t shake off the question: should I try to make new friends or accept being alone? I felt like I let down those I cared about, and they let me down, too. My disappointment outweighed my anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jakob knew everything about me, but I never thought he&#39;d hurt me like this. But then, who was I to demand answers from him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hours trickled by, and I lost all sense of time and awareness. Drinking wasn&#39;t my usual pastime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a twist of ironic fate, when I woke up the following morning, I found myself confronted with the startling realization that I had remarried my &#39;first&#39; husband overnight!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up to the sight of perhaps the largest engagement ring I&#39;d ever seen on my finger and our marriage license innocently lying on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;What the hell just happened, Sarah!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t want to drink margaritas anymore.</p>
