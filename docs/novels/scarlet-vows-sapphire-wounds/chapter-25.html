                <p>**Sarah**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reluctantly agreed to Josh&#39;s demands, which led me to tolerate Philip&#39;s shenanigans. Now, I&#39;m stuck with the scoundrel in apartment number 5.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chef from a local hotel came by to prepare dinner for us, sparking my curiosity about Megan&#39;s absence. Where had she been these past days, not accompanying Philip?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to suppress my curiosity, I asked, &#34;Where is Megan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip&#39;s expression soured before he replied curtly, &#34;She&#39;s at the hotel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perplexed, I probed further, &#34;Why didn&#39;t you accompany her? Your presence here seems unnecessary. Aren&#39;t you concerned for her safety at the hotel?&#34; My question wasn&#39;t driven by genuine concern for Megan; instead, I was simply puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip proceeded to pour soup into my cup, deflecting the conversation. &#34;Eat more,&#34; he urged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His actions spoke volumes-he clearly didn&#39;t want to discuss Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shifting the topic, I inquired, &#34;Why are you still in Henderson? Do you not intend to return to Luminary Productions?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am still handling work matters while in Henderson and can continue to provide for you,&#34; he assured me, causing me to raise an eyebrow. &#34;I will return to Highland Hills after the gala event that Megan and I are attending tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help but be impressed by his stoicism. With the gala not until tomorrow night, I realized I had a window of opportunity to escape from Philip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be taking you home with me,&#34; Philip announced, prompting me to splatter soup from my mouth onto his face. He wiped his wet face with a towel, surprisingly unperturbed by my reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean you&#39;re taking me to Highland Hills?&#34; I queried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll follow me in a month, remember?&#34; he reminded me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I have a job,&#34; I countered mentally. Was he planning to conceal me in Highland Hills for a month?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression soured at my excuse. &#34;I&#39;ll give you a job at Luminary if you want one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help but smirk. &#34;I want to be a famous celebrity. Will you grant me that too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, considering. &#34;Since when did you decide you wanted the admiration of many men?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was momentarily speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip, our deal was about becoming a famous celebrity. What does that have to do with men? Celebrities aren&#39;t objects of desire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Many male fans idolize celebrities under Luminary,&#34; he pointed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t you think that maybe I want to get rich? That&#39;s why I said that.&#34; A twist of discomfort tightened my features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmmm... you want to get rich? I&#39;ll provide the means. Besides, you won&#39;t get rich as Jakob&#39;s secretary either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, your plan for me is to become a submissive woman who will merely wait for you either at Serenity Pines Estate or Luminary&#39;s office. You want to control me, Philip.&#34; I ground my teeth, piecing together my ex-husband&#39;s scheme for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But his response caught me off guard. &#34;Yes,&#34; he admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fist clenched. &#34;That&#39;s not happening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rose from my seat to leave, but he intervened forcefully. &#34;Sit down, Sarah!&#34; His voice thundered, but I paid him no heed. In a sudden, violent motion, he seized me, throwing me off balance and onto his lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it! You&#39;re becoming difficult to control, woman!&#34; he cursed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not your dog, Philip!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who said you&#39;re my dog? You&#39;re my wife!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gritted my teeth. &#34;I&#39;m not your wife either, you jerk!&#34; He hadn&#39;t treated me like one in the past, either!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I struggled to free myself from his grasp, desperately attempting to rise from his suffocating hold, but his grip was an iron vice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop wiggling your hips! Damn it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze when I felt something big pressing from his trousers, my cheeks burning. &#34;You&#39;re an ass!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, yeah. Call me whatever you want, love,&#34; he sighed, skewering a piece of meat with a fork and feeding it to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It dawned on me that I had barely eaten, having only had some soup. The silence between us was a refuge, a rare moment of tranquility. So, I allowed him to feed me while perched on his lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension in Philip&#39;s body was palpable, radiating through his touch as he caressed my waist, leaving a trail of kisses along my neck while he fed me. Despite my best efforts to resist, I couldn&#39;t deny the rush of pleasure coursing through me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fvck!&#34; he swore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In one swift motion, he lifted me into his arms, carrying me towards one of the bedrooms. My mind swirled, thoughts scattering like leaves in the wind as he guided me into the room, enveloping me in a haze of desire and anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Philip**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ve desired to exert control over Sarah. It&#39;s a compulsion I couldn&#39;t resist. For three years, I wielded authority over our relationship, ensuring she remained under my influence. But observing her current reaction, it appears she&#39;s discontent with this dynamic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nevertheless, the mere thought of her working at BM Technologies alongside Bronn or Jakob or residing here in Henderson with Amir filled me with an overwhelming sense of unease. The mere thought of other men encroaching upon her space disturbed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Serenity Pines, at least, she was solely in my presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I placed Sarah on the bed, my longing for her intensified. Yet, I knew I must restrain myself. Our past intimacy was undeniably satisfying, and it&#39;s that connection I yearn for the most. As I held her, I felt the familiar rush of desire, but I resisted the urge to act impulsively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, just stay,&#34; I pleaded in a whisper, my words tenderly caressing her delicate ears before indulging in the sweetness of her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Entwining my legs around hers, I savored the sensation of her warmth against me. With a gentle touch, my tongue traced the contours of her neck, eliciting shivers of anticipation. At the same time, my hands explored the curves of her tiny waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The exquisite response of her skin sent waves of ecstasy pulsating through me, a symphony of pleasure coursing through my veins. The familiar, intoxicating scent of her fragrance enveloped my senses, a soothing balm to my soul as my lips danced across her silken skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I placed delicate kisses upon her navel, tracing every curve and contour of her torso with adoration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that intimate embrace, Sarah&#39;s fingers tenderly caressed my hair, igniting a fervent passion within me. With an ardent yearning, my lips found their way to her concealed chest, where I seized hold of her, consumed by the hunger that surged through my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip...&#34; Her voice, a melody of longing and desire, ignited a firestorm of emotions within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As our gazes intertwined, a wave of foolishness dissipated within me. In that fleeting moment, I seized the opportunity to answer the silent plea in her eyes. Cupping her jaw, I breathed in the air of her parted lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our kiss was slow yet consuming, penetrated like a puzzle piece that fits perfectly into her round lips, allowing the desire in her body to escape even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted Sarah to understand, to feel in her core that she possessed every inch of my being. I longed for her to realize the depth of what she had been missing all this time-the profound intimacy of this shared moment known only to us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hand traced a path upwards until it found the curve of her chest, gently caressing it. As I felt her hardened nipple beneath my touch, I knew she was ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling a shiver cascade down my spine, I was captivated by the lingering warmth of her fingertips against my neck. Our breaths intertwined in the air, charged with anticipation, while my swollen shaft, my pulse quickened, ready to pounce anytime soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought this was why I craved Sarah-the intimate connection that enveloped us even in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip...&#34; she gasped, feeling the teasing trail of my palm as it danced along the delicate lace of her panties. In my mind&#39;s eye, I envisioned the contours of her form. The desire to possess her consumed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve told you countless times, love. Can&#39;t you see? You are mine...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mouth made love with her skin, recalling the sensation that had been absent during her days away. But before I could begin to undress her, a commotion erupted outside, interrupting our moment.</p>
