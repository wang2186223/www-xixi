                <p>Sarah&#39;s anguished cries reverberated through my unconsciousness, her voice distorted as if echoing inside a vast, hollow drum. I yearned to chase after it, to pinpoint its source and find her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her confession about the baby filled her voice with fear, and I wanted to hug her, but I was being pulled back into darkness until her voice disappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After what felt like an eternity suspended in silent darkness, a searing light began to pull at the edges of my awareness. Gradually, painfully, my eyelids flickered open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensations immediately assaulted me. A hundred thousand needles seemed to pierce my back while the room blazed with an intense brightness. My head throbbed with pain, and I winced, wanting to curse, but it felt like something was lodged in my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;B-boss!&#34; a voice called out. It had to be Erwan. He quickly went to the door. &#34;D-Dr. Ethan! Boss Philip has regained consciousness!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rush of footsteps and urgent voices filled the hallway outside. I looked around while they busied themselves with things I couldn&#39;t understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to sit up made the room spin, forcing me to squeeze my eyes shut against the dizziness. I closed my eyes to steady myself and felt a thick bandage wrapped around my head. Glancing to the side, I noticed the medical equipment surrounding me-IV lines in my arms; heart monitors beeping steadily, and other machines I couldn&#39;t identify.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit!&#34; I hissed, desperately trying to piece together my fractured memories-the race... flashes of headlight... and then nothing but darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip!&#34; Ethan&#39;s voice called out. He entered with a doctor who began examining me, offering water to help me regain my senses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened? Where is Sarah?&#34; I asked as panic began to rise in my chest. The thought of her in Mariano&#39;s hands was terrifying. &#34;Goddammit, Ethan, where is she?&#34; My voice cracked with desperation as I tried again to sit up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s strong hands held me down, his face full of concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Easy, Philip! It would be best if you stayed still,&#34; he urged. &#34;Sarah didn&#39;t go to Romania if you&#39;re worried about that. She was closely guarded. Well, at least, until...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan, what happened?&#34; I demanded, the suspense killing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not until Amir took Sarah to Dubai to ensure her safety,&#34; Ethan assured me. &#34;Philip, you need to understand. You&#39;ve been in a coma for nearly three weeks. At first, we couldn&#39;t even locate you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan explained everything that had happened, including the kidnapping of my sister Jane. This prompted Sarah to return to Serenity Pines Estate and strike a deal with my mother to deliver the ransom money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the total weight of the situation hit me, I narrowed my eyes. &#34;Are you saying Sarah was in mortal danger while I was lying here, as useless as a corpse?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I attempted to stand, driven by a surge of adrenaline, but my weakened body betrayed me. Damn it! I need to regain my strength, but it seems impossible right now!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take me to Neon Port!&#34; I ordered the guard. I lashed out, unable to tolerate being forced to stay in bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip, for God&#39;s sake, calm down!&#34; Ethan shouted, torn between his medical training and friendship. &#34;You&#39;re too weak to charge in like this! They have a plan, and you need to trust your wife!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grabbed his clothing and glared at him fiercely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan, if anything happens to her, it&#39;s my fault!&#34; My voice cracked with frustration, and tears formed in my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You stubborn ass!&#34; Ethan snapped, then sighed heavily. Shaking his head, he prepared an injection. &#34;This will give you a temporary boost, but I&#39;m warning you-you&#39;re pushing your body to its limits.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes later, Ethan and I got into his car, followed by another vehicle carrying my two guards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s car stopped at the port, and my vision began to clear. My body was still in pain, but I needed to be strong. The port was bustling with activity. A van had been halted, encircled by a flurry of authorities. Amid the commotion, I spotted a familiar figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that Chairman Cornell?&#34; Ethan asked, shooting me a questioning glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wondered the same thing, suspecting my father was also here to save Jane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip, it&#39;s best if you remain here,&#34; Ethan said, his voice laced with concern. &#34;I don&#39;t have all the details of Sarah&#39;s plan, but I know she&#39;s not alone. Assistant Alex and Josh accompany her - they&#39;re there to ensure her safety. She&#39;s not as reckless as I thought. Mr. Martin and Sarah&#39;s beautiful assistant, Emily, are also involved in her plan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was speechless! I felt like a crazy person, agonizing over the thought that Sarah might do everything to save Jane, even if she&#39;s alone! In fact, I even felt jealous of Jane because of my wife&#39;s deep love for her friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck you, Ethan!&#34; I exploded. &#34;Why the hell didn&#39;t you tell me this sooner?&#34; Our heated exchanges were nothing new. &#34;I&#39;ve been with you all along, imagining Sarah walking into a trap, handing over the ransom money to my mother all by herself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t exactly ask, you rascal!&#34; he retorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dismissing my annoying friend, I called the guard who was with us in the other vehicle. &#34;I need you to find out exactly what&#39;s happening right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want to risk surprising my father or causing unnecessary conflict if they saw me unexpectedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes passed before the guard, accompanied by Trey, returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss!&#34; Trey exclaimed, his eyes widening in surprise as he spotted me inside Ethan&#39;s car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the current situation? I need details,&#34; I inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, we&#39;ve successfully rescued Ms. Jane. Additionally, we apprehended another member of Madam Cornell&#39;s team with Mr. Martin&#39;s assistance. Currently, we&#39;re awaiting the return of Madam Sarah&#39;s yacht to port. Her team has successfully captured Madam Cornell herself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes tightly, letting the information sink in. A mix of relief and anxiety churned in my stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should I inform them of your presence here, boss?&#34; Trey asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is Sarah alright? Is she safe?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trey nodded reassuringly. &#34;She&#39;s fine, boss. She&#39;s not alone-there are five highly trained guards with her, courtesy of Mr. Benner&#39;s security team. They&#39;ve been by her side this whole time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to sit still any longer, I pushed open the car door and stepped out. The chill of the sea breeze hit me immediately, cutting through my jacket and making me shiver. My head was pounding, and I felt slightly nauseous, but I forced myself to stand still. I couldn&#39;t let anyone see how shaken I truly was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard and Ethan were there to support me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re here!&#34; Ethan announced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched as Sarah descended towards the port with her group, bringing my mother, who seemed lost in her mind. As they approached, I noticed something wrong with Sarah. Her usual energy was gone, and her face looked unnaturally pale under the bright port lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, she collapsed, her legs giving way like a melting candle. Without thinking, I lunged forward, catching her just before she hit the ground, cradling her unconscious form against my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A collective gasp swept through the crowd, their confusion palpable as they struggled to understand why I had appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;B-boss!&#34; Alex exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shall I take her?&#34; Josh asked, looking directly at me for permission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;This guy!&#39; I thought to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He probably assumed I hadn&#39;t noticed his feelings for Sarah. The idea of him holding my wife made my blood boil. With a narrowed gaze, I chose to ignore his request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip!&#34; My mother&#39;s shrill voice broke the tension. Her eyes, wild with desperation, locked onto mine. &#34;Philip! Help me! Don&#39;t let them capture me! I&#39;ll die in prison, Philip! That woman has poisoned your mind!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to leave. The woman I once thought was my mother never gave a damn about me. During my disappearance or my time in a coma, she was busy scheming, maybe even when I was knocking on death&#39;s door. Her concern was more about money than my well-being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ending our relationship decisively, I declared, &#34;I will ensure you end up in jail, Mom. This is the price for destroying Sarah&#39;s life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes widened, and she screamed, losing control at the port. But I had already turned away, her cries fading into background noise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Placing Sarah gently in the car, I prepared to take her back to Serenity Pines...</p>
