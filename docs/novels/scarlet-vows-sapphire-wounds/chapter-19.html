                <p>**Sarah**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ve been considering since earlier that we shouldn&#39;t run into any problems with BM Technologies, but it didn&#39;t make sense if Megan wanted to undermine both Jakob and me. What I really need to contemplate is who&#39;s orchestrating all of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A figure rose from among Philip&#39;s team, wearing a plain button-up shirt. Without hesitation, he voiced, &#34;Isn&#39;t this strategy you&#39;re proposing considered cheating? Are you intending to replace the tool initially selected by Luminary Productions?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Selected?&#34; I echoed his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, just so you&#39;re aware, I&#39;m the project manager for this movie project. I&#39;m intimately familiar with the process, having been involved in the selection of the five options. President Cornell entrusted me with this project, and naturally, I prefer to avoid any potential embarrassment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smirk formed at the corner of my lips. &#34;In that case, may I inquire when the Holoforge was selected?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced briefly at Megan, his tone tinged with annoyance as he retorted, &#34;Why should I disclose that information to you? It&#39;s a managerial decision! That&#39;s confidential within the Luminary Productions team, understood?! Haiist! Why are you putting me on the spot in front of my boss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I apologize! If it&#39;s settled, we can proceed with the presentation featuring ChronoGrafix,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah!&#34; Jakob&#39;s voice quivered with apprehension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These kids! They&#39;re just being annoying!&#34; exclaimed the project manager.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trust me.&#34; As I reached out to give Jakob a friendly pat on the shoulder, a sudden chill shot down my spine like an icy arrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My senses heightened as I became aware of Philip&#39;s intense gaze fixated on us, his eyes narrowed with suspicion, especially aimed at my hand resting innocently on Jakob&#39;s shoulder. It was as if I had unwittingly touched a searing flame; I recoiled instinctively, withdrawing my hand as though scalded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What&#39;s wrong with that man?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ChronoGrafix presentation began to display on the screen, drawing gasps from those in the conference room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is ChronoGrafix, a visual effects tool that Mr. Jakob created six months ago,&#34; I started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on a minute! Isn&#39;t that also the Holoforge?! Damn it! I knew you two were deceivers. You&#39;ve copied the tool from Lucas and Stella, who presented earlier!&#34; Ethan Steele complained. &#34;Boss, we can&#39;t allow these two to deceive us like this! Mr. Martin, are you okay with having these kinds of people in your office?&#34; He scratched his head in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jakob clenched his fists, ready to confront Ethan, but I intervened. I whispered to Jakob, calming him down and advising him on how to clear our names.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression shifted as he absorbed my suggestion, and then he diverted his attention to the iPad he was holding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Ethan Steele, you mentioned earlier that Mr. Cornell assigned you to this project, correct?&#34; I confirmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Indeed! That&#39;s precisely why I assert that both of you are deceivers! You&#39;ve merely replicated Lucas and Stella&#39;s project!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In that case, my question is, amidst the five tools being presented now, how did it escape your notice that there is a similar tool and presentation? We are the finalists-indicating that these five tools have already undergone scrutiny to align with Luminary Production&#39;s preferences,&#34; I clarified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Sarah makes a valid point!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers rippled through the graphic designers inside the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I simply overlooked it, but now I&#39;ve just realized! How is it that you seem more informed than me? Tsk! Step down there so you can see what you two are searching for! This is exasperating!&#34; He directed his frustration towards Bronn Martin, who sat quietly but with a subtle smirk, seemingly studying my approach to the situation. &#34;Mr. Martin, I&#39;ve heard that these two are newcomers to your company! Do you approve of stealing concepts at BM Technologies? Tsk! It would be best if you two stepped onto the stage because we don&#39;t have time for you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Continuing my explanation, I added, &#34;We will ascertain the truth! BM Technologies dispatched various trial tools to Luminary Productions so they could assess the free versions beforehand-that&#39;s why we&#39;re here. Earlier, I inquired about the inclusion of Holoforge in the list. How can we be certain that it wasn&#39;t Holoforge that copied from ChronoGrafix?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They presented Holoforge before ChronoGrafix in the sequence of presentations to create the illusion that the tool is original compared to ChronoGrafix. It&#39;s easy to assume that the subsequent tool copied the first one presented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve been with the company for quite some time! Three years at BM Technologies, to be exact! And you,&#34; Lucas countered, gesturing towards the newcomer, &#34;you&#39;ve only been here for three months! It&#39;s only natural that we have more experience.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan Steele chimed in, his tone laced with anger. &#34;Exactly! Jakob&#39;s practically a stranger in this industry. How can we be certain he didn&#39;t just lift ChronoGrafix from Lucas&#39;s Holoforge?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I met Ethan&#39;s accusation with a steady gaze. &#34;Is that so? Well, there&#39;s encryption in the ChronoGrafix trial that only Jakob can decipher. It includes the entire history of the tool: usage frequency, specific features utilized, and even recipient details. So, Mr. Steele, are you absolutely certain you didn&#39;t forward it to Lucas and Stella? Perhaps they can replicate Jakob&#39;s hard work?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t fathom any other motive behind such actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan protested, &#34;But retrieving all that information is illegal!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Steele, there&#39;s a terms and conditions acceptance box you have to tick before even accessing the tool. By proceeding, you&#39;re essentially agreeing to abide by the rules. Unless, of course, you simply clicked &#39;agree&#39; without bothering to read them,&#34; I countered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip&#39;s expression soured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He sent it to Lucas&#39;s email address!&#34; Jakob exclaimed, his eyes widening as he peered at the iPad in his hands. &#34;And it was sent last night!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, we could assume that Mr. Steele altered Lucas and Stella&#39;s proposal project last night!&#34; I asserted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to speak!&#34; Lucas rose nervously, repeatedly bowing to apologize. He seemed cornered, with no choice but to confess. &#34;Mr. Martin, I&#39;m sorry! I received an anonymous message last night suggesting that Jakob&#39;s graphic tool had a better chance of being included in their project! I-I&#34; He stumbled over his words. &#34;They assured me I wouldn&#39;t get caught! I-I was just dazzled because I really wanted to work at Luminary. I&#39;m sorry!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bronn&#39;s bodyguards approached, escorting Lucas out of the conference. Stella trailed after them in tears. I could see the bleak future ahead for both Lucas and Stella within BM Technologies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip stood up. &#34;We have heard enough. Mr. Martin, my apologies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;M-Mr. President!&#34; Mr. Steele interjected. &#34;I-I must confess! It&#39;s Ms. Megan! She discovered the presentation process today and insisted on excluding Mr. Jakob from the project! I simply followed her lead!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s face contorted in a theatrical display of shock, her eyes widening in disbelief. &#34;What? Philip, that&#39;s absurd! I&#39;m a major sponsor of this project! Why would I sabotage something I&#39;m funding myself?&#34; Megan argued. &#34;Don&#39;t let him disrespect me like this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan made a valid point, yet within the depths of her seemingly innocent demeanor, the subtle curve of her smile, the nonchalant flicker of her reactions, and the insidious undertones of her gaslighting tactics, I know the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip&#39;s smile, brimming with trust toward Megan, made me sick to my stomach! Is he the mastermind behind all this, or does he just have a weakness for Megan, as usual? It only intensified the ache in my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel like I&#39;m suffocating once more, and it&#39;s definitely time for my medication! The memory of Megan&#39;s unsettling smile on the day I woke up in the hospital floods my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jake, I-I need to excuse myself to the ladies&#39; room!&#34; I muster a strained smile, hoping to conceal the tightening grip around my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it! I have to get back to our office immediately and drink my medicine!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My vision began to blur, the edges fading into darkness, while my hand clutched my chest with an intensity that matched the pounding of my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I... I couldn&#39;t afford to black out now! Not with Philip and everyone watching.</p>
