                <p>**Sarah**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While we stood outside the salon, Jane responded to my comment, &#34;My brother has too much on his plate, Sarah. He was scolded by our father yesterday when he visited the mansion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh? Why?&#34; I asked, confused. I had been preoccupied with work alongside Jakob and had no idea about Philip&#39;s daily life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s because the board members and some supporters of Luminary Productions already know you two have separated. Brother Philip has often brought Megan to various business events and social occasions for the past year. The public seems to think they&#39;re in a relationship. Dad wants to make that news official to protect Brother Philip&#39;s image with our business associates. Madam Cornell also pushed this to validate Philip and Megan&#39;s status.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Few people know you are married to Brother Philip. From the beginning, others assumed Megan was married to the Cornells. Brother Philip has been under immense stress but hasn&#39;t shown it. I don&#39;t want to add to the problem, Sarah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thought struck me: perhaps Madam Cornell had indeed planned to hide me away at Serenity Pines Estate for three years to keep my identity in Philip&#39;s life a secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want to dwell on the past anymore. It only brought sadness, made me question my actions, and risked triggering another panic attack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah? Jane?&#34; We both turned towards the voice. It was Dr. Ethan Vanderbilt, Philip&#39;s friend, grinning as he approached us. &#34;What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dr. Vanderbilt, with his silver-gray hair that only added to his cocky demeanor, stood there with dark roots showing about an inch at the base.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane spoke, &#34;Dr. Ethan, the salon threw Sarah and me out. They humiliated us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chimed in after Jane, &#34;They claimed we didn&#39;t have an appointment! But Philip assured me we had a booking with Brandy. I mean, I was getting a manicure. Jane was the one who had her hair appointment with Brandy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor grimaced. &#34;So, Philip was the one who booked the appointments for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right!&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm. If that&#39;s the case, it&#39;s unlikely there was no appointment. Come!&#34; Dr. Ethan led us back inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we reentered the shop, the receptionist&#39;s eyes narrowed, and Rebecca&#39;s face twisted into a sneer. &#34;You&#39;re unbelievably persistent and irritating!&#34; The woman spat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rebecca laughed, ringing with mockery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already told you to leave! I&#39;m going to call the police because you&#39;re disturbing our salon!&#34; the receptionist angrily scolded Jane and me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who said you&#39;re calling the police?&#34; Ethan asked from behind us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;D-Dr. Vanderbilt!&#34; The receptionist bowed her head. &#34;These two insist they have a reservation this afternoon, but I can&#39;t find anything on the schedule!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan!&#34; Rebecca&#39;s face lit up with surprise. She pointed an accusatory finger at me. &#34;That woman thinks she can sneak into the salon and skip ahead of those waiting patiently for their appointments. I&#39;ve been here for ages, waiting for my turn, practically camping out at this doorstep, hoping to get a slot!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right, Dr. Vanderbilt! They&#39;re causing trouble in our store,&#34; said the receptionist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dr. Ethan, are you a regular here?&#34; Jane inquired, her curiosity piqued as we both observed Ethan&#39;s familiarity with the woman at the desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rebecca interjected playfully, &#34;Oh, you two are so innocent! The Vanderbilts own this shop!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My sister manages this establishment,&#34; Ethan explained with a grin before returning his attention to the receptionist. &#34;Did you remember to check the VIP log sheets?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The receptionist&#39;s eyes widened as she hurriedly searched her computer for another log sheet, where our names, Jane&#39;s and mine, were indeed marked for the VIP section.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, my goodness! I-I apologize, Ms. Mitchell and Ms. Cornell!&#34; The receptionist apologized profusely, kneeling on the tiles. &#34;I didn&#39;t realize you were expected in the VIP section. VIPs seldom visit, and it didn&#39;t occur to me that you might be among them. It&#39;s my first time seeing you here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? What VIP section?&#34; Rebecca stammered, perplexed. &#34;Why haven&#39;t I heard of that before?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s quite straightforward. It&#39;s because you&#39;re not a VIP,&#34; I remarked, provoking her further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rebecca retorted, frustrated, &#34;You-! That can&#39;t be, Ethan! I&#39;ve been a loyal client for years! How come I&#39;ve never been informed? It&#39;s unfair! I demand to speak with your sister!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan calmly explained, &#34;We only have ten VIPs in the entire salon branch-myself, Philip, and a select few important people. Are you suggesting you belong among those few important people?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though embarrassed, Rebecca insisted, &#34;That&#39;s not what I meant, Ethan. But I believe I should be a VIP! I&#39;ve spent a considerable amount of money here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting one corner of my lips, I remarked, &#34;Rebecca, you&#39;re not exactly unique here. Every client at this salon splurges; you&#39;re not alone. Unless you&#39;re Queen Elizabeth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rebecca grew visibly irritated with me, but I couldn&#39;t help but grin. It was almost too easy to provoke her, much like her friend Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan clarified, &#34;Philip secured the VIP slot due to his ownership of this property. The others secured their slots through various means. Sarah&#39;s assessment was accurate. Just being a regular doesn&#39;t guarantee VIP status. If you&#39;re dissatisfied, you&#39;re free to seek services elsewhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing at the trembling receptionist who had escorted Jane and me out, I could see her fear-stricken demeanor. She had done a poor job indeed. &#34;I warned you earlier about this; I&#39;ll fire you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, please, Ms. Mitchell!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You even threatened to involve the police with Jane and me. What if it had been a different VIP customer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was, I wasn&#39;t inclined to stoop so low as to request the owner or Ethan to fulfill that desire. However, it was unacceptable for her to scrutinize us earlier as if we were unworthy of a reservation with Brandy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Mitchell, please! I&#39;m so sorry! I promise to be more diligent!&#34; she pleaded tearfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll handle her, Sarah,&#34; Ethan interjected, promptly calling ten staff members to assist Jane and me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My attention no longer lingers on her. I playfully stuck my tongue out at Rebecca, further irritating her. With jealousy flashing in her eyes, she hurled her bag and stomped her feet as she watched Jane and me being escorted to the heavenly retreat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;s no longer a concern of mine. Today, after the morning&#39;s taxing debate with Megan and Rebecca, I crave being pampered and happy! Our destination was the second floor of Coiffures, where the spa awaited us. Nail technicians, masseuses, experts in grooming, and even a bubbling jacuzzi awaited, promising respite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Brandy inquired, I confided in her about Jane&#39;s predicament. The spa&#39;s treatments were blissful; tension melted away under skilled hands, lulling me into a tranquil slumber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I awoke, I found myself leaning against a broad chest, both of us immersed in the fragrant waters of the tub. Philip&#39;s familiar scent enveloped me, soothing my mind with safety assurance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where am I? Philip?&#34; I murmured, lifting my gaze to meet his, and he greeted me with a tender kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt the warmth of his hand, a tender caress tracing along my body. As his touch pinched my nipple, a shiver of anticipation raced down my spine. A soft gasp escaped my lips as his touch found its mark, his lips following a path of desire along my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, lost in his touch&#39;s embrace, the world&#39;s cares faded away like whispers in the wind, leaving only the exquisite sensation of his caress against my skin.</p>
