                <p>**Sarah**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip cast a glance at the pink car tailing us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm... Who could that be?&#34; he inquired calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not sure,&#34; I responded, stepping on the accelerator. I noticed the pink car matching our speed, confirming my suspicion that it was tailing us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have a lot of enemies you can&#39;t even recognize who&#39;s trailing us?&#34; he queried once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s as if you&#39;re implying I have a bad attitude,&#34; I retorted, pressing harder on the gas pedal. That pink car wouldn&#39;t outmaneuver me when it came to driving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip extracted his cellphone from his pocket, dialing Assistant Alex&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need answers, now. Find out who owns that car with the license plate...&#34; He recited the plate number to Alex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sped on, the adrenaline coursing through my veins, until the pink car vanished from view, swallowed by the twists and turns of the road. Three agonizing minutes later, Philip&#39;s phone buzzed with a response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;According to Alex, the owner of that pink car is Jessica Woods,&#34; Philip announced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What on earth does that person expect from me? Jessica&#39;s clearly in the throes of madness at the moment. Confronting her now would be like stepping into a raging storm without a compass. It&#39;s simply not the right time to challenge her insanity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you staying?&#34; I inquired of Philip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Apartment number 5,&#34; he promptly responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was momentarily speechless. Philip seemed quite stubborn about residing in the same apartment I was renting. Yet, considering the circumstances of our previous encounter, his claim seemed justified since he had paid me ten thousand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; he pressed further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I originally planned to drop you off at the hotel where you should stay. It might be unsafe to remain at Apartment Number 5; Jessica might show up. She could already be aware of my staying there,&#34; I explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perhaps booking a hotel would be wiser,&#34; he suggested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a heavy sigh, I relented to Philip&#39;s proposal. Pulling the car to a stop outside the imposing façade of the Heritage Harvest Hotel, exhaustion weighed heavily upon me. I had no energy left for further debate. Spending the night at the hotel seemed like the most sensible choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip booked a family room, his arm draped over my shoulder as we went to the rented room. Once inside, he pulled me close and kissed me against the door, sending a delightful shock through me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his tender caress, I felt the soft whisper of his fingertips tracing the contours of my jawline, his heartbeat a symphony that resonated with the depth of our bond. As our lips met, our tongues waltzed in a graceful rhythm, merging into a perfect union of souls. With each breath, our spirits intertwined, creating a harmonious melody.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But every time I&#39;m near Philip like this, all my self-awareness seems to vanish, leaving me adrift. As our lips parted, a torrent of questions flooded my mind-about Philip&#39;s intentions involving me-but I knew delving into them would only cause me more pain. Fear and uncertainty gripped me; I felt lost...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want something to eat?&#34; he asked, breaking the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was then that I realized I hadn&#39;t eaten yet. &#34;Yes, please,&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Philip called for food, I went to one of the bedrooms. Shedding my clothes, I hastily washed away the remnants of the day, the steamy water offering a momentary escape from my racing thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amidst the rush of water, my mind flitted to Amir&#39;s complicated relationship with Jessica, the unsettling behavior of that woman following me after Amir broke up with her, my relationship with my father, and, most significantly, my tangled emotions for Philip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I used to be head over heels in love with him. Even now, traces of that enduring love lingered in my heart, but a newfound wariness tempered it. I knew I had to guard myself against trusting Philip again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wrapping a robe around me, I sank into the plush cushions of the couch, my gaze drawn to the breathtaking view beyond the expansive glass windows. The vibrant lights of the distant Las Vegas Strip bathed Henderson in a captivating glow, offering a moment of respite from the tumult within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The depth of the darkness enveloped me, exhaustion dragging me down like an anchor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Philip**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have a strong yearning to win Sarah back. She&#39;s the only one who helped me see things clearly. In her presence, I find solace, a tranquility that eludes me elsewhere. Her beauty radiated even in our banter, even when she jested, labeling me as stupid or moron; it&#39;s amusing, and I can&#39;t help but smile because I find her adorable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reflecting on our past, I remember a different Sarah when she was my wife. She seemed reserved, almost timid as if she didn&#39;t want to converse with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sara?&#34; I called out, scanning the room after I received the food delivery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There she lay, nestled on the couch, her delicate features softened in slumber. Seeing her like this brought a sense of peace. Her face was tranquil and serene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gently, I brushed a stray lock of hair from her face, aching for her to return to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must come back to me, Sarah,&#34; I whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carefully, I lifted her and laid her on the bed. Despite my desire to do many things to her body, I recognized her exhaustion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deciding to check the adjacent room, I called Alex once more. &#34;Discover what plans Ms. Jessica Woods harbors for Sarah. She trailed us earlier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s insane, boss!&#34; Alex exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. She&#39;s delusional if she thinks I&#39;ll let her near my woman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, I have an update on the investigation you assigned to me. It appears that Madam Cornell was the one who sent Sarah to the OB-Gyne last year. We couldn&#39;t locate the doctor who performed the procedure on Ms. Sarah&#39;s womb, but we did find the nurse who was a witness to everything. Would you like to meet with the nurse to ask some questions? I can have someone from the team reach out to her. She&#39;s been reassigned to Henderson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing at my watch, my eagerness to uncover the truth weighed heavily upon me. &#34;Yes, arrange for me to meet with the nurse and have Trey stay with Sarah while I&#39;m away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood, boss!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After making the call to Alex, Megan was on the line again. Our frequent communication centered on our work together, particularly on the Sci-Fi project, where she was involved in the movie production.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello,&#34; I greeted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip, we have an upcoming event next week. I thought I&#39;d give you a heads-up so you can prepare,&#34; Megan informed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please relay that to Alex. He handles my schedule for meetings and works,&#34; I replied casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s already aware. I saw it marked on your office schedule.&#34; Megan had been my companion for trips and business events over the past year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip, I heard that the Benner-Woods wedding is off. What else are you doing in Henderson?&#34; she asked, her tone laced with insecurity, almost like a jealous girlfriend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan, we need to rethink how we communicate if you&#39;re going to ask me personal questions like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; she exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t wish to cause Megan further distress. After all, we share a history as friends and former partners. Despite past complexities, I endeavor to maintain a respectful rapport, especially considering her ties to my mother. However, her behavior as a business associate is beginning to test my patience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this about my inquiry? I apologize, Philip. It&#39;s just... I can&#39;t help but feel uneasy. I don&#39;t want to see you with Sarah,&#34; she confessed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her response only fueled my annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very well, I&#39;m ending this call,&#34; I stated firmly, hitting the end button.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock on the door interrupted the moment, announcing the arrival of three bodyguards, including Trey, who often accompanied Sarah at Serenity Pines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quickly donning a long black coat in preparation for venturing outside, I addressed Trey sternly, &#34;We can&#39;t afford any mishaps with Sarah, especially after her escape in Highland Hills.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, boss!&#34; Trey responded, his expression reflecting remorse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without further acknowledgment, I followed the other two bodyguards who were to escort me to the nurse. I needed to uncover the truth of Sarah&#39;s pregnancy!</p>
