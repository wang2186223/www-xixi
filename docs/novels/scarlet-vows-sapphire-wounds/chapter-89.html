                <p>**Philip**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on now, let&#39;s get you back to your suite,&#34; I murmured, putting my arm around Sarah&#39;s waist to help her walk steadily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sobbed uncontrollably, her cries deep and raw, as if she were saying a painful goodbye to her best friends. As I guided her unsteady steps out of the dimly lit bar, my heart ached with remorse at the sight of her suffering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shh, don&#39;t cry, babe... your pretty eyes will go red and puffy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s your fault! You hurt me. Why can&#39;t you love me? Why does no one like me?&#34; She cried like a baby while we were in the hallway. Guests and hotel staff looked concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, babe Come on I&#39;ll take you to your bed,&#34; I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Philip! Why does everyone hurt me?&#34; I could hear the pain in her voice. Even in her drunken state, she was carrying the weight of the pain I caused her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen, babe Lying to you that night was the dumbest mistake of my life. But I was weak I did what I thought I had to. My mother keeps bothering you, and I couldn&#39;t take it anymore. I keep giving you heartache.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She continued crying like a child. As I held her trembling body in my arms, I was struck by her fragrance, her warmth, her very essence-everything I had so foolishly thrown away. I couldn&#39;t believe how blind and idiotic I had been not to realize how precious she was until it was too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did I let Sarah leave? Why did I ruin the life we could have had?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I loved this woman with every fiber of my being... but my actions had taken away my right to tell her. I decided to become a better person, to earn wealth, power, and status-to be someone worthy of her love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip hurt me so much in the past...&#34; she whimpered brokenly, her tears dampening the fabric of my shirt as she clung to me. &#34;He hurt me. No one has ever hurt me the way he did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes, feeling sorry, and hugged her tighter. Then, I gently kissed her on the forehead. &#34;You will never be hurt because of me again, babe That&#39;s a promise!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A group of people dashed down the hallway, led by a stunning woman in a beautiful white dress. She was followed by a group of bridesmaids dressed in stylish black outfits. It seemed weddings were a frequent affair in this town.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, guys! We&#39;re dreadfully late!&#34; the woman, presumably the bride, exclaimed as she hurried past us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman at the back, who looked like she was in her early thirties, fixed us with a disapproving glare. &#34;Hey, why are you still here? Hurry up! You have to follow the bride!&#34; she scolded firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I contemplated correcting her, but Sarah darted forward. Her cheeks flushed with drunken glee as she trailed after the noisy wedding party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah, stop!&#34; I called out in alarm. I worried she might stumble or worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! I want to witness the wedding! Come on, let&#39;s go!&#34; she insisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing at my watch, I remembered she had a presentation the following afternoon. Resigned, I tagged along, unwilling to see her disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were directed into a waiting limousine outside the hotel. Unsure whether to board, I paused, uncertain if it was wise, but Sarah rushed in before I could say anything. I couldn&#39;t leave her alone, so I reluctantly followed her into the fancy interior, bending down as I squeezed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss!&#34; Trey called out, left behind in the commotion. &#34;Damn it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I surveyed the strangers in the limousine, all dressed in black. Then I looked at Sarah and myself. Our attire matched theirs perfectly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn! There seemed to be a misunderstanding. But I was too embarrassed to say anything, too ashamed to admit it now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, are you friends of the bride or the groom?&#34; a woman asked, sensing we were the odd ones out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah erupted into laughter. &#34;Neither! We don&#39;t even know the bride or groom!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The occupants of the limousine exchanged glances before bursting into laughter themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never knew you could crack such hilarious jokes!&#34; remarked one man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Embarrassed, My face burned, and I wished I could vanish into the comfortable leather seats. But when my gaze landed on Sarah, witnessing the shameless delight sparkling in her gray orbs, I couldn&#39;t help but shake my head with a resigned chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckled and surrendered to the group&#39;s infectious joy. They were super excited, singing loudly, dancing freely, and just having a wild time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before we knew it, the car stopped outside Lovers&#39; Haven Wedding Chapel. We were ushered inside and greeted by several couples waiting to exchange vows. It felt like everyone around us had caught the wedding bug, and many were eager to make their commitment official.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly informed Trey of our unexpected detour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the ceremony unfolded, Sarah suddenly felt compelled to join the couples at the altar. She confidently approached the officiant or a minister of some sort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir! You need to marry me to my husband right this instant!&#34; Sarah insisted to the confused man, &#34;This guy right here, he&#39;s my incredibly handsome husband! Please, you have to let us renew our vows right now!&#34; Her words poured out rapidly, fueled by her drunken excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shot an apologetic glance at the officiant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t listen to my wife, sir. She&#39;s quite intoxicated at the moment,&#34; I explained, gently pulling Sarah away. Though inwardly frustrated by her actions, I kept my cool outwardly. &#34;Sarah, you&#39;re not thinking clearly&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I winced, feeling acutely uncomfortable as I realized that every person in the chapel had turned their attention toward us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew it! You don&#39;t love me!&#34; Sarah cried out, her distress escalating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Babe, please, let&#39;s calm down,&#34; I urged, sure she&#39;d regret this outburst once she sobered up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The officiant took pity on the distressed woman. &#34;Since you&#39;re already married, having another ceremony won&#39;t be a big deal,&#34; he reassured me kindly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is one of those events where I struggle to define our &#39;situationship&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Encouragement came from others in attendance. &#34;Come on, you&#39;re in Vegas! It would be a wonderfully memorable experience for a married couple!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made one last weak attempt to object, reaching for any excuse I could find. &#34;W-we don&#39;t even have rings,&#34; I blurted out, hoping it would suffice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Sarah&#39;s heartbroken sobs continued to flow, drawing more unwanted attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen, just go ahead with it! Renewing your vows with your wife won&#39;t hurt. She&#39;s convinced you don&#39;t love her anymore, poor thing,&#34; the officiant urged, echoing the sentiments of the onlookers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right!&#34; More whispers of agreement backed up his position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned in towards the officiant, whispering, &#34;Is there any way we can do this unofficially? Just have a wedding ceremony?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want Sarah to get emotional, nor did I want anyone to suspect anything fishy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely!&#34; The officiant&#39;s grin stretched from ear to ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wedding proceeded, fulfilling the attendees&#39; expectations. Sarah&#39;s face lit up with joy, and she clapped excitedly after it concluded. Her behavior seemed strange, almost overly enthusiastic. What could be prompting this unusual display?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Trey picked us up, my bodyguard was accompanied by Jakob, each in separate cars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah, I was really worried, looking everywhere for you! I checked into your suite, but you weren&#39;t there. Thankfully, I bumped into President Cornell&#39;s bodyguard. Why didn&#39;t you pick up your phone?&#34; Jakob scolded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do not raise your voice at my wife,&#34; I interjected sternly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My apologies, President Cornell...&#34; he muttered through gritted teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah silently slipped into the car, closing her eyes as if wanting to take the world away. &#34;I don&#39;t want to talk to you,&#34; she declared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jakob clenched his jaw, visibly irritated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The officiant chose that moment to approach, eyeing the luxury vehicles idling at the curb. &#34;Mr. Cornell? You haven&#39;t settled your bill for my services this evening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I inwardly cursed. Of course, the officiant probably pushed that ceremony to get a payment. Exhausted and frustrated, I rubbed my nose, realizing the night wasn&#39;t finished yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll handle it so that you can take Sarah back. She looks exhausted,&#34; Jakob offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; I muttered, realizing too late that I shouldn&#39;t have entrusted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the hotel, Sarah suggested hitting the casino. It seemed she had a sudden surge of energy when intoxicated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A lot of things happened after that! When morning arrived, I felt a surge of rage towards Jakob for registering our marriage license. How the hell did he pull that off?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t fucking know!</p>
