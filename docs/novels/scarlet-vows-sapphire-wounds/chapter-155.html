                <p>**Sarah**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleven years ago...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darkness had settled over the tropical landscape, with the moon barely visible through the thick clouds. Waves crashed fiercely against the shore behind our villa, their rhythmic roar contrasting sharply with the chaos inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today was meant to be a joyous occasion-my 17th birthday. My family was at the Palm Beach resort to celebrate, but it didn&#39;t feel like a celebration. My parents had been in their room for a while. All I knew was that my father had been drinking heavily after receiving some documents from his assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their argument echoed through the villa. The walls were thin, offering no soundproofing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t do this, Xavier!&#34; my mother pleaded, her voice filled with despair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sickening sound of shattering glass punctuated her words, followed by heart-wrenching sobs, and it made Amir and me uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brother, I&#39;m afraid&#34; I whispered to Amir, trembling as he held me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t respond. I had forgotten that he had already started to grow distant from me because of Jessica.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mother&#39;s voice rose again, more apparent this time. &#34;I never blamed you for having another woman! Please, Xavier, don&#39;t do this to Sarah!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why is she mentioning my name? I trembled with fear and guilt, unaware of the tears streaming down my cheeks. Was I the reason for their argument?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guilt consumed me. Hearing my mother&#39;s anguish because of me was unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For seventeen years, you deceived me!&#34; my father roared. &#34;Why didn&#39;t I see it? How could I have been so blind?&#34; His rant was interrupted by a painful cry. &#34;Ahh!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I flinched when I heard my father&#39;s scream, followed by more breaking sounds. His image at that moment was completely different from how I knew him, especially since he always treated me like a princess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, the door to their room burst open violently. My father stood in the doorway, a terrifying sight, his eyes bloodshot and wild.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He narrowed his eyes at me. The sharp smell of whiskey clung to him, but his steps were steady as he walked into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Xavier! Don&#39;t!&#34; my mother cried out; her voice hoarse from crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Mom&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My father approached me, his fist clenched. He held the document tightly in his other hand, almost crumpling it. Was he planning to hurt me? Should I hide?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amir&#39;s tall frame blocked my view, shielding me from our father&#39;s menacing approach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll regret this, Dad! You won&#39;t hurt Sarah!&#34; Amir declared firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widened in shock. Did he plan to hurt me? My father, who had always treated me like a cherished princess, now posed a threat?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are not my daughter!&#34; he spat. With a violent gesture, he flung the crumpled documents to the floor before storming towards the villa&#39;s exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I curled, frozen, his declaration echoing in my mind. What could he possibly mean?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amir picked up the document, his hands trembling visibly. He glanced at our mother, still weeping in the bedroom doorway, her pristine white outfit now disheveled and tear-stained. My mother&#39;s gray eyes were filled with pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amir, follow your father!&#34; our mother ordered firmly despite her grief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;B-but...&#34; My brother was hesitant and undecided. I knew he didn&#39;t want to leave our shattered mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your dad&#39;s been drinking, Amir! Follow him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I I need answers!&#34; my brother responded, also in tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll answer all your questions, but follow your dad!&#34; She grabbed Amir by both arms. &#34;I won&#39;t let TerraTraxx go to someone else! You&#39;ll inherit it, Amir! Follow your dad! Now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Amir dropped the documents in his haste to obey, I caught a glimpse of their contents. The truth hit me like a tidal wave-I wasn&#39;t Xavier Benner&#39;s biological child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah...&#34; My mother&#39;s voice was soft, full of sorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I collapsed into her arms, sobs wracking my body. The pain was overwhelming, made worse by the cruel timing. Why today, of all days?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want for a gift, dear?&#34; my mother still managed to ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question seemed absurd at the moment. How could I possibly think about presents? Nothing! I wanted nothing!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We cried together as she gently guided me to my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;W-who is my real father?&#34; I asked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took her a long time to answer. Her eyes narrowed as if the name caused her physical pain. &#34;Marcus Blackwood...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the name left her lips, the villa was plunged into darkness. Then, like someone who had lost their mind-gunshots echoed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, my God!&#34; My mother&#39;s hand flew to her mouth, eyes wide with terror. &#34;He&#39;s here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sprang into action, grabbing her trench coat and draping it over my shoulders. Her movements were frantic, driven by a fear I couldn&#39;t fully comprehend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wh-what is happening, Mom?!&#34; I stammered. The sudden change from a birthday celebration to a nightmare left me stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shhhh!&#34; She pushed aside the pain in her chest and the sobs from earlier. It seemed my mother had transformed at that moment, steeling herself out of necessity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She placed a bag in my pocket. &#34;There&#39;s money in here, Sarah, and your passport. Whatever happens, promise me you&#39;ll just drive. Drive far away, and don&#39;t stop!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Mom, I don&#39;t understand-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t answer. Instead, she called someone and quietly said, &#34;I agree...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, she dialed 911 without saying a word. Perhaps she believed the sound of the gunshots would tell them everything they needed to know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind raced, trying to piece together what was happening. Slowly, my mother opened the door to the room, peering cautiously into the darkened hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We heard a gunshot in the kitchen. We ran in the opposite direction. Silence was crucial: no footsteps, no tears, no sobs, no questions. We squeezed into a cramped space under the stairs, barely daring to breathe. Heavy footsteps echoed through the villa, each thud making my heart race.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daughter...&#34; The way he said the word gave me chills. It sounded almost reverent but had a scary, manic tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clamped my hand over my mouth to stifle a whimper, my entire body trembling. At that moment, I realized Marcus Blackwood was more than a monster. He chanted my name like a wolf king hunting his prey as if he wanted to kill me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the footsteps retreated upstairs, my mother tugged me towards the garage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is your dad&#39;s fault!&#34; she hissed, but in a lower hush. &#34;Marcus must have found out you&#39;re his child because of the DNA test!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shoved me roughly into the driver&#39;s seat of her sleek sports car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must go! Drive, Sarah!&#34; The command brooked no argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streamed down my face as I gripped the steering wheel. &#34;I can&#39;t leave you, Mom...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of abandoning her was unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He won&#39;t kill me! But you, I&#39;m sure he will! Promise me you&#39;ll just drive! Don&#39;t look back!&#34; she ordered firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I won&#39;t leave you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if Amir or your dad comes back? Drive! Don&#39;t be stubborn!&#34; Her logic pierced through my panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streamed down my face as I reluctantly nodded. With trembling hands, I turned the key. The sports car&#39;s engine roared to life, its sound impossibly loud in the tense silence, revealing our location to Marcus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll be safe with Grandpa Mitchell!&#34; My mother&#39;s voice was urgent. &#34;Promise me you&#39;ll be safe, Sarah!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could respond, we heard a man&#39;s voice melodizing the words as if we were playing hide and seek. &#34;There you are! I wanted to meet my daughter...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mother blocked the view so I couldn&#39;t see him in the rearview mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are not going to kill my Sarah!&#34; she shouted. &#34;Sarah, leave! Now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following my mother&#39;s instruction, instinct took over. I slammed my foot on the accelerator, the tires squealing as I peeled out of the garage. Gunshots chased me, but the car was bulletproof. I didn&#39;t know where the car would take me, but I had to be strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I sped away into the night, my mind was a whirlwind of emotions. Grief, exhaustion, and an overwhelming sense of confusion threatened to overwhelm me. Questions without answers swirled in my head, each more painful than the last</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After two days of driving, I flew to Dubai. My mother had been wrong-Marcus had hurt her. She was killed on my 17th birthday!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, ten years later, he&#39;s not going to kill my family! I was careless! I&#39;ve long feared he&#39;d come after me...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, it&#39;s not just my life at stake. Iris and Rowan, my precious children, are in danger too. That monster&#39;s blood is running through our veins!</p>
