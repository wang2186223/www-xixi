                <p>**Sarah**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?!&#34; I exclaimed, my drowsiness evaporating as the door swung open abruptly, revealing three imposing figures barging into the room. The space felt constricting, leaving me nowhere to escape. Panic surged through me as they closed in and seized me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Help!&#34; I cried out, but my plea was silenced as one of them clamped a hand over my mouth, his breath reeking really bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey there, babe! We&#39;re just here for your belongings,&#34; one of them smirked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Babe, my foot!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My struggles against his iron grip proved futile as his fingers clamped down, imprisoning me further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone tipped us off that the contents of your bag are valuable,&#34; another interjected, snatching my luggage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperation fueled my resistance as I writhed in the grasp of one of the men. No!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes darted around the room, searching for any other valuable items they could seize before the man who had snatched my luggage made his exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;No! My medicine is in there!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s get out of here!&#34; another urged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait! Shouldn&#39;t we have some fun with this little darling first?&#34; the man holding me suggested lewdly, extending his tongue suggestively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tsunami of nausea crashed over me as his foul breath slithered toward me, a putrid fog that threatened my senses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I recoiled in disgust from his odor, yet he had the nerve to call me &#39;darling&#39;! His accomplice, standing beside him, cast me a lecherous glance, his eyes smoldering with suggestive intent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rare to encounter something so enticing,&#34; he remarked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;No! Please, Lord! I won&#39;t do anything bad anymore!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sank my teeth into his hand, only to be assaulted by the overpowering taste of salt that nearly made me retch! Did he ever bother to wash it? In a state of horror and disgust, I fled, my features contorted in a grotesque mask of repulsion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey! Get back here!&#34; the two men barked after me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeking escape, I darted into the fire exit, descending the stairs with reckless haste. I didn&#39;t care where I ended up; I couldn&#39;t bear another moment in the presence of that shameless breath. I was just on the fourth floor, mere steps away from the ground level. At that moment, I didn&#39;t care where my escape route led; I just needed to get away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emerging from the fire exit, I found myself face to face with one of the intruders emerging from the elevator. They had split up, one taking the stairs, the other the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it!&#34; They could take everything, but please spare me from that foul breath!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fled, but before I could escape, a hand closed around my arm, and I screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah!&#34; My scream pierced the stillness of the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Madam Sarah, please, calm down! I&#39;m Josh. Boss Philip sent me to watch over you...&#34; I spun around and met with the sight of a tall, muscular stranger. He exuded a pleasant scent as if he had just stepped out of a shower, erasing the lingering odors of those other men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There she is!&#34; Two figures emerged from the motel exit, their shouts filled with aggression as they pursued me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh, the man who had introduced himself, shifted his gaze to the approaching men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That chick belongs to us!&#34; one of them declared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not your chick! Perhaps you should prioritize brushing your teeth!&#34; I retorted sharply. While I sought a man who can give me the love I&#39;ve always dreamed of, a love that makes me feel truly alive, I won&#39;t settle for someone who doesn&#39;t even bother to brush their teeth!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, I&#39;ll grant you any request. Just rid me of those two imbeciles!&#34; I implored Josh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the two aggressors closed in, Josh swiftly incapacitated them with a series of precise strikes until they lay unconscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My chest heaved with a tumultuous blend of terror and frustration. Despite my best efforts, tears burst forth like a sudden downpour, catching me off guard on this unexpected night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you unharmed, Madam Sarah?&#34; Josh inquired once more. &#34;Allow me to escort you back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh guided me towards Philip&#39;s car, and I did not attempt to resist. He reached inside and pulled out a fleece, handing it to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cover yourself first,&#34; he murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I took the fleece from him, I felt a chill, a sudden awareness that the only garment covering my lower half was a flimsy pair of panties. The realization hit me like a wave, and I could feel the tears against my cheeks, tracing down in silent streams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks!&#34; I mumbled as I wrapped the blanket around me, leaving only my face exposed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh guided me into the car. I no longer protested, too exhausted to care whether he was taking me back to apartment no. 5. I had nothing with me anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What infuriated me further was the unmistakable scent of Philip emanating from the fleece Josh had provided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All I wanted was to sleep. I silently wept in the backseat while Josh cast worried glances in my direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I barely registered the journey, lost in my exhaustion, until the car came to a halt at apartment no. 5. The door opened after a moment&#39;s pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip&#39;s expression soured at the sight of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened to her?&#34; my ex-husband inquired of Josh, his tone betraying irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I noticed a man carrying luggage that appeared to belong to Madam Sarah. It seemed suspicious, but I didn&#39;t know her room number. I went to the information booth for assistance, and that&#39;s when I saw Madam Sarah descending the stairs. Two men followed her,&#34; Josh explained calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I assigned you to watch over Sarah! What happened, and why is she crying now?!&#34; Philip&#39;s voice thundered with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I made a mistake, I&#39;m sorry, boss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know your mistake. You&#39;ll be suspended for a month! And forget about any bonus. Inform Alex to investigate what happened tonight,&#34; Philip&#39;s words dripped with frustration as he clenched his teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh nodded, acknowledging his fault, and refrained from offering any further excuses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip gently lifted me from behind the car, cradling me in his arms as he carried me inside the apartment building. Despite my initial urge to protest, the warmth of his touch and the comforting scent of his cologne washed over me, soothing my troubled soul. At that moment, somehow, my heart instinctively knew what was best for her. Thus, I chose not to argue, trusting in its gentle guidance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip settled me onto the soft sofa, his expression contorting in dismay at the sight of my dirty feet, the only visible sign of distress besides my tear-stained face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you barefoot?!&#34; His scolding tone cut through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stupid! What did you expect? Should I have asked the intruders in my room to wait while I put on shoes before they chased me? Ridiculous!&#34; Tears streamed down my face as I snapped back at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t respond, instead headed to the bathroom. Returning with a wet towel, he sat in front of me, gently wiping my feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, he lifted his gaze to mine. &#34;Did they touch you?&#34; he inquired, perhaps trying to understand the cause of my distress. &#34;If only you had stayed here in the apartment, this wouldn&#39;t have happened. Now you&#39;re crying nonstop!&#34; he added, his irritation palpable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streamed down my cheeks even harder after receiving a scolding. &#34;Who wouldn&#39;t cry? They took my luggage, and all my clothes were in there! I have nothing to wear, nothing to use!&#34; I exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip&#39;s expression soured. &#34;Wait, so you were practically naked when you fled from your room to the exit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Almost naked!&#34; I confirmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He narrowed his eyes. &#34;Stop crying... I&#39;ll lend you my shirt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand felt like a weighty anchor as he wiped my feet, visibly suppressing his seething rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The guy who grabbed me had the foulest breath!&#34; I added, continuing my litany of complaints. &#34;I nearly passed out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did he try to kiss you?&#34; Philip asked, irritation creeping into his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course not! If he had, I&#39;d be dead! He was even salty,&#34; I sobbed with each complaint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you absolutely sure he didn&#39;t touch you or try to kiss you?&#34; he pressed, seeking reassurance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said no! Why are you so insistent?&#34; I wanted to punch Philip, but his incredibly good-looking face made me pause. I couldn&#39;t bring myself to ruin its charm with any negativity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because you&#39;re crying as if they assaulted you!&#34; he retorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Their odor was unbearable. My innocent nose was assaulted, and now I feel absolutely filthy!&#34; I sobbed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll find them. I&#39;ll confront them for you. Is that the only reason you&#39;re crying?&#34; His disbelief was palpable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would appreciate it if you could ask them to take a bath before showing them to me. Besides my personal preference for cleanliness, I&#39;m also here with my relentless ex-husband! If you hadn&#39;t stirred up trouble, I could have enjoyed my evening,&#34; I complained to Philip, tears welling up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was speechless at my remark, squinting hard and pinching the bridge of his eyebrows. Without a word, he lifted me again and carried me to the bathroom. Placing me gently on a chair, he turned on the water in the spacious bathtub.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Furthermore, I want you out of this apartment by tomorrow! I don&#39;t need Megan to get jealous,&#34; I added, noticing his sour expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The jerk ignored me! He instead removed my fleece and helped me into the bathtub, even going so far as to put a shower cap on my head to protect my hair from getting wet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he began to scrub my body, my heart questioned his motives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can handle this myself!&#34; I exclaimed, snatching the soft scrub from his hand. &#34;It&#39;s not like you&#39;ve ever done this before!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw stiffened at my words, and he angrily stormed out of the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed to find out who was behind those men who had broken into my place. The intruder&#39;s revelation hinted at a puppet master pulling sinister strings from the shadows, dictating the violation of my motel&#39;s room!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have to outsmart Philip because I don&#39;t want to be indebted to him. The following day, I was taken aback by what unfolded.</p>
