                <p>**Emily**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lost in thought, I remembered the day Bronn tried to convince me to move to Henderson with Willow. It was months ago...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone buzzed with a message from Bronn:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bronn: &#39;Emily, why are you turning down my offer? This isn&#39;t just about us, and it&#39;s for Willow. We&#39;ll get along so our daughter can have the complete family she deserves. We&#39;ll let the public know slowly, but I really want to keep this quiet for now so Willow doesn&#39;t get hounded by paparazzi and gossip columnists.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tickle in my nose preceded a sudden sneeze. The bright screen of my phone seemed to pierce my already strained eyes, so I set it aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a single thing Bronn said made me happy. I allowed him to visit our child; I think he already won her over-with nothing more than a clubhouse sandwich! Tss!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I can&#39;t agree with Bronn; his contract offer felt like poison to me. He can be a father to Willow without involving me or making me his wife. I didn&#39;t even read the content in the contract because I was so pissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Emily, are you feeling alright?&#34; Sophia&#39;s voice interrupted my chaotic thoughts. She was one of Sarah&#39;s new assistants, a capable woman in her mid-thirties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, our meeting partner re-entered the small conference room. The realtor, a well-dressed woman in her fifties with an efficient demeanor, handed me the signed document. I reviewed it, but a thin layer of tears clouded my vision. Quickly grabbing a tissue, I wiped them away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright, Ms. Carter?&#34; the realtor inquired. We met here in Sweet Valley, just a few hours from Highland Hills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I&#39;m terribly sorry for the distraction,&#34; I managed, forcing a smile. I turned to Sophia, &#34;Please review the documents. We must ensure all required signatures are present and every minute detail has been properly signed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded and went through the documents one by one. It was challenging to go back to save our time here. Even a single missing signature would be a huge problem. There needed to be more than an electronic signature since the document related to properties and real estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I feel like you&#39;re going to get sick,&#34; the lady remarked. &#34;Ms. Mitchell is lucky to have someone like you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for your kind observation,&#34; I replied, striving to stay professional. &#34;Working with Ms. Mitchell is truly an honor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My smile remained fixed. Sarah&#39;s offer to lead Sophia and Mike after promoting me was anything but ordinary. The salary alone was impressive, and on top of that, there was the apartment, car, and the option to work from home while handling her meetings schedule and video conferences.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a package that would make any executive assistant jealous. The compensation was so competitive that it seemed almost unbelievable for someone like me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Mitchell&#39;s new office in Highland Hills has just opened,&#34; I said, my voice slightly hoarse. &#34;Our team is busy setting up and transitioning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sniffled again, feeling my nose tickle and my sinuses grow heavy. My throat felt rough like I&#39;d swallowed sandpaper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Emily,&#34; Sophia interjected, &#34;I&#39;ve thoroughly reviewed all the documents. Everything appears to be in order and properly signed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you so much, Madam!&#34; Our transaction concluded smoothly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the elevator, I rubbed my gritty, sore eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia sounded concerned. &#34;Ms. Emily, maybe you should rest. You don&#39;t look well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, feeling a wave of fatigue wash over me. &#34;You&#39;re right. I&#39;ll call Sarah after this to inform her that I&#39;m not feeling my best. Would you mind driving us back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hesitating slightly, I held out the car keys. Sarah had entrusted the vehicle to me, and I took that responsibility. But given how I was feeling, letting Sophia drive seemed the safer option to avoid any potential accidents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During our journey, I texted Sarah:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Me: &#39;I&#39;ll let Sophia drive. I&#39;m not feeling well and think I&#39;m coming down with the flu.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once we were on the road, Sophia broke the silence with a question that had clearly been on her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Emily, isn&#39;t Ms. Mitchell based in Highland Hills? It seems odd that she hasn&#39;t met me and Mike in person yet.&#34; Sophia asked. Glancing at Sophia, her sharp observational skills came to mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truthfully, I had been wondering the same thing. Sarah has rarely left Serenity Pines since Madam Cornell&#39;s arrest. I thought the incident had affected her more than she showed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our boss is currently undergoing therapy,&#34; I explained carefully, aware of the need for discretion. &#34;There have been... threats to her safety. Do you remember the incident on The Oceanic Odyssey cruise ship? Sarah&#39;s family was directly involved. But please, don&#39;t share this with anyone,&#34; I cautioned her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia shrugged. &#34;I just can&#39;t believe it! She&#39;s what, twenty-three? Sometimes it feels like our boss spends her time shopping and living off her wealth, relying on us for everything just because she&#39;s young.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need to observe your words, Sophia. Sarah&#39;s life choices are hers, and it&#39;s not your place to interfere. Your relationship with her is strictly professional-she pays you to work, and that&#39;s the extent of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I became more cautious of Sophia. At early thirties, she was the oldest among us, and I frequently heard her asking Mike about our ages. It seemed like she was always trying to get ahead, using her seniority to gain an advantage over us younger employees. Her ambition was clear, but her approach bothered me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep this in mind, Sophia. Sarah may be young, but that doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s naïve or incompetent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah wouldn&#39;t be raking in millions just by monitoring the stock market if she didn&#39;t know exactly what she was doing. Her success spoke volumes about her capabilities, regardless of her age. She&#39;s the Benner princess, not an ordinary woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence fell between Sophia and me as our vehicle cruised along the long highway back to Highland Hills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we arrived at the office, Josh was waiting in the lobby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi, Josh!&#34; Sophia greeted him. I noticed Sophia trying to flirt with Sarah&#39;s bodyguard, but he remained as impassive as a wall, unaffected by her attempts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Madam Sarah sent me to collect the documents,&#34; Josh stated flatly, pointedly ignoring Sophia&#39;s advances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is she alright?&#34; I asked. A sudden sneeze escaped me, making me realize how awful I felt. &#34;I haven&#39;t seen her for months.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you&#39;re the one who&#39;s not okay,&#34; he remarked before making suggestions. &#34;Give me the car keys. I&#39;ll drive you to your apartment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you!&#34; I didn&#39;t refuse because my eyes were already stinging, and my head felt heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I come too?&#34; Sophia asked with a flirtatious tone, trying to join our conversation. It was apparent she was trying to seduce Josh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could respond, a newcomer appeared, snatching the keys from my hand with surprising speed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll take her.&#34; It was Bronn; his forehead creased as he noticed my discomfort. He placed his palm on my forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My face contorted into a sour expression. I had no intention of discussing the contract with Bronn again, but I was too exhausted to protest. Besides, I didn&#39;t want to trouble Josh for a ride, and Willow would be delighted to see her dad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got into the car, leaving Sophia and Josh standing on the side of the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the car, the quiet engine and the comfortable leather seat made me feel sleepy. I&#39;m not sure what happened next. One moment, I struggled to stay awake, and the next, I drifted into complete darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next thing I knew of was being guided by strong, steady arms into the apartment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My vision blurred, and my legs weakened, slipping into a relentless cycle of darkness and unconsciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was enveloped in a chill</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed a thick fleece or comforter desperately</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was shivering with cold sweat, my clothes clinging uncomfortably to my skin</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I regained consciousness, two familiar, strong arms embraced me warmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Battling the flu, I spent a few days recovering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bronn stayed in the apartment the whole time, caring for Willow and me. He is remarkably balanced as a nurse and father. I found out later that he had canceled all his plans for the week to prioritize being with us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He even postponed his trip to China to promote LoveLogic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I started feeling better, I wanted to trust Bronn&#39;s care and commitment. But part of me hesitated, remembering our past issues. Eventually, I found the courage to confront the obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I accept your offer for Willow and me to stay in Henderson, but not the marriage proposal, Bronn-I&#39;m not just a business deal,&#34; I muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does that even mean?&#34; Bronn asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It means I&#39;m a woman, not a contractual lover.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my surprise, he acknowledged his mistakes. &#34;Sarah already explained it to me,&#34; he admitted. &#34;But can we at least be a family? I mean, Emily... I want you to be my... I want you to be my... I want us to be exclusive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned, never in my wildest dreams had I expected Bronn to ask me to be his official partner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can work through this for now, and then we can decide if marriage is something we want to pursue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His request was so ordinary, almost like something out of a teenage romance, that it completely caught me off guard. After a moment of shocked silence, I found myself agreeing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I informed Sarah that I accepted Bronn, though she misunderstood, thinking it meant I accepted his marriage proposal.</p>
