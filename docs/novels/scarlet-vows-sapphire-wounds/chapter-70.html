                <p>**Sarah**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandpa, what do you mean she&#39;s my mother&#39;s twin?&#34; Amir asked, clearly surprised by the revelation. The furrowed lines on his brow revealed that he, too, had been utterly unaware our mother had an identical twin sibling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandpa Mitchell let out a weary sigh before delving into the story. &#34;Back when my business and youth consumed me, I dedicated all my time to work, inadvertently creating a divide between my wife and me. After a misunderstanding, we agreed to separate; your mom stayed with me while Marietta went with her mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In those days, I maintained a connection with Marietta and continued to support her. My wife remarried, and I thought everything had settled. Little did I realize the simmering jealousy Marietta harbored toward your mom. Despite my efforts, they never seemed to get along. As time passed, both my daughters pursued their education. Your mom excelled, becoming a licensed accountant and eventually an economist like myself, which filled me with pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;However, your mom&#39;s achievements seemed only to intensify Marietta&#39;s envy. To appease her destructive behavior and prevent further family rifts, I foolishly gave Marietta control over managing my finances, assets, and client networks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression twisted in self-reproach. &#34;She took ruthless advantage of my trust. Marietta slowly manipulated the situation to steal my business, wealth, and everything I had spent my life building right from under my nose. As her father, I can accept many things, but being betrayed by my own child is a wound that cuts deep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glistening tear formed in my grandpa&#39;s eye as his voice grew heavy with pain. &#34;Fast forward again to the most painful part: she&#39;s the reason why your mom was kidnapped back then. I never suspected she&#39;d plan to assume your mom&#39;s identity after I cut ties with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your mom was married, had an intelligent son, and held a high reputation in the finance industry But then Marcus returned your mother...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shuddered involuntarily at the mere mention of that name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The full, ugly truth may never have come to light if not for the events putting young Sarah&#39;s safety at grave risk back then and your dear mother&#39;s tragic passing in that terrible fire. I&#39;d warned her to keep away from both of you. I want nothing to do with her, especially when it comes to you two.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My trembling only intensified, and a wave of nausea swept over me as my vision blurred once more. This panic attack overwhelmed me, and a tidal wave of fear, sadness, and anxiety flooded my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amir&#39;s intense gaze bored straight through me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah!&#34; His voice drew closer, but then the world around me dissolved entirely into black oblivion as I crumpled, slipping into unconsciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I awoke, I was nestled in bed, greeted by watchful eyes. Among them were Amir, Grandpa Mitchell, Amanda, and another household member, along with Dr. Morgan&#39;s unexpected presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My gaze sharpened as it landed on him. In a low, accusing tone, I demanded, &#34;What brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a cautious step back. &#34;It appears Ms. Mitchell woke up feeling unwell,&#34; the doctor replied, attempting to maintain composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amir interjected to try to explain the situation. &#34;Sarah, Dr. Morgan is your physician, isn&#39;t he?  I have a scheduled consultation with him this afternoon to discuss some matters, and he just happened to arrive at the mansion when you fainted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clenched my jaw, directing a fierce stare at the doctor. &#34;Ha! Does Amir know what unspeakable things you did to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This caught the attention of my grandfather. With a concerned brow furrow, he questioned, &#34;What did he do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Mitchell, I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re insinuating!&#34; the doctor hastily replied. &#34;I think Ms. Mitchell may still be experiencing the aftereffects of her panic attack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help but let out a mocking chuckle; a smirk tugged at the corner of my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did he do to you, Sarah?&#34; Amir asked, visibly unsettled by my demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s trying to kill me by giving me medicine for psychosis! I found out those kinds of medications could potentially weaken my heart over time. So, for months, as I became increasingly dependent on the drugs he prescribed, I experienced worsening symptoms-running out of breath easily, constant anxiety, and inability to get restful sleep. I thought I was developing heart failure! But the truth is, he&#39;s been systematically trying to poison me and make me think I was dying!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; My grandfather&#39;s voice boomed with fury, his eyes ablaze with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Benner, please, don&#39;t believe her words. Ms. Mitchell is experiencing hallucinations! You&#39;re aware of her history of mental health struggles. She had a panic attack earlier. She&#39;s simply having another psychotic episode.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of my purposes in coming to Dubai was to confront Dr. Morgan. It seemed he doubted my readiness. I stood up and delivered a resounding slap across his face, marking the first time I did for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grabbed the stack of incriminating documents from the nightstand drawer where I had neatly organized the compilation of evidence last night. They contained Josh&#39;s investigations against him, results from my medical tests, and more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thrust the first document at him. &#34;Here are the results of my heart medical test from last year. The initial diagnosis was that I had a weakened heart condition. But this deceitful monster made me believe I only had a year left to live! And I believed him because I trusted you, brother!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amir&#39;s expression contorted with rage, and he clenched his fists tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is undoubtedly fabricated!&#34; the doctor retorted, disgustingly persisting in his lies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Undeterred, I continued, &#34;Oh! Allow me to clarify the misconception about my cardiac health,&#34; as I produced the following prescriptions, listing the medications he had prescribed to me. &#34;He had me take these medicines directly from him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I presented the results I received from the hospital in Highland Hills, dating back to the day I saw him with Madam Cornell, and hurled those reports at the doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;After requesting the hospital to analyze the medications he prescribed to me over the past year, I uncovered the true contents of those medicines. He gave me medications for psychosis while his report diagnosed me with a weak heart. Everything is detailed in those reports.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I threw every document until my hands were empty. &#34;And to top it off, I discovered you embezzled money from people by doing this! I am not your first victim, you evil monster!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amir&#39;s hands gripped the doctor&#39;s collar tightly, his voice booming with rage. &#34;Why did you do this to Sarah?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Reynolds!&#34; Amir barked, summoning his assistant. Only then did I notice the man standing quietly in the corner of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gather all that evidence from Sarah! Ensure this lunatic is stripped of his license and can never practice medicine again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Benner, please, you mustn&#39;t trust her lies! Ms. Mitchell is nothing but a manipulative, lying bitch! She&#39;s twisting the truth!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, I wanted to punch him, but before I could react, Amir struck first-his closed fist connecting with the doctor&#39;s cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean Sarah&#39;s fooling us? Are you saying my granddaughter is going crazy?&#34; Grandpa Mitchell&#39;s gravelly voice rang out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You, old fool! Mind your own business!&#34; The arrogant doctor sneered and retorted audaciously against my grandfather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This moron!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t believe the idiot&#39;s brazen insult of my grandfather. Clearly, he had no clue about Grandpa Mitchell&#39;s power and influence, assuming he was simply an older adult based on his casual white t-shirt and shorts. No outsiders knew of our true identities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Guards!&#34; Grandpa Mitchell bellowed, his frail body trembling with an intensity of fury. His eyes blazed with undisguised wrath as he instructed Reynolds. &#34;Inform Director Monroe about this individual. I don&#39;t want to see him even as a shadow!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Director Monroe held the esteemed position of overseeing the entire medical facility where the disgraced Dr. Morgan practiced his profession. The renowned hospital relied heavily on the generous financial backing provided by my grandfather&#39;s vast wealth. Dr. Monroe also served as my grandfather&#39;s personal physician.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I exclaimed, &#34;You&#39;re dead!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amir&#39;s rage was palpable; his face flushed crimson. &#34;You tried to kill my sister and then insult our grandfather. You&#39;re the lowest scum!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dr. Morgan&#39;s eyes bulged, suddenly registering who we were. &#34;W-What? You&#39;re part of the Benner family? B-But Mr. Benner, this is all a misunderstanding! I thought Ms. Mitchell was your mistress-Jessica Woods and Madam Cornell from Highland Hills, both confirmed it! I was following their instructions! Please spare me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor&#39;s world quickly turned upside down as he realized his mistake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amir&#39;s punch landed squarely on his face, especially stinging upon learning of his ex-girlfriend&#39;s involvement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor crawled toward me. &#34;M-Ms. Mitchell, I beg you! I&#39;ll do anything you ask; please spare me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at him with utter disgust. &#34;That&#39;s the problem! As a Benner, I cautiously extend chances to people!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, the guards unceremoniously seized the doctor and tossed him out of the mansion. Amir couldn&#39;t meet my gaze, overwhelmed with embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah, it&#39;s time to reveal the real you! I don&#39;t care if you won&#39;t use the Benner name, but I won&#39;t tolerate anyone disrespecting you, even under your Mitchell name! Even though I&#39;m old, I&#39;m the one who still has complete control over your mother&#39;s legacy, which should be you,&#34; Grandpa nearly suffered a heart attack from anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My throat felt tight as I considered his words. &#34;I... I&#39;ll think about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do it, Sarah! People are bullying you, and I can&#39;t bear it anymore!&#34; Amir urged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll give you time to think. I&#39;ll be the one to train you!&#34; Grandpa declared, ending the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As evening fell, I was surprised to see visitors. Yes, visitors!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bronn Martin and my brutish ex-husband, Philip Cornell, awaited at the front gate. And I didn&#39;t know what to do!</p>
