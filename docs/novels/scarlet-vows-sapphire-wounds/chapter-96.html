                <p>Megan&#39;s plan of attack was swift and reckless. She lunged at me, hands outstretched towards my neck in an attempt to strangle me. But Josh saw it coming and swiftly intervened, grabbing her wrists and pulling her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re nothing but a hindrance in my life!&#34; Megan shouted, her face contorted with rage. &#34;What do you really have, huh? No matter what you do, Philip will never love you! Never! He pities you because your innocent baby died!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw clenched at her words. Of all the cruel things Megan could have said, mentioning the death of my unborn baby was the worst. Fury boiled inside me as I stepped closer and slapped her hard across the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan trembled with rage, holding her reddened cheek. &#34;Y-you-! I will kill you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I met her fury with a dark stare until she looked away. Grabbing her chin, I squeezed it. &#34;You still don&#39;t get it. The authorities are looking for Madam Cornell because Dr. Smith implicated my mother-in-law. But they don&#39;t know yet that you were an accomplice involved in what happened to me. What do you think will happen if I reveal to them your role?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I flicked her red cheek with disdain. Megan&#39;s eyes widened in fear as she realized how much trouble she was in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Impossible! Y-you won&#39;t be part of the complaint! W-what about Philip? You&#39;re an evil woman! That&#39;s your mother-in-law, and you&#39;re going to let her go to jail? You&#39;re a demon! You have no gratitude!&#34; she shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again, my palm struck her cheek. I was trembling with fury at this vile woman who had the nerve to blame me for their evil deeds as if I were at fault.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That still doesn&#39;t justify what you did, hurting my innocent baby!&#34; I roared. &#34;Do you still not get it, Megan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We heard tires screeching, and a plain-looking vehicle pulled up outside Serenity Pines Estate. The security guard assigned to monitor the gate announced, &#34;Miss, the investigator is outside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw the anxiety in Megan&#39;s eyes as she looked from the guard to me. &#34;Wh-Why did you call the authorities?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of answering her verbally, I grabbed Megan firmly by the arm and began forcibly dragging her toward the door. She struggled against my grip, nearly losing her balance as I pulled her along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let go of me!&#34; she shouted, her carefully applied facial mask slipping tilted during the struggle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the villa&#39;s wide door, the two investigators who had previously interviewed me after Megan&#39;s house burned down appeared surprised. Without hesitation, I shoved the stubborn woman towards them, causing her to stumble down the short stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan struggled until one of the investigators caught her in his arms. But she quickly pulled herself away as if she might catch a contagious illness from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to know the current status of your investigation into the fire at Ms. Megan Thompson&#39;s villa,&#34; I stated firmly to the two men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Ms. Mitchell, we have apprehended another household helper who was attempting to flee the country. She has confessed to being the instigator; stealing your clothing to use as a disguise and later conspiring with the group that burned down Ms. Thompson&#39;s villa. She admitted to everything,&#34; one of the investigators explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan smirked smugly as if she had found a way to outsmart me again. I wasn&#39;t sure what trick she had pulled off, but I was determined to uncover the truth behind her actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Another helper died in the fire. Did you find it odd that only Ms. Thompson survived?&#34; I challenged them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan scoffed loudly. &#34;Look at her! She&#39;s practically eager to see me burn in that fire, too! I&#39;ve been telling you she&#39;s behind this, all so she could have Philip!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two officers regarded me suspiciously, but I chose not to engage further. In reality, the text messages the woman showed me weren&#39;t sufficient to prove Megan started the fire, even though other evidence firmly pointed to her guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing my ground, I turned to address the private guard. &#34;Well, she has been overstaying at my villa against my wishes! I&#39;ve been trying to remove her for a long time, but she is extremely persistent. Get that woman out of my home immediately. And get all her belongings out as well-Every. Single. Item!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They followed the instruction. It&#39;s fortunate they recognize who&#39;s in charge now that my husband is overseas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan shook with anger, her face red with fury as she looked around at the chaotic scene. The disturbance at the grand villa caught the interest of nearby residents, who watched curiously and whispered about the police being there. Megan&#39;s immense pride wouldn&#39;t let her endure such public embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t do this! You and Philip are separated already! He allowed me to stay here in Serenity Pines. He&#39;s the only one who can evict me!&#34; She shouted angrily with trembling lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arms crossed, I retorted firmly, &#34;Serenity Pines Estate belongs solely to me! Whether Philip agreed to let you stay here or not doesn&#39;t matter. I&#39;m the rightful owner, and I make the decisions. Now, pack your things and leave my villa!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within moments, three burly guards emerged carrying boxed and bagged belongings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Madam Sarah, here are all her belongings,&#34; one of them reported.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tossed them one by one while Megan scrambled to gather them, appearing like a distressed beggar, while bystanders beyond the open gate watched. She was humiliated and powerless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can&#39;t anyone help me?&#34; she pleaded with the authorities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is a private matter, Ms. Thompson. Moreover, Ms. Mitchell accuses you of trespassing. If Ms. Mitchell owns this residence, our hands are tied,&#34; one of them responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s face twisted with disbelief and seething rage as she turned to me. &#34;You shameless bitch! This isn&#39;t over! I&#39;ll make you pay for humiliating me. Philip will realize his mistake and return it to me. Just wait!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In addition to the trespassing, Ms. Thompson has repeatedly made false accusations that I set fire to her villa on numerous occasions. I wish to file a restraining order against her; she is causing me significant distress! Is that possible?&#34; I inquired of the authorities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two officers exchanged looks before the taller one nodded. &#34;That is possible, Ms. Mitchell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! You can&#39;t do this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A guard drove her luxurious vehicle out of the indoor parking until it stopped in front of the wide door where we were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan trembled as she hastily loaded her disheveled belongings into the car. &#34;We&#39;re not finished, Sarah! Philip is definitely mine!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, sure,&#34; I muttered, rolling my eyes at her single-minded obsession with Philip. What an unhinged woman!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan had just sped away in her car after taking the driver&#39;s seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Call the villa cleaner! I don&#39;t want that woman leaving any stains here,&#34; I instructed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sister of the helper who died in the fire at Megan&#39;s villa came up to me. She had seen everything that happened but wasn&#39;t happy with how things turned out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about my sister? Isn&#39;t Ms. Megan going to be held accountable?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m really sorry. You have seen everything that dramatic happened here. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll find evidence to press charges against her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could face trouble if I get involved in the ongoing official investigation. I need to speak with another helper who admitted to being a suspect in the fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I spent two days busy with work until Assistant Alex brought me bad news early in the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had rushed over to Amir&#39;s villa, looking distraught. Jane and I enjoyed the delicious food Amanda had prepared in the dining area when Alex delivered the devastating update.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Madam Sarah, we can&#39;t find the boss&#39;s whereabouts. He He was lost on the Transfagarasan Highway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze, the blood draining from my face as Jane audibly gasped beside me. Philip had recklessly joined an illegal street race to that notorious destination!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew it! I couldn&#39;t hold back my tears. &#34;Bring me to Romania immediately! I have to go find him!&#34; I declared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Sarah!&#34; Amanda objected in a worried voice. Jane pulled me into a comforting embrace as she, too, began to weep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, Madam, but I can&#39;t...&#34; Alex replied firmly. &#34;You can&#39;t leave Highland Hills. I promised the boss that I would ensure you remained safely here no matter what.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;What?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alex immediately gave orders to all the guards who came with him. &#34;Do not let Madam leave these villa grounds under any circumstances! I apologize, Madam, but this is for your own safety&#34;</p>
