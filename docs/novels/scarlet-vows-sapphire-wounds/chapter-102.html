                <p>&#34;You may now come in, Sarah.&#34; Ethan&#39;s voice was somber as he spoke. He stood next to another doctor, both looking serious after examining Philip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I entered the bedroom I had shared with Philip for three years. So much had happened here. This is where I experienced waiting for him as his wife, where I made him feel my overwhelming love. This room held everything, including the night we conceived our first child. Perhaps it was where we created the new life growing inside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My lips formed a straight line when I saw him lying down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan closed the door behind me, giving us privacy for whatever words might be spoken or left unsaid. I stood at the foot of the bed, taking in the sight of my husband surrounded by a tangle of machines and wires.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;See you soon, my love&#39; Those were the words Philip said the last time we saw each other in Las Vegas. The memory brought tears to my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Legs shaking, I sat down beside him, staring intently at his pale lips, the crisp white bandage wrapped around his head, and the steady blink of the monitors measuring his fragile vitals. With exquisite care, I cradled his pale hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve said countless times that I don&#39;t need you anymore&#34; I confessed in a broken whisper. &#34;I tried to avoid you many times, but I always ended up coming back to you&#34; I wiped my tears even though they continued to flow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love calling you &#39;this brute.&#39; I enjoyed our banters. I miss the Philip stealing kisses to drive me wild&#34; I choked between sobs. &#34;The way you give me attention now is so different from when we were married, and it scared me&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath, I continued, &#34;Philip, I&#39;m pregnant I want to question myself, hide this pregnancy, and give you a chance like you told me. If you love me, please. I need you I&#39;ll wait for you, Philip&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kissed his cheek, but my chest tightened. Philip seemed lifeless at that moment. I missed the way he used to look at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swiftly reminded myself of the need to gather strength, find calmness for clearer thinking, and fortify myself against the tumultuous emotions stirring within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t allow your mother to hurt me, so if I ever hurt Madam Cornell, I want your forgiveness, Philip. Will you understand me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I left the room without a trace of tears. Josh stood straight from where he was leaning against the wall when he saw me, his eyes alert and assessing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s your plan?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I regarded him thoughtfully. &#34;I&#39;m going to get Jane.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cautioned me gently, &#34;Sarah, whatever you&#39;re planning, please don&#39;t involve-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing around the thankfully empty hallway cautiously, I interrupted him with a warning, knowing he referred to my pregnancy. &#34;Don&#39;t say anything more about it! I&#39;m keeping this utterly a secret for now. Madam Cornell shouldn&#39;t find out, and I&#39;m unsure who my true allies are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just saying you need to be extremely careful this time. Remember, that&#39;s why you&#39;ve been having panic attacks! That woman has outmaneuvered and blindsided you before; she could easily do so again if you let your guard down,&#34; Josh spoke through clenched teeth, clearly concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew his worry stemmed from genuine care. He seemed like both a bodyguard and a therapist to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry. Everything&#39;s planned, and you&#39;ll be there to watch over me through all this,&#34; I reassured him. His surprise was evident. With Josh, I felt safe; I trusted him not to betray me. &#34;By the way, where&#39;s your ex-girlfriend?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s expression darkened. &#34;Megan&#39;s in some seriously hot water recently with the authorities. She&#39;s been taking substantial sums from friends and associates, including Rebecca Cornell, under the guise of investments. Instead, she&#39;s diverting that money into different companies and ventures, just like she did with me, all to fund her extravagant lifestyle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s jaw tightened visibly as he struggled to maintain his professional demeanor. When he spoke again, his voice carried a hint of disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah, and the stock market crash at Luminary Productions, where she heavily invested expecting results from President Cornell&#39;s Sci-Fi project, didn&#39;t help. Megan&#39;s facing significant losses and can&#39;t repay her lenders. Authorities are searching for her,&#34; Josh explained in detail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh! So, where is she now?&#34; I inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan was last seen at the airport the same night you and Amir left for Dubai. She traveled to Berlin, and after that, her whereabouts became unknown. I keep thinking that Madam Olsen might have found Megan...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged, uncertain whether Madam Olsen truly believed Megan was the elusive Mariano she seemed so eager to uncover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Much like Madam Cornell, I can&#39;t shake the feeling that Megan will return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are your thoughts on her disappearance?&#34; I asked Josh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugged casually. &#34;Sarah, as a psychiatrist, understanding troubled minds is part of my job. But I prefer to prioritize my own mental health rather than speculate about that woman&#39;s whereabouts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But surely you must be angry with her?&#34; I pressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anger is a natural response, isn&#39;t it?&#34; he replied flatly, refusing to show his genuine emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head, realizing our conversation wasn&#39;t going anywhere. I admired how calm he stayed even in chaotic situations. It looked like he found peace at Serenity Pines, overseeing Philip&#39;s team diligently. Maybe he was watching out for me, too, in his own way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Madam Sarah, Mr. Martin is waiting outside,&#34; Assistant Alex interrupted, engaging Dr. Ethan Vanderbilt in conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked towards the broad, arched entrance and was taken aback to see Bronn standing there, deep in thought, as he puffed on a cigarette. His tall, rugged silhouette stood out distinctly in the speckled afternoon sunlight filtering through the trees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bronn?&#34; I exclaimed in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced up, hastily discarding his cigarette in a nearby bin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come inside!&#34; I urged him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bronn walked into the estate&#39;s grand hallway behind me. Ethan looked at him with confusion, probably wondering why someone who might be a suitor had arrived while Philip was still in a coma. I chose to ignore Ethan&#39;s questioning expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are you, and how&#39;s President Cornell?&#34; Bronn greeted me warmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m managing. Philip&#39;s condition hasn&#39;t changed, but he&#39;s safe,&#34; I replied, sidestepping the sadness that accompanied thoughts of Philip. &#34;I didn&#39;t expect to see you here at Highland Hills.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just found out you arrived today. I talked to your grandfather, and he asked me to ensure you&#39;re safe, hence my sudden visit,&#34; Bronn explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I no longer feel saddened by the lost beginning of what could have been between us. A lot has happened, and I truly believe I&#39;m meant for Philip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I really appreciate you coming, Bronn. Anyway, now that you&#39;re here, could you visit Emily for me? She&#39;s at the office, and I haven&#39;t been able to check on her regarding everything going on. I didn&#39;t even give her notice that I&#39;d be arriving today...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bronn swallowed hard, guilt flashing across his chiseled features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t feel guilty, Bronn. Emily has been handling several of my engagements for days, and I feel terrible about it. Please, go see how she&#39;s doing,&#34; I pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was, I still didn&#39;t fully understand the nature of his relationship with Emily. But I sensed Bronn was still trying to convince himself that he and I were meant to be together despite my commitment to Philip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;After our last incident in Las Vegas, things were not good between us. Emily told me to stay away from her,&#34; he said</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, bro! Stop being stupid!&#34; I winced, unable to stop myself from asking why the men interested in me always ended up in such complicated situations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Madam!&#34; Assistant Alex&#39;s voice rang out. &#34;Madam Cornell has sent new instructions. She wants us to take the money to The Oceanic Odyssey.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Oceanic Odyssey?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a cruise ship that docked at Neon Port last night,&#34; Ethan clarified. &#34;As far as I know, it&#39;s scheduled to depart at six this afternoon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re allowing vehicles to be brought aboard, so that&#39;s why Madam Cornell chose it,&#34; Alex confirmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Besides, it will make it easy for her to escape if needed,&#34; I added, glinting my eyes. This could be the perfect opportunity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right on time, my stylish sports car arrived, driven by Jakob and another team member. I was already starting to form a plan.</p>
