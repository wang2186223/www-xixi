                <p>**Philip**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The burial of my mother and my fight with Josh happened on the same day. If I had seen this woman pretending to be Sarah on that day, there&#39;s a good chance she knew exactly where I was going and what I was thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mariano&#39;s new assistant informed me that Josh&#39;s body was missing. The strong ocean currents had taken him, leaving no trace. After a week of searching, Josh was officially declared dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wondered just how much Megan knew about Mariano&#39;s network. Was she just a pawn or a key player in this twisted game?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other hand, Sarah told me that Josh was furious with this woman because of what she did. But I began to doubt: what if the bodyguard lied to Sarah to manipulate my wife&#39;s trust? The thought made me feel sick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Josh lied, it would definitely hurt Sarah&#39;s feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s true motives were a mystery, a puzzle with pieces that didn&#39;t quite fit together. His skill at moving between Megan, Mariano, Madam Olsen, and Sarah effortlessly made me doubt everything. Who is he behind his masks?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan cut through my thoughts. &#34;I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re saying, Philip.&#34; That was the second time she denied it. &#34;A video just surfaced recently. Maybe Josh and Sarah really had a relationship behind your back, and they even managed to have sex at Serenity Pines,&#34; she said, curling her lips into a malicious smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood up gracefully, moving towards me with deliberate and provocative steps. A heavy, unpleasant scent surrounded her-a mix of strong perfume and something sinister that made me recoil in disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a fit of anger, I stood up and closed the gap between us. My hands gripped her neck, fingers pressing on her pulse. The disgust I felt inside me boiled over, fueled by her last hurtful words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you need to be careful with me,&#34; I growled, my voice low and dangerous. &#34;I&#39;m not a saint, and you&#39;ve given me a very easy job by coming here,&#34; I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;W-what do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at Trey before fixing my gaze back on Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What I mean is, I won&#39;t let you tarnish Sarah&#39;s reputation. You can&#39;t, Megan Not now, not ever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trey&#39;s deep voice came from behind me. &#34;Boss, everything was recorded and caught on camera.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The color drained from Megan&#39;s face. &#34;You bastard!&#34; she spat, her composure cracking. &#34;What are you planning to do with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, I saw genuine fear in her eyes-a feeling she couldn&#39;t fake, even with Sarah&#39;s borrowed identity. It reminded me starkly of the contrast between the woman I loved and the impostor standing before me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Beckett has been asking for you,&#34; I said, watching as recognition and terror flooded her features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Beckett is a powerful business tycoon whom Megan allegedly seduced and extorted into securing an eight-digit deal, despite his marital status. He also owned the villa that mysteriously burned down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s been searching for you since your sudden disappearance from Highland Hills, Surely, you&#39;re aware of your misdeeds. He&#39;s furious, and I can only guess what he plans to do to you,&#34; I warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s mask fell away entirely. &#34;No, Philip, please!&#34; she begged, her voice filled with panic. &#34;Don&#39;t give me to him! He&#39;ll kill me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two bodyguards entered, with Alex following closely behind. My heart raced as her screams echoed while they escorted her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Sarah**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A month has passed, and I can feel a noticeable improvement in my overall well-being. Philip made a public declaration that our marriage remains strong, effectively silencing the rumors that had been swirling around us. More importantly, he took steps to clear my name regarding the infamous sex tape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip hired a team of experts, including forensic specialists and body language analysts, to release a comprehensive statement. This document highlighted distinct differences in body shape, movements, and even subtle mannerisms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the issue surrounding me now settled after a month, if there&#39;s anything on my mind, it&#39;s Josh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dr. Ruth, who is also thirty years old, examined me and my body. To ensure my safety outside Serenity Pines, she arrived at the villa early.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can leave the villa, Ms. Mitchell, but don&#39;t exert yourself. You still need to take care of your body,&#34; the doctor reminded me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words brought a wide smile to my face. After what seemed like an endless time at Serenity Pines, the thought of returning to a normal routine filled me with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Call me immediately if there are any issues,&#34; the doctor said before leaving the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the doctor left, Philip approached me. His hand gently brushed my cheek. &#34;Are you certain about visiting the office?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I am. It&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve stepped outside of Serenity Pines. I promise it&#39;ll just be a short visit to meet with Emily&#39;s team, then I&#39;ll come straight back. I know you&#39;re worried, Philip, but it&#39;s been over a month of recovery. Besides, I won&#39;t be doing anything too demanding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel guilty because those around me have worked hard. Philip managed most of the accounts I handled in the stock market, and Emily coordinated with him to ensure everything ran smoothly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kissing the twins on the forehead, I then turned back to Philip. &#34;It&#39;s your special time with your babies!&#34; I giggled, giving his shoulder a gentle pat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I&#39;m going to love every second of it,&#34; Philip replied, his arms encircling my waist. His voice dropped to a husky whisper, &#34;Though I probably should have asked Dr. Ruth when I could &#39;score&#39; with my wife again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll make it up to you, don&#39;t worry!&#34; Blush crept up my cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jakob and Trey accompanied me to the office. On the way, our talk turned into something I&#39;d been thinking about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been meaning to ask,&#34; Jakob said, breaking a moment of silence, &#34;why haven&#39;t we seen much of Jane lately?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My expression turned serious as I contemplated Jane&#39;s recent absence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To be honest, I&#39;m not sure either. I&#39;m worried about her too,&#34; I admitted, a frown creasing my brow. &#34;Strangely enough, it seems we were closer when she lived in London than we are now. Philip said he talked to her and Jane&#39;s okay. She&#39;s only visited Serenity Pines once after I gave birth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perhaps she&#39;s just busy... or, um,&#34; he trailed off, scratching his head uncertainly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raised an eyebrow, intrigued by his hesitation. Jakob and Jane weren&#39;t very close, but his reaction hinted he might have information I didn&#39;t know. &#34;Do you know something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, he admitted, &#34;The truth is, she&#39;s become a VIP player in LoveLogic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, really?&#34; This was news to me. I had assumed Jane was occupied with office work, not immersed in the virtual world of LoveLogic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s been... pursuing Bronn as her boyfriend in the game.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, I didn&#39;t see anything particularly concerning about this. Jane designed Bronn&#39;s character.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Jakob&#39;s next words caught me off guard. &#34;Sarah, I think she&#39;s in love with my brother. Actually, she confessed to Bronn when they met recently.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh! That&#39;s unexpected!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our conversation was interrupted as the car stopped in front of the building where the office was located. Through the tinted windows, I could see Emily waiting for me on the sidewalk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exiting the vehicle, Jakob, Trey, and another bodyguard followed me. Emily and I exchanged greetings until I noticed Josh not far away, his long strides bringing him closer to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Josh!&#34; I exclaimed in surprise to see him there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trey and the other bodyguard&#39;s eyes narrowed when they saw him. They swiftly moved to intercept Josh before he could get too close to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah! I&#39;ve missed you so much!&#34; Josh&#39;s voice was thick with emotion. &#34;You&#39;ve been gone from our house for a month. You only said you were going to Luminary Productions, and then you vanished!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jakob and I exchanged glances. His words made no sense to me-what house was he talking about?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh gritted his teeth in frustration as my bodyguards maintained their firm grip on him, keeping him at a distance of about two meters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me go!&#34; he shouted, struggling against their hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced around nervously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trey,&#34; I whispered urgently, &#34;we&#39;re in public.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On my very first day out of Serenity Pines, fate seemed to be playing tricks on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What on earth was happening?</p>
