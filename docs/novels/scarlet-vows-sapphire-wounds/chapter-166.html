                <p>**Sarah**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My father, Mr. Benner, contacted me again. After years of estrangement, I decided it was time to meet him and finally confront our tumultuous past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Accompanied by Trey, I arrived at the hotel suite where he was staying. His assistant, a woman in her thirties, greeted us at the door with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good afternoon, Ms. Mitchell!&#34; she said warmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello,&#34; I managed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, come in,&#34; she said, stepping aside to let me enter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked across the plush carpet until I saw Mr. Benner. My father, once a towering figure of authority, now sat in a wheelchair. His once jet-black hair had faded to steel gray, and deep lines etched his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been a long time since he had disowned me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so happy to see you, Sarah,&#34; he said, his voice filled with emotion. &#34;You&#39;ve lost so much weight, my dear&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;My dear&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I approached him, extending a carefully wrapped package. &#34;I brought you something,&#34; I said, &#34;Three first editions by Haruki Murakami. Your favorite.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled appreciatively. &#34;Thank you! Uh, would you like something to eat?&#34; He didn&#39;t wait for my reply. &#34;Carla, please order something for Sarah!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, boss!&#34; the assistant replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sank into the supple leather of an oversized sofa. Once we were alone, I steeled myself to ask the question that had been weighing on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad,&#34; I began, the word feeling foreign on my tongue, &#34;did you know that Mom is Mariano?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a deep breath and nodded. &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why were you so hesitant the last time we spoke? When we spoke during the hotel attack, why didn&#39;t you tell me outright that Mom was there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was terrified,&#34; he admitted, his voice trembling. &#34;I don&#39;t know how to explain. I disowned you for years and saw that you were stronger than I expected It&#39;s my fault he found you,&#34; he confessed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence fell between us before he continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I met Marcus before our vacation. I didn&#39;t know who he was at the time. He approached me at the hotel and saw your picture on my phone screen while I was talking to a business partner. Marcus was the one who made me doubt and subtly suggested I should take a paternity test. I had no idea he had abducted your mom in the past&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My lips pressed into a thin line as I processed the weight of his words. Dad&#39;s voice trembled as he continued, his eyes glistening with unshed tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had no idea that Marcus&#39;s obsession with you stemmed from your resemblance to his mother, Sarah. I was completely blinded by my anger when I received the DNA results from the assistant. I felt so betrayed and deceived&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dad recalled our time at Palm Beach. &#34;When I returned to our rented villa, chaos greeted me. Everything was in shambles, broken and scattered. I was terrified I couldn&#39;t find you or your mother. Then the original Mariano told me your mom would never return I didn&#39;t imagine how far-reaching the consequences of my actions would be&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They explained that you needed to stay in Dubai and that I had to cut off all connections with you. Marcus... he had already eliminated Margarette&#39;s first daughter, believing it was you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped at the revelation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To make amends with Margarette, I married her. Your mother&#39;s death was staged, and only the three of us knew the truth-your mom, me, and Grandpa Mitchell. We endured, we sacrificed, all to keep you safe. This continued until Marcus was finally apprehended and imprisoned in Alcatraz.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streamed down my face, mirroring the ones now falling freely from Dad&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s all my fault, Sarah At Amir&#39;s wedding, I was terrified. Your grandfather urged me to end the madness, but I knew it wasn&#39;t over-Marcus was still alive then. Months turned into years, and you built your own family, Sarah. But I will forever regret what I put you through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moved closer and hugged him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did well, Sarah. You did great, and I&#39;m proud of you!&#34; Dad murmured, his hand gently stroking my hair. That&#39;s what I needed to hear from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hadn&#39;t realized how deeply my life was tangled in this web of deceit and danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted to thank your grandfather for accepting you with open arms when I couldn&#39;t. Unfortunately, he passed away after his illness. He was deeply hurt when you were in a coma,&#34; Dad added quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My tears flowed more freely. My mother had already told me about that while I was still recovering in Berlin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remembered my conversation with Grandpa Mitchell when he learned I was pregnant with Philip. He had said he just wanted me to be happy, no matter my decision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our family traveled to beautiful Maui, Hawaii, where my husband Philip had planned a surprise. The excitement of what was coming made our tropical vacation even more special.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the gentle Hawaiian breeze flowed through our rental, my twins came to me with excited eyes, holding a box with great anticipation. Inside was a white, flowy summer dress they had chosen for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mommy, please wear this Please?&#34; Iris begged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mommy, that&#39;s a gift from Iris and me. We picked this day to give you the dress!&#34; Rowan added excitedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was puzzled. &#34;Does this mean you knew we were going to the beach?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They exchanged glances. &#34;No,&#34; they answered in unison, a little too quickly to be convincing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-it just so happened&#34; Iris mumbled, unable to meet my gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not very good at lying, Iris!&#34; Rowan said, betraying his sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyed at being blamed, Iris retorted with a huff, &#34;It&#39;s your fault! You let me say that Daddy told us in advance!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help but laugh at their adorable squabble. &#34;It&#39;s not your fault, baby. If anyone&#39;s to blame, it&#39;s your crafty Daddy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I watched them bicker, I saw so much of Philip and me in our children, even in the most minor things. They tease each other endlessly, but they always have each other&#39;s backs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On my second day at Villa Serafina, the teacher called me because Rowan had punched a bully, bothering Iris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing these thoughts aside, I slipped into the beautiful dress my children had thoughtfully chosen. I realized Philip must have missed seeing me in such a feminine, romantic outfit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the dress on, the kids led me to a pavillion surrounded by a myriad of flowers. At the front, a thick white curtain was set up for some presentation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are we lost, kids?&#34; I asked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They didn&#39;t answer. I was curious to know how far Philip had gone with the arrangements. Given how beautifully it was decorated, I initially thought someone else had rented the pavilion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, a presentation started playing at the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip&#39;s face appeared on the screen. &#34;I have a story to tell&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my surprise, an old photo of me from college appeared on the screen, showing a candid moment with Jane, his sister. I felt a mix of nostalgia and confusion-I had no idea Philip had been taking pictures of me back then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He confessed he had a crush on me from the start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And yeah, I stole kisses from her while she was sleeping,&#34; he continued. My cheeks flushed with embarrassment. I never thought Philip would do something like that, even though I&#39;m older now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following images are from when Philip and I married, with his voice playing in the background.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah has a heart overflowing with warmth and kindness for everyone around her. Her intelligence shines as brightly as her smile, but her boundless love as a mother and wife takes my breath away. Honestly, I feel unworthy to call myself her husband&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes welled with tears of joy as he continued,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Two years ago, I made a vow to myself that I would propose to the mother of my children in the way she deserved-a proper proposal. It was Sarah who took the initiative, proposing to me not just once but twice in the past.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed through my tears at his words, unable to respond because of their truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;That&#39;s why&#39; those words marked the end of the video.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I turned around, my breath caught in my throat. There stood Philip, devastatingly handsome in a crisp white button-up shirt and shorts, the golden Hawaiian sun casting a halo around him. His eyes, filled with love and promise, met mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My love, my heart, my everything-would you do me the honor of marrying me once again?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our children, Rowan and Iris, erupted into joyous cheers and applause, their happiness mirroring our own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip gently took my hand, pressing a tender kiss to my knuckles before drawing me close and capturing my lips in a kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In this third wedding, I will be the bride-radiant, cherished, and entirely in love. I&#39;m thrilled to marry Philip for the third time, surrounded by our precious children, my parents, Amir, and my friends as witnesses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, I felt a deep happiness radiating from every part of me. I was content, deeply loved, and immensely grateful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s not just I who&#39;s been given a second chance at love-it&#39;s Philip and me, together with all the blessings bestowed upon us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though I was once devastated and heartbroken after losing a baby in our first marriage, now I have Iris and Rowan; two beautiful children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have Philip</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have a stronger, more resilient version of myself</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we stood there, wrapped in each other&#39;s arms with the paradise of Hawaii surrounding us, I knew this was more than just a proposal. It was a celebration of our journey, a testament to the power of enduring love, and a promise of the beautiful future we would continue to build together.</p>
