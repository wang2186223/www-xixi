                <p>When I entered the hospital ward, Jane was leaning against the upright bed, quietly sobbing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jane!&#34; I called out, my voice tinged with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;S-Sarah&#34; She looked up and saw me, a glimmer of relief in her eyes. I approached the side of her bed so she could hug me properly. She clung to me tightly, crying softly like a child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you do that, Jane? Why did you try to cut your wrist?&#34; I couldn&#39;t help but ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She answered in a frail voice with only the two of us in the room. &#34;It&#39;s a ploy, Sarah I made sure I wouldn&#39;t die.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Confusion furrowed my brow as I studied the bandage on her hand, noticing the cut was far from her wrist. &#34;What the hell, Jane! What you did was incredibly dangerous!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She continued weeping as she told her story. &#34;I know! But what can I do? I can no longer take it! I have to ensure I won&#39;t marry Mr. Olsen!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does anyone know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking her head, she replied, &#34;If you&#39;re wondering if Brother Philip knows, I only told you Oh Sarah, if you could have seen how terrified I was when Dad arrived earlier! He wanted to beat me, but Brother Philip shielded me from his rage...&#34; Her tears streaked down her pale cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was good that Philip could protect her, even as my heart clenched just at the mere thought of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But why are you still crying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane went on, &#34;I never imagined that the Olsens and my family had already made a contract behind my back. The Olsens are major financial backers of Philip&#39;s SciFi project, and they threatened to withdraw a huge amount of money if I didn&#39;t marry into the Olsen family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widened in horror as she continued her explanation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I pleaded with Brother Philip last night not to give me to the Olsens. Earlier, after he realized how far I was willing to go to escape the marriage, he agreed to shoulder the damages Madam Olsen demanded It&#39;s millions of dollars, Sarah, and my brother agreed to bankrupt himself to ensure that my marriage to them wouldn&#39;t go through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Philip did what he had to do!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But that&#39;s not the end of it, Sarah... My dad decided to remove me from the project entirely! He&#39;s also cutting off my allowance and revoking all my cards. That&#39;s my punishment for what I did. I-it&#39;s fine. That&#39;s why I&#39;m jobless right now and penniless...&#34; she sobbed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt at a loss, unsure what to say. Chairman Cornell&#39;s punishment was reasonable, given Jane&#39;s rash actions. Suddenly, Remembering a potential lifeline, I realized I needed LoveLogic&#39;s assistance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right! You&#39;ve got a job, Jane. You&#39;re familiar with my ties to BM Technologies. Jakob, a friend and collaborator-he&#39;s looking for people to help us design a non-player character. Basically, an AI that can serve as a technically &#39;imaginary boyfriend&#39; for the user.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I proceeded to explain the concept of LoveLogic to her, the virtual romance companion that could provide emotional support and intimacy tailored to the individual. As I spoke, I could see Jane&#39;s tentative spark of interest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Little did I know, this would soon become a pressing issue in our friendship</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had a couple of business meetings scheduled at Aspire Financial Group, a prominent financial services company headquartered in Highland Hills. Therefore, I had to remain in town while Amir returned to his job, and he kindly arranged for an assistant for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Jane and I waited for Bronn at the hotel restaurant, I sent Jakob a message: I have a task for you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jakob&#39;s response came swiftly, laden with sarcasm: Oh, God! I thought I was done being your slave. What is it this time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This brute!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckled at his dramatics before typing: Come on! Please investigate Emily Carter for me. She&#39;s the assistant working at Aspire Financial Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to ensure that the assistant Amir gave me wasn&#39;t as difficult as some of the women around me. I&#39;m not looking for another Madam Cornell, Megan, or Jessica Woods... Please, not again!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jakob immediately replied: Are you sure about the name?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I confirmed: That&#39;s the name Amir gave me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no immediate follow-up from Jakob, I decided to let the matter be for the moment. Just in time, Bronn arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah!&#34; Bronn greeted as he approached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, hi! Thank you!&#34; I stood and gave him a friendly peck on the cheek, accepting the bouquet he offered. &#34;By the way, this is Jane Cornell. She&#39;s now part of Jakob&#39;s team. They haven&#39;t crossed paths since Jakob was still busy in Henderson, though they&#39;ve had brief interactions in the past since we all came from Crestwood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane&#39;s cheeks visibly reddened a bit as she made eye contact with the tall, handsome Bronn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jane will be the one designing your non-player character for the LoveLogic, which is why I arranged this meeting today,&#34; I explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see&#34; Bronn seemed distracted, prompting my inquiry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is everything alright?&#34; I asked, concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing! I&#39;m sorry, some other matters weighing on my mind,&#34; he reassured me, though his distraction was palpable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From how he seemed, I figured he was probably dealing with some tough business stuff. But I didn&#39;t ask more since giving business advice wasn&#39;t my thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While they chatted about design ideas, Jane snapped pictures of Bronn with her camera. I politely left to use the restroom while they were busy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I washed my hands, the restroom door suddenly swung open, revealing Philip standing there, his eyes holding an intensity I couldn&#39;t ignore. Before I could react, he swiftly locked the door behind him and closed the distance between us. In one fluid motion, he pulled me into a forceful embrace, holding me tightly against him as his lips crashed onto mine in a passionate, longing kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was stunned, unable to move, though part of me wanted to push him away. There was an aching desire mixed with undeniable pain etched across his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please...&#34; Philip uttered in a hurtful tone after breaking the kiss. &#34;I can&#39;t, Sarah...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;What does that even mean?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could process his words, he had already turned and hastily exited the ladies&#39; room, vanishing from sight as quickly as he had appeared like the bogeyman in a dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mouth hung open in shock. In those fleeting seconds, I was utterly bewildered, unable to comprehend what had just occurred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Bronn**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like all the other powerful men in this ruthless fucking business world, I did whatever was necessary to further my interests and ambitions, carrying the empire initially built by my grandfather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My encounter with Sarah dates back to when she was just sixteen. At that time, I saw her as too young for any romantic involvement. It was then that I met Emily Carter, who became my secret mistress for two years. Our relationship was completely hidden from others-Emily was like an intangible dream, unreal and ever-elusive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment I was on the brink of marrying Sarah four years ago, Emily vanished into the shadows, evaporating like a wisp of smoke in the night. However, Sarah herself tied the knot with Philip Cornell simultaneously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had no clue of Emily&#39;s whereabouts after her disappearance, and I convinced myself that letting her go was ultimately for the best.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During my recent encounter with Sarah, she proposed an embrace of honesty between us. We agreed to give our relationship a chance, a decision I deemed the most sensible. Yet, just before meeting Sarah at a hotel in Highland Hills, a message from Jakob interrupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Jakob:*** *Brother, I found Emily! But now things are tricky. Emily Carter works at Aspire Financial Group, and she&#39;s assigned as Sarah&#39;s personal assistant.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The news sent shivers down my spine. After four years without so much as a whisper about this woman, Emily resurfaced under Sarah&#39;s wing. Another message arrived from Jakob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Jakob:*** *Sarah tasked me with investigating Emily&#39;s background. What am I supposed to tell her?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt utterly lost and confused. What should I tell Sarah first? Should I confess my family connection to Jakob, which explains how I know her whereabouts? Or should I come clean about the deeply personal secret of my past passionate affair with her future assistant, Emily?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily was a relationship I had desperately tried to convince myself was firmly in the past, or so I had thought</p>
