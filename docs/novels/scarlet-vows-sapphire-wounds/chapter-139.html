                <p>It&#39;s been months since I convinced Emily to come with me to Henderson. However, her commitments to Sarah&#39;s group often keep her in Highland Hills, which frustrates and intrigues me. Balancing our new life together and her ongoing responsibilities has been a delicate dance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were both surprised to learn that Sarah frequently stays at Serenity Pines because she is pregnant, something she cannot disclose publicly. Tonight, as I prepared to attend a high-profile gathering while Emily stepped in as Sarah&#39;s representative, we were getting ready to leave the mansion together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daddy, can&#39;t I come with you and Mommy?&#34; Willow asked as I put on my necktie. Emily was being attended to by three stylists in another room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come here,&#34; I said softly, beckoning her closer. As she rushed toward me, eyes wide with excitement, I realized how much my life had transformed. In an instant, I went from being alone to experiencing pure happiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scooped Willow up, relishing the weight of her in my arms, and planted a kiss on her petal-soft cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mommy said the party is only for big people,&#34; she said, her lower lip jutting out in an adorable pout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know it&#39;s disappointing,&#34; I said, &#34;But we&#39;ll bring you along when you&#39;re a bit older, okay? To make it up to you, how about we have a special tea party tomorrow? Just you, me, and Mommy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yay! I want to play with Iris and Rowan once they get bigger, too!&#34; Those were Sarah and Philip&#39;s twins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three of us visited Sarah after she gave birth. For now, she is still recovering, and I think it will take two or three months before Sarah can personally handle her tasks again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; I chuckled. &#34;And maybe, if you&#39;re good, we can visit Auntie Sarah&#39;s babies, Iris and Rowan, next week. Would you like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, yes, yes!&#34; Willow squealed, bouncing in my arms. I kissed her cheeks again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was at this moment that I caught sight of Emily standing in the doorway, and my breath caught in my throat. Her hair was styled in a detailed bun. She wore a long gown in rich purple that shimmered as she walked. The color suited her fair skin, and the dress elegantly highlighted her figure. Her makeup was subtle yet flawless, enhancing her natural beauty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was utterly mesmerized, unable to look away as she glided towards us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It looks like you finally managed to convince her to stay here with just her nanny,&#34; Emily said, kissing Willow on the cheek. Her simple perfume filled the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re... stunning,&#34; I breathed, the words escaping before I could stop them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A blush crept across Emily&#39;s cheeks, and she returned the conversation to our departure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to leave so we can return quickly,&#34; she suggested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three of us walked together to Willow&#39;s room to personally tuck our child into bed. After tonight&#39;s gathering, I have plans for us. I&#39;d already spoken with my parents about my intentions, explaining Emily&#39;s situation. They understood, but their acceptance was tinged with reservation. Emily&#39;s background as an orphan from a modest family didn&#39;t align with their vision of a suitable wife for their son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I first announced my intention to marry Emily, I recalled my father&#39;s words: &#34;You don&#39;t have to marry her, Bronn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a weighty declaration. I clarified that they shouldn&#39;t meddle in my personal life with Emily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If you ask my dad, he still harbored hopes of me marrying into a prestigious family. As the head of BM Technologies, I&#39;d made my own name in the business world, becoming a sought-after bachelor. But Sarah&#39;s words rang in my ears: I was my own man, and no one-not even my parents-should control my life choices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This journey with Emily completely changed how I see things. My structured world of contracts and traditions was turned upside down, but I&#39;ve learned to find a middle ground with Emily, merging our different perspectives into a shared vision for our future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goodnight, baby!&#34; Emily&#39;s soft voice pulled me from my reverie, returning me to the present moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock at the door interrupted the peaceful scene. &#34;Boss, your ride has arrived,&#34; came a voice from the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to Emily, who was gently kissing Willow&#39;s forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ready?&#34; I asked, admiring how she managed to look both maternal and breathtakingly elegant in her evening gown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we left Willow&#39;s room, I wrapped an arm around Emily&#39;s waist as we made our way to the helipad where the helicopter had landed, avoiding the annoyance of traffic. Tonight&#39;s gathering on the Las Vegas Strip is convenient for us, just a few miles from Henderson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sometimes, I still feel overwhelmed by the life you&#39;ve given me,&#34; Emily confessed as we stepped out of the grand mansion&#39;s ornate entrance. The helicopter hovered gracefully over the meticulously maintained Bermuda grass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grinned and guided her towards it, helping her board. We landed at the hotel helipad within minutes, where the gathering awaited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we walked through the luxurious hallway, Emily brought up a topic about Sarah. &#34;Did you know she&#39;s pregnant?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had no idea, but I have a feeling Jakob might have known,&#34; I replied. Another thought about Sarah crossed my mind. &#34;By the way, how&#39;s your professional relationship with Philip developing? I hope he hasn&#39;t caused you any trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I have absolutely no issues with Philip,&#34; she assured me. &#34;In fact, I&#39;m often pleasantly surprised because we are frequently on the same wavelength when it comes to handling Sarah&#39;s accounts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s because you&#39;re brilliant, Emily,&#34; I remarked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled, a blush coloring her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know,&#34; I continued, expressing my admiration, &#34;I&#39;m grateful you joined Sarah&#39;s team. You&#39;ve made a remarkable name for yourself in less than a year. It&#39;s impressive. When people ask about Emily Carter, they already know you&#39;re one of the industry&#39;s highest-paid and most respected executive assistants. Your reputation speaks for itself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The assistant who commutes by helicopter daily,&#34; she giggled softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help but ponder how different things might be if Emily were on my team instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There would undoubtedly be gossip and speculation about whether her beauty was being used to get my attention. People love to gossip, and while I usually ignore it, I&#39;m more concerned now. I&#39;m not just a businessman anymore; I&#39;m a father and a man deeply in love with a woman I want to protect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Sarah&#39;s team, there are no such accusations, but I often worry about Emily&#39;s health and well-being. Her high-profile job can be very stressful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure it&#39;s okay for us to be seen together by reporters?&#34; she asked, a hint of worry in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely! I&#39;m exclusively dating the most stunning executive assistant. Who would disapprove?&#34; I teased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her arm hooked onto mine more securely as we stepped onto the plush red carpet. A sea of cameras immediately began to click and flash around us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Martin!&#34; a reporter called out, thrusting a microphone in our direction. &#34;Can you share with us who your stunning date is this evening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi, I&#39;m Emily Carter!&#34; Emily replied, flashing a dazzling smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow! You two look adorable together. Are you a fan of Mr. Martin&#39;s?&#34; the reporter pressed mischievously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily&#39;s smile faltered slightly. It was clear that I had garnered more female admirers following the launch of Bronn, my non-player character in LoveLogic. This led to widespread guessing that any woman seen with me might be a hopeful admirer trying to get my attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually, it&#39;s quite the opposite. I&#39;m the one who&#39;s Emily&#39;s devoted fan! I&#39;ve been the one pursuing her relentlessly,&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reporters were thrilled. It was my first time bringing a date to such a high-profile event, and they were eager to ask many questions about this unexpected development. I happily answered their inquiries, staying close to Emily to protect her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once we managed to slip away from the group of reporters, Emily looked visibly drained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Geez!&#34; she exclaimed under her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the gathering, Emily confidently mingled with officials while I engaged in conversation with a few people until Jane Cornell tapped me on the shoulder. Her presence surprised me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi!&#34; she greeted</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, hi!&#34; I responded, leaning in to place a customary kiss on her cheek. &#34;Are you here as your family&#39;s representative for the event?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah... I just arrived. Um, can I talk to you privately for a moment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking it might involve Sarah and the twins, a private matter not for public discussion, I agreed to Jane&#39;s idea. We walked to an open area next to the main hall, where we found ourselves by a sparkling pool under the clear blue fluorescent. A refreshing breeze offered relief from the stuffy indoor air, and I saw a few familiar faces chatting quietly nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bronn, um, I&#39;m in love with you,&#34; Jane declared, shocking me to the core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How should I respond to that? &#39;Thank you?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My dad said he&#39;ll help me talk to your family so we can have a relationship. I&#39;m telling you this so you won&#39;t be surprised if they approach you,&#34; she explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on, hold on, Jane. Um, I&#39;m sorry, Jane... but I can&#39;t. I want you to know I&#39;m getting married soon. You know I&#39;m committed to someone else, right? I love her, and she&#39;s the one I want to marry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain etched across her face, and then tears began to spill down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was perplexed because Jane and I had only interacted briefly in person; our relationship was more of a professional acquaintance than a close friend, let alone a romantic interest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was she acting like this?</p>
