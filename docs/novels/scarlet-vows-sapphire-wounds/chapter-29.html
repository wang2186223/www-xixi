                <p>**Philip**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I missed Sarah&#39;s presence in our villa-that&#39;s what I was certain of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While I was conversing with Ethan over the phone in the library, Sarah was taking a bath in our room. All her clothes were still neatly arranged, ensuring she wouldn&#39;t encounter any inconvenience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan began his explanation, &#34;I conducted a small investigation into Dr. Morgan. I needed to apply some pressure to get him to talk... Last year, Mr. Amir Benner took Sarah to Dr. Morgan&#39;s clinic in Dubai for a check-up. Months later, Dr. Morgan received two offers-one from Mr. Benner&#39;s girlfriend, Jessica Woods, and the other from Serena Blake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dr. Morgan opted to accept Serena Blake&#39;s offer to manipulate Sarah&#39;s medication... Your ex-wife was grappling with panic attacks and severe depression. Yet, Dr. Morgan erroneously diagnosed her with a heart condition. It appears Sarah may have become reliant on the medication. It would be advisable for you to bring her to my clinic tomorrow. I&#39;ll arrange for her to meet with a specialist there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gripped the phone tightly, struggling to comprehend how Sarah ended up in this situation. &#34;Why is she battling depression? Could our marriage somehow be contributing to it? I recall we had a disagreement, and then she requested a divorce...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night weighed heavily on me. It felt as though Sarah had reached a breaking point in our relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that when you found her at Serenity Pines with another man? Is that when Sarah fell ill?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pressed my fingers firmly against my temples, feeling the weight of our tumultuous three-year relationship bearing down on me like a suffocating blanket. I honed my skills at work, relentlessly pursuing the coveted position of president, desperate to prove my worth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could her depression stem from wanting to end things with me?&#34; I pondered aloud. &#34;Jane mentioned Sarah declining a university offer in London, giving it to my sister, only to forego enrollment herself. Sarah was a brilliant student; she might have harbored significant regrets about her decision.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I lack medical expertise, I present the various possibilities to Ethan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;True, it&#39;s plausible that her relationship with you, starting so young and then facing the pressures of Serenity Pines, may have contributed,&#34; Ethan offered. &#34;But upon further investigation, that wasn&#39;t the primary cause.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My muscles tensed. &#34;If not that, then what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah was pregnant,&#34; Ethan disclosed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?!&#34; Shock pulsed through me, eyes widening in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dr. Morgan confirmed it, and I uncovered medical records indicating Sarah underwent an abortion last year here in Highland Hills. And then, Amir Benner paid her a visit in the hospital ward.&#34; Ethan&#39;s next words sent a shockwave through me. &#34;Philip, I believe Amir may have impregnated Sarah... Dr. Morgan echoed the same suspicion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slammed the telephone handset down, my frustration boiling over as I scanned the villa for Sarah. Words cannot convey the storm raging within me. I am consumed by a fury so intense that it blinds me. Darkness encroaches on my vision, a suffocating pressure grips my chest, and rational thought flees in the face of my seething rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah!&#34; My voice reverberated through Serenity Pines, but she was outside, locked in a heated exchange with Alex, insisting on leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me go! I&#39;m not staying here! Take me to the hotel!&#34; Sarah&#39;s words fueled my rage, and I gripped her arms tightly, my teeth clenched, seeing through her façade of lies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where do you think you&#39;re going?&#34; My tone was sharp, and my eyes narrowed with icy resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She faltered at my demeanor. &#34;Philip, I-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She attempted to explain herself, but I cut her off, dragging her back into the house and up the staircase. It was reminiscent of the time I caught her with another man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! Philip! You&#39;re hurting me!&#34; Her voice trembled with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I turned a blind eye to her pleas, heedless of whatever explanations she might offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, it felt like I had cast aside every shred of my sanity, hurling it out the window into the abyss of my fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip! What are you doing? It hurts!&#34; she shouted, tears pooling in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shoved her into the closet room, her feet slipping on the shiny wooden floor, fear etched on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could you?&#34; I trembled with anger, and she recoiled, bewildered by my words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave everything to Sarah! Now I understand why she wanted a divorce. Amir got her pregnant, and to save face, she terminated the baby!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll stay here until you understand what you&#39;ve done!&#34; With a heavy heart, I closed the door and secured it with a lock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, no, please! Philip!&#34; Her desperate pleas echoed through the villa. &#34;It&#39;s dark in here, Philip! Please, let me out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I descended to the kitchen, drowning out her cries with alcohol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aaah!&#34; I screamed, hurling the glass against the wall after downing the amber liquid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I considered wiping clean the slate of her cheating, brushing aside the betrayal that marred our third anniversary. Yet, the bitter truth remains: Sarah&#39;s deceit has inflicted wounds upon our marriage that cannot be easily healed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I callously commanded Alex to ensure Sarah remained confined within Serenity Pines Estate before callously driving off. Even though I noticed my assistant seemed worried, I selfishly went to the usual bar where Ethan and I usually go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An hour slipped away in Ethan&#39;s company before Alex&#39;s frantic call, saying something happened to Sarah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Sarah**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the days following my reunion with Philip, I sensed a shift in our dynamic. Our conversations stretched longer than they had in our marriage, and an undercurrent of sexual tension simmered beneath the surface. However, I quickly understood that any apparent difference in him was just something I imagined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The darkness enveloped the closet room, its shadows casting uncertainty over my surroundings. With the light switch situated outside in the bedroom, I found myself adrift, unable to find solace or assurance in the darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anguish seized my heart as tears streamed down my cheeks unchecked. It was as if Philip had transported me back to a time when he was still my husband, a time when I felt unable to voice my desires, haunted by the fear of his potential reactions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, I witnessed the anger etched on his face simply because I expressed my desire to depart from Serenity Pines. In the dimly lit room, voices echoed, sending shivers down my spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip wished your baby to die!&#34; My mother-in-law&#39;s voice pierced the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahhhh!&#34; Escaped my lips, a primal cry of anguish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah... You&#39;re utterly pitiful,&#34; Megan&#39;s voice followed, punctuated by mocking laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amidst all the noise, I heard a baby crying. &#34;Mommy...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahhhh!&#34; My cry joined the chorus as tears streamed uncontrollably down my cheeks, unable to contain the depths of my sorrow. I curled into myself, clutching my knees as the weight of despair pressed down upon me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My chest felt like it was being crushed, struggling against invisible hands tightening around my lungs. Panic clawed at me as I gasped for air, but it was like trying to grasp smoke. This wasn&#39;t like before, when I could reign in the chaos within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was a tidal wave of helplessness crashing over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;H-help,&#34; the word escaped my lips in a strangled plea, barely audible even to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like I was sinking deep into the ocean, the pressure building up with every moment. I reached out for air, longing for relief from the overwhelming darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I need air! I need-&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the door swung open, a flood of blinding light poured into the room, searing my eyes with intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Madam Sarah!&#34; Their voices reached me, but their faces blurred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As darkness surrounded me, I saw Alex and Josh one last time, but their faces were fading away...</p>
