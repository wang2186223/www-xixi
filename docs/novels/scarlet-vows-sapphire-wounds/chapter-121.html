                <p>**Bronn**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily and I were tense as the car made its way to her apartment. My chest churned with anticipation and resentment. Sarah&#39;s words from earlier echoed in my mind, reminding me that I had no right to question Emily&#39;s decisions. Given our complicated past, doing so would be selfish and hypocritical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the car stopped in front of an apartment, I gave Robert an order. &#34;Please leave me and Emily alone,&#34; I said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Certainly, Mr. Martin,&#34; Robert replied with a nod, his professional demeanor unwavering as he smoothly exited the vehicle, leaving Emily and me alone in the suddenly claustrophobic backseat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily&#39;s voice, tinged with nervousness, broke the silence. &#34;What are your plans, Mr. Martin?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I inhaled deeply, the scent of her familiar perfume-a delicate mix of jasmine and vanilla-momentarily distracting me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just want to understand why you got pregnant,&#34; I began. &#34;When we met at the hospital, why did you let me believe you and Ethan were together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily&#39;s fist clenched on her lap. &#34;I don&#39;t know either, Mr. Martin. When I went to Pennsylvania, I discovered I was pregnant. I realized I hadn&#39;t been as diligent with the birth control as our contract stipulated. I believed you were going to marry Sarah then, and I thought our situation with my child would complicate your life. I was convinced that keeping it to myself was the right thing to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily was clearly putting up a wall between us, and her tears caught me off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bronn, my child is innocent of my past mistakes, so please let me keep Willow. Don&#39;t take her away from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily&#39;s pain and sorrow hit me hard. I wanted to hug her and assure her I had no plans to take Willow away, but I was also struggling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Jakob told me what he knew this morning, my parents informed me they were still committed to the Benners. They had replaced Sarah with Lila.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, driven by desperation, guilt, and a spark of something I couldn&#39;t quite name, I made a decision that surprised me even.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m offering marriage to you, Emily,&#34; I blurted out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips parted in surprise. &#34;Marriage?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe I was desperate, trying to regain control of a situation slipping away from me quickly. Sarah was right; I had been denying the truth because it was harder to face than lying about it. I couldn&#39;t stand the idea of marrying Lila either; she was using Sarah&#39;s name, and it irked me, but Emily didn&#39;t need to know that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Think about it carefully. I&#39;ll send you the contract for review. Take your time to consider all aspects.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily&#39;s face soured at the mention of the &#39;contract,&#39; but she didn&#39;t respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily took a deep breath, steeling herself before speaking. &#34;About Willow... please, let me explain our situation to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright...&#34; I followed Emily, exited the car, and observed their apartment. It was a decent home located in a safe community area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s one of the perks Sarah provided as part of my role as her assistant,&#34; Emily explained, noticing my glance around. &#34;I receive many benefits from being her assistant, so I stay in the job. She&#39;s a good boss who values my contributions to her team.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was keenly aware of Emily&#39;s remarkable work ethic. No other woman had ever captured my heart like she had, yet I continued to lie about it. My eyes were drawn to her lips, full and inviting in the soft light. The urge to kiss her was almost overwhelming, but I controlled my desire and resolved to stay calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mommy!&#34; The door swung open, and Willow emerged. Emily smiled and embraced our daughter. My heart raced; although Willow had inherited Emily&#39;s beautiful face, she had my blue eyes and blonde hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The little girl turned her gaze to me, her expression souring. She folded her small arms and scowled. &#34;Mister, why are you here? Are you bullying my mommy again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I almost chuckled at her cuteness. To emphasize her displeasure, she had stopped referring to me as &#34;uncle&#34; and now addressed me only as &#34;mister,&#34; as if she had severed any connection between us. Our previous encounters had not been pleasant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came here to apologize to you...&#34; I said softly, trying to convey my sincerity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmph! I don&#39;t need your apologies! I hate people who bully my mommy! Like Ms. Erica! I only like Auntie Evelyn and Uncle Ethan!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help but scratch my head, feeling amused and overwhelmed. It was becoming clear that gaining Willow&#39;s approval might be more complicated than patching things up with Emily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow dashed back into the house, leaving me uncertain of my next move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think it&#39;s best to earn Willow&#39;s trust first. If we reveal I&#39;m her father right away, it could be overwhelming and potentially traumatic,&#34; I explained to Emily, who nodded in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My situation with Emily grew more complicated. We entered the house and surveyed the surroundings where my daughter lived. Yet, the knowledge that Willow had been living here, under a roof that wasn&#39;t mine, stirred a deep discomfort within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the living room, Willow seemed determined to ignore my presence. She was engrossed in play with her teddy bear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily cleared her throat softly. &#34;I apologize for my daughter&#39;s behavior,&#34; she said. &#34;The hospital incident has left her with a different impression.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s alright. Let&#39;s give her some space for now. Emily, please consider my proposal. Let me give Willow the family she deserves,&#34; I implored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily nodded, though her expression betrayed her reservations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My proposal was straightforward: a discreet marriage to Emily, ensuring our personal lives remained private, which was crucial given my position, followed by us starting a family together in Henderson. However, Emily&#39;s life and career were firmly established here in Highland Hills, adding complexity to the situation. I needed to discuss this with Sarah and obtain her approval for Emily to relocate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I sent Emily the contract outlining my proposal, I hadn&#39;t anticipated her disapproval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, Mr. Martin. I&#39;m declining the offer. I&#39;m sorry, but I can&#39;t accept these terms&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Emily**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you turn down Bronn&#39;s marriage proposal, Emily?&#34; Sarah&#39;s voice came through clearly on our video conference. As usual, she was at Serenity Pines, her familiar personal office visible in the background.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have to be honest with you; Bronn reached out to me. He shared his plans about moving you and Willow to Henderson. It would be difficult for me if you moved into Bronn&#39;s mansion because it would undoubtedly increase my workload. On the other hand, you would be my support at BM Technologies and for various business engagements in Las Vegas and Henderson. So, after careful consideration, I gave my approval.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah, I don&#39;t want to be just a contractual love affair for Bronn Martin. It hurts me deeply. I&#39;d rather forget he ever existed in my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still can&#39;t believe Bronn would impose those terms in his contract. Yes, I wanted to give Willow a real family, especially now that her father was in the picture. But Bronn&#39;s approach felt like a slap in the face, reducing our potential relationship to another business transaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He sent you a contract?&#34; Sarah was shocked, understanding my concerns. &#34;I assumed he was proposing a standard prenuptial agreement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if I can&#39;t comply with what&#39;s in the contract? I can&#39;t bear the thought of Willow getting hurt the way I was before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The heartbreak Bronn left in my heart was undeniably painful. The last thing I wanted was for our daughter to experience that kind of heartbreak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After talking with Sarah, I took off my coat and went downstairs to spend some time with my daughter, only to be surprised to find Bronn sitting beside Willow on the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mommy! Daddy brought me food!&#34; Willow exclaimed happily, enjoying her clubhouse sandwich. My gaze shifted to the sandwich I used to adore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;They&#39;re already close? And how had Bronn already earned the title of &#39;dad&#39;?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your dad?&#34; I echoed, raising an eyebrow at Bronn. &#34;Mr. Martin, I never knew you were so good at charming people with food.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bronn&#39;s lips curved into a broad smile. &#34;And you haven&#39;t changed a bit. Still capable of seducing me effortlessly.&#34; His eyes traveled down my body, then back up to meet my gaze. &#34;Quite a view, by the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took me a moment to realize he was referring to my attire-a thin white top and no bra, as I hadn&#39;t planned on leaving the house. My nipples were clearly visible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Damn it!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cursing under my breath, I hurried back upstairs to change.</p>
