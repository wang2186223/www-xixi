                <p>**Sarah**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reading Jakob&#39;s message, I carefully calculated my next steps. Approaching Josh directly about the information we had gathered wasn&#39;t an option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I replied: One thing I&#39;m certain about him-he loved Megan, which is why he&#39;s seeking answers. And when people love someone, they can do reckless things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jakob: Agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still needed to figure out if I could trust Josh. Jakob and I need to watch his actions closely. Megan will do whatever it takes, and given their past relationship, it will be easier for her to gain Josh&#39;s trust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Me: We must launch LoveLogic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jakob: That&#39;s why we&#39;re putting in the effort, doll. Now, we need backing from BM&#39;s major sponsors. I need to secure some software and security tools. By the way, are you attending the Langston event because of Madam Cornell&#39;s connection with them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bronn probably informed him about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Me: Yes. Also, I want to meet the Langstons to try to get their support. According to Bronn, Langston is one of the major sponsors that will approve LoveLogic if we&#39;re ready for the market and if it&#39;s projected to be profitable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The relationship between the Langston couple and the Cornells is significant. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if my former in-laws made an appearance. From what I&#39;ve heard, the Langstons played a key role in Philip deciding to marry me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slipped my phone back into my pocket and followed Alex. As we entered one office space, I noticed Jane was already there, diligently gathering details.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone, this is Ms. Mitchell. She&#39;s a representative from BM Technology and will be working with the editorial team,&#34; Alex explained. &#34;I&#39;ll leave you now, Mad- Ms. Mitchell,&#34; he said, quickly correcting himself from nearly calling me &#34;Madam.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip and I agreed that I would be known only as Ms. Mitchell. It wouldn&#39;t reflect well on his image if his ex-wife were working as a secretary for an outsourcing company. I also wanted to avoid drawing attention to our past relationship, so we reached a mutual understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks, Alex!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just let me know if there&#39;s any issue,&#34; Alex said before leaving the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While I was setting up my laptop, three people approached me. &#34;Hello, Ms. Mitchell. Can we call you Sarah?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure!&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are part of the editorial team at Luminary Productions...&#34; They then shared how their team operates before asking about my background.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We were told you and Ms. Jane Cornell were college classmates,&#34; one of them said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah, yes. That&#39;s how we know each other,&#34; I glanced at Jane, who was busy working while conversing with her team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If so, did you use that connection to become the representative for BM Technologies?&#34; another asked suspiciously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another chimed in, &#34;Yeah, I&#39;m wondering why BM would send just a secretary to represent them. Sending just anyone is like an insult to Luminary Production.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their comments caught me off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm...my cousin works at BM Technology, and he&#39;s heard rumors about you being close to Mr. Martin. Do you have some elicit relationship with BM&#39;s chairman that got you this role?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t appreciate their insinuating tone one bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that how you can afford those fancy designer bags?&#34; the third person commented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fell into silence, uncertain of their intentions. Then I chuckled, &#34;Wow, is that how you all operate? I bought this bag with my savings.&#34; I eyed the expensive diamond necklace on one woman. &#34;How lovely, a lab-grown diamond! Did you have to sell yourself to afford such an exquisite necklace worth fifty grand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-!&#34; The woman&#39;s teeth clenched. &#34;I paid for this myself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, then, what&#39;s the difference in how I paid for my bag?&#34; I asked, my eyes narrowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because you&#39;re just a secretary! An orphan!&#34; she spat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raised an eyebrow, but her colleague intervened before it could escalate further. &#34;S-Sarah, let&#39;s not exchange harsh words. We&#39;re just trying to get to know you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re the ones being disrespectful,&#34; I countered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We just don&#39;t want you meddling in the editing. That&#39;s all!&#34; her colleague insisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My gaze narrowed, realization dawning that this was all about ego. Sensing the tension, Jane stepped closer. &#34;Is everything alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing, Ms. Cornell. Just discussing work and getting acquainted with Ms. Mitchell. Though it seems she dislikes us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane smiled politely. &#34;Well, our meeting is coming up, so be prepared in case Boss Philip asks you anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fools then returned to their workstations, the woman with the necklace rudely brushing past me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry about their attitude,&#34; Jane apologized once they were gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged. It was clear to me that their kindness towards her stemmed solely from the recognition of Jane as the chairman&#39;s daughter, regardless of her lineage. After all, she remained a beneficiary of her father&#39;s fortune, a fact that couldn&#39;t be overlooked despite its origin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane leaned in, &#34;Anyway, how are things with you and Brother Philip?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; I asked, typing my long password on my laptop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you two get back together? I can tell you still like each other. If not, why did you have an intimate time yesterday at the spa, or salon, and Philip slept over at the villa?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes in exasperation, and Jane caught the same nuance that Jakob did. &#34;Love, reconciling with Philip in that manner is simply not feasible for me. Things have gotten more laid-back between us, and I&#39;m mainly here to focus on my job. Besides, you&#39;re aware that what transpired in the past was far from simple.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fierce desire to retaliate against Madam Cornell burns within me like an unrelenting fire. The situation will only get worse if Philip is in the picture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why do you two still refer to each other as &#39;my wife&#39; or &#39;my husband&#39;?&#34; Jane inquired once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We do?&#34; came my puzzled response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded. &#34;Sometimes you forget Philip is your ex-husband. I often hear you say, &#39;My husband&#39;. The same goes for my brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hmm... I was surprised to find out they picked up on that. It&#39;s Jakob&#39;s habit of frequently referring to Philip as &#39;your husband&#39; that&#39;s to blame. That&#39;s right! It was all his doing!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And let&#39;s face it, deep down, you yearn for reconciliation,&#34; Jane interjected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But if I&#39;m to pursue genuine happiness, I must choose a different path,&#34; I replied softly, almost in a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone like Mr. Amir Benner, perhaps? What exactly is the nature of your relationship with him?&#34; Jane inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane doesn&#39;t really know my true self. She can&#39;t find out either because it&#39;s dangerous, especially if Marcus finds me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to clarify that there is no romantic involvement between Mr. Amir Benner and myself. Please disregard any claims made by Philip regarding our relationship.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane nodded in understanding, then inquired further, &#34;And what about your relationship with your boss at BM?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I replied calmly, &#34;Bronn? He&#39;s actually a childhood friend of mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I&#39;m really sorry for lying, Jane.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is he courting you?&#34; she asked in a confused tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s the undeniable truth, and so I nodded in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If so, then Brother Philip has a tough rival,&#34; she murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forget about that brute,&#34; I casually commented, rolling my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When my six-month contract at Highland Hills concluded, I planned to return to Henderson. However, there was a possibility I would remain in Dubai if the LoveLogic project launched by then, ensuring Madam Cornell lost her position as the chairman&#39;s wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My deepest desire was to become a mother and housewife, enjoying a healthy, non-toxic relationship with my husband and in-laws. Bronn was the sole individual capable of providing me with that life because I have a good relationship with him and with his family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anyway, let&#39;s just continue working.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before the meeting commenced, I received a call from the front desk informing me of a visitor waiting in the lobby. To my surprise, it turned out to be Philip&#39;s former pregnant secretary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Hmm... this is fun.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I really thought she was out of the picture.</p>
