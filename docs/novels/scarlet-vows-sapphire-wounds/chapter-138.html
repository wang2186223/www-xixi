                <p>**Sarah**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could everyone please leave Philip and me alone?&#34; I asked, addressing everyone in the Summit Room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jakob hesitated, then gave an understanding nod before leaving. They all exited one by one until Trey was the last to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Philip and I were alone, a heavy silence filled the room. I wiped away my tears, trying to compose myself. My husband&#39;s eyes narrowed as he looked at me, taking in my reactions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it that I don&#39;t know, Philip? &#34;What am I missing that&#39;s left me so blindsided by all this?&#34; I pleaded, desperate for answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed bitterly, surprising me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re asking me that, Sarah?&#34; He shook his head. &#34;Now you know how it feels to be kept in the dark, to have secrets kept from you!&#34; His voice rose slightly, his hurt and frustration showing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned into silence, I opened my mouth a few times, but no words came out. His words hurt, and finding any explanations was a struggle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip&#39;s face twisted with deep pain. &#34;Sarah, I need you to be honest with me, just this once,&#34; he said, &#34;Did you love Josh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question felt like a punch. &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He continued, unable to hold back his emotions any longer. &#34;I&#39;ve tried so hard to hide my jealousy for so long. I&#39;ve kept it inside, even though it tore me apart because I thought I shouldn&#39;t complain!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words rushed out, years of feelings pouring out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You care for Josh, Sarah. That much is obvious to anyone with eyes. I don&#39;t understand the nature of the bond you two share, but I&#39;m not blind. Just admit it-you loved him! You wouldn&#39;t be so devastated if he meant nothing to you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;What? No!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cried even harder. My body trembled at his accusation. It was challenging to explain to Philip what I felt because he would never understand. But I couldn&#39;t deny the truth in Philip&#39;s words-I had hidden things from him, letting this situation worsen until it reached this breaking point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip whispered painfully, each word filled with the anguish of someone who had silently endured for too long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you honestly believe it was acceptable for me to witness you forming a bond with my bodyguard? Did you think it was okay for me to see Josh kiss you or how torn you seemed without his presence? Did you think I wouldn&#39;t notice how much you cared for him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip&#34; I murmured his name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He continued, his voice trembling, &#34;I admit it, Sarah. I wanted Josh out of our lives. Your feelings for him aren&#39;t simple, and I&#39;m... I&#39;m consumed by jealousy over the relationship you two share I know it&#39;s my fault. You wouldn&#39;t feel this way if I had given you the time and attention you needed back then. I don&#39;t have the right to these feelings, but I can&#39;t help it. You love him, Sarah... and it hurts so much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears filled my eyes, and I covered my mouth as Philip&#39;s words hit me hard. His perception shook me deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, I found my voice. &#34;Do you want the truth? Maybe I was drawn to Josh, or maybe it was because he showed me unconditional love, Philip.&#34; I took a deep breath, steeling myself to continue. &#34;He stayed with your team for months, ensuring I wouldn&#39;t suffer from panic episodes again. He loved me, Philip-even if it was simple. It was a kind of love you didn&#39;t give me back then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Witnessing the pain my words caused, I saw it reflected in Philip&#39;s eyes. His fist clenched tightly with tension. He turned and departed from the Summit room without uttering a word, leaving me with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Jakob entered and gently rubbed my back as I sobbed uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me what happened,&#34; Jakob urged softly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Between gasping breaths, I managed to say, &#34;I told him everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pain of my confession still burned on my cheeks. Slowly and hesitantly, I explained everything to Jakob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After listening patiently, he asked the inevitable question. &#34;But how do you really feel about Josh, Sarah? Have you thought about why your husband continues to feel jealous of him? I thought your relationship with Josh was purely professional.&#34; He paused, weighing his words. &#34;Even if I were in Philip&#39;s shoes, I wouldn&#39;t appreciate what I saw today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But, Jakob. Philip is the one I love. It&#39;s natural for me to worry about Josh because he has no family. I admit we shared deep conversations, and there was mutual trust. Our relationship wasn&#39;t just professional. It was... special,&#34; I explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jakob&#39;s hand moved in soothing circles on my back as he spoke, his voice gentle but firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s why your husband is hurting. Because you didn&#39;t confess to him. You keep insisting that your relationship with Josh is purely professional, but your treatment of him runs much deeper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sniffled, my voice thick with emotion. &#34;I finally admitted it to Philip, but it hurt him more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve observed your relationship with Philip. I believe you haven&#39;t loved or accepted anyone besides him, but from what you told him earlier, he might have gotten a different impression. Like you, Philip is haunted by fears that you might leave him because of past events, and he sees Josh as a formidable rival.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With gentle fingers, Jakob wiped the tears that had spilled onto my cheeks. His touch was comforting. &#34;Your feelings are valid, but try to understand that Philip has reason to be hurt as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaving the room, I searched the office for Philip but couldn&#39;t find him. This was our first argument since our whirlwind wedding in Las Vegas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon returning to Serenity Pines Estate, I spotted Philip with the twins. He was carrying both of them, their tiny bodies cradled in his strong arms. His face wore a smile, but his eyes held a sadness that tugged at my heart. It seemed as though he was channeling all his pain into this tender moment with our children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amanda greeted me, noticing my swollen eyes. &#34;Are you okay, dear?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t hold back anymore. Falling into Amanda&#39;s motherly embrace, I let the tears flow freely. &#34;Philip is angry with me...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amanda stroked my hair soothingly. &#34;No wonder he didn&#39;t come home happy either. But don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll patch things up. These things happen in marriages.&#34; She paused, looking over my shoulder. &#34;Oh, there he is, heading inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed Amanda&#39;s gaze to see Philip walking towards the villa&#39;s main building; Iris was nestled in his arms, her little head resting on his shoulder, while Pepper trailed behind, carefully holding Rowan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amanda took Iris from Philip. &#34;You two talk things out, and we&#39;ll take care of your little ones for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip seemed at a loss for words, tension evident in his stance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we talk?&#34; I asked tentatively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression softened, and he gently pulled me into his arms. I breathed in his familiar scent as he kissed my forehead tenderly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, my love,&#34; he whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding me close, Philip led me into the bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat me down on the edge of the bed, then knelt before me. His strong arms encircled my waist, his forehead resting against my stomach. I could feel his warm breath through my shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m really sorry&#34; he murmured, sensing my presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran my fingers through his hair, trying to soothe him. &#34;Let&#39;s talk about Josh and then put this behind us. Is that okay?&#34; I suggested softly. &#34;I want to clarify that what I feel for him isn&#39;t romantic. It&#39;s... special, but not in that way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip&#39;s gaze met mine. I continued, choosing my words carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;During my recovery, Josh was often there. He helped cleanse my damaged soul, in a way. I feel sad about him because I didn&#39;t see Josh simply as a bodyguard, Philip I saw him as an older brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded. &#34;I understand, and I apologize for what I said earlier. I&#39;m just frustrated seeing him again. I was apprehensive about you because it was the first day you went out and immediately faced a problem. I was terrified something might happen to you. I&#39;m so sorry, my love.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We shifted positions. Philip sat on the single couch and pulled me onto his lap, cradling me against his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you so much, Sarah,&#34; he whispered into my hair. &#34;I&#39;m terrified at the thought of you leaving me because of my past mistakes. When I saw our children earlier, it reminded me of my promise-to never make you cry and to love you deeply, always.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s support each other and have no more secrets, okay?&#34; I suggested, searching his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kissed me on the forehead. Silence lingered between us before I remembered his sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the way, how&#39;s Jane? She hasn&#39;t been answering my calls.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She seems okay. She asked about you the other day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Little did I know then, but Jane was far from okay. I could never have imagined that one day, my dear friend would betray me in ways I couldn&#39;t yet fathom</p>
