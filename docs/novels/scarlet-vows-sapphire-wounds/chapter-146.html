                <p>**Jane**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeking my brother Philip&#39;s advice, I came to Highland Hills, desperate for his support during this difficult time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For four years, I managed the modeling agency, a sub-company of Luminary Productions in London and Paris. Alongside my career, I continued therapy to address my past traumas. The weekly sessions, though often painful, have gradually cleared my mind. To atone for what I did to Sarah, I devoted myself to my work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My marriage to Brody Martin has been nothing more than a well-orchestrated charade-a typically arranged marriage designed to benefit our families rather than our hearts. He owns a chemical empire and is a cousin of the brothers Bronn and Jakob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip spoke after hearing my story. &#34;You mean to say, after you returned from Paris, you found your husband in the apartment at The Strata with his secretary? And at that moment, you decided to end your four-year marriage? Now you&#39;re here, asking me to break the news to Dad that your marriage with Brody didn&#39;t work out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pressed my lips together, fighting back tears. &#34;That&#39;s right. Brother, I don&#39;t think Brody loves me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Brody was first introduced to me, he was naturally cold towards me. His striking resemblance to Bronn, a man I once yearned for, initially clouded my judgment. Our relationship was fine, in the sense that we both played our roles in the family and marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brody has been taking care of me as his wife for the last four years. I feel the respect we have for each other. But all that ended when the woman he was supposed to marry entered the picture. She&#39;s been a secretary in Brody&#39;s office for four months.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paused, gathering strength. &#34;You know I&#39;ve had a bad history in the past. The best option for me is to accept that my marriage isn&#39;t working and then move on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t want a life wasted; tired of waiting for love, tired of loving without reciprocation. Brother Philip looked at me intently. I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s surprised by my behavior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After finishing my therapy and focusing on work, I had a realization. I&#39;d spent four years fooling myself into thinking that Brody and I were building a life together. I clung to the fantasy that our arranged marriage would become a fairytale romance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jane, I feel like you&#39;ve been through a similar situation with Sarah before,&#34; Brother Philip remarked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mention of his wife, whom I hadn&#39;t seen since my wedding abroad, I pressed my lips together and bowed my head, feeling a rush of shame and the weight of my past mistakes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip continued, his tone gentle but probing, &#34;Is it possible you&#39;re misinterpreting the situation with Brody&#39;s secretary because you know she&#39;s his ex?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was I jumping to conclusions?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All I knew was that the secretary had sent me multiple messages and frequently told me to stay away from my husband, reminding me that our connection was only contractual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I... I&#39;m not sure, Philip,&#34; I admitted. &#34;But I can&#39;t shake this unease about his secretary. Our arguments have become more frequent and more intense. This trip back from Paris is my last resort. Why else would she be in our apartment if there wasn&#39;t something between them? If I hadn&#39;t arrived that night... God, I don&#39;t even want to imagine what might have happened. A cheating husband is the last thing I need in my life!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My chest tightened, and tears nearly spilled. I took a deep breath, trying to control my emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of that night with Brody was still painful. I hadn&#39;t even unpacked my suitcase; I took it straight to Highland Hills after telling Brody we needed to separate. His hurt and betrayal haunted me, but what ate at me was the doubt in my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the door flew open, breaking my troubled thoughts. I looked over, and my gaze met Sarah&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daddy!&#34; The little girl ran over first, followed closely by the boy with a flushed face. Brother Philip hugged both of them lightly and simultaneously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I miss you, Daddy!&#34; said the girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah entered Philip&#39;s office with a neutral expression but fixed her gaze on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The boy, eyes wide with curiosity, asked, &#34;Who is she, Daddy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah was the one who answered, &#34;She&#39;s your Auntie Jane.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, oh, I know!&#34; the girl chirped excitedly to her twin. &#34;She&#39;s Daddy&#39;s sister!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, Auntie Jane!&#34; they both exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to cry seeing their happy family. I admit I&#39;m still envious of them. But maybe that&#39;s normal, right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re absolutely adorable, Brother Philip,&#34; I managed with a forced smile. &#34;Anyway, I... I should go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The unspoken tension between Sarah and me made every breath feel difficult. I didn&#39;t want to interrupt their family time, and I wasn&#39;t sure I could stay composed around Sarah after she ended our relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaving Philip&#39;s office, I spotted Alex, who had been working for my brother for years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Jane,&#34; he began, his voice hesitant, &#34;your husband is waiting for you in the lobby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My expression instantly soured. &#34;How did he find me here?&#34; I hissed, panic rising in my chest. &#34;Get rid of him, Alex. Tell him I&#39;m not here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was exhausted, and the idea of facing Brody, going over our arguments and the pain of betrayal, was too much to handle. I sank into Alex&#39;s chair outside Philip&#39;s office and closed my eyes, trying to escape the harsh reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, the phone&#39;s sharp ring startled me. My heart raced, worried it might be Brody. Alex answered it on speakerphone, and it turned out to be a staff member.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss Alex, Madam Sarah&#39;s ride is here upstairs. Could you let her know, please?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes snapped open, and my curiosity piqued. I was unable to mask my surprise. &#34;Is Sarah taking a helicopter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Alex confirmed. &#34;She has a meeting in Henderson this afternoon. Given her limited time with her job, Boss Philip, and the twins, the helicopter is the most efficient option.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A lightbulb went off in my head: air transport was the perfect way to avoid running into Brody. My mind raced with possibilities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Sarah emerged from Philip&#39;s office, I stood up abruptly, our eyes locking in a moment of mutual surprise. She clearly hadn&#39;t expected to find me still lingering in the outer office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Summoning my courage, I asked, &#34;Sarah, c-can I come with you?&#34;</p>
