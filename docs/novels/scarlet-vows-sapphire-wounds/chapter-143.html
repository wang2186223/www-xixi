                <p>Faint voices could be heard upon regaining consciousness. A sharp pain throbbed at my temples, and I felt weak all over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As my senses returned, I struggled to recall my last clear memories. Jane&#39;s face came into focus-she had handed me a drink. I was sure she had something to do with what happened to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blinking away the lingering haze, I looked around. The luxurious décor and familiar layout reminded me that this was Ethan Vanderbilt&#39;s house. Philip had brought me here months ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That lunatic! I couldn&#39;t believe that scumbag!&#34; I heard Dr. Ruth exclaim outside the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ruth, please, you need to calm down. This level of stress isn&#39;t good for you or the baby,&#34; came the voice of Dr. Ethan Vanderbilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Baby? Is Dr. Ruth pregnant?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Summoning my remaining strength, I pushed myself up and staggered towards the door. As I opened it, both doctors spun around, their wide eyes and slightly open mouths revealing their surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi! Uh, h-how did I get here?&#34; I asked them. And why is Dr. Ruth here? But I kept the last question to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah! It&#39;s good to see you awake. Just a moment; I need to call your husband and let him know,&#34; said Ethan. He walked away before I could respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hang on. Did something happen to me?&#34; Fear gripped me as I looked at Dr. Ruth. Is that why I was left here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dr. Ruth&#39;s expression softened, a reassuring smile spreading across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, no, nothing like that,&#34; she soothed. &#34;Your husband just went to take care of the incident at the Eclipse Club Lounge. He entrusted you to us because he also needed to attend to Iris and Rowan,&#34; explained Dr. Ruth with a broad smile. &#34;Anyway, come on, you must be famished. The drvg you were given can have that effect. Let&#39;s get some food in you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She led me to the kitchen, clearly at home in Ethan&#39;s house. Her ease with the layout and effortless finding of everything made me wonder. It&#39;s obvious! The two are having an affair!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave me some milk, bread, and bacon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t take this the wrong way, but why did you go to Arthur&#39;s club?&#34; Dr. Ruth inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Arthur?&#34; I repeated the name she mentioned. For the doctor to speak of the club owner this way, they must know each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Arthur is my ex-scumbag fiancé!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh!&#34; My mouth formed an O. &#34;He invited me to his business establishment for a possible business partnership, but now, I don&#39;t think that was the real reason at all. While I was... under the influence, I heard my aunt&#39;s voice. I think they&#39;re all in this together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aunt? Do you mean Madam Olsen?&#34; Dr. Ruth asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. It seems you know quite a lot, Dr. Ruth,&#34; I couldn&#39;t help but remark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dr. Ruth elaborated, &#34;Arthur and I... we have a history. We were college friends back in Nashville and started dating about ten years ago. Five years ago, he proposed, and I accepted like a fool. With marriage plans in mind, I invested nearly all my earnings from my medical practice into his club. He always said it was his dream, that it would make us rich...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dr. Ruth&#39;s voice faded as she absentmindedly traced patterns on the kitchen table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I noticed gradual changes in our lives-from a modest apartment to a penthouse. However, our dream of starting a family seemed to disappear in exchange. For five years, he made excuses until I discovered that the engagement ring he gave me was intended for another woman!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression hardened, jaw clenching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Three months ago, I had a patient who became pregnant after visiting Arthur&#39;s club. Suspicious of his lies and sharing a roof with him, I obtained documents from his safe-the identity of the club&#39;s major investor, even details about the drugs they use to victimize patrons. It was like a house of cards collapsing around me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Listening intently, I couldn&#39;t help but empathize with Dr. Ruth as she recounted her story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Madam Cornell is his primary investor. So when President Cornell informed me last night about what happened to you and where he rescued you, I knew immediately how to proceed with your treatment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Dr. Ruth!&#34; I wondered if Arthur DeLuca was the father of her unborn child, but I couldn&#39;t ask-it felt too personal, too raw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Imagine, I was blinded by that lunatic for ten years! The woman he was truly planning to marry had followed him here in Highland Hills. I discovered he&#39;d been housing her for months, right under my nose. Without hesitation, I ended things with him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a deep breath, composing herself. &#34;But even now, that shameless man won&#39;t leave me in peace. He blames me whenever something goes wrong in his club, like last night... I only realized his manipulative ways and deception after he disappeared from my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Dr. Ruth shared her story, I realized everyone seemed to have their own deep, often painful narrative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dr. Ruth, you mentioned seeing those documents. Is there any way we could get copies?&#34; A fire of determination had ignited within me. &#34;I can&#39;t allow a club like that to continue operating in this city, wreaking havoc on women&#39;s lives. Their evil needs to end.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I need to teach Madam Olsen a lesson! I can&#39;t understand why she would want to hurt me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually, yes. They&#39;re all on my cell phone, locked away in my safe. When I discovered those documents, I immediately photographed everything, thinking they might be needed someday.&#34; She gave a wry smile. &#34;I guess that day has come sooner than expected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dr. Ruth, I can&#39;t thank you enough for this,&#34; I said, squeezing her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing... It&#39;s time to shut down that club.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, I explained why I had been at the Eclipse Club Lounge. I was saddened that I had nearly become a victim the previous night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip&#39;s car arrived to pick me up a few minutes later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once inside, I immediately told him where I wanted to go. &#34;I miss Iris and Rowan, but I need to talk to Jane right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip was surprised. He started to protest, but he saw the determination in my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a slight nod, he instructed the driver, &#34;Take us to Cornell Mansion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the car pulled away, I fell into a heavy silence. The weight of betrayal pressed down on me, threatening to crush my spirit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane&#39;s betrayal hurt most those who could have turned against me. For the three years of my marriage, I trusted her as a friend amidst the challenges with Philip. In one night, she shattered that trust completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we arrived at the mansion, Philip turned to me, concern etched on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s your plan, Sarah?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip, I&#39;m used to betrayal by now, but Jane? I was nearly molested last night because of her actions.&#34; My voice cracked slightly, but I pressed on. &#34;This won&#39;t be easy, but I need to confront her. I have to cut her out of my life completely...&#34;</p>
