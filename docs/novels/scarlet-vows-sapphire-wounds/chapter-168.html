                <p>When did I genuinely start falling for him so deeply? It was that night four years ago, during a crisp autumn in London. Brody was abroad on a business trip. I was overworked and sick at the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had just returned from Paris, feeling dizzy as I stepped into our penthouse in Mayfair. I sneezed as I texted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Me:*** *&#39;Just got back from a business trip. What do you want for dinner?&#39;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost instantly, Brody replied: *&#39;I&#39;m on a business trip in New York. You didn&#39;t tell me you were coming back today.&#39;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had wanted to surprise him, so I kept my return a secret. But he hadn&#39;t mentioned his trip to me either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Me:*** *&#39;Alright! Take care!&#39;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My nose, already raw and red from constant sneezing, throbbed as I hit send. I dragged myself to the ensuite bathroom, leaving a trail of discarded clothes behind me. The hot shower offered momentary relief, but the room began to spin uncontrollably as I stepped out, wrapped in Brody&#39;s oversized bathrobe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I collapsed onto our king-sized bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire night was a blur of chills, cold sweats, and a desperate urge to get up, though my body wouldn&#39;t cooperate. My phone, placed on the mahogany cabinet across the room, rang incessantly. Each shrill tone pierced my aching head, but I was too weak to silence it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had no idea how many hours passed; a blurry outline of a doctor leaned over me. The sharp prick of a needle in my arm was the last thing I registered before succumbing to darkness once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I finally woke, Brody was beside me, gently wiping my arm with a damp towel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wh-what happened?&#34; I asked, my throat raw from dryness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s good you&#39;re awake... You caught the flu,&#34; Brody said softly, brushing his hand against my forehead to check for a fever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As my mind slowly cleared, confusion set in. &#34;Weren&#39;t you supposed to be in New York? When did you get here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brody frowned. &#34;The day you messaged me, I tried calling after my meeting. When you didn&#39;t answer, I got worried. I checked the penthouse&#39;s security feed and saw you&#39;d arrived and gone straight to the bedroom. After a few more unanswered calls, I knew something was wrong. I dropped everything and returned right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My cheeks flushed with warmth. &#34;I&#39;m so sorry, Brody. I&#39;ve ended up being such a bother to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t apologize. You haven&#39;t inconvenienced me at all. You&#39;re my wife, Jane I&#39;m relieved I came home when I did. The doctor said the IV drip was crucial in controlling your fever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could have easily delegated the task to someone else if work kept him occupied, but instead, he had dropped everything and flown across the Atlantic just for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there anything specific you&#39;d like to eat?&#34; Brody asked, his voice laced with concern. &#34;I could order something if you have a craving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing in particular. Whatever you choose is fine.&#34; I wondered if he&#39;d order takeout, so I made the decision. &#34;I&#39;m sorry again. I remember I offered to prepare our dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s the least I can do as his wife. We&#39;re both busy with work, and I&#39;m frequently away in other cities. I do everything I can to keep our relationship harmonious when I&#39;m here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half an hour later, Brody returned, balancing a tray laden with steaming dishes. The aroma of home-cooked food filled the room, making my stomach rumble appreciatively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I savored each bite, I couldn&#39;t help but comment, &#34;This is delicious. Where did you order from? The quality is restaurant-level.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I sipped water, he said, &#34;I cooked the dinner. I&#39;m glad you liked it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nearly choked on my water, coughing slightly. &#34;You made all this? In just thirty minutes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; he replied simply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My cheeks warmed again.  This successful, busy man had not only rushed home to care for me but had also taken the time to prepare a meal from scratch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, I felt the full force of Brody&#39;s care, and I knew I was falling even deeper for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I cried alone inside the hotel suite, my thoughts drifted back to Paris on New Year&#39;s Eve two years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We had initially planned to spend the holiday with the Martin family in North Carolina, but an issue arose with one of the models my agency managed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to go to Paris because I hadn&#39;t realized the model was struggling with her mental health, which had manifested in a dangerous eating disorder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brody had to go home, and I had no choice but to fly to Paris alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you have to go to Paris yourself?&#34; Brody asked, his voice tinged with sadness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She doesn&#39;t have any family,&#34; I explained, my voice tight with concern. &#34;It&#39;s the holiday season, and most of my staff are away. With her mental health so fragile, she needs someone she trusts at the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew I would miss Brody and his family, but I had to decide who needed me more. I promised myself I&#39;d call Brody to wish him well, a poor substitute for our planned New Year&#39;s Eve celebration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the hospital, I stayed by the side of the model, who had become a close friend. We went to the garden area to watch the fireworks in the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we waited for midnight, lost in our own thoughts, I was startled by a sudden kiss on my cheek. I nearly got angry, thinking some stranger had done it. But as I spun around to confront the intruder, I found myself face-to-face with Brody&#39;s familiar, broad-shouldered frame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;B-Brody! What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His bright and warm smile against the cold Parisian night made my heart race. He presented me with a bouquet of my favorite flowers-peonies and roses-their sweet scent, starkly contrasting to the antiseptic hospital air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I couldn&#39;t let the New Year begin without you by my side,&#34; Brody said softly, his eyes never leaving mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After introducing him to my model, who smiled knowingly at us, Brody turned back to me. &#34;Happy New Year, Jane. I hope you can forgive the surprise. I just... I couldn&#39;t bear the thought of you being alone tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was, I had been feeling sad. Philip was likely busy with his family, and Sarah and I hadn&#39;t spoken in a while because she was upset with me. I thought I deserved to endure this loneliness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what about your family, Brody?&#34; I asked, guilt creeping into my voice. &#34;They must be missing you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jane, you are my family Happy New Year.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears welled up in my eyes, blurring the lights of Paris. I threw my arms around him, burying my face in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hours of crying and thinking about Brody&#39;s genuine care for me when I was his wife. someone knocked on my door. Fear gripped me-I was alone in this suite, and no one, not even my secretary, knew where I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I heard his voice, muffled but unmistakable. &#34;Jane, let me speak with you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart leaped into my throat. Why is Brody here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>SPECIAL</p>
