                <p>**Philip**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The streetlights blurred as I stared out the car window, my mind a whirlwind of emotions on the way back to Serenity Pines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had just come from the police station, where I met my father, who had a grim look throughout the process. My mother died in prison. The news of my mother&#39;s suicide in prison hit me like a physical blow. Even though she had become a bad person, Madam Cornell was still my mother. It pained me to think she had managed to hurt Sarah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dad had taken on the grim responsibility of identifying and claiming Mom&#39;s body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind was in chaos as the car approached Serenity Pines. It must have been around one in the morning, and Sarah was probably curled on the bed. I checked my phone and saw a message from her, which had been sent hours ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Sarah:*** *Is everything alright, Philip?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My throat tightened. No, nothing was alright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I decided to tell Sarah the truth in person, so I didn&#39;t respond to her message. Besides, she was likely asleep by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got out of the vehicle and saw Sarah outside with Josh. What was she doing? Why was she out there? Above all, why did it seem like they were having a serious conversation?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a dark expression, I approached them. Before I could close the distance between us, he did the unthinkable-he leaned in and kissed Sarah. Time stood still. My vision narrowed on the spot where Josh&#39;s lips met my wife&#39;s. A primal rage surged through me, and my fists clenched involuntarily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dared to touch what&#39;s mine!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that eternal moment, all I could think was: Is this it? Is she leaving me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah and I reconciled quickly after the incident I witnessed. The misunderstanding was resolved, and our bond grew stronger after enduring yet another challenge. Now, here I am at the cemetery, emotions swirling beneath a calm exterior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was late afternoon. There was a drizzle, so most attendees held black umbrellas as they paid their last respects to my mother, Madam Cornell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Familiar faces filled the crowd: long-lost relatives, my friend Ethan, and even some business associates like Bronn and Madam Olsen. Despite the turmoil inside me, I maintained a stoic façade, my face betraying no emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane decided to stay away and focus on her day at work instead. I understood her choice; the trauma from her abduction by my mother was still fresh, with both physical and emotional wounds yet to heal. Sarah also stayed at Serenity Pines Estate, a wise decision considering the reporters circling the cemetery&#39;s outskirts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t notice when the people at the cemetery started to leave one by one. My friend Ethan was beside me, supporting me, along with a few guards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, Trey&#39;s voice interrupted my thoughts. &#34;We need to go, boss!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, turning towards the waiting car. As I did, I thought I saw someone by a big oak tree-just for a moment, I thought it was Sarah, but she quickly disappeared from my sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To ensure that Sarah wasn&#39;t around, I called her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello!&#34; Sarah answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing right now?&#34; I asked, my eyes still fixed on the tree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Finalizing your character in the LoveLogic app,&#34; she replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Does that mean she&#39;s home?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My brow furrowed. &#34;My character?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Philip, your character was completed by Lexi, and it was so handsome! I almost don&#39;t want to release it to the public. If I didn&#39;t think about my team&#39;s effort and the potential earnings for our app...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time that day, a smile tugged at my lips. &#34;You&#39;re probably ogling over the AI version of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course not! That&#39;s being a pervert!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are a pregnant pervert. You just admitted it to me...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did I?&#34; She&#39;s so cute when she&#39;s confused. I&#39;m so fucking in love with this woman. God, how I wanted to see her, to hold her and feel the swell of her belly where our babies grew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, she&#39;s the person I need the most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please take care of yourself,&#34; I reminded her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah was in a challenging situation, compelled to stay at Serenity Pines and work there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will, babe!&#34; Sarah replied. &#34;Pick up some delicious buns from the bakery near Luminary Productions before you return home. Bye!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After ending the call with Sarah, Ethan turned to me, a knowing smirk playing on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never thought Sarah was the key to making you smile. It&#39;s almost cringe-worthy how obsessed you are!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Crazy!&#34; I retorted, shaking my head at Ethan&#39;s comment. My gaze returned to the old oak tree on the edge of the property. &#34;I thought I saw her standing there earlier. That&#39;s why I called her-to see if she&#39;d managed to sneak out somehow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan glanced toward where I had pointed. Trey looked alarmed and instructed another guard to check the spot. Whether it was Sarah or not, caution was necessary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, the guard returned, slightly out of breath. &#34;Boss, there&#39;s no one there. I checked the surrounding area, too-all clear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were probably just missing Sarah,&#34; Ethan commented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Possible. The thought repeated in my mind, bringing a surge of longing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, we should get going,&#34; my other guard remarked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing at my watch, I realized it was time to meet Mariano&#39;s group. I sighed heavily, feeling anger resurface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could you give Ethan and me some space?&#34; I requested of my guards, my tone leaving no room for argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They nodded silently and moved away, positioning themselves at a respectful distance but still within sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s your plan, Philip?&#34; Ethan inquired softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s about Josh. I saw him kissing my wife, Sarah,&#34; I gritted my teeth, speaking in a low voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Ethan exclaimed, clearly confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan,&#34; I said, gripping his arms tightly and looking him directly in the eyes, &#34;if something happens to me during this meeting, I need you to promise me you&#39;ll ensure Sarah and the babies are safe. No matter what.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion and alarm warred in Ethan&#39;s expression. &#34;What does that even mean, Philip? What are you planning?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have to confront Mariano&#39;s team because Josh is his people. This meeting is inevitable since Josh has unexpectedly chosen to leave my team. I question his motives even more. It&#39;s not me he&#39;s been watching over all this time-it&#39;s Sarah!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s eyes widened as he glanced around at our companions, ensuring we weren&#39;t overheard. &#34;What exactly are you implying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not easy to leave Mariano&#39;s team, especially if you know as much about his operations as I do. Yet Mariano allowed Josh to leave my team without any fuss. Don&#39;t you find that suspicious? I think Mariano deliberately placed Josh in my team to watch over Sarah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan paused, processing this revelation. &#34;Wait, are you saying Mariano wanted to protect Sarah?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded firmly. That&#39;s right! Josh was always there for Sarah, ensuring she recovered fully from her panic attacks. Now that my wife is improving, Mariano suddenly allows Josh to leave my team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what I&#39;m thinking?&#34; I continued, lowering my voice even further. &#34;I think Mariano might be one of Sarah&#39;s family. Maybe Amir, her father, or Grandpa Mitchell!&#34;</p>
