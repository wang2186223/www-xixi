                <p>**Philip**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Josh&#39;s picture, I struggle to articulate how it makes me feel. It&#39;s almost as though Mariano is playing games with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing at Sarah, I noticed her lips were still parted in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I feel so stupid!&#34; she exclaimed. Her hands gripped the clean white sheets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Try to stay calm, love,&#34; I reassured, squeezing her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I trusted him completely, Philip. I told him about my deepest feelings, my struggles... How could he betray me like this?&#34; Her voice rose, tinged with anger and disbelief. &#34;And who is this new Sarah? What kind of sick game is this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing at Jakob by the window, I hoped for his insight. He responded with a shrug, his expression tinged with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hadn&#39;t told Sarah everything that happened because I didn&#39;t want to add more stress to her fragile state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about it. We&#39;ll figure this out,&#34; I assured her, trying to inject confidence into my voice. &#34;We&#39;ll do everything we can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But it doesn&#39;t make any sense! Did that person really think she could have my life just because she looks like me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to agree, to tell her it doesn&#39;t work that way, but I held my tongue. The situation was more complicated than she knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, I raised her hand to my lips and gently kissed her knuckles. &#34;You need to rest and take care of yourself. Let me handle this issue; I suspect Mariano&#39;s involvement. He won&#39;t leave me alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could Madam Olsen have been working with Josh all this time?&#34; Jakob pondered. &#34;Remember how she took him to Romania to retrieve Philip&#39;s body? Anything could have happened then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s plausible, but Sarah immediately dismissed the idea. &#34;No, Philip! I trust Josh completely. So much has happened since then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Another thing,&#34; Jakob pointed out, &#34;Josh knew you were pregnant, Sarah, but this group doesn&#39;t seem to know that,&#34; his brow furrowed as he studied the photograph again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wonder what his motive could be,&#34; I pondered aloud, more to myself than anyone else. The pieces didn&#39;t quite make sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah sighed heavily, clearly frustrated. I could sense her confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough with the stress. Everyone, please leave the room. I appreciate your concern for my wife, and thank you for visiting, but your presence is causing her distress,&#34; I said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the last thing I wanted-to stress out my wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can stay at Amir&#39;s villa,&#34; Sarah suggested, glancing at Trey to handle the arrangements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a practical suggestion. Amir&#39;s villa boasted high security and was conveniently close to Serenity Pines, allowing me to respond swiftly to any new developments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once everyone had left, I sat on Sarah&#39;s bed, facing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can count on me for this, babe. Somehow, this person is helping you resolve your issues with Lila. Companies are filing deception charges, and some products have been withdrawn. Amir said there&#39;s chaos in the Benner family. Your father wasn&#39;t fooled, though. He knew that woman wasn&#39;t really you. &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My wife pondered profoundly and then nodded. &#34;Oh, goodness! You&#39;re absolutely right!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grinning, I was glad to see a glimpse of her usual self. &#34;You married quite the capable husband, you know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tss!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckled. &#34;For now, let them fight amongst themselves. You must focus on regaining strength and being a happy, healthy mother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refusing to let outside issues disrupt our peace at Serenity Pines, this sanctuary was ours and free from outside disruptions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your mind is sharpest when you&#39;re calm We&#39;ll prepare and wait for the right moment to act.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lifted her chin gently with my finger and leaned in, pressing a soft, loving kiss to her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After two days, work demands couldn&#39;t be ignored any longer, especially given the recent developments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah&#39;s scandal caused chaos at Luminary Productions. A press conference was scheduled, and my father, the chairman, called me to accompany the public relations team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I adjusted my tie, I told Sarah, &#34;Lexi and Jakob noticed a lot of buzz on social media, especially from those who said they saw us getting married in Las Vegas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah&#39;s face contorted in a wince.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re doing everything they can to scrub the internet,&#34; I continued, my fingers twisting the tie knot. &#34;Taking down public posts, flagging videos-anything about our forced wedding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forced wedding?&#34; she echoed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, remember when you forced me to marry you?&#34; I teased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave me a wicked smile. &#34;But I asked you for a divorce practically before the ink was dry on the certificate!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right, right!&#34; I said, finding her cute when she was riled up. I sat beside her on the bed, and she automatically helped me straighten my tie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If reporters at the press conference ask about our marital status... are you comfortable with me confirming it?&#34; I asked, hoping to dispel any lingering doubts. In my mind, I envisioned a future where Sarah had fully recovered: romantic dinners at our favorite restaurants, strolling hand-in-hand through the park, and attending red-carpet events as a power couple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay to confirm the marriage, but please don&#39;t mention the twins. The idea of the public knowing about them terrifies me,&#34; she replied. &#34;Done!&#34; she announced, finishing with the necktie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew Sarah was scared, especially if Marcus showed up unexpectedly. I had to investigate to make sure he wouldn&#39;t surprise us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Setting aside wedding concerns, she mentioned, &#34;I was thinking of giving Jakob and Lexi an apartment near Luminary Productions as a token of appreciation for their hard work. Can you help me check it out? I want it to be a surprise and not trouble Emily right now, as she&#39;s closely managing Sophia and Mike.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, I&#39;ll handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jakob and Lexi definitely deserved recognition. I used to have unfounded jealousy toward Jakob. However, now I&#39;ve come to see that they regard each other as extended family. Sarah&#39;s team has much work ahead of time, and arranging the apartment is just a small request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before heading to the office, I gently kissed her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Luminary Productions, especially in my father&#39;s office, tension filled the air as I met with the public relations team. They looked curious and concerned as we discussed my relationship with Sarah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mean to tell me you&#39;re still married?&#34; my father asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, those social media comments about people witnessing our wedding a few months ago are accurate. I remarried Sarah just before the accident that put me in a coma,&#34; I explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sensed a hint of satisfaction from Dad upon hearing this news. Sarah was more than just an ordinary woman; my father was finally starting to understand how important she was to the family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While he had never been openly abusive toward Sarah, he often treated her with indifference. He wasn&#39;t a good man by any means, but compared to my mother&#39;s cruel manipulations, he seemed like a saint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the meeting ended, I walked out of the office and found Alex, my assistant, anxiously fidgeting in the hallway. It always makes me nervous when my assistant acts this way. Perhaps it&#39;s because we&#39;ve been together for so long; I can usually read his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, there&#39;s a visitor in your office. Trey is there keeping an eye on her,&#34; he reported.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would you allow someone into my private office?&#34; I frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had to, sir. It... it could potentially disrupt today&#39;s agenda,&#34; he replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His unclear answer made me more uneasy. Without saying anything else, I walked quickly to my office, ready to face whoever this mysterious visitor was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon opening the door to my private office, I was surprised to find Sarah sitting elegantly on the couch, reading a newspaper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, babe!&#34; she exclaimed, perfectly mimicking Sarah&#39;s gentle voice, as she gracefully stood up and moved towards me for a hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trey, who stood nearby, cleared his throat as a subtle warning. Of course, I was aware-it wasn&#39;t miraculous for my wife to rise from bed with fresh surgical wounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the imposter approached, I smelled her perfume-a strong scent that Sarah would never use. Quickly, I stepped back and firmly grabbed her shoulders, keeping her at a distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34; I demanded, my voice low and dangerous.</p>
