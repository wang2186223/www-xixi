                <p>**Sarah**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m seething at Philip&#39;s remarks, clenching my fist in frustration. The audacity of this despicable man!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite being with Megan, he had the nerve to disrespect me, shamelessly stealing a kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I despise this tumultuous storm raging within me! The longing persists! The mere touch of Philip&#39;s breath, the tender caress of his fingers upon the wineglass, every fleeting glance sends shockwaves through my very essence, threatening to unravel me completely!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, I must remind myself of the pain he caused, both to me and our child. I must replace any lingering affection with seething anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright, Sarah?&#34; Bronn&#39;s concerned voice breaks through my thoughts as we leave the restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine. I&#39;ll head back to the suite. See you tomorrow,&#34; I reply, masking my turmoil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip and Megan exit ahead of us in a whirlwind of tension, with Megan practically throwing a tantrum. The sight of her jealousy and irritation ignites a wicked pleasure within me, especially when she can&#39;t accept Bronn&#39;s interest in me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With emotions swirling inside me, I strode purposefully toward the opulent suite I had meticulously secured for three days. The taste of regret lingered on my tongue, a bitter reminder of the unpleasant fare I had ingested earlier, threatening to wreak havoc on my well-being. Sensing the situation&#39;s urgency, I knew that only through exercise could I purge my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I already discussed it with my doctor because I find it peculiar how much more invigorated I feel with regular activities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor&#39;s voice echoed in my mind as I recalled our conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Regular exercise can strengthen your heart muscles and improve cardiovascular function. But be careful not to overdo it or disrupt your routine. Since you&#39;ve already consulted me, make sure not to skip it,&#34; the doctor advised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He emphasized that my situation was unique and stressed the importance of not neglecting medication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day at BM Technologies followed its usual course. Philip arrived in the afternoon, just as Jakob and I were deeply engrossed in our job inside the small office. Our focus was disrupted when the secretary interrupted us to remind us about the presentation for Philip&#39;s team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jakob, Luminary Productions is here. The boss is calling you to the conference room. The presentation begins in thirty minutes,&#34; Gayla, one of Bronn&#39;s secretaries, informed us before leaving again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to Jakob. &#34;Are you confident about Luminary?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, why?&#34; he responded, briefly glancing at me before returning his focus to his laptop screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you stay in Highland Hills City if your project gets accepted? Are you prepared for that?&#34; I inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me? You mean you&#39;re not coming with me?&#34; he countered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fell silent momentarily, remembering Jakob&#39;s aspirations of joining Philip&#39;s Sci-fi project; a chilling question gripped my mind like icy tendrils: Was I inadvertently poised to snatch his dream away?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew deep down that Jakob&#39;s dream would come true, but there was a tough reality: I might miss seeing it happen if it didn&#39;t happen within a year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll stick by you, even if it feels impossible for me to return there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mention of Highland Hills evoked a flood of painful memories, making it the last place I wanted to revisit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But doesn&#39;t Philip Cornell realize you&#39;re my assistant or secretary?&#34; Jakob queried, his hand finding its way to his chin in contemplation. &#34;It would undoubtedly raise significant questions if he doesn&#39;t see us together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shrugging slightly, I confessed, &#34;I can&#39;t say for certain what&#39;s going through his mind, especially given his role in orchestrating my cheating incident that night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Jacob delved into last year&#39;s events, he uncovered unsettling truths. The individual I encountered in the bedroom at Serenity Pines Estate was affiliated with Philip&#39;s company and not a recognized actor. Following the ordeal, that actor received a hefty sum of two million from the Cornells. It became evident that Philip was determined to extricate himself from our marriage in favor of Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob&#39;s countenance soured as he broached the sensitive topic. &#34;I apologize for reopening old wounds,&#34; he said solemnly. &#34;So, does this mean that now that we&#39;re collaborating, Philip might go to great lengths to thwart our efforts in advancing the graphic design tool?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s how it is,&#34; I affirmed frankly. &#34;This is personal, and Philip is our client. He&#39;s capable of just about anything,&#34; I remarked nonchalantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, Jakob and I prepared before going to the conference room. BM Technologies had arranged the attendees into five groups, with Jakob and I among them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we entered, I caught Philip&#39;s gaze. Megan accompanied him, managing a smirk and subtly raising her lips in my direction. Without much ado, I ascended the stairs situated to the side. Our seats, alongside Jakob&#39;s, were on elevated chairs, typical of the panel conference room where the presentation was slated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip took the stage and delivered a message. &#34;This project holds immense significance for my company. We will offer a substantial amount along with a bonus to the visual effects developer&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He offered some words of encouragement before proceeding to call the teams up one by one. Jakob and I found ourselves at the tail end of the list. It was only when the third team was summoned that we encountered an issue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They presented their project on the screen. &#34;Meet &#39;HoloForge,&#39; the latest and greatest software for making sci-fi movies. It&#39;s super easy to use, with a cool interface that listens to your voice and gestures, and artists can seamlessly navigate through a vast array of tools and effects, unleashing their imagination without constraints...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait a moment!&#34; I exclaimed, rising from my seat and widening my eyes. I shared a glance with Jakob, who mirrored my expression despite the dimness of our surroundings. We were bathed only in the light from the stage and screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holoforge is ChronoGrafix-our project!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They&#39;ve simply rebranded it, but the concept Jakob and I crafted is displayed on the screen! The graphic artist elaborated, &#34;This tool facilitates real-time collaboration among artists, directors, and producers from any corner of the globe. Whether brainstorming ideas, reviewing concept art, or providing feedback on visual effects, every team member can seamlessly contribute to the creative process&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uncertainty gripped me as I pondered Jakob&#39;s next move. He soured as he realized that someone had usurped our concept. With determined strides, Jakob made his way towards the stage, and I followed suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic surged within me. Perhaps I was the true target of the Luminary, and Jakob was unwittingly entangled in the web, just as I had feared earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could Philip&#39;s presence here signify an attempt to discredit us, branding us as lacking originality and jeopardizing our standing within BM Technologies?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling frustrated, I grabbed the microphone from Jakob just as he was about to speak and turned it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jakob, hold on!&#34; I intervened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah, that project belongs to us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m aware. But we&#39;ve only been with BM Technologies for three months! Mr. Martin would face humiliation in front of the Luminary, and LoveLogic could suffer repercussions too!&#34; I implored, trying to reason with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve exerted tremendous effort on this project! We spent countless nights working, often skipping meals to meet deadlines. And let&#39;s not forget you&#39;ve-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop! I&#39;ll ask Bronn to conduct an investigation,&#34; I interjected calmly. &#34;I understand the frustration of seeing others claim credit for our work, but reacting impulsively to this event could harm us. They&#39;re baiting us to react. We need to maintain our professionalism. BM Technologies has a reputation to uphold. If we lose our composure, it could portray us as troublemakers, complicating the resolution process.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What should we do then?&#34; Jakob inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gayla interrupted us as she approached. &#34;Is there an issue? Why are you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gayla, HoloForge is ChronoGrafix-our project,&#34; Jakob explained, his voice shaky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you certain?&#34; Gayla&#39;s eyes widened in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to inform Mr. Martin immediately. The ChronoGrafix shouldn&#39;t be displayed,&#34; I urged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sense of urgency, Gayla darted away from us, her steps quick and purposeful as she made a beeline toward Bronn&#39;s location. As the third group concluded their presentation, she arrived just in the nick of time, tension thick in the air like an impending storm. Lucas and Stella, with haughty arrogance, descended from the stage, their sneers cutting through the room like blades.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then there was Megan, her gaze briefly flickering our way, a chilling void of emotion in her eyes, betraying no hint of sympathy or solidarity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;So, it&#39;s you!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suppose Megan and Philip intend to undermine me. In that case, I won&#39;t let them involve Jakob, who diligently focuses on his work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we were called onto the grand stage for our momentous presentation, Jakob stood frozen, his mind a tumultuous sea of confusion. He had been poured into serving our business partner with BM, and the repercussions of this turmoil were palpable-I could sense his profound distress echoing through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hereby announce a change in the submitted graphic tool!&#34; I proclaimed into the microphone, fixing Megan with a steely gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she hungers for my failure, I am resolved not to yield her the pleasure...</p>
