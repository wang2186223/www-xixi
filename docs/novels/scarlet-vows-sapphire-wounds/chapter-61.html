                <p>**Sarah**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34; Josh&#39;s voice cut through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I strained to listen more closely, climbing onto the toilet to catch the voices more clearly. Thankfully, my thoughts hadn&#39;t deceived me. The sound was faint, barely more than a whisper since I was eavesdropping from the bathroom, hoping to catch any helpful information.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go away! I need to smoke to ease my stress, and it doesn&#39;t help seeing you here!&#34; Megan&#39;s voice was sharp with irritation as she shouted at the bodyguard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know it&#39;s not Sarah Mitchell. Why are you accusing her of what happened at the villa?&#34; Josh pressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need your opinion! Why are you even on Philip&#39;s team, huh? To mess with me?&#34; Megan snapped back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, that&#39;s right! You&#39;ll see me every day, Megan,&#34; Josh&#39;s voice trembled with intensity. &#34;This is what you&#39;ve brought upon me and my family.&#34; His anger was palpable</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let go of me, you jerk!&#34; Megan&#39;s voice rose in fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you are the most despicable person I&#39;ve ever met! You&#39;re a cunt!&#34; Josh&#39;s voice was filled with rage, starkly contrasting with his usual calm demeanor when he talked to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard the sharp sound of a slap. Megan had probably slapped Josh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want me back; that&#39;s why you&#39;re bothering me!&#34; Megan accused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh growled, his breath heavy with frustration. &#34;No, Megan. I want to know the truth! I&#39;ve been with Mr. Cornell&#39;s team for half a year. I&#39;ve heard the rumors. You were supposed to marry Mr. Cornell. Why did you leave him for me? And now, you&#39;re running back to him even though you know he doesn&#39;t want you because Ms. Mitchell is there!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah, that woman doesn&#39;t even faze me! Philip and Sarah reconciling? Impossible. Madam Cornell would never permit it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh chuckled. &#34;Ah, trying to curry favor with Madam Cornell, are we? Yet you&#39;re clueless about her intentions. Funny, really. You and she? Cut from the same cloth. Maybe both of you could benefit from a little therapy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re a piece of shit!&#34; Megan shot back. &#34;Daniel, why don&#39;t we join forces to sort this out? You want me back, right? I might entertain the idea if you guarantee Sarah&#39;s demise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My focus intensified upon hearing Megan&#39;s words. While I couldn&#39;t decipher Josh&#39;s thoughts, one thing was clear: his relationship with Megan was far from healthy. Moreover, I suspect Megan was unaware prior to this day that Josh or Daniel she mentioned is a part of Philip&#39;s team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniel... Daniel who?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can only hope Jakob has already gathered information about Josh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind wandered as I sat in the back of Philip&#39;s car. Megan and I were with him after the fire investigation and on our way to Luminary Productions. Even though I&#39;ve finally received an answer about Megan and Josh&#39;s relationship status, I still feel unsettled. People tend to betray me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan occupied the front passenger seat while Philip and I were in the back. Much to my relief, he was engrossed in his laptop, as it meant he wouldn&#39;t be clingy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip, remember the event I told you about? It&#39;s Langston&#39;s anniversary. Alex already confirmed our attendance,&#34; Megan reminded him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chose to gaze out the window, pretending not to hear her. I knew she had said it deliberately, rubbing in my face that no matter what, she and Philip shared a connection that excluded me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, right! I&#39;ll bring Sarah on your behalf,&#34; Philip commented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Megan raised her voice and glanced at me through the rearview mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan, your home just burned down. It wouldn&#39;t be right for people to see you partying at the event as if nothing happened. They will definitely question your presence there. Wouldn&#39;t it be better if they believed you were preoccupied with what happened at your residence?&#34; Philip explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see Megan&#39;s face sour. She was clearly dismayed, but Philip made sense. Unfortunately, Bronn had already invited me to the event because Langston is a major sponsor of theirs. The event would take place in the neighboring city of Highland Hills, and since Bronn knew I was in the town, he had already informed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t make other arrangements, Philip. Mr. Bronn Martin has already extended the invitation, and I&#39;ll be attending as a representative of BM Technologies, accompanying him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip&#39;s jaw tightened, his gaze fixing upon me with an intensity that made my heart beat. &#34;We&#39;ll discuss this later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan explained, her voice tense, &#34;Philip, the Langstons are expecting us.&#34; Her determined demeanor suggested she was unwilling to let me accompany my ex-husband to the party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan, if you&#39;re so keen on going, why don&#39;t you take Mr. Martin as your date?&#34; Philip retorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan averted her gaze. Philip&#39;s words cut deeper than any blade. Her eyes smoldered with a potent mix of anguish and fury as she turned her withering glare upon me, clearly holding me accountable for his cruelty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I interjected, &#34;Philip, you know I&#39;m here on behalf of Bronn&#39;s company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bronn? I didn&#39;t realize your association with him was that intimate.&#34; Philip closed his laptop with an annoyed expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head in exasperation. This was simply about attending the Langston party. Why do I feel like I&#39;ve cheated? This jealous behavior-I don&#39;t have time for his sulking! I&#39;m here for business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the car stopped, Megan looked on the verge of tears as she swiftly exited and walked away. I gathered my things, paying her no further attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you giving me away to Megan?&#34; Philip asked, regaining my focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip, you&#39;re a person, not something to be &#39;given&#39; to someone,&#34; I clarified. Here we go again. This brute never could resist an opportunity to start his constant banter and childish taunting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About the party? Why do you want me to take Megan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t suggest that you bring Megan. What I meant is that I already committed to attending with Bronn. I&#39;m here representing BM Technologies, remember? It&#39;s normal for colleagues to be at the same event, just like you and Megan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t approve of you going with Bronn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I huffed. &#34;I&#39;m not asking for your permission. If you don&#39;t want to take Megan, take Madam Cornell or Jane! Listen, you&#39;re giving me a headache, Philip. I&#39;m just reminding you that I finished defending myself in the interview earlier with the investigators. You&#39;re giving me SDE vibes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;SDE?&#34; He gave me a confused look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Small dick energy,&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver opened his mouth wide, widening his eyes. I wasn&#39;t even aware that he was still in the vehicle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does that even mean? You&#39;re fully aware I&#39;m big and have a lot of energy!&#34; Philip exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not in the mood to talk about your dick!&#34; With heated cheeks, I rolled my eyes, trying to play it cool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the driver picked up on that second-hand embarrassment vibe and wanted to fade into the upholstery to avoid further bruising his boss&#39;s ego.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You brought that up, and now you&#39;re not in the mood? I really don&#39;t understand you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure, sure. Let&#39;s be honest; that&#39;s the reason for our divorce!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver&#39;s eyes widened in utter shock. Philip also commented. &#34;You divorced me because I have a small dick?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver awkwardly exited the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had the strong urge to throttle Philip! &#34;Seriously! I don&#39;t want to talk about your dick! What I meant is that we simply don&#39;t understand each other, which led to our divorce! Got that? Furthermore, I wouldn&#39;t approve of going with you either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh? Why&#39;s that?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because it&#39;ll look like I&#39;m replacing Megan again. My ego can&#39;t handle that.&#34; My cheeks flushed as soon as the words left my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It stopped Philip from bantering, finally getting my point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got out of the car, determined not to let my headache worsen because of him. The driver scratched his head awkwardly. My banter with Philip will surely linger even in his dreams! That rascal! It&#39;s his fault for not grasping my words properly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I walked, I ran into Alex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alex, where can I work?&#34; I asked, looking for a suitable office space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh, where would you like to have an office, Madam Sarah?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d choose Philip&#39;s office if I wanted to irritate Madam Cornell and Megan. But I wanted to avoid seeing Philip as I worked, especially since Jakob and I were working on something he shouldn&#39;t see or know about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Somewhere far from your boss, somewhere I won&#39;t even see his shadow-does such a place exist?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cleared his throat. &#34;The chairman&#39;s office?&#34; He meant Philip&#39;s father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked, momentarily thrown off guard. &#34;I&#39;m just kidding! Just give me a space near the production team I&#39;ll work with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Alex led me to the new office space, my phone buzzed with a message from Jakob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Jakob:*** *Josh&#39;s real name is Dr. Daniel Caldwell, and his history with Megan is more complicated than we thought.*</p>
