                <p>**Sarah**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Jane exited Philip&#39;s room, I was at a loss for how to react.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was something different about her that I couldn&#39;t quite pinpoint, but it left me feeling unsettled. Seeking a moment to process my thoughts, I moved to the large floor-to-ceiling window. I left Philip with the children, still feeling uneasy from my brief interaction with Jane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane had always held a special place in my heart, and realizing we had grown distant over the past four years disturbed me deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here&#39;s a coloring book for each of you. Whoever does the best job coloring gets a special prize from Daddy. How does that sound?&#34; I heard Philip say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Iris&#39;s voice piped up eagerly, &#34;Me, me! I&#39;m definitely going to win! I&#39;m way better at coloring than Brother Rowan!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way, Iris! Your coloring is always messy and all over the place!&#34; Rowan immediately retorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, we&#39;ll see about that later!&#34; Philip responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until I felt Philip&#39;s warm embrace from behind that I snapped back to reality. Turning my head, I saw Rowan and Iris wholly absorbed in their coloring books at Philip&#39;s desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you troubled by Jane&#39;s visit?&#34; Philip asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is she?&#34; I asked simply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To be honest, I&#39;m unsure if I can say she&#39;s okay. Jane&#39;s gone through significant changes after therapy. I thought she and Brody Martin had no problems, but&#34; He trailed off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what?&#34; I prompted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When Jane returned from Paris, she found Brody&#39;s secretary in their apartment. As it turns out, this woman is actually Brody&#39;s ex-fiancée.&#34; His face soured as he relayed this information, clearly disapproving of the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s cheating?&#34; My eyes widened in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not sure, babe. I can&#39;t answer what Brody truly feels or how he&#39;s acted towards Jane. It&#39;s possible there&#39;s an explanation for why the secretary was at their place that doesn&#39;t involve infidelity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raised an eyebrow at Philip. &#34;Are you defending a cheater?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip grimaced at my accusation and reasoned, &#34;Come on, I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s possible! Remember when you thought I had something going on with Megan before, even though I ended any thoughts of her before we married? What I had with Megan after she returned was purely professional, nothing more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s exactly what you told me about us, too, Philip. That what we had was &#39;purely business.&#39;&#34; I commented, raising an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip scratched his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmp!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our conversation was cut short when my ride was announced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bye, babies! Be good to Daddy, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bye, Mommy!&#34; my two kids said. Philip managed to steal a quick kiss before I left the room, his lips brushing mine with an urgent tenderness. As I stepped out, my heart skipped a beat. There, waiting outside, was Jane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Jane**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The trip to Henderson was unusually silent between Sarah and me. For over two hours, we hardly spoke because of the helicopter&#39;s noise. Exhausted, I fell asleep without even realizing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was jolted awake as the helicopter began to land. When I looked around, I saw a familiar logo and realized we were landing at BM Technologies. I mentally kicked myself for not thinking ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it! Why had I assumed Sarah was going somewhere else?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were greeted by her executive assistant, Emily, who looked just as surprised to see me. I offered a smile, which she returned. Since we&#39;re part of the same family, it&#39;s not unusual for us to run into each other at family gatherings, though my relationship with her and Bronn is a casual familiarity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was about to part ways with Sarah&#39;s group when I suddenly realized I had no money. Crap! In my haste to escape Brody&#39;s presence, I had left everything behind-including my wallet. I had no cash, no cards, nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we waited for the elevator, I gathered my courage and gently tapped Sarah on the shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, I know this is incredibly awkward, but can I borrow some money?&#34; I asked, whispering and blushing from embarrassment. Emily and two other assistants were nearby, glancing over at us. &#34;I promise I&#39;ll repay you when I return to Highland Hills.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; Sarah asked, looking puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scratched my cheek nervously, feeling increasingly foolish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I... I didn&#39;t think things through today. I literally had nothing with me except my phone, which was in my pocket. I drove to Luminary Productions and left my bag in the car, thinking I&#39;d only be in Philip&#39;s office for a minute. But, well...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah&#39;s intense gaze bore into me, clearly struggling to understand my lapse in judgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, I know,&#34; I continued, desperate to explain myself. &#34;I was impulsive. Please?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah sighed long and then said, &#34;I&#39;ll help you out. But in return, I need your assistance with something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My brow furrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A new game app is launching today, and I&#39;m one of the judges for the projects submitted for investment. I need your expertise to ensure my choices are sound and unbiased. Could you analyze each submission and point out potential design flaws or technical execution? I&#39;ll pay you afterward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea intrigued me. It seemed like a good distraction from my chaotic thoughts. Why not? I thought. I missed Sarah&#39;s company and was eager to spend time with her, even if it was just a short, professional visit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jakob looked surprised when he saw me approaching the conference hall and then hugged me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jane? Wow! My dear cousin! Have you and Sarah patched things up?&#34; He was grinning like a fool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grimaced and didn&#39;t respond to his comment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jakob didn&#39;t let my silence stop him. &#34;Did you know that Brody had me looking for you? Good thing you&#39;re here! Now I won&#39;t have to struggle with my answer!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A warning glance was shot his way, silently urging him to drop the subject.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jake! Leave her alone,&#34; Emily said sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? I was just-&#34; he began, but Sarah interrupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jane looks uncomfortable. Can&#39;t you see?&#34; Sarah scolded her friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You and Brody fought?!&#34; Jakob exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you go on inside and leave her be?&#34; Sarah kicked him to create some distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;P-please don&#39;t mind him,&#34; Emily said, trying to defuse the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know how he gets when he&#39;s excited-his mouth runs faster than his brain. I swear, that man must have taken a double dose of his vitamins this morning!&#34; Sarah remarked with a hint of sarcasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Th-thanks, ladies!&#34; I managed to stammer, feeling a lump in my throat, fighting my tears. Their instinctive protection of my mental state, even after everything that had happened, touched me deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath, I steeled myself as we entered the conference hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bronn stood at the podium, his charismatic presence commanding attention. Watching him speak, I realized my feelings for him were just infatuation-an overblown gratitude for his perceived rescue from Madam Cornell. It was merely a fantasy, a way to escape my harsh reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Games have evolved from mere entertainment to powerful tools over the years. They&#39;ve made learning more engaging Games also foster connections, bringing people together in virtual worlds where individuals from diverse locations can meet, play, and collaborate&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His presence stirred thoughts of Brody, causing a pang in my chest. Our four-year marriage wasn&#39;t perfect, but it wasn&#39;t terrible either. He had treated me well as a Cornell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, what went wrong with my marriage?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To all our brilliant engineers, thank you for your invaluable contributions, eagerness to share your knowledge, and always wanting to learn more. Your dedication motivates us to aim higher and be more innovative...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Applause filled the room. I pushed thoughts of Brody aside and joined Jakob and Sarah in rating the game apps presented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the event, I thought we would return to Highland Hills, but Emily and Bronn invited Sarah and me to their place for a gathering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At their mansion, I had a chance to talk more deeply with Sarah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day, I woke up to find Brody sleeping beside me and screamed in surprise!</p>
