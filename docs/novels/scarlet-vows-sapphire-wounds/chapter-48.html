                <p>**Sarah**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I stirred awake, the room enveloped me in a shroud of darkness, leaving me momentarily disoriented. Recollections trickled back, reminding me of my recent journey with Philip to this hotel, shadowed by Jessica&#39;s persistent pursuit in her unmistakable pink vehicle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My gaze fell upon Philip, seated on the couch as I exited the bedroom. A dim light illuminated his figure, casting shadows that danced across his troubled features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Is he drinking?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heavy with sorrow, his eyes met mine as I approached, his silent inquiry hanging palpably in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why keep the truth from me?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion clouded my thoughts, grappling with the weight of his accusation. &#34;What truth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He responded to my inquiry about the baby, our child, the infant I had been grieving for until this moment. As I sifted through memories, myriad thoughts crossed my mind, but one remained etched in my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you know? You saw my pregnancy report, Philip! You even asked your mother&#34; My voice quivered as the weight of the past threatened to suffocate me once more. How I was mercilessly taken to the clinic by Madam Cornell, the callous disregard for my maternal rights-they clawed at my consciousness, leaving me gasping for air, my vision blurred by tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah, I had no idea you were pregnant back then! I only learned about your miscarriage when we reconnected... But what baffled me is why you didn&#39;t tell the truth that very night you demanded a divorce! You should have told me then about the pregnancy!&#34; His voice grew louder, filling me with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at him, feeling a wave of disgust. &#34;How, Philip? You treated me like dirt, just like your parents! You led me on, accused me of deceit, inflicted pain for three years, betrayed me...&#34; Tears welled up as memories of the anguish at Serenity Pines flooded back. &#34;I witnessed you gifting Megan the sapphire necklace. I saw...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My voice faltered, stifled by the imminent cascade of tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You went to the restaurant?&#34; he asked, guilt evident in his expression. &#34;Let me explain, Sarah...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! The point is, you don&#39;t love me, Philip! So, how dare you cast doubt on my decision to seek a divorce then? I confronted you! And without a flicker of hesitation, you coldly affirmed that there&#39;s no love between us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip stood there, utterly dumbfounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My chest constricted, tears streaming down my face uncontrollably. &#34;How dare you, Philip?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My vision blurred, darkness encroaching as anger fueled my sobs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip approached me tentatively and then pulled me into a hesitant embrace. &#34;Are you alright, Sarah?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head, gasping for air. &#34;I-I can&#39;t breathe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s your medicine?&#34; he asked urgently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; I had to resist. I needed to see Josh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip scooped me and gently carried me to the couch. I nestled into his embrace, settling onto his lap as he cradled me close, my head finding refuge against his steady heartbeat. I surrendered to his touch, finding a moment of peace in the familiar scent of his clothes, letting his presence soothe the turmoil within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry...&#34; Philip whispered multiple times, his hand soothingly running through my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip&#39;s apologies failed to ease my mind. The truth is, I crave independence. I want to achieve success on my terms. I long to retaliate against those who harmed my baby! I want them to experience the pain that haunted my heart, hoping that by doing so, the ache and agony I&#39;ve endured for a year might finally begin to fade away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stirred awake, roused by the soft morning light seeping through the curtains. Unsure of the hour, I found myself still cradled in Philip&#39;s embrace, which surprised me; I hadn&#39;t realized I had drifted off in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pang of sorrow washed over me. The conversation from the night before yielded one certainty-Philip remained unaware of the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At one time, I wouldn&#39;t have been shocked if Madame Cornell had painted Philip as the villain, the one seeking harm for our baby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;That old woman!&#39; I muttered, my eyes narrowing with determination. &#39;She has to pay.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing up slowly, I adjusted my robe, casting a fleeting glance at Philip, who was still peacefully asleep on the couch. After a quick freshening up, I emerged from the bathroom to find Philip still on the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Approaching the table laden with food, my stomach growling with hunger. At that moment, I didn&#39;t care about the flavors or whether the dishes were still as delicious as before. All that mattered was satiating the gnawing emptiness inside me. I reached for the garlic bread, hastily tearing off a piece and stuffing it into my mouth. Along with it, I grabbed three extra cookies, craving the comfort they promised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peeking outside the suite, I spotted Trey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Madam?&#34; Trey&#39;s surprise was evident as he saw me emerging in just a robe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I offered no response, instead choosing to quietly close the door behind me as I walked down the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you going?&#34; Trey persisted, trailing after me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To my car,&#34; I replied tersely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With that attire?&#34; Trey&#39;s concern was palpable as he glanced back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trey, I&#39;m no longer Philip&#39;s wife. You don&#39;t need to watch over me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite my protest, Philip&#39;s bodyguard persisted in following me down to the parking lot, and I relented. After all, Philip&#39;s staff mirrored his annoying nature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scanned the lot, hunting for my parked car amidst the sea of vehicles. Trey remained steadfast in his pursuit. His unwavering dedication to fulfilling his boss&#39;s directives added to the mounting pressure throbbing in my temples.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nevertheless, I chose to brush aside his presence. As I slipped into the driver&#39;s seat, Trey desperately attempted to detain me, his imposing figure blocking the driveway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Madam Sarah, please! I&#39;ll be in trouble with the boss if you leave without his knowledge!&#34; he pleaded, his voice tinged with urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell your boss to go to hell!&#34; I snapped sharply, inching the car forward. &#34;Trey, believe me, I won&#39;t hesitate to drive right over you if you don&#39;t move!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From his expression, it was evident that he was indifferent to the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unbelievable!&#34; I sighed in exasperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, Madam Sarah, at least let me accompany you. I&#39;ll take the blame if the boss gets upset. Besides, you won&#39;t even notice me following you. Please...&#34; Trey persisted, adopting a tone of desperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine! Get in!&#34; I relented, annoyed by the tactics employed by Philip&#39;s bodyguards. They always play the sympathy card with me, as if I&#39;m responsible for their boss&#39;s bothersome behavior!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trey stepped aside from blocking the driveway and settled into the passenger seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ugh, annoying,&#34; I grumbled, shaking my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All I wanted was a moment of peace without Philip. I drove towards Apartment Number 5.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I exited my car after I parked in front of my rented residence, Jessica swiftly approached me, catching me off guard as I hadn&#39;t noticed her pink car. Did she wait for me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The corners of her eyes shadowed with intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re really a slut!&#34; she accused sharply because I donned a hotel robe. &#34;Who were you with last night, huh?&#34; she demanded, her voice strained with jealousy and anger.  &#34;You won&#39;t escape what you did to me at my wedding! You&#39;ll see how ugly things can get, you ugly bitch!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could even react, she hurled the contents of her bottle in my direction, the liquid inside splattering dangerously.</p>
