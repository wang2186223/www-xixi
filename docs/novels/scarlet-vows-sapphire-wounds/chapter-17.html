                <p>**Philip**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah, my ex-wife, is now entangled with Bronn Martin. From Amir Benner to a computer software developer, she seems to have a penchant for wealthy men, a fact that stirs a deep-seated fury within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She still retains a youthful allure, with her sophisticated, wavy brown hair cascading down her back. It struck me that she is now twenty-three, no longer the young teenager who once stood beside me in marriage. Her skin seemed to radiate under the gentle washroom lighting, and she was draped in a seductive dark dress that tempted sinful thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been trying to locate you for a year. After hiding away in Dubai, I never anticipated finding you here. I even resorted to financial means, yet received no leads. Are you growing weary of Amir Benner now that he&#39;s set to marry, thus turning your attention to Bronn Martin?&#34; I questioned sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah&#39;s expression remained impassive as she washed her hands, her response devoid of emotion. &#34;I no longer have ties to you, Mr. Cornell. There&#39;s nothing I recall needing to discuss or explain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury ignited within me, propelling me forward as I closed the distance between us. With a forceful grip, I seized her chin, commanding her attention, and pressed her back against the sink. A torrent of desire surged through my veins, an unstoppable wave crashing against my senses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have I not made it clear, Sarah, that you are mine?&#34; I murmured. I could already feel the softness of her plump lips against mine, her piercing gray gaze locked onto me with unwavering intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah arched her eyebrow at the remark, her tone tinged with skepticism. &#34;Are you finished with your jokes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Cornell, you don&#39;t have ownership over me, and whoever I choose to be with is none of your business. Whatever was between us is over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her rationale struck me like a lightning bolt in a storm, sending shockwaves of frustration rippling through my core. I hadn&#39;t considered the possibility of losing her, nor did I anticipate the sting of her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mere thought of her in Bronn Martin&#39;s arms set ablaze a tempest of fury within me. With eyes tightly shut, I drew a deep breath, drinking in the fragrance of her neck that I grasped firmly, yet finding myself shivering at the familiarity of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You belong to me, Sarah. You shouldn&#39;t let other men lay their hands on you!&#34; I claimed, sinking my teeth into her skin to leave a mark before soothing it with my tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me go!&#34; she hissed, struggling against my grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I refused. Instead, I seized her lips forcefully! In that electrifying moment, it felt as if every ounce of longing I had harbored for so long was unleashed, flooding my senses with a hunger I could barely contain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though my desire to claim her then and there was overwhelming, I was forced to restrain myself, unwilling to hurt her in the process.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remained still after her struggle, no longer the Sarah I once knew-the Sarah etched in my memory. I paused, halting my advance to kiss her; instead, I locked my eyes with her as our heated breaths mingled in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you done?&#34; She coolly brushed her fingertips across her lips. &#34;Mr. Philip Cornell, I know you&#39;re h0rny, but it seems you&#39;ve forgotten that our marriage is over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly grin curled upon my lips. Pressing my body against hers, I felt my hardened groin, yearning for the touch of her pvssy beneath the fabric. Damn it! Perhaps my yearning for Sarah had intensified during her year-long absence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I yearned for her with an insatiable hunger before, that craving has transformed into an inferno of desire, raging fiercely within me, burning brighter with each passing moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A mere dissolution of marriage doesn&#39;t even bother me. It&#39;s just a piece of shit! So, you must remember this, babe. You. Belong. To me!&#34; I growled each fvcking word, gripping her chin firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made sure she understood every word I said! Sarah used to be a submissive wife, and I still expected her to submit to my words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my dismay, she sneered, brushing off invisible dirt from my shoulder before retorting, &#34;I never took you for a whiner like a baby, Philip. I won&#39;t apologize for owning my body! My body, my rules!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a forceful shove and a disdainful sneer, she propelled me backward, her eyes blazing with defiance as she strolled towards the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My senses reeled in disbelief, a tempest of fury rising within me as I stood there, abandoned and seething with rage!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That must be the real her, without a doubt! She discarded her mask, revealing her true self. Unsure whether I appreciate it or not, but the mere thought of her in the arms of another man ignites a fury within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dialing Alex&#39;s number, I implored, &#34;Sarah is here in Henderson! Get every detail on her whereabouts, Alex. I don&#39;t want any more mistakes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Consider it done, boss!&#34; came Alex&#39;s prompt reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After regaining composure, I returned to the restaurant table to find Megan already seated with Sarah and Bronn Martin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip, I&#39;m sorry. While you were in the washroom, I agreed to join Mr. Martin&#39;s table,&#34; Megan said with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Settling beside Megan and Sarah at the circular table, I observed Sarah&#39;s stoic demeanor as she continued to dine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s good to see you here in Nevada, Mr. Cornell,&#34; Bronn commented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re in town for Amir Benner&#39;s engagement and wedding, along with other business projects and events. I&#39;ve also been considering a visit to BM Technologies,&#34; I replied, the last part a spontaneous fabrication. In truth, I harbored a strong curiosity about Sarah&#39;s involvement at Bronn&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re invited to Amir&#39;s wedding, too?&#34; Sarah inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Amir?&#39; The inflection in her voice when she uttered that man&#39;s name carried a personal touch grated against my very soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curious about Sarah&#39;s attendance at Amir&#39;s wedding, I accepted the invitation on behalf of Luminary Productions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It seems we&#39;ll be crossing paths again at the engagement. Sarah and I will be attending,&#34; Bronn declared, his dazzling smile revealing teeth so perfect they seemed sculpted. At the same time, admiration danced in his eyes like sparkling stars for Sarah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clenched my fist. I didn&#39;t want to stir up trouble with Bronn, particularly since I required his help with the production I was organizing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, will you two be having a date at the wedding as well? And how did you and Sarah meet, Mr. Martin?&#34; Megan inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah lifted her gaze. &#34;I&#39;m Jakob&#39;s secretary, one of his game and security software engineers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah, interesting! It seems you&#39;re surrounded by men, Sarah. Maybe you&#39;ll find a new beau at BM Technologies,&#34; Megan teased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, Sarah&#39;s lips curved into a smile. &#34;Do you think so?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, did you try to seduce Mr. Martin, too?&#34; Megan asked bluntly. &#34;Oops, sorry! Sometimes, my tongue gets a little too sharp. I just thought of it because Mr. Martin seems to be quite wealthy and picky.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s implication was clear: Sarah was targeting wealthy men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her seemingly insulting remark, Sarah maintained her polished smile, giving the impression that she was unfazed. It appeared as though she wanted to challenge Megan. Yet, it was actually me who felt my blood boiling as I began to realize there might be something between the two of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shot Megan a warning glance instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an attempt to release the tension that had been building in my clenched hands, I reached for my wine glass, taking a sip of the crimson liquid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s quite the contrary, Ms. Megan,&#34; Bronn clarified. &#34;If that&#39;s the insinuation, it&#39;s actually Ms. Mitchell whom I&#39;m endeavoring to win over. She&#39;s stunning and intelligent. Perhaps my years of singleness have led me to this realization. Maybe she&#39;s destined to be my wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I felt my anger simmering beneath the surface, I distracted myself by placing some chicken wings on Sarah&#39;s plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eat more,&#34; I encouraged her, noticing she had been sticking to salad despite the variety of dishes available. After sharing three years of intimacy, I&#39;ve become intimately familiar with Sarah&#39;s body, and I couldn&#39;t help but notice the subtle shifts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; Sarah murmured, accepting the gesture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s expression soured while Bronn furrowed his brows, clearly intrigued by my actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks for the gesture, Mr. Cornell. You must have a good relationship with Sarah,&#34; Bronn commented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s probably just concerned because I&#39;m Jane&#39;s best friend,&#34; Sarah replied before turning to me. &#34;Anyway, Brother Philip, others might mistake me for your date. Aren&#39;t you going to offer Megan some chicken wings, too? It&#39;s best not to make her jealous, especially when there&#39;s no reason for it. Megan, don&#39;t worry, as Jane&#39;s brother, Philip is firmly off my prospective lover&#39;s list.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have a list?&#34; I exclaimed, feeling my anger flare. Sarah&#39;s words were like a lit match to gasoline. I could feel the urge to bite back at her sharp tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brother Philip, it&#39;s just a joke. I wouldn&#39;t want Mr. Martin thinking I actually keep a list of prospective lovers,&#34; she said with a smile directed at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan glanced at me, sensing my irritation, and her eyes started to well up with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rose from my seat. &#34;I believe Megan has lost her appetite. We&#39;ll be heading out.&#34; Retrieving some bills from my wallet, I placed them on the table. &#34;Here&#39;s our portion of the bill.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah&#39;s comment cut through the air. &#34;Why not grab some takeout, Brother Philip? You&#39;ve already covered your part of the meal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning in closely to Sarah, I made sure my words were delivered in a gentle whisper. &#34;If there&#39;s anything I&#39;d like to &#39;take out,&#39; it&#39;s certainly not the food, babe! So, perhaps reconsider your suggestion!&#34;</p>
