                <p>**Sarah**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip pulled me into his private office and pressed me against the door, his lips crashing onto mine in a passionate kiss. His hands gripped my shoulders, holding me firmly in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip, hang on!&#34; I protested, but he ignored me. He scooped me up effortlessly, setting me down on his grand table, my legs dangling off the edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip! Stop!&#34; I said, pushing him away and getting off the table. I moved far from his spot. &#34;I didn&#39;t come here for you to flirt with me. Tsk!&#34; I hadn&#39;t even recovered from Jane asking for my help with her marriage when I was immediately faced with a new challenge from Madam Olsen. And now, here was Philip with his flirtations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, I just couldn&#39;t help myself after seeing you. So, what brings you here?&#34; he asked with a flirtatious tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came here about Jane! Is it true that she&#39;s set to get married this weekend?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip sighed wearily. &#34;Yes, the decision was rather sudden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you agree to marry her off to the Olsens? Is Madam Olsen here to discuss their marriage? You know how she treats people; is that the kind of person you want in your family?&#34; I demanded, unable to hide my frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised a hand, trying to calm me. &#34;Sarah, I can&#39;t do anything about it. The Olsens are providing significant funds for the project we&#39;re working on now. Moreover, Jane stands to gain considerably from the marriage. That&#39;s what we discussed this afternoon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what do the Olsens get in return? Surely, their family wouldn&#39;t agree without gaining some benefits from yours,&#34; I said, staring intently at Philip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jane&#39;s role would involve caring for David Olsen&#39;s two children, who currently reside in New York. Madam Olsen wanted Jane to be her grandchildren&#39;s stepmother. But Jane can still manage some of her own affairs even if she&#39;s with the Olsens. I&#39;ll make sure she can continue her job,&#34; he replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip&#39;s words hit me like a ton of bricks. &#34;So, you&#39;re the one who made all these decisions for Jane?&#34; My frustration bubbled up, impossible to conceal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched as Philip&#39;s expression tightened. &#34;I&#39;m just trying to do what&#39;s best for my sister,&#34; he muttered, his jaw clenched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you know this isn&#39;t what Jane wants! Do you want her to end up like me, leaving everything behind when she gets married? Do you want her stuck in the Olsen household, tending to the children and her husband? And then, you expect everything to be okay because Jane can get financial support if needed?&#34; I couldn&#39;t contain my outrage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had misjudged Philip. I thought this insensitive, self-absorbed prick understood my complaints and the anguish I went through in my own disastrous marriage. But he&#39;s just as clueless and insensitive as every other man, willing to sacrifice his sister&#39;s happiness for money and status. He seemed determined to stick to his agenda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip attempted to approach me, but I refused to listen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! This is all about you and your selfish interests!&#34; I spat venomously. With a sharp exhale, I pushed past Philip&#39;s office door, the frustration simmering beneath my skin. Returning to my desk, I buried myself in work throughout the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was too disgusted to even speak with my ex-husband right now. He kept bombarding me with messages, but I couldn&#39;t be bothered to read his predictable string of pathetic apologies and feeble excuses-I simply ignored him!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All I knew was that Philip was bound for Los Angeles tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After wrapping up work, I swiftly secured a ticket to Dubai, driven by a dual desire: to seek answers and to create some distance from Philip. Amir sought refuge there, escaping the fallout and scrutiny following his tumultuous wedding to Jessica. He needed a break from prying eyes, and I needed to confer with my grandfather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Approaching Jane, I handed her the keys to the villa. &#34;Loves, I won&#39;t be returning to Amir&#39;s villa for the time being. You&#39;ll take care of it. I have pressing matters to attend to tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She furrowed her brow. &#34;Is Brother Philip accompanying you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; If only she knew I didn&#39;t want to see her brother right now. &#34;It&#39;s related to my job. Please don&#39;t tell your brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane nodded, though still looking perplexed. When I returned to my workstation, I noticed one of the editorial team members eyeing me curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going on a trip?&#34; she inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. You can send me a message if there are any issues,&#34; I replied, brushing off her scrutiny and focusing on my impending departure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I headed towards the airport, a white van trailed behind me. I made a turn at a corner, and the van seemed to disappear. Maybe I was imagining things. Perhaps that van wasn&#39;t really after me. But just as I thought that it reappeared behind me after several turns, matching my speed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tires protested against the asphalt with a piercing screech as I pressed harder on the accelerator, the engine roaring in response. Adrenaline surged through me, mingling with the sweat that trickled down my forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are these people?&#34; I murmured to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wanting to shake off the van, I veered away from the airport&#39;s direction. I wouldn&#39;t let them catch me if they had ill intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a massive motorcycle blocked my path, its rider strategically obstructing my way. Panic surged through me as I slammed on the brakes, narrowly avoiding a collision. My eyes widened in horror as the rider brandished a gun aimed in my direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit!&#34; I cursed under my breath, paralyzed with fear as I awaited my fate. But before I could comprehend the situation, the gunman fired, targeting the van behind me. Shock rendered me speechless as I witnessed the van swerve off course, narrowly escaping the bullet&#39;s path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gunman, without a word, lowered his weapon and swiftly departed, leaving me bewildered and shaken. Glancing back, I noticed some of the van&#39;s occupants disembarking, seizing the opportunity to make my escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I drove on, the gravity of the situation weighed heavily on my mind. Heart pounding, I struggled to understand the chaos around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;What the heck is going on?&#39; I wondered, struggling to make sense of the bizarre events that had just unfolded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite feeling paranoid and anxious, I tried to regain my composure, reminding myself I was cutting it close for my trip to Dubai.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Who were those people, and why were they after me?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While I waited at the boarding area, my pulse quickened as my cellphone rang, revealing Philip&#39;s face on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, what does he want now?&#34; I muttered, answering the call with a curt &#34;Hello?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Woman, where are you? Trey said you&#39;re missing.&#34; Philip&#39;s voice bristled with impatience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip, you&#39;re annoying! I have a trip, alright?&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where? Are you leaving after abandoning your job at the office? Do you think you can just do anything? Leave whenever you want?&#34; he accused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about you? Do you think you can meddle in someone else&#39;s life? You&#39;re stressing me, and that&#39;s why I&#39;m taking my leave! Listen, I don&#39;t want to disrupt your editorial team. They know what they&#39;re doing.&#34; I shot back, feeling the weight of his expectations suffocating me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Philip&#39;s editorial team was just irritated with me and didn&#39;t understand my role there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My role is to ensure that Chronografix has no problems and works fine. I have another job.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, because your job is to ensure I&#39;ll see you every day, and you leaving town doesn&#39;t make sense at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was left speechless, anger boiling beneath the surface. &#34;You&#39;re a pervert! Do you realize how inappropriate you sound?&#34; I snapped, drawing puzzled glances from those nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the situation could escalate further, I abruptly ended the call, opting to avoid a scene. While waiting, my thoughts drifted to the events of the evening. Who was the mysterious individual who came to my rescue on the motorcycle? And who were the occupants of that white van? Is my safety now at risk?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then there&#39;s Madam Olsen. Is her resemblance to my mother merely coincidental, or is there something more to it?</p>
