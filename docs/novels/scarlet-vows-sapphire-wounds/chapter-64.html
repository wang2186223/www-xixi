                <p>**Philip**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the meeting, I was taken aback to find my mother waiting for me. I initially thought she was scheming to stir up trouble for Sarah again. However, her words took me by surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Son, are you busy? I wanted to invite you to have dinner,&#34; Mother stated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m always busy, Mother,&#34; I muttered as I reviewed one document. &#34;But I&#39;m fine with dinner tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had my reasons for wanting to talk to her, so I agreed to accompany her. Some matters needed to be clarified, secrets that had come to light, especially concerning Sarah and her involvement. She needed to know what I had discovered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t neglect yourself. You&#39;ve been so preoccupied that we don&#39;t get to talk properly. We don&#39;t see each other anymore. You&#39;re often on trips, and I have also heard Sarah is staying at Mr. Benner&#39;s villa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remained silent in the presence of my mother. At that moment, delving into a conversation was not on my agenda. My focus was tethered to my work, and I had no intention of allowing anything to disturb that precarious balance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip, I talked with the Langston couple. They will support you if you challenge your dad for the chairman position.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, maybe you understand that it&#39;s only been a year since I took over as president, which almost wouldn&#39;t happen if Uncle hadn&#39;t cheated in his job.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip, I&#39;m doing this for your good!&#34; she exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed my mother probably thought she could still manipulate me like a schoolboy. My mood soured. The notion of enduring dinner and remaining in Mom&#39;s company until then was utterly intolerable; I&#39;d rather exchange bickering with Sarah than subject myself to another moment with Mother. So, I enlisted Alex&#39;s help to secure a restaurant reservation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across from Luminary Productions, we saw Jane and Sarah eating simple sandwiches at the convenience store. I met Sarah&#39;s eyes, but her gaze was locked on my mother, who squinted in their direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mom silently warred against Sarah, still seeing her as the vulnerable woman I&#39;d married. But my Sarah had changed drastically in a year, which confused me, as I thought I&#39;d hate that change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s voice interrupted as Mom&#39;s car rumbled to a stop by the wide exit door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Madam Cornell!&#34; Megan called out, catching both my and my mother&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mom&#39;s face lit up momentarily before she expressed concern, &#34;Oh, dear! I heard your villa burned down. How&#39;s the investigation going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan glanced in my direction before replying, &#34;The investigation is ongoing. I&#39;m thankful to Philip for graciously accommodating me at Serenity Pines Estate for the time being.&#34; She then turned to my mother with a warm smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mother muttered, &#34;Just let me know if you need anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I yearned for my mother to exhibit such kindness in Sarah&#39;s company. Yet, in light of her actions towards Sarah, it felt like a distant dream beyond the realm of possibility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a heavy heart, I stole another glance at the convenience store, finding Sarah&#39;s gaze unyielding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Madam Cornell, hearing about my helper&#39;s passing was truly heartbreaking,&#34; Megan replied softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since you&#39;re staying with Philip, why not join us for dinner?&#34; my mother insisted, placing a comforting hand on Megan&#39;s shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, I&#39;d prefer it if it were just the two of us for dinner tonight,&#34; I interjected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Philip! Megan has been through so much already. She needs our support. Despite everything, she still attended your meeting and helped with your project,&#34; my mother urged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated, torn between wanting a private conversation with my mother and recognizing her point. The nurse&#39;s revelation about Megan visiting Sarah in the hospital last year added to my uncertainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s eyes pleaded with me, silently begging my understanding. &#34;Please, Philip. I don&#39;t have anyone to share a meal with tonight, and knowing you&#39;re not there would only add to my sadness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about him, Megan. Come join us for dinner,&#34; my mother insisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine! Let&#39;s go,&#34; I agreed, trying to appear indifferent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? Can I? Thank you, Philip and Madam Cornell! Your presence makes me feel like I have my mom back,&#34; Megan said, her voice catching with emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I led them to the van, where they could chat during the ride. And when I glanced back at Sarah, her chilling gesture-her thumb drawn across her throat-indicating a clear warning: &#39;You&#39;re dead!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This woman! What fresh hell has she conjured this time? What have I committed? I reached for my phone and fired off a message: See you later, babe!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had the nerve to ignore it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the restaurant, I swirled my wine glass absentmindedly as Mom and Megan engaged in conversation. The atmosphere felt dull but suffocating, and an overwhelming urge to escape washed over me with each passing word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip, seriously, when are you going to marry Megan? You&#39;re both available now. She&#39;s just waiting for you,&#34; Mom pressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crimson bloomed across Megan&#39;s cheeks in a shameful blush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, maybe you forgot, but Megan left and found someone else. We&#39;re not together anymore,&#34; I interjected casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan nearly choked. &#34;I thought you&#39;d moved on from that, Philip.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what of Sarah? Did she not betray you in equal measure by taking another lover?&#34; Mom&#39;s relentless interrogation persisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a voice from behind caught us off guard. &#34;Tsk, tsk, Madam Cornell, I didn&#39;t expect you to discuss me when I&#39;m not present. But please, don&#39;t compare me with Megan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned around to find Sarah standing there, a hint of mischief in her eyes. Jane trailed behind her, my sister&#39;s expression a silent declaration of innocence as if to say, &#39;I&#39;m just along for the ride.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you two here?!&#34; Megan snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jane and I were craving steak! But even from blocks away, the reek of, ahem, strong old folks, collagen-starved hags assaulted our nostrils. And then I heard my name being talked about. I figured it was this lovely bunch who love talking shit!&#34; Sarah explained with a smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-! Philip, please ask that woman to leave,&#34; my mother demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Madam, getting angrier won&#39;t smooth out those wrinkles. Relax, take it easy&#34; Sarah retorted. &#34;By the way, what&#39;s on the menu? I&#39;m famished after that meeting.&#34; She turned to me expectantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait, hadn&#39;t I seen her munching on a sandwich earlier?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m craving these scallops!&#34; Sarah declared, popping one into her mouth without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really lack manners! Philip, do something!&#34; My mother&#39;s voice rose, drawing attention from nearby diners. She was making a scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or I shall simply take my leave of this terrible place!&#34; My mother threatened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah just smirked, seemingly unfazed by my mother&#39;s theatrics. At that moment, I had an overwhelming urge to seize those mocking lips with my own and put the insolent woman in her place. I shook my head to dispel the thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip, Sarah&#39;s behavior spoils our meal,&#34; Megan chimed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whaaat? What have I done now? Megan, you&#39;ve accused me several times already,&#34; Sarah shot back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mother stood abruptly, tossing the napkin onto the table. &#34;I&#39;ve lost my appetite!&#34; With that, she grabbed her purse and glanced at me. &#34;If they want to stay, let&#39;s find another place!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She noticed my lack of movement. Would I be a neglectful son if I didn&#39;t escort her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Madam Cornell,&#34; Sarah called out loudly, raising my wineglass mockingly as Mother began her dramatic exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mother turned to listen as Sarah continued speaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Philip&#39;s former secretary paid me a visit earlier, just so you&#39;re aware, and your name came up,&#34; Sarah said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mother gritted her teeth, her gaze darkening as it fixed on me. &#34;I&#39;m taking action for your sake, Philip! That includes removing that woman from your life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rose from my chair, unable to endure the weight in my chest any longer, the relentless question echoing unanswered within me. &#34;What about the removal of my child, Mother? Is that for my sake or yours, because you favor Megan for me? Well, I refuse to entertain the notion any longer!&#34; I snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan and my mother gasped in disbelief. I raised my voice, the frustration boiling over. &#34;Did you ever stop to consider if I wanted any of the things you&#39;ve done, Mother?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mother&#39;s jaw clenched, her hands knotting into claws. &#34;That woman is bad for you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re acting out of self-interest, Madam! Karma&#39;s a bitch!&#34; Sarah declared, a sly smile tugging at the corners of her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mother could do nothing more than turn on her heel and storm from the restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t shake the nagging feeling if I were truly safeguarding Sarah or if her facade merely blinded me. She carries herself with such poise, but perhaps it&#39;s all an illusion.</p>
