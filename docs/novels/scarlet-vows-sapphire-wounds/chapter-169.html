            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>**Jane**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jane!&#34; Brody&#39;s voice echoed through the hallway, making me freeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh no! He was really here. My heart raced as I approached the door and peeked through the peephole. Brody was on the other side, his broad shoulders filling the frame. His usual neat look was a bit messy-his necktie was crooked, his top button undone, and a hint of stubble darkened his jaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Should I open the door?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you&#39;re there, Jane,&#34; he said, his voice low and steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath, I slowly turned the lock. The click felt loud in the quiet. When the door opened, our eyes met, and the months apart vanished instantly. Brody&#39;s eyes scanned my face, lingering on my swollen eyes that showed I&#39;d been crying. I saw a mix of emotions pass over his face: concern, guilt, and something more intense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, he stepped inside. The scent of his cologne enveloped me as he pushed the heavy oak door closed with his foot. Before I could gather my thoughts, his hands cupped my face, thumbs gently stroking my cheekbones. Then his lips were on mine, urgent and demanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kiss broke down all my defenses. We had kept a careful distance for two long years, meeting only casually during my rare visits to the city. He&#39;d asked about my life and work and offered me quiet support through Sarah&#39;s coma, but we had never allowed ourselves this intense, desperate connection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve missed you so damn much!&#34; he murmured between kisses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brody&#34; I tried to protest, questions burning on my tongue. I wanted to ask about the woman in his apartment and why he was kissing me now. But my body betrayed me, arching into his touch, craving the familiar planes of his chest and his arms&#39; strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait&#34; I managed, struggling for clarity. &#34;We should-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Later. I need this. I need you!&#34; His eyes were pleading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My resolution crumbled. Alright, we&#39;ll talk later!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As his lips trailed fire down my neck, I lost myself in the intoxicating blend of his touch, the lingering sadness in my heart, and the rekindling of what I&#39;d thought was lost forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, tangled in Brody&#39;s arms, I felt more alive than I had in two years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When consciousness slowly returned the following day, I became acutely aware of the delicious soreness permeating my body. My hips and thighs ached most satisfyingly, a testament to the passion we&#39;d shared. I couldn&#39;t help but smile. Brody had always been gentle, but he was a beast to be reckoned with in bed. I had to admit, I missed him terribly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had tried to move on, to love someone else and date other people, but deep down, it was always Brody I truly wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up entirely when I noticed he wasn&#39;t in bed. Sitting up and clutching the sheet, I looked around the room. My eyes landed on my discarded panties. I reached for it out of habit, but when I saw its state, they were beyond saving from our wild reunion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I stood there holding the damaged underwear, the bathroom door swung open, and Brody emerged, wrapped in nothing but a towel around his waist. Droplets of water clung to his broad chest, tracing tantalizing paths down his abs. I swallowed hard, my mouth suddenly dry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi,&#34; he said with a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uhm&#34; I struggled to find my words. I needed to say something. &#34;D-do you think this is inappropriate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The corners of his mouth lifted slightly. &#34;Perhaps. But I feel like this is the most perfect thing that&#39;s happened to me since our divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the thing, Brody, we&#39;re exes! This doesn&#39;t change that fact.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sweetheart, that&#39;s not what you made me feel last night. You moaned my name so loudly it felt like the whole of London could hear how much you enjoyed it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My cheeks flushed immediately, and I tried to muster anger. &#34;You&#39;re an ass!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved closer, perching on the edge of the bed. &#34;I can&#39;t take this anymore, sweetheart. I did everything I could and gave you what you wanted. I even tried to make it up to you like you asked. Let&#39;s stop this. Two years is too long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You hurt me and I was so afraid, Brody.&#34; My tears began to flow uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, sweetheart I deeply regret how I treated you before I was an idiot, Jane. Men... we don&#39;t always understand. We&#39;re not like the perfect husbands in romance novels who always know exactly what their wives think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sniffled, wanting to hold onto my anger but feeling it slip away with each passing moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We were always lost. We test the waters before diving in because we struggle to read women&#39;s emotions. I&#39;m not generalizing all men, but that&#39;s how it was for me back then. I thought showing you my love, even if I didn&#39;t say it outright, would be enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t blame other men! You&#39;re the only idiot here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded. &#34;I agree! I gave you space because I couldn&#39;t bear the thought of you hating me,&#34; Brody continued his thumb gently wiping away a tear that had escaped. &#34;And I needed to face the consequences of my actions. To become someone worthy of your love again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you still love me, Brody?&#34; I asked softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course I do!&#34; he answered without hesitation, his gaze never wavering from mine. &#34;Last night, it nearly drove me mad thinking I might lose you again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit my lip and looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have to admit. The woman you saw at the penthouse was my date last night. She&#39;s the daughter of a business partner who asked me to meet her, as she&#39;s quite taken with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman I&#39;d glimpsed was undeniably stunning, the kind of beauty that turned heads wherever she went. And Brody... well, he was Brody. Successful, charming, and devastatingly handsome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt like damaged goods. I had wandered through a dark world, made choices I wasn&#39;t proud of, and even betrayed Sarah in a moment of weakness. Compared to her, it seemed unlikely that Brody would ever choose me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I tried to have a romantic relationship with her, and I invited her to the penthouse to give a document to his father. I wanted to avoid any rumors if someone saw us at the hotel or outside. But when I brought her there, can you believe it? You were the one on my mind. I excused myself briefly to regain my composure and figure out what to do. And that&#39;s when I saw you at the elevator, Jane.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing those words from Brody was painful, especially when I realized I couldn&#39;t love anyone but him. But we had both been lost for two years, and I couldn&#39;t hold that against him. I had dated other men, too, trying to find a connection elsewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I panicked, especially knowing I had a visitor at that time. I immediately thought about the last day you stayed at the penthouse and saw Sonia then. But this time, I could only think that I couldn&#39;t let you slip away. Not again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed hard, finding the courage to ask the question gnawing at me. &#34;D-do you like her? The woman from last night?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s attractive, I&#39;ll admit. But she&#39;s not you, Jane.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wiped away my tears. &#34;When you left the penthouse, I nearly lost my mind trying to find you,&#34; he said. &#34;And then, seeing you with swollen eyes, I knew I was the one who made you cry again. That&#39;s when I realized we need to resolve our issues.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brody took my hands, his touch sending a familiar spark through me. &#34;Give me a chance, sweetheart. Please One last chance to make things right between us&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must always take care of me from now on!&#34; I exclaimed, raising with a hint of playful demand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, sweetheart,&#34; Brody replied calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I continued, &#34;And you mustn&#39;t worry me! No more inviting random beauties to our penthouse!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled softly, mistaking my concern for jealousy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And,&#34; I hesitated before voicing my desires, &#34;I want to get pregnant, Brody. Do you want to be a father?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We&#39;d never discussed this subject before during our marriage. I didn&#39;t even know if Brody wanted children. But seeing Philip&#39;s twins had awakened a longing in me I couldn&#39;t ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brody&#39;s smile grew wider. &#34;Do you have any idea how tasty you look right now, talking about babies?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My cheeks flushed. &#34;I&#39;m serious!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved closer. &#34;Who said I&#39;m not? Jane, having a family with you... it&#39;s been one of my deepest wishes. Of course, I want to have a baby with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled at his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Any other wishes?&#34; he asked, his lips brushing my shoulder in a tender kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;None,&#34; I breathed. &#34;I... I love you, Brody.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gently caressed my cheek. &#34;As I love you, Jane. More than you could ever know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I realized how close I&#39;d come to losing all of this. That other woman might have won Brody&#39;s heart if I&#39;d delayed my return. The thought made me shudder. I didn&#39;t want to pretend anymore; I didn&#39;t want to hide behind walls of self-protection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah was right; chances should be given to those who truly deserve them, and Brody is one of those people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had given me a chance when I was lost and floundering in darkness. I didn&#39;t deserve him then, but he had cared for and loved me with a depth that overwhelmed me with its kindness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three months later, Brody and I renewed our vows. This time, there were no arrangements or contracts-just two people genuinely in love committing to a shared future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten months after that, I gave birth to our baby girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Brody&#39;s arms, with our daughter between us, I finally understood: home isn&#39;t a place; it&#39;s the people who love you unconditionally</p>
