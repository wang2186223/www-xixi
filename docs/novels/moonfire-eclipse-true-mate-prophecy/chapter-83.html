                <p>Over the last week of us living in our new home everything became pretty normal quickly, I&#39;ve had to stop giving my classes in the gym now it&#39;s becoming incredibly hard to endure with all the pressure now. I spend alot more time at home doing the pack paperwork and so on, to keep me busy but also because I can&#39;t really do much else, the girls visit every now and again when they know it&#39;s safe to do so .ie. when I&#39;m not too busy working or sleeping to keep myself rested for what&#39;s about to come. Lucas has also organised that someone be in the house with me all the times although they don&#39;t have to have eyes on me they are constantly there not to my surprise really. We finally managed to finish off the baby clothes shopping and to say the least theres alot of clothes along with gifts we had from everyone, I&#39;m ever so greatful for, with so many options out there for feeding I&#39;ve decided I want to try breast feeding as it&#39;s the most natural way and apparently gives them a better support to their immune system Lucas is just happy to go with the flow and doesn&#39;t mind helping when he needs to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Lucas we have a problem. Whats up? Are you and pup okay? Do you need to see mark? Stop panicking I&#39;m fine, I&#39;ve just recieved a a fax from Birchgrove they have received rogues turning up at the borders and had two attacks in the last week. Do you think?  yes Lucas I think jackson is trying to worm his way into the pack to make a larger army. What you thinking we should do? I think we should send over some warriors and keep all in close contact for now to ensure both packs safety. Okay I&#39;ll get on it and inform Evan to organise a number of warriors to join and possibly a highly trained warrior to give them so extra training. Thank you Lucas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All this nonsense is just making me more agitated and my blood pressure probably unstable. I should really try and relax more but someone has to organise all this. Perhaps I can find a mobile therapist to come give me a mani pedi to try and relax me a little before this little monkey makes an appearance. Suddenly I hear my front door opening sending me on edge after all this news, ***&#34;Hey Amelia you look like you seen a ghost&#34;*** Nikki insinuated ***&#34;sorry guys just had some news from Birchgrove they&#39;ve had rogues and attacks in the last week seems suspicious so I&#39;m kind of on edge and Lucas more so than me&#34;*** I sighed. ***&#34;I really think you need to stop with the pack work and just relax for the rest of your pregnancy it&#39;s not doing you any good getting stressed all the time&#34; &#34;I agree, maybe we can organise going to a spa or something to calm you&#34; &#34;if you think anyone is going to allow me from pack grounds you must be kidding, but I have been thinking of trying to find a mobile therapist to come give us all a mani pedi and just relax for abit, as for pack work, if I don&#39;t do it I&#39;ll only stress even more not knowing what&#39;s going on&#34; &#34;fair point your a stress head&#34;*** Libby giggled. ***&#34;I second that&#34; &#34;can&#39;t say I disagree either, but I like the organisation, anyway do either of you have any news?&#34; &#34;only that I&#39;ve passed my first assessment, looks like theres only another 2 then I&#39;m a nurse isn&#39;t that amazing?&#34; &#34; that is amazing, congrats girl, told you, you could do it if you set your mind to it&#34;*** Libby looked like she was beaming too ***&#34;I finally got Mark to accept me at a surgical intern, it&#39;s taken so long, I never gave up and finally it&#39;s paid off, Mat is so proud too.&#34; &#34;I bet you both are, everyone is starting to find their feet in the pack especially with me making more equalities woman are finally begining to feel like they can be themselves.&#34; &#34;true that&#34; &#34;I&#39;ll leave you get some rest, little princess don&#39;t keep us waiting forever, I&#39;ll ring around and see if we can get someone to come out and treat us, let us know if you need anything&#34; &#34;thanks girls I&#39;ll catch you inabit&#34;***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the girls left I managed to get a nap in, I&#39;m so exhausted. Realising it&#39;s getting on I better get on and do some dinner for us tonight, just a simple cottage pie will do for tonight. As I&#39;m mid preparing everything and set the oven on I get a link through from the warriors things arent looking good I guess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Amelia there&#39;s been another attack on the pack tonight, we managed to hold them off but we did lose some warriors but they are coming in with a stronger force, I think you need to consider keeping someone around at all times now. There usually is someone here but sometimes I just need a break, I&#39;ll speak with Lucas and see what we can come up with, has anyone sent a tracker out to see where they are based? No I&#39;ll get on it. I think a surprise attack on them could help our position we also need some survalliance on them first. No worries Luna we will get on it. Keep me updated Jake, thank you.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Things need to turn in our favour, maybe I can get in touch with another neighbouring pack or the Mayback pack for some assistance. Lucas enters the kitchen wrapping his arms around my waist resting his hands on my bump ***&#34;How are my two beautiful girls?&#34; &#34;We are okay, have you heard the latest?&#34; &#34;latest?&#34; &#34;I take it they haven&#39;t linked you knowing your reaction, there&#39;s been another attack at Birchgrove&#34; &#34;Why didn&#39;t anyone inform me?&#34; &#34;I&#39;ve only just found out myself, Jake linked me&#34; &#34;So what&#39;s the report?&#34; &#34;We lost a few warriors along with them, they ended up retreating, but they are coming in with stronger forces now, I&#39;ve ordered Jake to get some trackers on the case to find their hideout, and get a survalliance team to give me some info so we can decide how we want to proceed&#34; &#34;surprise attack, I guess it could work, is everyone masking?&#34; &#34;they know to mask either way&#34;*** Lucas has a face like thunder, I decide to proceed with dinner and leave him cool off, he&#39;s probably gonna get the boys over later to come up with a plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half way through dinner, Lucas just storms off, no idea what&#39;s got to him but I can&#39;t run around like this either way, it hurts to woddle around too much I giggle to myself. I decide I need to take mine and our pups protection into my own hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Trent are you able to do protection work for me and our princess until all this crap is over, I don&#39;t want to put my pups life at risk. Of course Amelia anything to keep you safe, when would you like me to start. In the morning will be fine I&#39;ll give you a briefing too. No worries I&#39;ll see you in the morning. Thanks Trent btw we are at Lucas&#39;s parents now.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that that&#39;s organised time to chill for the evening I think I&#39;ll make my tea and head up to bed, I can&#39;t wait up for Lucas or I&#39;ll be absolutely useless tomorrow, I&#39;m bad enough now I don&#39;t need to be falling asleep mid sorting out everything else, plus Lucas needs his space he&#39;s worrying about me and our pup now more than ever it&#39;s coming so close to the end of the pregnancy that I could go into labour anytime really.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tuck myself up into bed and grab a book from my nightstand to read while I wind down. I&#39;ve been on the same book for weeks now, just can&#39;t seem to keep track of it inbetween everything I can&#39;t concentrate and I&#39;m so tired I usually fall asleep reading, I don&#39;t really help myself. As I start flicking through pages after finishing off my tea, I find myself falling asleep so I put the book back on the nightstand and let myself drift into my dreams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Good Morning Amelia it&#39;s good to see you, you look like your just about ready&#34;*** Trent greeted me, happily. ***&#34;I am ready and fed up now, everything is swollen and achy, I can&#39;t wait for it to be over with.&#34; &#34;either way you look as amazing as ever, how&#39;s Lucas by the way haven&#39;t seen him in a while&#34; &#34;he&#39;s still in bed I have no idea when he got home last night, he went off after dinner. I found out the Birchgrove pack are having spontaneous attacks or rogues showing up wanting to join, by the strengths increasing by each attack&#34; &#34;So Lucas is in protection mode and avoiding contact I take it.&#34; &#34;something like that&#34;*** I sigh. ***&#34;you know he&#39;s doing it to keep you all safe&#34; &#34;I know but I hate it when he gets like this it&#39;s as if I don&#39;t exist.&#34; &#34;it will all work Amelia&#34;*** As he brings me into his embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the day passes along very slowly, Lucas had breakfast watched a little TV then headed out to training, he&#39;s abit better today but I can feel his stress and tension rising. I send over some healing which seems to help a little but he just goes out and leaves me with Trent. I just hope he doesn&#39;t do anything stupid. I make some phone calls one of our other neighbouring packs are keeping a look out as to any suspicious activity also Mayback are sending some warriors as they can&#39;t come themselves, due to commitments which is fair we didn&#39;t exactly give enough of time for them to prepare. Just glad they can send some reinforcements. As the dinner approaches I start to head to the paackhouse for dinner. I notice Trent trying to mind his business. Lucas gets back and indicated he&#39;s going to get ready and released Trent from his duties for the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;see you in the morning,&#34; yep see you in the morning, good night.***</p>
