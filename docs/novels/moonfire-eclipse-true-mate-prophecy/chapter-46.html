                <p>***&#34;Why are you shouting at me?&#34; &#34;Amelia I thought I lost you, dont not scare me like that again.&#34; &#34;why are you scared and why am I at the clinic?&#34;*** she looks at me confused ***&#34;Amelia you&#39;ve been in a coma for the last day and a half, I&#39;ve been going out my mind I&#39;m just glad your okay.&#34;***  she bows her head, ***&#34;it&#39;s okay my little Luna your awake now thats the main thing, how do you feel anyway beautiful?&#34; &#34;I actually feel great, like a new burst of energy has come over me, it&#39;s weird but I kinda like it.&#34;*** she does look radiant ***&#34;glad to hear it Amelia&#34;*** Mark&#39;s voice coming out of no where, ***&#34;you look bright as a button this afternoon, let&#39;s just check your vitals and perhaps you can go home if all is well I don&#39;t see the need to keep you here if your bouncing with energy, being in here isn&#39;t going to help that, your in good hands with Lucas&#34;*** I hope so but I do get overly paranoid so ***&#34;thank you Mark, you&#39;ve been amazing, how ever can I repay you&#34;*** feeling the need to offer him something for his support over the last month or so. ***&#34;You don&#39;t need to pay me anything, there&#39;s no better payment than see you you both happy and know there is nothing I wouldn&#39;t do for you and our spectacular Luna.&#34; &#34;We are truly grateful for your care and support Mark, we owe you big for this.&#34;*** Amelia smiled warmly. ***&#34;The only thing you owe me is making sure I&#39;m alerted to your abilities and if there&#39;s anything you need from me I&#39;m more than happy to help.&#34; &#34;she wouldn&#39;t be able to hide from you anyway she may get abit eccentric and scream it out&#34;*** Amelia showing a pouty face  ***&#34;you have a fair point there Lucas, now you two love birds run along and enjoy the evening together.&#34;*** We thank Mark once again and head back to the packhouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;First things first I need a shower I need to get rid of this hospital smell off me&#34; &#34;you smell divine to me beautiful but as you wish, I will have to get back to work tomorrow so Trent will be back and I&#39;ve asked Nikki to come see you for abit tomorrow you two can have a girly catch up&#34;*** Amelia looking all excited to have some company ***&#34;Tonight me and you are going to chill out with an extra large pizza and a movie, plus I also need to go over a few things with you for Mateo&#39;s birthday next week.&#34;*** Amelia&#39;s eyes piercing me ***&#34;hold on why wasn&#39;t I aware of this before?&#34; &#34;honestly I forgot too until Nathan reminded me the other day&#34;*** I muttered apologetically with my hand scratching my head. ***&#34;Well looks like were going to have to get things organised pretty quick.&#34;*** Amelia clearly frustrated ***&#34;yeh and to add to that Mateo wants to find his mate but I can&#39;t be sure how we&#39;re going to pull that off with the security we need to hold up, unless she&#39;s in this pack&#34; &#34;we will worry about that at the time but we can&#39;t give a definite time on when he finds his mate anyway.&#34;*** thats what hurts me, I found mine early and she&#39;s the best thing that happened to me, my Amelia, I would still be waiting another 6 weeks so I just nod. ***&#34;you order pizza and whatever else needs to be sorted and jump in the shower won&#39;t be long.&#34;*** She was right about one thing she really is bouncing with energy, I think I like the energetic Amelia perhaps that&#39;s what was missing from her all along and her body trying to store as much as possible in order to keep it for when it was needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia sat in her corner, demolishing pizza and drinking coke, I remind Amelia gently ***&#34;party plans&#34; &#34;sorry been trying to work it out,&#34;*** looking at me apologetic, I could never be mad at her, those goddess golden eyes they seem to illuminate more than they did before too, completely hypnotising. ***&#34;what&#39;s your ideas?&#34; &#34;party at the packhouse&#34; &#34;you gotta be kidding I can get the bunker free of charge and most things organised and you want to stay here&#34;*** looking furious ***&#34;Amelia it&#39;s for safety purposes&#34; &#34;It&#39;s also Mateo&#39;s special birthday so I&#39;m sure we can arrange extra security and what not&#34; &#34;Amelia are you gonna let it go?&#34; &#34;Errrmmm nope&#34; &#34;fine, I&#39;ll put Evan and Nathan in charge of sorting security out&#34; &#34;okay that&#39;s better, We&#39;ll speak to Nina and Rich about it on Saturday seen as we haven&#39;t made it to dinner this week what day are we looking at?&#34;*** I nod and utter hoping I don&#39;t get shouted at with how little time we have ***&#34;Friday&#34; &#34;that gives me a 7 days to plan and organise party for day 8, does Mateo have any particular interests? or favourite colours or something to go off&#34; &#34;he loves his eyes, he likes to party, he likes to show off, he likes women I don&#39;t know what else to say&#34;*** looking at her puzzled and furious, probably wrong that I find it hot but she&#39;s deep in thought, surely she can&#39;t come up with something off that, I mean it&#39;s just a party does it really matter. ***&#34;I got it, a UV/foam party&#34;*** looking at me proud of her idea. ***&#34;thats gonna be messy, but I must say I love the idea, your gonna be wet and in minimal clothes nothing I&#39;d rather see&#34;*** sending a wink her way even if it means other men looking they won&#39;t dare touch her. ***&#34;Let&#39;s not get distracted now Mr Silverstone, we need some ideas for invites, perhaps me nd Nikki could do up some designs for them and see which you like best.&#34; &#34;sounds much sexier when you call me that&#34;*** feeling the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end and that burning sensation running through me, this girl turns me on without even trying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Amelia is a genius, UV/Foam party in the bunker, was gonna ask you and your dad to organise extra tight security. Matty boy will love it women all wet and barely clothed, it is genius I give her that and count that covered.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia and Nikki have been going hard at this party, choosing outfits for themselves Amelia wants me to a nice pair of jeans and shirt that goes with her outfit, So her, Trent and Nikki went to the tailors to find the right style she was looking for. Tomorrow and Friday morning she will be yet again busy trying to get the bunker organised and set for the party. While Amelia is busy with that I head down to check the progress on the already late developing Gym, can&#39;t get materials my ass, lazy lot thats what they are. ***&#34;How are we coming along gentlemen&#34;*** the building actually built just interior work to do. ***&#34;should be ready Saturday evening for you Luc&#34; &#34;thats amazing let me know when and I&#39;ll come and collect the keys and so on from you.&#34; &#34;no worries, I was gonna ask what flooring do you want?&#34; &#34;solid wood, good shine on, all equipment for gymnastics only, plenty of crash mats of different thickness and size. don&#39;t forget the sponge pit things&#34;*** I turn to leave hopefully she will have a nice surprise this weekend. I get back to finish off some paperwork before Amelia comes back and turns back into this seductress that she is recently, maybe her heat is coming up and thats whats making her hormones fly around, not that I&#39;m complaining hearing those sweet moans and feeling her dripping her essence on me just makes me crave her more.</p>
