                <p>Fated to ignite a forbidden bond, Lucas—a future Alpha—defies tradition for Amelia, an outcast with a lethal secret. As ancient prophecies awaken and traitors close in, their love may save their kind... or doom both worlds to extinction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;YOUR LATE!!&#34; Mateo shouting into my head waking me abruptly, oh no not again rubbing my eyes and stretching out as I did every morning. Rolling over to see the alarm clock at 9.20, that not just the usual 5/10 minutes its nearly half an hour late. I leap out of bed throw on some worn jeans, white tank and plaid shirt undone over, quickly run my hands through my soft blonde locks, quickly brushing my pearly whites before racing out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dreading the look, she would give for being so late, her long black curls pinned away from her face, her very on point eyebrows almost make her look angry constantly to top it off her stern dominating voice. Even being on the shorter side she terrified students, although Mateo and me have learnt to leave it go others still give her some stick Jackson included. Mrs Harrison wasn&#39;t impressed with anyone being late for her classes and usually ended up giving them double the work load so having her both first and second period was going to be torture. Although I do feel she has a little soft spot for Jackson almost sounds as if she&#39;s trying to seduce him at times, I mean he&#39;s very easy on the eyes, probably describe him as tall, dark and handsome which got all the attention both male and female. Well, me, I&#39;m have far more defined musculature and taller a than Jackson being a future alpha and all, I just don&#39;t show it off unlike him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching the school after running at my wolf speed trying not to be noticed but I was impressed to see it had only taken 15 minutes. Bursting into class to have everyone stare. I rub my head and give an apologetic look muttering sorry. Sending a mind link New record to Mateo and Jackson smiling proud of my achievement. They shook their heads and let out a laugh. &#34;Boys is there something you&#39;d like to share with us?&#34; Mrs Harrison frustrated by now after the interruption. &#34;No sorry please carry on&#34; I said apologetically. &#34;Thank you but you will have double homework none the less.&#34; Oh, great not like don&#39;t have enough on my plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lunchtime came so slow my stomach now growling at me, getting some quizzing looks from some of the others in class. Shrugging my shoulders at them. These late training sessions with Nathan and Evan for the last week is taking it toll on me, my father insists its for my own benefit, but I&#39;m sure he just wants to punish me because I won&#39;t take the chosen mate he has in line for me, I want a chance to find my true mate is that so much to ask. The moon goddess will give me something special I know it I just know it feeling the frustration build fisting my hands through my locks. My mother is very supporting on this because she didn&#39;t get that opportunity when she was arranged to mate my father although they both love each other dearly she&#39;s always told me to take my chance at finding my chosen one and that&#39;s what I intend on doing I have time a few months before my 18th birthday so I&#39;m just enjoying my time with my brothers.Jackson and Mateo break me from my thoughts. &#34;what&#39;s up bro?&#34; Jackson quizzing me. Mateo nodding along &#34;you&#39;ve been really off the last week something bothering you bro, I&#39;m sure we can give you someone to release that tension building up&#34; with cocky smirk. I catch him off guard with my elbow catching his ribs, I guess I have been in thought more lately with everything &#34;just the pressure looming over me taking over as alpha not sure I&#39;m up for it, plus I don&#39;t want a chosen mate I want my true Luna.&#34;Lucas don&#39;t you dare question yourself your already 10 times the man your father, our pack loves you and you know it so don&#39;t be so hard on yourself as for your Luna hopefully we will find her before it comes to that.&#34; Nathan piping up from nowhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No training tonight  you&#39;ve worked hard this week your mother wants you to have some free time.&#34; Maybe my mother is trying to get him to ease off on me she always worries he pushes me too hard especially because I&#39;m the future Alpha of the pack, me and Da don&#39;t see eye to eye on the whole Luna deposition, he wants me to have a chosen mate, making it nearly impossible to get the time to find my little Luna whoever she may be my thoughts taking me away again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally last period coming to close, &#34;Guys just had the news, we have no training and no duties  tonight, it&#39;s student night I the bunker who&#39;s game?&#34; Mateo and Jackson already on board the party animals they are, I&#39;m not that into the scene id rather go for a run to let Damon out and try and shrug the heaviness off  for a little while. &#34;Oi sucker don&#39;t think your backing out this time, you can let Damon out tomorrow you need to get out&#34; Guess I don&#39;t have a choice I begrudgingly agree but it does give me the opportunity to maybe find my Luna. &#34;Taxi at 8 outside the packhouse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I head up to my room slump myself on the bed big enough for 3 wolves of my size. Everything in a silver and blue colour coordination and a beach wood finish bright and airy always welcoming for the day I find her, my Luna, my fated, my mate. I drag myself up and head for the kitchen making my self quick chicken n pasta before heading in the shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting the warm steamy water fall down over easing the tension in my muscles allowing them to relax I let out a sigh in relief. Smelling the sandalwood and jasmine from the washes and shampoos and whatever my mother made for me she loves that kind of thing she always smells divine, and always taught me to take care of my body and hair kind of routine. As I finish drying my hair to keep some of my loose curls intact without being frizzy. I hear someone burst into my room, recognising the scene over powering my room, Jackson the womaniser, I really wish he wouldn&#39;t go off with all these women. Its not that thses women aren&#39;t up for it but your mate is precious and should be your one and only love and partner, mating is sacred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be there now bro just finishing up then I&#39;ll get dressed and we head down&#34; letting him know I wouldn&#39;t be long. Grabbing some dark wash jeans slightly worn but hung on my hips as I liked, grabbed a black fitted shirt that clung to me. Quickly putting my chain on and shoes on. I&#39;m ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heading back to the kitchen to find Jackson and Mateo both devouring my left-over pasta, grunting and growling in approval. &#34;This is so good, where did you learn to cook&#34;. I shrugged my shoulders and rolled my eyes at the sight of them shovelling each mouthful in occasional gulping of water to wash it down. Checking my watch its 7.55 Nathan is gonna be pissed if we&#39;re late, as they carry their dishes over to the sink, I mutter &#34;leave them were going to be late, let&#39;s go&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathan already waiting downstairs which he seemed annoyed it was 8 already and taxi was waiting outside. Me uttering &#34;blame the hungry wolves themselves&#34; both letting out a low growl. Nathan and I just ignored and head into the taxi. I let out a long sigh and the driver pulled away.</p>
