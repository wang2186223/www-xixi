                <p>If he manages to undo my bond with Lucas I might aswell be dead. I don&#39;t want or need anyone but Lucas he&#39;s the best thing that happened to me, I find myself sobbing my heart breaking at the thought I may not be mated anymore, I certainly don&#39;t want Roman as a mate, thoughts of Lucas warming me, Tara getting extremely unsettled. Lucas not linking back I let out a deep sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m left sitting in this cell for what feels like hours on end with my own thoughts, begining to lose all hope of my rescue. The only sound is my stomach growling in hunger and drips coming from the leaking pipes. Tara really not doing well at the moment, she&#39;s just silent with no input on how we get ourselves out of this. ***&#34;Amelia time for dinner.&#34;*** as the guard undoes the chains. ***&#34;thanks, these have no affect on you but how?&#34; &#34;I&#39;m not sure but atleast it&#39;s only the tightness hurting me&#34; &#34;I&#39;ve seen a pack heading towards this location hopefully they won&#39;t be long&#34; &#34;thank you&#34; &#34;I just hope they have a bullet proof plan&#34; &#34;probably wing it&#34; &#34;there&#39;s about 20 wolves and a witch, they best come with a plan&#34;*** crap they won&#39;t be prepared for that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Lucas there&#39;s about 20 wolves here and a witch the guard informed me. Don&#39;t worry I have back up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Hows dinner Amelia&#34; &#34;it&#39;s lovely thank you&#34; &#34;your welcome, hopefully tonight it will be a new begining for us&#34; &#34;It&#39;s a full moon tonight meaning it&#39;s going to be perfect timing&#34;*** it&#39;s a full moon that will work in Lucas favour, but why take away my bond on a full moon? ***&#34;you looking forward Amelia?&#34; &#34;don&#39;t ask questions you won&#39;t like the answer to&#34; &#34;snappy aren&#39;t we, Hamish take her back to her room&#34; &#34;yes sir&#34; &#34;we&#39;ll come to get you when we&#39;re ready for you&#34;*** I just nod in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Tara if Lucas is gonna take much longer we will need to fight our way out of this. I know I&#39;m keeping my energy for us just incase.** Don&#39;t even know how long I&#39;m being kept here until they take me, wondering patiently waiting. For either me unleashing myself or Lucas showing up. I hear a commotion outside the door before Roman uncuffs me and drags me out into the hallway, going down different passage ways than before we end up in a room let up with candles and what seems to be a ritual circle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Amelia are you ready to remove your mark and bond?&#34; &#34;Roman I don&#39;t want this and you know that.&#34; &#34;shut up and get on with it&#34;.*** My heart pounding now, the witch wraps some plants around my wrists and smothers them with wolfsbaine, it should be now burning me and making me weaker, the witch notices it doesn&#39;t have an affect. ***&#34;not possible&#34; &#34;You never said wolfsbaine wouldn&#39;t have an affect on her&#34; &#34;this could be more difficult, did you build a tolerance?&#34;*** I ignore her not answering. The witch pours an essence into a tube, throwing little spells out here and there, Roman now smirking, nows my chance to try and grab my freedom, I snap the plant wrapping my wrists. I feel myself getting angry. ***&#34;Stay away from me both of you.&#34;*** I step back into the shadows. ***&#34;Amelia there&#39;s no where for you to go from here&#34;*** she must be trying to distract me. To get me to back into my position. Roman fiercely holds me down in order for the witch to try and bind me again, making her attempt a failure, letting the anger wash over to me. I&#39;d burst into flames and set them both into shock as while they try to control me. Roman burnt himself and and the witch couldn&#39;t see that coming as they try to regain some of their power back I hit them both with another round of flames. ***&#34;Amelia when did you?*** I hear Roman trying to come out with words. I hear howling, it must be Lucas hes here. ***&#34;oh lover boy is here to watch it all happen&#34;.*** As the guards usher Lucas, Mateo and Nathan in I notice they have blood stained fur. They shift back to human form. The witch tries to throw some spells at us but to her failure my necklace was protecting me as it should.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas and Roman now having a face off. All who was watching couldn&#39;t take their eyes off Lucas he was huge compared to Roman. ***&#34;You will pay for taking my girl that I promise you&#34;.*** Lucas growling at Roman. ***&#34;How did you get in?&#34; &#34;your guards were pretty pathetic. I&#39;m sure someone&#39;s going to need to clean the halls too&#34;*** In the corner of my eye I can see the witch trying to perform a spell, I send flames from my hands before she can complete her spell, getting annoyed at me she sends another bolt toward me again not doing anything.***&#34;Not so fast are you&#34; &#34;your very special my love&#34;*** Roman tried to distract everyone with his words, Lucas only getting angrier and as he goes in for a strike Roman dodges and aims for me, before he knows it he&#39;s being tackled by Lucas, he&#39;s faster. ***&#34;Don&#39;t you dare lay a finger on her&#34;. &#34;she&#39;s mine, you took what is mine. If I can&#39;t have her no one can!&#34;*** Roman tries to be humorous, the witch waiting for a signal as she stand patiently, I notice it must be Damon taking control. Roman shifts into his wolf form, ***&#34;no she&#39;s mine, she chose me&#34;*** Lucas also shifting, he looks bigger from when I seen him last, the witch throws an arrow, looking astonished it doesn&#39;t affect him. Roman and Lucas circle around waiting for someone to make a move, Roman leaps to Lucas, while Lucas leaps to dodge quickly switching to attack taking Roman by surprise, he shrugs it off, Damon probably in full control of the situation. He&#39;s just playing at the moment, I can tell by his demeanour. Roman swiftly goes for Lucas ankle catching a bite before Lucas can leap, letting out a slight yelp shaking it off. No more playing get this done. The guard I know as Hamish, sets himself behind Matt and Nathan. I whisper to him ***&#34;Nows your chance go and get your family&#34;*** he nods in appreciation and exits the room. Roman now bleeding quite badly as Lucas is now tearing his body apart, Roman hasn&#39;t given up though. Lucas rips a chunk out of Romans shoulder and spits it to the floor. Roman looks weak now and unable to keep his stance. I know Lucas is going to finish him, as Roman trys to curl up Lucas pushes him with a paw and presses into his chest, letting out a loud howl then holds his neck in his jaw, all you hear is a massive crunch and a limp wolf laying on the ground blood pouring out. The witch trys to make a hasty exit but Hamish and his family bring her back in, after her failed escape. Lucas shifts back, ***&#34;You can finish this one if you want beautiful&#34;. &#34;with pleasure&#34;*** I quickly dodge all her strikes, almost like my gymnastics moves coming out. I finely get hold of the witch and she laughs in my face and spits at me, ***&#34;you haven&#39;t got it in you&#34;*** and with that I grab her head with both hands and just snap it clean and drop the old hag to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dive into Lucas, ***&#34;What took you so long?&#34;, &#34;sorry beautiful these passages are very confusing&#34; &#34;I couldn&#39;t keep track either&#34;*** I turn toward Hamish, ***&#34;thank you, you took care of me&#34; &#34;it&#39;s okay, I couldn&#39;t imagine losing my mate like that. I have to go find somewhere for us to go now&#34;*** Lucas stepped in ***&#34;What do you mean somewhere to go&#34; &#34;we were taken from our pack and forced to resign our oath, so we currently don&#39;t have anywhere to go so I&#39;m going to go to the motel for tonight and see where life takes us from there&#34; &#34;Amelia says you were helpful and gave information and asked me to spare your life, I wouldn&#39;t have been as prepared if it wasn&#39;t for you so please come join us at our pack&#34; &#34;Thank you sir, are you sure the alpha won&#39;t mind?&#34; &#34;I&#39;m the future alpha so I&#39;m sure I can wangle something, probably do the oath myself if my father doesn&#39;t agree.&#34; &#34;but why we don&#39;t have anything to offer you?&#34; &#34;what did you do in your last pack? I know we need extra nursery staff and possibly warriors, or a new architect ours is well slow&#34; &#34;architect sounds good and my mate here can help with the nursery&#34;  &#34;that&#39;s sorted then&#34; &#34;can we head home now I&#39;m exhausted&#34;*** I feel my eyes getting heavy, ***&#34;of course Amelia home to where you belong&#34;***</p>
