                <p>Its been four whole days since confronting Da about his set up, four whole days of waiting to hear something from the Dr and four whole days of waves of exhaustion. The tip of the iceberg being Jackson is still being an ass. My patience with things are wearing thin. Mateo has done a good job of keeping me distracted with plans for the pack when I take over and Nathan and Evan doing some extra training with me. She&#39;s still in and out if my mind, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s gotta be a bond of some kind, I&#39;m in and out of exhaustion everytime I think of her there are other times as well but not as often. Ma wants some time with me today seen as Da is heading away from the pack until tomorrow, I can&#39;t wait I&#39;ve missed our time together, she&#39;s in a league of her own, I hope my Luna is going to be just as amazing as her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mateo keep an eye on things around here seen as Da isn&#39;t here I&#39;m in charge but I&#39;m spending a few hours with Ma, cheer her up a bit, if there&#39;s anything just drop me a link bro. Of course, bro I got this you go see that wonderful Ma of yours give her a hug from me.&#34; Mateo always had my back and knew what Ma meant to me so was always so helpful when it came to her, I think secretly he&#39;d love to have her as his mother too, Mateo&#39;s parents aren&#39;t really bothered by anything he does to be fair, they don&#39;t dislike each other as a family just not as well bonded as others. It didn&#39;t seem to bother Mateo much I just think sometimes he gets jealous of my mothers and my bond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I head to the kitchen in my parents&#39; house to find Ma &#34;So Ma how are you today? You look much better than you did the other day&#34; it makes me so much happier to see her more lively. &#34;Oh I am darling thank you for noticing, you still look as exhausted as you did&#34; &#34;aww Ma don&#39;t you worry about me I&#39;ll fine&#34; she&#39;s looking at me concerned. &#34;you can&#39;t keep all this up you know that. You and Jackson sorted your tiff out?&#34; asking cautiously &#34;Na, it will work out somehow just need some time.&#34; wondering if it ever will, a lot has happened between us in the past but he&#39;s never ever let something so stupid come between us. &#34;your father is right in that respect you know, he has no respect for your authority or you. You can&#39;t count on him Lucas he&#39;s trouble and you know it&#34; letting out a deep sigh I know but I don&#39;t know how to handle everything he still felt like a brother to me. Damon growling because he agrees with my mother and father on this one. &#34;I know in some ways but he&#39;s my brother&#34; &#34;Lucas I know you and I know you will make the right decisions for you in your own time.&#34; placing a coffee in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eating away on our lunch having a chit chat about this and that, Ma asks &#34;Lucas are you going to the masquerade party in the bunker on Friday night? your not exactly talking to your father he can&#39;t tell you no can he&#34; She giggled as her own suggestion. &#34;I am thinking about it but I would need to go shopping for a suit and mask as I can&#39;t just go in any old suit now can I&#34; suggesting to my mother we go shopping in the slightest hint. &#34;Are you hinting my boy? you know you don&#39;t need to hint, I&#39;d love to join you and help you pick out the perfect suit with you.&#34; thank goddess, she has a better fashion sense and it also means I get more time with her. &#34;Heading to the mall with Ma shouldn&#39;t be too long, hope everything is OK bro.&#34; Letting Mateo know I wouldn&#39;t be at my parents if he came looking for me, &#34;No problem, if it&#39;s for the party can you see if you can get me a charcoal mask to go with my charcoal suit. You&#39;re not going with navy then? Na can&#39;t seem to get it to look how I&#39;d want it to with a mask. no worries. catch you later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We arrive at the tailors to find me a suit, as soon as we walk in, &#34;Ava, how lovely it is to see you, how can we help you today? &#34;My son is looking for a unique suit for a masquerade party&#34; &#34;Silver if you can&#34; I muttered &#34;Of course I have 3 pieces that may be of interest&#34; &#34;This one here is a two piece set if you want a shirt you&#39;d have to get one separately, and there&#39;s no waist coat because of the way the suit is designed it&#39;s on the larger side for a slouchy fit.&#34; &#34;definitely not&#34; my mother instantly answered. &#34;the second one here is a 3 piece not so much of slouchy fit more tailored fit, so a waist coat is included in this and just adds a little something to the suit&#34; &#34; that&#39;s a maybe, son have you thought of a colour tie or bow and whatever it is your going to be wearing.&#34; &#34;gold&#34; I said sharply. &#34;I have the perfect combination for you, it&#39;s abit of a mix match in designers but it comes together wonderfully, but it is only a hire suit so here we have a slim fit suit in medium/light grey, I&#39;ve taken a gold double breasted waist coat with a subtle paisley design from the exclusive range, paired with the matching gold tie and pocket square.&#34;&#34;son could you try it on please?&#34; I head to the changing room and put the suit on, it feels very light and airy which is a breath of fresh air I hate suits, gave me a snug if so it showed my structure and build well and most importantly it was a mixture of both of us. Silver and Gold. I exit the dressing room &#34;&#34;That looks impeccable on you sir if I do say so myself&#34; &#34;I&#39;ll take it&#34; &#34;How long would you need to hire for?&#34; &#34;that won&#39;t matter, I&#39;m not hiring I&#39;m buying. I&#39;ll take it whatever the price it&#39;s perfect just what I was looking for&#34; &#34;But sir&#34; &#34;name your price I&#39;ll pay it, I want this suit&#34; my mother completely lost for words, she&#39;s never seen me so quickly to react, she knew there was more to it. &#34;Son whoever she is, I can imagine her face seeing you in this, you look outstanding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After paying the hefty bill at the tailors seen as it was supposed to be an exclusivly hire only suit,  I needed a mask for me and Mateo, he wants something to go with his charcoal suit which would be easy. I&#39;ll get him an dark grey mask with some tribal or embossed pattern on. Mine was a little more complicated, I needed a gold and silver piece with fine details on it, I&#39;d know when I see it. We get into the fancy dress shop as I call it, Ma always hated me calling it that, but its basically what is was. I picked Mateo&#39;s out pretty easily he&#39;s gonna be happy, it&#39;s a half face covering mask abit like phantom mask with fine silver patterns by the eye. The lady came over can I help you with something almost throwing herself me. &#34;yes actually I need a silver and gold mask for a masquerade.&#34; of course she&#39;s blushing after saying a few words, it gets annoying &#34;These are the only two we have.&#34; One of them just looks like some make shift mask with abit of paint. The other is a silver mask, with fine gold detailing with a silver silk ribbon to tie the mask on, the edges cut to perfection each detail looks handcrafted it honestly is a work of art itself. &#34;This one please&#34; &#34;I&#39;ll pay for this one dear, consider it good luck with your girl&#34; &#34;I have the money Ma&#34; &#34;I know, it&#39;s a gift from me&#34;</p>
