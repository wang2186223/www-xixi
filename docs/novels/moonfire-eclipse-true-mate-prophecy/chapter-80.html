                <p>We walked along the beach, chatting and came to a stop admiring the view the moon and stars are bright tonight making it that little bit more romantic, ***&#34;Amelia do you mind if I hold your bump?&#34; &#34;sure our pup moving quite abit at the moment so you may feel something&#34;*** I get to my knees and feel her cute little bump, ***&#34;your loved more than you will ever know, I hear your giving your moma a hard time please take it a little easier on her she does alot and deserves a break I put enough on her which I need to correct without you giving her a hard time too my monkey. I hope you turn out like her strong and stern but caring and full of love the same time,  I know now your going to be the best Alpha of this pack, I love you little wolf&#34;*** I plant a kiss on her bump and come back to my feet. I notice a tears welling up in Amelias eyes. ***&#34;That was sweet Lucas, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll make a good daddy&#34; &#34;I&#39;ll try my best for our little family,&#34;*** we continue to chat and sit in the sand for a little while but it&#39;s starting to get a little chilly I offer Amelia my coat ***&#34;Are you ready to head back?&#34; &#34;I think so I need some sleep now&#34; &#34;no worries my love we shall go back.&#34;***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I drive us back to the packhouse, pretty much in silence, I think Amelia is deep in thought as she hasn&#39;t really moved a muscle either. I park the car up and head around her side to open the door and help her exit. As we walk toward the pack house I see that Amelia seems to be struggling with something, ***&#34;Amelia what&#39;s wrong? did I do something?&#34; &#34;No but I do need to ask you something, Would it be okay to come home tonight?&#34;***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Amelia being back home I&#39;ve never felt so content although I have had to take on more work than normal, Amelia is really starting to feel this pregnancy getting the best of her so she does what she can but then takes the rest of her time to rest herself. We have also made different arrangements for meeting up with Nina and Rich they now come to us for dinner instead and plus it&#39;s been so manic we don&#39;t get the chance to leave more often than not. It makes Amelia happy to keep them involved with everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tomorrow will probably be busier than normal so I set to get more work done today so I can enjoy my day with Amelia and the pack for this gender reveal party that the others wanted us to throw. Mark made most the arrangements considering he&#39;s the only person who knows what we we&#39;re having along with his contacts that&#39;s about all Amelia and I knew. Everytime I look at the pictures from the scan they just make my heart throb, My little pup growing inside the love of my life almost brings tears to my eyes. I must be getting soft, since my birthday I seem to be thinking more maturely, although it could have something to do with the pup on the way too, who knows. Didn&#39;t really do anything for my birthday either just went for food with everyone, I didn&#39;t want a massive thing after everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Amelia is everything okay with you? I&#39;m starting to feel a little uneasy. Yes Lucas just nervous about tomorrow I didn&#39;t think I would be but everyone will be looking at our pup as the next Alpha of this pack and their future already determined. Our pup willl be whatever they want to be if they don&#39;t want to be Alpha they won&#39;t have to be, I promise you that. I wouldn&#39;t force anything either but they will have the pressure from everyone else in the pack. I know but we will support whatever they will be beautiful. We need to get some work done or we won&#39;t be having any party tomorrow, I have a few phone calls and proposals to make I&#39;m sure some of these packs take us for mugs. I&#39;m with you on that, Love you beautiful.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia is good with working with the other packs, always challenging their proposals and making a better deal for both packs, she gives this pack more of a voice and allows a better connections with everyone. We are probably one of the richest packs, we aren&#39;t one of the biggest anymore but we are by far the more organised and communicative even the council have alot more respect for us since Amelia handling all the pack affairs. I think the council have made proposals as to when we retire as Alpha and Luna we become one of them, we both just shrug it off for now, no time soon will we retire so we plenty of time to make plans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I head out to check on the training as we plan to take into account there are smaller wolves within the pack and with Amelia being substancially smaller but has amazing tactics and agility, she has suggested we can make them apart of the warriors, they will undertake both gymnastics classes and physical and strength training. Amelia held a pack gathering where she explained there is a place for everyone in the pack and they will get the support and guidance they require to be whatever they want to be, also first time in history woman are apart of the pack warriors, I&#39;m struggling to adjust to that as I hate the thought of a woman taking a hit from another male it&#39;s just wrong but I do think Amelia has the right state of mind to make everyone equal. That girl is something special she could change the whole dynamic of packs and how they proceive what it should be. I&#39;m so proud of the woman she has become, our pup is so lucky to have such an amazing mom, me on the other hand still have some growing to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With evening now dawning on us, Amelia was still busy at work, so I decide to make us dinner tonight, I chose hunters chicken, some corn on a cob and some skin on fries. I get preparing the fries, plenty of olive oil, chicken fresh from the butcher, couldn&#39;t ask for better produce. I place everything in the oven to cook while I potter around trying to make some sort of romanic gesture, I place wild orchid scented candles around the room and rose petals along the floor leading to the bedroom and place them in a lovely heart shape. I&#39;ll put desert on there later for her and choose a chick flick to watch in bed and put it on pause ready. I think she will like my effort and hopefully we will have a well deserved relaxed evening together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I finished I hear Amelia entering through the door, her scent hits me right away, along with the smell of food cooking. ***&#34;Good evening Amelia, hope your hungry I made food&#34; &#34;this is alot more than food, what is all this in aid of?&#34; &#34;don&#39;t you like it?&#34; &#34;I love it, just not sure why?&#34; &#34;just thought it would be a nice romantic gesture and we could have a relaxed evening just me and you&#34; &#34;Thank you Lucas I appreicate it very much&#34; &#34;no worries beautiful now you go and rest your legs while I dish up and set the table&#34;*** Amelia went to curl up as best she could on the sofa, She is very pregnant now she shouldn&#39;t have much longer left, few weeks tops but Mark is happy with her progress that&#39;s the main thing and he has given us an all clear for a home delievery which Amelia is ecstatic about. As I finish up dishing up Amelia comes to take a seat at the table. ***&#34;Smells and looks amazing thank you Lucas&#34; &#34;anything for my beautiful wife.&#34;***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We chat and giggle through dinner, her giggle is so infectious, ***&#34;Amelia I will never get sick of that goofy giggle of yours&#34; &#34;thanks just wanted to hear I have a goofy giggle&#34;*** I clean up after dinner and sort out desert, chocolate porfitaroles, squirty cream and some strawberries on the side, I place them on the tray I laid out on the bed ready for when Amelia let her food settle, it&#39;s taking a little longer now so I have to be patient. We reached 8pm Amelia now getting tired, ***&#34;I need a wee Lucas I just can&#39;t move&#34; &#34;don&#39;t worry I&#39;ll help, perhaps we can watch a film in bed after that?&#34;*** I offer as I carry her toward the bed room. Amelia&#39;s eyes lit up as she saw my continued effort to our night. ***&#34;Lucas you really did go all out, thank you&#34; &#34;that I did, I wanted to show my queen just how special she is, but first let&#39;s get you to that wee&#34;*** Amelia agreed without hesitation.</p>
