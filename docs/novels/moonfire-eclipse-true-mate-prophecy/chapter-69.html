                <p>After Amelia changing Nikki and putting her to bed and making sure she was okay, she came back to the room. ***&#34;There&#39;s my girl, in a way I&#39;m glad were back early we have alot to do tomorrow in prep for Sunday&#34; &#34;your telling me, Libby has been a bag of nerves too so keeping her calm in all this is becoming more and more difficult, I think it&#39;s with everything else looming over too, she&#39;s worried it&#39;s going to go all wrong for them.&#34; &#34;we all know it won&#39;t there will be high levels of security at all times, and the council won&#39;t be joining until Monday so we should be okay.&#34; &#34;What do you mean the council will be here on Monday?&#34;*** Amelia looking at me in complete shock, I forgot to tell her, crap ***&#34;sorry must have slipped my mind with everything going on? the council will be here Monday afternoon to discuss a course of action for me taking Alpha and they agree my father is no longer fit for Alpha it&#39;s just we have to go through all the legal side too.&#34; &#34;oh right&#34;*** Amelia muttered while I could feel her nerves she kept calm and collectected on the outside. ***&#34;Everything will be okay Amelia, just a few hurdles and it will be over with&#34;*** I bring her into my chest and let her rest there to calm herself. ***&#34;I know but deep down it&#39;s like I&#39;m lying to myself I know your father isn&#39;t going to react well with this I just don&#39;t want you to lose the last bit of your family&#34; &#34;Amelia he&#39;s not my Da anymore either way he&#39;s not the man I once knew, he&#39;s a lost soul now&#34;.*** We remain cuddled up on the sofa, while both of just collect our thoughts and just relax into eachothers embrace. We didn&#39;t need a passionate love making session, we didn&#39;t need our bodies hot and sweaty, holding eachother and just being in our own little bubble was far more intimate at this moment as we just search our minds, slowly start getting heavy eyes and sleepy heads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s the morning of the ceremony and Mateo and Libby both flapping around, I&#39;m sure me and Amelia were fine on our day, we were never this worked up. Amelia down stairs with the staff trying to get them organised for everything and where they are placing everything, Nina and Rich were more than happy to make the food. I&#39;d organised that we continue with training to avoid everyone getting overly worked up. After training Mateo only had time to shower before I&#39;d whisk him and Nathan off, we will get a bite to eat, have a chill out before getting ready ceremony starts at half 5 so we would have plenty of time to relax before the ceremony although I was wondering if that was a good thing or a bad thing, either way we would find out soon. My father now telling me he isn&#39;t going to initiate the ceremony and the only other person here capable is me, so another job added to the list.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Amelia and I greeted a few outsiders to the pack for the ceremony offering beverages and showing them to their rooms for the evening so they could prepare themselves, Libby was with Nikki getting themselves ready while Amelia had already gotten dressed in an above the knee gold and silver short dress with a thigh slit and long sleeves coming into a v neck. she looked like an angel. There was no one not even Libby that could dress up to her, between her beauty and style she could be a model. even some of the younger wolves coming to the pack would stare, even with her mark on full show seen as her hair was pinned up screaming elegance and grace.  If another man even smells her I&#39;m going to rip their head off. not a good idea Lucas you can&#39;t, be the man not like she&#39;s going to run away from you. I bowed my head in shame as the words echos in my ear. Sorry didn&#39;t think before I spoke Damon replied apologetically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With only am hour before the ceremony and everyone arrived Amelia and I head on the field to make sure everything was in place and the PA system was working accordingly. Unfortunately Amelia didn&#39;t have much time to spend with Libby as she was organising everything unlike when my mother and Nina did for her no one stepped up and I know it upset Amelia that she couldn&#39;t give the time for her but also understood that things had to be done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Now Mateo, would you please say a few words&#34;*** Mateo nods. ***&#34;I&#39;d like to thank everyone for your company on such an important day of our lives it&#39;s truly humbling and also thank the moon goddess for blessing me with such a pure heart, Libby not only are the most attractive girl I&#39;ve seen but your also the most kind, gentle and caring person to go with it. You listen to my troubles I listen to yours, some people will say we are like chalk and cheese, while maybe we are but we fit together perfectly. You are my balance, without you I think I&#39;d be lost. So with that I love all of you Libby the good and the bad, Together we can take on the world.&#34; &#34;With the speeches done I need to use the ceremonial blade to allow your blood to mix, both scrunched their faces as I took the blade to them and they placed their hands together in unison, I can now officially granted as a mated couple, you may now Mark eachother in Union or just kiss if you wish&#34;.*** With that they both allowed their canines to lengthen and mark eachother on the spot while the crowds whistled and cheered for them. Mateo finished up with a large howl while everyone followed. They both ran off to complete the second part of the ceremony, no one really noticed we thought they would have but all seemed well, food was going down nicely, everyone chatting and giggling, the dance floor starting to pile up also. I didn&#39;t think we would have so many people dancing maybe I should have had a bigger one. I drag my beautiful wife up dance for a while before we shift and go for the our run with the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia had loved every minute of the day but now I could see all her hard work is paying off now she looks exhausted, ***&#34;Amelia darling your tired now why don&#39;t we head up to bed and skip the run.&#34; &#34;no I&#39;m fine let&#39;s go for our run then it&#39;s done, I will sleep in the morning&#34; &#34;not too long we have guests tomorrow don&#39;t forget&#34;*** she must have forgotten by the look on her face.  Mateo and Libby come back both extremely blushed, ***&#34;You ready now you two?&#34;*** letting out a chuckle. ***&#34;Think so, sorry we got extremely carried away.&#34; &#34;no worries it&#39;s your day.&#34;*** Amelia heads to the mic to make the announcement to make our way to the tree line, plenty of blankets were already placed at the tree line to ensure everyone still had some modesty when they return. Mateo made his move and shifted first Libby followed hesitantly followed by the rest of the pack, Damon and Tara were finally free to do as they please as we took the back seat and relaxed into it. After a few hours of just being free, Amelia and I decided to head back and go up to bed seen as we both had important business to tend to tomorrow which of course would require concentration and alertness, not to forget it could turn into a blood bath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia did have her lay in and my nerves were going crazy now, this isn&#39;t going to end well I can tell before we even come to having a discussion. It may not be a traditional Alpha ceremony but it has to be done in the best interest of the pack. Amelia getting herself prepared and going over paperwork while I just keep my head level knowing of what&#39;s coming. Amelia will deal with the terms and conditions and all that jargon, she seems to be good at that kind of thing. ***&#34;Lucas please calm down I can&#39;t focus with your nerves rushing through me.&#34; &#34;sorry beautiful, just trying to prepare for worst case scenario&#34; &#34;I know baby, we will get through all this&#34; &#34;He&#39;s lost his mind Amelia this isn&#39;t going down well, I&#39;m gonna have to..&#34;*** I can&#39;t even finish the sentence Amelia wraps her arms around me, it&#39;s not Da anymore Lucas, we will do what is necessary for this pack. I know doesn&#39;t make it easy. Damon just backs off leaving me to argue with myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Buddy, council are here, okay I&#39;ll meet them in Da office if you will escort them, I&#39;d like you and Nathan to join us along with summon Da beta. No worries. Thanks boy.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;So gentlemen and lady we have been summoned to rectify an issue which has been long standing&#34; &#34;what is this all in aid of?&#34;*** Da answered abruptly. ***&#34;Da we have been trying to get through to you on this issue and your putting us all at risk with your lack of judgement and your state&#34; &#34;what bloody issue I don&#39;t have any&#34; &#34;Alpha Brandon Silverstone we no longer see you fit to fulfil your duty as Alpha of this pack we are here to strip you of your title&#34;*** Da just laughed  ***&#34;You gotta be joking, you think I can&#39;t run this pack have you seen this pack it&#39;s run on a tight ship&#34; &#34;Alpha you have become a threat to your own pack, you have killed your own members which you would have never done and we do not wish to cause too much drama here, I understand your position you have lost your mate, it&#39;s enough to damage anyone both physically and mentally in which we cannot blame you for at all.&#34; &#34;Brandon you haven&#39;t done any paperwork or the daily running for this pack nor have you engaged in any pack activities to understand what is happening&#34;*** his Beta answered agreeing with us he has lost it basically. ***&#34;So we have two options we will forcefully take your title or you can give it up willingly&#34;*** I can see my fathers blood boiling at this point he doesn&#39;t even try to hide it letting out a growl. ***&#34;So we will now ask you Who is the Alpha of this pack?&#34;  &#34;I am and the only way your going to take my title is by taking my life I will never bow down to this ridicule&#34; &#34;if that&#39;s how it has to be Alpha&#34;*** taking a deep breath ***&#34;I, Lucas Silverstone of the Silverstone Pack challenge you Alpha Brandon Silverstone for the title of Alpha of this pack&#34;***</p>
