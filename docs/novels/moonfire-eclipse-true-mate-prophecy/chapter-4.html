                <p>&#34;Amelia are you okay?  Its gone 10am and not heard or seen you this morning.&#34; Romans mind link flashing into my head. Stirring from my sleep still feeling exhausted, I rub my eyes to adjust the the sun peaking in through the window. &#34;Amelia?&#34;  Roman again, &#34;Sorry was sleeping I&#39;ve been so exhausted since last night, I&#39;m going to get on with some chores, come over later.&#34; Closing off my mind link throw on some jogger bottoms, a crop top and some sneakers , throw my hair into messy bun, headphones in and away to go. I headed to the kitchen grabbing one of the left over croissants from breakfast before heading down to the basement to put the first of many loads of washing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After an hour of sorting through washing and piling things up to go to each ones room. I find myself getting tired again, why can&#39;t I shake this feeling I mean I didn&#39;t do that much of a work out yesterday, okay I didn&#39;t eat much but I was used to that I had left overs unless Roman made food for us or ordered takeaway, maybe just catching up on me. Now that the 3 washing machines were full, I went on to the dining room hoovering, mopping, polishing and dusting luckily I&#39;d done the majority of the cleaning yesterday. I begin heading back down to the laundry room to swap clothes over to the tumble dryer and putting more loads in. I bump into someone not realising, &#34;Sorry&#34; came out of my mouth without really taking note who it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat down on the cold concrete for 10 minutes trying to regain some energy for the bathrooms. Suddenly images of that gorgeous man from the bunker invade my mind those incredible eyes, just making me melt at the thought. Maybe it was him who tipped me, my thoughts trailing off to how his godly body would look stripped down the feeling of our bodies grinding sending sparks through each touch. I break myself from though letting out a low growl and shook my head no you don&#39;t need anyone but Roman. Roman is your mate stop dreaming and get on with life I told myself. Tara feeling the frustration aswell. I sighed hard, they&#39;re just thoughts I try to convince myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amelia I&#39;m really worried about you it&#39;s as if your distancing yourself from me I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;ve done or what&#39;s even up with you, are you coming down with something? do you need to see the pack doctor?&#34; Roman blurting out with a concerned look across his face.&#34;No it&#39;s nothing I think everything is just catching up on me I think a large meal and a good rest will do the trick,  join me for takeaway and film tonight?&#34; I uttered suggestivly. I hate seeing the doctors for my yearly check up I&#39;m not going for abit of tiredness. &#34;Sure I&#39;ll come over but if you don&#39;t start feeling yourself over the weekend you will be seeing the doctor Monday morning understood?&#34;  I nod in agreement throwing a cheeky smile as he helps me off the floor. &#34;Sorry but I do need to get on or I&#39;ll never finish, 7.30 sound okay to you?&#34; &#34;Not a minute later&#34; giving me wink as he exits the laundry room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finish folding the dry laundry and replacing dry with wet and so forth, surely there&#39;s more to life, not my life I guess sighing in thought, Tara growling at my thoughts, &#34;your even more special than you know.&#34; I push her back even though I shouldn&#39;t we are special to each other we always will be, feeling her warmth trying to comfort me a small smile creeps upon me &#34;thank you Tara I love you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carrying along 3 bags of washing and cleaning supplies trying to juggle everything can be tricky but I&#39;ve grown to adjust and save time. Starting with the future gamma room just a plain neutral room, cleaning and clothes put away followed by the future beta, I head towards the future Alphas room the one room I always dread I knock and wait for a response with no response I let myself in. His room so organised and everything has it&#39;s place, with blacks, greys and whites everywhere it&#39;s a perfectly organised. I give everything a wipe down and replace everything where it should be nervously or I would get reminded for the 100th time where things go. I head to the bedroom stacking his clothes to the correct piles, its just changing the bed sheets left and I can head out. I exit the wardrobe to find Jasper sitting on the bed, &#34;your not done yet? your slacking today&#34; he spits out with a growl &#34;Look let&#39;s get these sheets changed over and so you can get out of here I have no time for orphans&#34; I just nod my head without showing my tear filled eyes giving me the reminder I never really belonged. &#34;Now that&#39;s done get out, no idea why my father still has you here, not like there isn&#39;t others to do your job, maybe even quicker and better&#34;  &#34;Yes Alpha I&#39;ll Leave now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finally finished my chores everyones clothes and bedding clean and dry ready for tomorrow&#39;s duties. I head slump onto my bed, exhaustion washing over me.  It&#39;s 6pm just enough time for a shower and read a little before 7.30. After a quick shower jumping into some fleece pajamas leaving my hair dry naturally for a change, I start to think about food what are we going to eat. &#34;Thai&#34;  Tara bouncing around knowing it&#39;s Romans favourite, typing in the order for delivery at 7.20 giving me enough time to plate up before he gets here. &#34;Don&#39;t forget panang curry&#34; Tara trying to be useful reminding me that its Romans favourite. &#34;Yes Tara thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Order complete.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turn to my bag where all my books usually are, I pull one out didn&#39;t really mind which one, Myths and prophecies that&#39;ll do. I got so lost I was loosing track of time. 7.15pm oh crap, I throw my book back in my bag and head to the packhouse door, driver already waiting. &#34;thanks heres a tip&#34; rushed back to my room to plate up. A knock on the door &#34;come in your right on time&#34; Roman appeared in sweat pants and oversized tee taking my breath away I think he could wear a bin bag and I&#39;d still be attracted except this time I have two men battling around my mind trying not show my frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already picked a film I hope you don&#39;t mind it&#39;s a thriller/mystery&#34; hoping he wouldn&#39;t mind &#34;Whatever you like I picked last time so it was turn anyway&#34; We nabbed out plates and sat on either end of the small sofa, a little too small for Roman but he never complained. I hit play, we both started to tuck into our dinner, hearing the grunts and growls of approval coming from Roman without realising I was letting out a chuckle, &#34;what&#39;s funny?&#34; his mouth full of food, &#34;nothing just look kinda cute when you eat like that, it gets me everytime&#34;. We both finished so I took the plates to the kitchen as I sat back down there it was again exhaustion washing over me, I hadn&#39;t felt it at all since having a shower until now. &#34;It&#39;s happening again isn&#39;t it, your getting tired&#34;  Roman looking at me concerned, I could feel his frustration too. &#34;A little but I&#39;m fine, it&#39;ll pass just watch the movie&#34; he shook his head in disbelief but continued to watch the movie not to press any further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amelia my office please&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Alphas link awaking me suddenly realising I&#39;d fallen asleep, checking the time half 9 I don&#39;t even remember watching the rest of the film. Oh no wheres Roman? I practically abandoned him, feeling guilty, I pick myself up off the sofa, mind link Roman, &#34;I&#39;m sorry&#34; I sent extremely apologetic. It&#39;s okay you were tired just get your rest I&#39;ll see you tomorrow. I frowned and with that, Amelia now. What did I do this time? I wish all this would end but I don&#39;t want to be without Roman.</p>
