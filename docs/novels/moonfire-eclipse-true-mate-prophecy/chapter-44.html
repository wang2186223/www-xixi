There are no maps and only a selected few learnt the layout. I stand infront of the iron door, and place on some gloves to open the interrogation room. ***&#34;You ready for this beautiful&#34; &#34;I think so&#34; she said gently trying to hold back her fear, this girl never fails to amaze me, my one and only true Luna.***</p>

Amelia do you have anything you&#39;d like to ask?&#34;*** She brings herself closer to the rat making me even more furious between her actions and words. ***&#34;How many of you are there?&#34;*** she asked ***&#34;you think I&#39;m gonna answer to a little skank who just wanted to get into bed with a big strong alpha to protect her, give her money and have power, you gotta be kidding me your a joke, always have been and always will be&#34;*** laughing in the chair, making my blood boil. I pull out a knife and cut two fingers off without a second thought. ***&#34;who&#39;s fucking laughing now, you answer to Amelia when she speaks, don&#39;t you dare disrespect her again&#34; &#34;fucking wolfsbaine, you fucking asshole&#34; &#34;now you will apologise to Amelia for your disrespect and answer her question&#34;*** he just spits at the table, he&#39;s still not ready to cooperate, I cut another 2 fingers from the opposite hand Amelia raises her hand ***&#34;enough of that now he&#39;s just a scared poor little boy, look hes so weak and defenseless&#34;*** she follows up with a laugh while running her hands through his hair tugging slightly ***&#34;you ready to answer now little one?&#34; &#34;Sorry Amelia, there around 80 of us now&#34;*** I laugh 80 how pathetic he ain&#39;t getting anywhere the 80 there probably 300 warriors alone in this pack but Amelia is doing a good job at getting information even if her technique was making my blood boil, she was getting results. ***&#34;I see getting quite the support then&#34; &#34;you could say that, there should be more to come shortly&#34; &#34;What do you know of the Black shadow packs involvement&#34;*** I question ***&#34;there&#39;s not direct involved but some of their pack members will be joining us&#34;*** I tilt my head ***&#34;why?&#34;*** Amelia pushed. ***&#34;ahh yes you were made rogue from the pack weren&#39;t you!, see not good enough anywhere no one wants you&#34;*** Amelia&#39;s eyes glowing in rage, she grips his leg and yanks his knee out of place you could hear the crack plain, not that I&#39;m surprised she&#39;s getting annoyed too.***&#34;You fucking whore burn in hell&#34; &#34;now where were we? oh that&#39;s right you were answering me why people are coming to you?&#34; &#34;your pack isn&#39;t the only pack at risk we have 2 others in mind.&#34; &#34;so basically your all little dogs following their owners command to fulfill his need for power, aww this is too cute, here take a little water, your doing well so far,&#34;*** Amelia pets his head ***&#34;So are we correct in saying you have 4 packs you plan on taking over? and is this to create one massive pack?&#34; &#34;now your getting it, see the plan is much bigger than you&#34;.*** shit, how are we gonna get this resolved. I drag Amelia out and slam the door taking 5 minutes. Amelia looks at me puzzled, ***&#34;we need more information but Amelia you are doing well I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d get involved honestly.&#34; &#34;I&#39;m quite enjoying, we are getting information slowly but I can&#39;t keep this up forever&#34;*** she lets out a sigh and heads back in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Where are you based?&#34; &#34;you seriously think I&#39;m gonna tell you that I&#39;d rather die&#34;*** fine I give a few blows to his ribs and set his body hair alight watching is burn and melt leaving his skin chared and blistered. ***&#34;anything yet?&#34;*** like I said ***&#34;I&#39;d rather die&#34;*** he spits Amelia takes a butchers knife and slices off his hand letting blood poor everywhere then placing it on hot iron to stop the bleeding, she&#39;s a pro ***&#34;forget it you ain&#39;t getting anything&#34;*** screaming with in pain. I snap his knee caps and kick him to the floor, pressing his head against the floor demanding answers. ***&#34;get screwed&#34; &#34;dont you worry I will later on, where as no wolf will look at you again&#34;*** punching repeatedly until he&#39;s almost unconscious, ***&#34;give me a location&#34;*** I growled Amelia watching wide eyes ***&#34;I told you I&#39;d rather die I&#39;ve given you everything else&#34; &#34;one last thing and you can go you&#39;ve been so helpful but you will learn respect&#39;&#34; Amelia insists watching the reluctance to let him go, you pulls the pliers from the tools and a blade out of tool kit and asks me &#34;hold his mouth apart&#34; splitting his gum with the blade and tearing out his canines, letting blood pour from his mouth. The boys looking in g</p>
                
                
                
                <p>horror at Amelia&#39;s actions it is the worst punishment for a wolf. ***&#34;now you will never be able to mark a woman and God forbid you disrespect one, again. Let this be a reminder of our encounter and where your cocky attitude gets you, bag him and get him out of here, someone will find him eventually&#34;*** he spits blood at Amelia ***&#34;you flithy whore you will pay for this&#34;*** before the boys can bag him, she looks back and laughs, I take my fist and knock him unconscious, how I love sending a message, lets hope they get it loud and clear we&#39;ll be waiting. Amelia is in complete shock from her actions. ***&#34;Taking someone&#39;s canines is probably the worst thing you can do for a wolf, no marking when you find your mate, even if you find one they usually walk away when they realise they can&#39;t complete the whole process.&#34; &#34;I&#39;m aware, I didn&#39;t realise what I was capable of but that was satisfying&#34;***  I find it a huge turn on that my girl will get her hands dirty, atleast the little prick can give them the message.Amelia looking exhausted now so I usher her back to bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After last nights charade both Amelia and I relaxed and finally got to bed. She was amazing even joined in on the interrogation which was much to my delight, we make a good duo. Only thing now is this vial, her essence, possibly making her fulfill her true destiny, if it does contain all her abilities I wonder what she&#39;ll have, she&#39;s already magnificent, she&#39;ll be unstoppable too. I think they don&#39;t want me to mark until she&#39;s taken it to be able to share the abilities but we can&#39;t be sure that anything we hear is the truth. I&#39;m so nervous I can&#39;t think straight all I want is for her to be safe, I know she&#39;ll be in good hands with Mark.</p>
