                <p>I awake in a dark and dirty cellar, the smell of damp and rotting invading my nostrils. I try to move but realise I chained up so I just get myself to a sitting position. I&#39;m a little weak but if I just stay here maybe I can just regain some energy. I smell wolfsbaine but has no effect on me, I also recognise the scent here but I don&#39;t know why? **Tara are you okay? yes mate came for us but he was late I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t fight for us. It&#39;s okay it was a shock for both of us.** Maybe I shouldn&#39;t have left, maybe if I&#39;d have just got on we would be fine now. I start sobbing my pain of missing Lucas, the aches of needing him to hold me, my body just wanted Lucas at this point and now I&#39;ll never see him again. **you can&#39;t think like that Amelia, Lucas will come for us I know he will.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I try to look around for an escape plan, maybe there&#39;s something here I can use to my advantage, It&#39;s just so dark my eyes are struggling until I focus some more the more I start illuminate areas I&#39;m looking at maybe it&#39;s another ability or it&#39;s just wolf vision at it&#39;s finest. I here people beyond the room I&#39;m stuck in, shouting I try to listen, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s Romans voice. I stay silent but no one comes in I&#39;m just left here. My energy almost fully regained, I try to loosen the chains to no success their too tight. I just lay on the concrete floor thinking of all the things that had happened over the last week or so, that is until I hear, ***&#34;she should be out for atleast another 6 hours according to the dosage&#34;.*** What the hell did they give me, it obviously wasn&#39;t working on me as it should, probably my body just replenishing itself thank god for being a prophecy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Lucas Mateo Nathan anyone? I&#39;m okay I just don&#39;t know where I am please help me. Amelia you can link thank god, I know your okay I can feel it, no need to be scared though I&#39;m trying to work out where you are, we have trackers with us, and luckily your scent has been left behind so strong is shouldn&#39;t take long, I&#39;m coming for you beautiful hang tight. I&#39;m sorry I left, I love you Lucas. It&#39;s me that&#39;s sorry don&#39;t worry you&#39;ll be coming home before you know it.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Tara did you leave a strong trail, of course I did he&#39;s coming for us, he needed a little help. Thank you.** I&#39;m sat there kind of excited, he&#39;s coming for me he still loves me and most of all he&#39;s realised he was wrong. I continue to lay on the concrete floor before I here alot of shuffling and keys clanking, then the click of the door unlocking, I lift my head up and see someone I don&#39;t recognise haul me off the floor and unchained me. ***&#34;Come&#34;*** he takes me through lots of passage ways, I could hardly keep up with what turns we were taking. We enter into a well lit room and a table for two sat directly in the middle. Roman, appears from a side door dressed quite sharply. I feel disgust in my stomach and anger soaring through my veins, he was once my best friend now all I see is hatred. **Amelia control yourself don&#39;t expose your abilities.** Tara was right I need to play along for our safety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Come Amelia no need to be scared I&#39;m not going to hurt you, let&#39;s have dinner&#34;*** I just nod, and get urged to take a seat. ***&#34;How&#39;s your life been outside our pack Amelia? you look radiant as ever and you look like your taken care of well, I must thank them for taking good care of you&#34; &#34;it&#39;s good, thank you, I made some friends and what not&#34;*** food arrived and a bottle of wine. Roman poured us both a glass although it smelt cheap and nasty I took a sip. ***&#34;I&#39;m glad you had friends, people actually seeing the Amelia I&#39;ve known for years just a shame you won&#39;t be seeing them again. Don&#39;t worry you&#39;ll make new ones with me too&#34; &#34;I notice the wolfbaine hasn&#39;t affected you, sorry about that though I needed to stop you running away from me again&#34; &#34;About that Roman I never ran away, I was made rogue they said it was because of you&#34; &#34;No Amelia don&#39;t give me excuses, you ran away from me and you didn&#39;t look back&#34; &#34;Think whatever you want to think but I didn&#39;t I was made rogue and your the one who didn&#39;t protect me like you said you always would.&#34; &#34;I&#39;m very disappointed with your lying Amelia, we will have to work on them if this is what they changed you into&#34;*** I notice Roman sounds like he&#39;s lost it, he&#39;s gone full on deranged. It&#39;s definitely not the Roman I once knew. ***&#34;Amelia you need to eat&#34;*** I pick at my food not really feeling hungry I actually feel sick to my stomach. ***&#34;I&#39;m not that hungry&#34; &#34;I suppose you won&#39;t be, your away from your mate, don&#39;t worry that will soon be sorted out you will no longer wear his mark and have no connection with him rest assured&#34; &#34;Roman you have lost your mind, how could you ever think I&#39;d want you with the person you have turned into&#34; &#34;enough Amelia you have made me the way I am it is your fault you promised yourself to me and that&#39;s what will happen&#34;*** I don&#39;t even reply, he has completely lost it, there will be no reasoning with him anymore he&#39;s just bitter and angry and doesn&#39;t see the situation for what it is. **Lucas please come soon, I don&#39;t know how long I&#39;ll be able to control myself here.** ***&#34;If your not going to eat and just continue to patronise me then I think you should go back to your room, I won&#39;t stand for your spoilt bratt behaviour&#34;*** he signals the man to take me back. Thank the goddess I don&#39;t have to sit through that torture any longer, ***&#34;Is he always like that&#34;*** I mutter to the guard. ***&#34;pretty much, I don&#39;t like this as much as you but I have to protect my own too I&#39;m sorry&#34;*** bowing his head as he chains me back up ***&#34;I&#39;ll try and bring you something to eat and drink later but I can&#39;t promise&#34;*** he was put in an impossible situation too, perhaps Roman has got his family or has threats on his family. He&#39;s a changed man and not for the better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Lucas when you do come for me spare the guard, he&#39;s only doing this out of fear for his family, I think Roman has them too. How many are there beautiful?  I&#39;m only aware of Roman and a guard I haven&#39;t seen anyone else. Okay thank you Amelia please hang tight we think you&#39;ve been taken to a vineyard. If he has I know the one he would but I&#39;m not able to confirm it, I&#39;m underground in cellers it&#39;s like a maze under here. It&#39;s okay beautiful we still got your scent.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stuck in the cell again, wondering why would he bring me to the vineyard, maybe it&#39;s just a memorial thing for him and we had so many good times at the vineyard. Memories together filling my head, the laughs, the only person who mattered at that point but he&#39;s not that person anymore. I feel myself getting tired so just curl up and try to let my body rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I must have fallen asleep, I look around and find a sandwich and bottle of water the guard must have dropped them in and realised I was asleep so just left them for me. I take a sip of water and eat the sandwich thanks to the kind gesture of the guard. It actually tastes nice, and I feel a little more energy creep in. ***&#34;Amelia Roman has some clothes here for you.&#34;*** he enters the cell and hands me the clothes unchaining me for me to be able to change and turns around. ***&#34;Thank you&#34; &#34;your welcome&#34; &#34;my mate is coming when he does I want you to run and get your family I&#39;m sorry you got pulled into this mess&#34;*** he doesn&#39;t answer me but nods. Roman appears in the doorway, ***&#34;Amelia this is Revenna, she will help us with your mark and bond. It will be later on today and hopefully all will be back to normal in time.&#34;*** I don&#39;t reply I just go to sit back down and wait for everyone to leave me, it takes them a while to get the hint but eventually they leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Lucas you have to hurry, they want to undo our bond and it will happen soon. please hurry there&#39;s a witch here too.**</p>
