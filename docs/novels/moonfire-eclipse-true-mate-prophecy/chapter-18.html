                <p>Hand in hand, walking tonwards a small clearing, I notice some small twinkling as we approach close I notice a little path all lit up with tealights in jars and petals dropped perfectly along the ground, I look to where the path leads and I see a gently lit gazebo the same and petals dropped on the ground there lay a blanket and a basket. Could this man get any more perfect &#34;You did this for me?&#34; looking in amazement and disbelief why would anyone do this for plain me. &#34;I hope you like it, although I can&#39;t take all the credit I did get a little help&#34; &#34;like it? I love it, Lucas this has to be the best thing anyone has ever done for me&#34; &#34;I came across this gazebo a short time ago and thought it would be perfect for my mate, and what better time than for our first date, I even refined it up a little, I originally carved a moon on it&#39;s own but when I learnt you were a desert wolf I carved out a sun for you&#34; confusion hitting me, Im a what I&#39;ve never even hears this and most of all he knows things I dont making me a little nervous.  &#34;you are very thoughtful thank you but can we hold on and trace back a little I&#39;m a what now?&#34; &#34;your a desert wolf aren&#39;t you?&#34; am I?quizzing myself &#34;I&#39;m a wolf I know that much but desert wolf? I&#39;ve never heard of them&#34; &#34;when I first met you I felt something and everytime you came to mind, even inbetween I&#39;d feel exhausted, drained and just wanted to sleep, I went to my pack Dr and he did some research to which he found we had a developing bond which was only connected with a desert wolf, I&#39;m sorry I thought you&#39;d be able to give me insight I thought you knew&#34; he bowed his head in shame and despair, while I&#39;m left questioning everything I thought I knew about myself.  &#34;Lucas this isn&#39;t your fault, I had no idea, I was feeling that way too, I thought I was just tired until I put 2 and 2 together and worked out it had to be some form of bond but&#34; here goes I gotta reveal somethings I thought I&#39;d have some time to wait for &#34;my old packs Dr said I was perfectly fine, it was my body getting prepared for mating, as I was so small and weak compared to everyone else in the pack I know very little about myself or my past I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t be of much help I&#39;ve always been a simple wolf with no hope of a future, I&#39;ve always been treated as worthless, I&#39;m sorry I just can&#39;t give you answers of what I don&#39;t know, perhaps you should find someone more worthy&#34; His head has lifted sometime into my speech and he listened attentively, I could see his stare burning me, as my eyes started filling as a single tear fell he grabbed me into his embrace, I started to sob, &#34;shh shh shh, it&#39;s okay, I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t mean to make you cry, I didn&#39;t know, I&#39;ll be by your side whatever you chose, I love you Amelia and I&#39;m not about to let you go now, we&#39;ll get through this together if you will let me&#34; I just laid in his chest his words and his warmth, and the connection from our mate bond calming me down, he said he loves me, he wasnt letting me go he wants all of me, my heart just melted, &#34;I love you too Lucas&#34; I whispered he squeezed a little tighter. We just sat there with him holding me &#34;Amelia darling our food is here we must eat&#34; I agree, and he gives me some pasta, fruits and all sorts while he munches away himself, I can&#39;t believe I almost ruined a perfect night sighed at my own actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amelia I have a few things of my own I need to reveal so you can make an informed decision as to how you feel about me&#34; I nodded looking extremely nervous now &#34;You know I&#39;m from the Silver Stone pack, well my father is the Alpha meaning I&#39;m the next Alpha in line, that would make you a future Luna, Only we have a few obstacles in our way, now you must know I will happily give up my title to be with you. My father doesn&#39;t believe I should have my true mate, but has a chosen mate lined up for me, which is Haisley from the Black shadow pack&#34; Fear soaring through me realising that this could all go horribly wrong, I take a big gulp not knowing where I stand in all this. This is going to cause a whole lot of trouble,He glares at me trying to work out my thoughts and gently pushes &#34;was this your old pack?&#34; I nod without answering &#34;I thought as much, now you informed me your old pack, why aren&#39;t you there now? rogue?&#34; I nod again ashamed, &#34;it&#39;s okay you don&#39;t need to be so nervous I will protect you even if it costs me my life no one will bring you harm&#34; &#34;what if they blame me for all this&#34; &#34;that was going to be apart of my next question, why were you made rogue?&#34; &#34;I&#39;m not sure they blamed me for one of the warriors distractions and disappearances because he was my only friend I got the blame.&#34; &#34;My father won&#39;t happy with me having my true mate I will warn you on that he&#39;s an ass, my mother on the other hand will love you, every inch of you, I know that for sure&#34; &#34;So how are we going to make this work it could bring war between the two packs and people will get hurt because of us&#34; &#34;if I can help it that won&#39;t happen I&#39;ve already rejected Haisley as my chosen before I even knew about you and I have been rejecting for the last 6 months so that shouldn&#39;t be an issue, it&#39;s your old pack that may cause problems, with you being made rogue it could prove difficult for my dad to accept you but we will worry about that when we get to it, he may become on board but that I&#39;m unable to answer for sure right now but I will be informing him of you tomorrow and work out the rogue business, If we cant come to an agreement I will choose you everytime either way, I don&#39;t want to stay away from you longer than I have to Amelia it hurts to be away from you&#34; was there any doubt as to what I would choose this man is perfection andwilling to throw everything for plain old me, how could I not choose him just because we have a few hurdles it doesn&#39;t mean we wouldn&#39;t get through them, if we&#39;re together that&#39;s all that matters, I couldn&#39;t agree more it does hurt to be away from him &#34;It hurts me too Lucas, I choose you, all of you, I can&#39;t be away from you, I love you&#34;</p>
