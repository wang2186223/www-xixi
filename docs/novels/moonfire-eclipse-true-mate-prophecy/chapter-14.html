                <p>I&#39;ve been pumped since finding out I have a mate, desert wolf or not she&#39;s &#34;MINE.&#34; Damon has been fighting me to just go mate at every moment we have free. The masquerade party at the bunker hopefully she&#39;ll be working and I&#39;ll be able to reveal all then until then Damon would have to wait. I need to work out how I&#39;m going to play this, I&#39;m not intending to push her too fast. The exhaustion starting to subside a little now I&#39;ve accepted my mate, just like Mark said it would we just need to mate to get over that hurdle, he&#39;s uncertain of what the future may hold and what kind of obstacles will stand in the way, but everything we do it more or less the same, mate, mark, ceremony just our power comes from different sources and we have different goddesses. This is going to be an exciting rollercoaster. I&#39;ll do whatever it takes for her to be by my side. Fuck everyone else she&#39;s my true Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yesterday had been a whirlwind with Da coming back, updating him and so forth, plus my excitement of telling Mateo and Nathan of my mating bond which of course they were both over the moon but obviously I had to keep it between us three at the moment because we didn&#39;t know what the hell was going to happen between us or even if she would accept me all these thoughts going through my head as I sat at eating breakfast with Mateo, Nathan and Jackson decided to join this morning even if he didn&#39;t say a word to me or even try to look at me, I could feel the tension thickening the air. Jackson had been slowly easing himself back but avoiding me at all costs, he attends training and has some banter with Nathan because he&#39;s just too laid back to even have a confrontation, Mateo just gives out a blunt vibe with him and avoids personal talk because Mateo is extremely stubborn and hates the way he acts with me so Mateo heads to the kitchen to grab us both a cuppa, as he arrives back, looking extremely pale may I add I get a link &#34;Luc we need to talk later, just me and you ok, it&#39;s important. No problem my room after training.&#34; Ok, somethings up Mateo never holds anything back, seeing as Da is back from his trip now it&#39;s back to using my room as an office again. I&#39;ve been popping in and out on Ma she looks a little brighter, but I know she&#39;s holding back something I just need to figure out what.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the training grounds, I find myself in thought, thoughts of her, her golden eyes so soft and gentle, looking into mine while we make sweet sweet love, I can just imagine the feel of her plump lips resting on mine sparks fluttering through my body, my hands traveling over her naked body, I feel a thud to my hip I hit the ground, I look to see Nathan laughing &#34;shouldn&#39;t be so distracted this is no place for your thoughts&#34; sending a wink &#34;you only did that because you know if I wasn&#39;t in thought you wouldn&#39;t have stood a chance&#34; the rest of training went well I can feel myself getting faster, stronger and far more efficient, even some new tactics coming along. Evan blows the whistle to indicate training is over,  Mateo running over to me &#34;Shower then your room I&#39;ll probably be around 30 minutes&#34; I nod in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m sat on the sofa flicking through the channels trying to see if there&#39;s anything decent to watch with no luck on that front, Mateo jumps on the sofa without me even realising he&#39;d come in. &#34;So bro what&#39;s up? you&#39;ve been acting weird all day this isn&#39;t just a chit chat so spit it out.&#34; I call out sturnly &#34;It&#39;s Jackson, I think he wants your title&#34; I feel the colour drain from my face &#34;You what?&#34; &#34;I overheard two omegas training to be warriors talking about Jackson fighting for the alpha title&#34; the little prick, all over a frigging fling and he wants my title because he didn&#39;t get his way, I knew he was big-headed at times and loved the respect he got and sometimes expected more but seriously. &#34;who does he think he is I&#39;m gonna...&#34; Mateo butt&#39;s in before I can finish &#34; You can&#39;t just got throwing your weight around it isn&#39;t going to be that simple we have to think strategically here&#34; &#34;You&#39;re right, work out his plan, and use it against him&#34; &#34;now your thinking like an alpha, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea telling Nathan just yet, you know how he can lose his head as calm as he is but when it comes to life threatening,  it&#39;s a different story you should know that&#34; &#34;I also can&#39;t keep things from him it&#39;s brotherly code we&#39;re talking about here&#34; &#34;what you gonna do then Luc&#34; &#34;tell him and hope he keeps his head together but I can&#39;t keep it from him&#34; Mateo nods with a slightly concerned face. &#34;so plans?&#34; &#34;you try and uncover what you can about his intentions and if he is actually trying to plot against me and as for me...&#34; &#34;as for you, you will focus on your mate for now until I need you to take action I will keep you updated right now though I gotta get going but catch you inabit,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Guys movie and a few beers at mine tonight.&#34; sending a link to Nathan and Mateo it&#39;s a good excuse to have time to tell Nathan what&#39;s going on without him getting suspicious in the meantime. &#34;Cool you need me to bring anything?&#34;  Nathan replied almost instantly. &#34;No just yourself. mateo you in?. Yeah I&#39;m in thought that would have been clear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I open a beer and search for a movie, jarhead, seems like a good shout war, action and teaming up, Mateo and Nathan walk in I toss them both a beer, and let them know I&#39;ve already chosen a film, I head for the kitchen to grab 2 bowls one with toffee popcorn and the other is full of potato chips. Finally, I turn towards Nathan and say &#34;Look bud tonight isn&#39;t just about us bonding I also have something to share with you. I need you to keep calm and keep your shit together got it&#34; he nods nervously waiting for me to spill, &#34;Jackson has intentions to take over the alpha title, we don&#39;t know his full intentions but what we do know is he wants me out the picture.&#34; &#34;the ass that he is he will stand no chance I&#39;m gonna go over there...&#34; &#34;you will not do anything yet we don&#39;t know what he has planned already we just need to be prepared to use his plans against him.&#34; &#34;Methodical I actually kinda like it.&#34; &#34; Mateo you find anything further?&#34; &#34;Actually alpha one of the omegas from this morning approached me about Jackson&#39;s intentions and how he would inform me of anything I needed to know, he&#39;s trying to start a rebellion for when you take the title so he can give himself enough time to get people on board and figure out how he&#39;s going to do it all&#34; &#34;thank you let&#39;s keep this one at arm&#39;s length though it could be part of a plan or trap he could be feeding false information&#34; Nathan and Mateo nod in unison. We finish up the beers and film and it&#39;s time to call it a night.</p>
