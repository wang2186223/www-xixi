I neeee&#34;*** She turns sharply wrapping her arms around me her tear stained face telling me she&#39;s been beside herself. ***&#34;It&#39;s okay I&#39;m here, I just need water&#34;*** my mouth like sand paper. Nathan hands over the glass with a straw. ***&#34;thanks&#34; &#34;don&#39;t do this to me again I thought I was losing you&#34; &#34;can&#39;t get rid of me that easy beautiful&#34;*** letting out a chuckle I actually feel 1000 times better than before, Amelia must have put some healing into this too. ***&#34;How long was I out?&#34; &#34;long enough we only have an hour until we meet Da&#34;*** shit I had been out a long time, didn&#39;t feel that long though. ***&#34;I&#39;m gonna grab a shower and change&#34; &#34;no worries I&#39;ll fix us up a bite to eat&#34;.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia fixed up some breakfast rolls for us all, smells just as amazing at they tasted. ***&#34;thanks Amelia&#34;*** everyone muttered with their mouths full. Mark decided to make an appearance, ***&#34;I see you&#39;ve come around well&#34; &#34;That I have, I&#39;m ready&#34; &#34;do you mind if I check a few vitals to make sure?&#34; &#34;you carry on doc&#34;*** he continued to check everything ***&#34;cool as a cucumber as they say, I would say good luck but you wouldn&#39;t need it anyway&#34; &#34;cheers, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll need to check me over later&#34; &#34;probably, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be fine though&#34;*** Mark exits hastily. ***&#34;Come on we need to make a move too&#34;***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heading across the field noticing the crowds already building, people patting me on the back while I&#39;m not taking much notice, trying to keep a calm and composed approach while inside I&#39;m a bag of nerves. I see my father making his way across the field, my nerves suddenly turning to anger. Meeting in the middle, Da has a smirk across his face, ***&#34;I hope you said your goodbyes son.&#34;*** I don&#39;t even give him the satisfaction in replying. The council make their way over to us stopping central to us. ***&#34;First things first, do you Lucas still want to challenge for Alpha?&#34; &#34;I do&#34; &#34;Brandon do you accept the challange?&#34; &#34;wouldn&#39;t be here otherwise&#34;*** answering cockily ***&#34;Right now that&#39;s clear, rules are as follows, no weapons, no outside support, do not exit the marked out area. if you want to surrender two taps to the ground. You may fight in either of your forms are we understood gentlemen?&#34;*** both nodding in agreement. ***&#34;You may now take your places and good luck&#34;*** the words ringing in my ears as I took a defending position feeling a little sick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We circle around for a while, I&#39;m not taking the first throw, I&#39;d rather start in human form anyway, Damon comes out later, **Good choice.** Damon holding back at present. My father lets out a chuckle ***&#34;thought you came here to fight not play ring of roses&#34;*** he&#39;s trying to get to me, ***&#34;surprised you know the game, Ma taught me&#34;*** smirking back. His face straightened out, almost trying to fight back the anger. He made his way closer, He&#39;s planning on his moves, he throws in a few punches, I dodge and block them quickly changing my stance from defence to attacking laying in some hard punches into his ribs backing off again to defend, ***&#34;you&#39;ve trained hard boy but not hard enough&#34;*** he throwing in some hard kicks to my thigh. Barely making me flinch, he&#39;s weak, he&#39;s gonna turn dirty I know it now. I lunge forward throwing another sequence, avoiding his blocks and shuffling myself around quickly to gain the upper hand, I manage to throw in a right hook to his jaw making a cracking noise. Raising his hand to his mouth and spitting the blood away, ***&#34;Let&#39;s see how you like this&#34;*** throwing punches one catches my rib and one my shoulder it hurt like hell but doesn&#39;t stop me from counter attacking and gripping him to the floor, ***&#34;Why are you doing this?&#34; &#34;You will never make it as Alpha&#34;*** spitting in my face, I step back to let him get to his feet, he&#39;s looking at me puzzled, ***&#34;What the wolfsbain? I do smell it, but you know what it has no affect on me so give it your best shot&#34;*** I can see I&#39;ve angered him so he shifts. Amelia&#39;s tension soaring through me, but my own focus drowns it out again. I stay in my human form and use my speed and agility to avoid him. **He&#39;s tired, let me out, let&#39;s end this, no more playing Lucas.** In that second I launched myself to the air shifting the same time, Damon manages to get a grip on his back paw more or less crunching it in his jaw hearing a yelp coming from Da snarling and flashing his pearly whites, blood covering his beautiful fur. Now he&#39;s angry. Da now had to rely on 3 legs, feeling more hyped myself, Da was slowing but his strength still remained, tearing of flesh from Damon, Damon now switched into tactics and started to prance around Da like it was a game, taking a bite here and there. Da caught on Damons back end ripping out massive chunk. Blood now cover both our coats, Damon was ready to finish him with that launching himself around trying to get to an optimum position. Da looking confused and uneasy on how things turning out, Damon speared himself for the last time pinning Da to the floor, barely able to breath. **Didn&#39;t expect these turn of events, that little bitch of yours will never be able to live a normal life and the path you chose, you will be punished for.** Damon clenched his jaw around Da&#39;s throat, snapping his neck with pure force, and tearing a massive chunk with it, spitting it out to the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take a moment to regain my thoughts after what just happened, he honestly tried to kill me, nor did he show any remorse for what he had done, he&#39;s proved what I&#39;d done had to be done. I couldn&#39;t help but allow my emotions to take over as I lay over his body, Amelia running over with a blanket for me, my wounded my wounded body didn&#39;t feel any physical pain in that moment. Just the emotion of killing my father and him not even caring about anything he had put me through even after that I still loved him. Amelia wrapping herself around me too, slightly comforting me. ***&#34;Sorry to disrupt you but Lucas you must mix your blood in order to come Alpha and a true Alpha&#34;*** the council man suggested. Sliced mine and my fathers hand with our ceremonial blade and allowed out blood to mix while I healed, I felt the power washing through me the shift in position evident within me, Amelia feeling it pass through her too. The feeling quickly disappeared, being replaced with loss and despair. I had done it I wasn&#39;t sure we would be able too. If it wasn&#39;t for Damon leveling us out and pushing all the emotional attachments away don&#39;t think we would have had the outcome we did. I begin to sob uncontrollably, I loved him, my own flesh and blood I killed him, and he hated me. Anger beginning to soar through me, Amelia looked terrified of me in that moment. None of this would have happened if it wasn&#39;t for her. ***&#34;Lucas don&#39;t let this get the better of you&#34; &#34;It&#39;s all because of you!&#34;***</p>
