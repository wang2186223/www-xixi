                <p>Sitting in the library with Roman trying to do some reading. He hates reading but knows I love it, so does it anyway for me. Roman is tall nicely tanned well built and mouth wateringly handsome, and probably the only person nice to me at this point he acts as my protector. He&#39;s training to be a warrior so gets some stick sometimes for hanging out with me but doesn&#39;t let it get to him, I frown at the thought it&#39;s because of me. Thoughts trailing off to hoping he is my true mate since he&#39;s my best and only friend, even my parents left me. &#34;Amelia you seem in thought again&#34; &#34;sorry just getting distracted recently&#34; I get back to my book, roman doesn&#39;t press he knows how tough things can get sometimes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The black shadow pack isn&#39;t all bad, I follow my duties and chores as an omega, I get rewarded with food and necessities to survive and most importantly full access to the library. I use the library as my school, my getaway and my safe haven since no one really comes here. Although we don&#39;t have access to schools or colleges, they do throw on some essential classes at times for survival skills, pack education and what not but none of real interest to me. Reading and gymnastics is where my passion lies, sounds weird a wolf doing gymnastics but it gives a sense of pride I never get from anything else. Tara my wolf loves the excitement and thrill I get from the tricks also helps her in some ways brings her strength and different aspect of defence she never thought was possible when we started. After What seemed to be hours in my own thoughts Roman nudges me to break my thoughts &#34;it&#39;s 3 already&#34; Roman uttered, oh crap I need to finish the chores quickly before I can use the gymnasium. Rushing to shove everything in my bag before heading out thanking Roman on the way out. How ever am I going to finish everything get to the gym go let Tara out for a run and get to work all by 7pm. May not be the best job in the world but it gives me money to get me by, Bunkers probably one of the busiest nightclubs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>5pm I finally finished this evening chores I head to the alpha&#39;s office. Seeing Haisley and Libby heading out from the office sending chills down my spine as Haisley laughs and utters &#34;little skank&#34; tripping me up sending me flying toward the office. I pull myself up shrug it off no use acting only gets me punished seen as she is the gamma&#39;s daughter and looks at me like a slave as does everyone else, its only because I have no real parents I don&#39;t really know the full extent but Alpha and Luna took me in and have provided shelter for me but it came at a cost I&#39;m basically a slave for everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knock the big hard wood door, Alpha Ryder opens the door with a half hearted smile &#34;Amelia what can I do for you today?&#34; &#34;Alpha may I use the gymnasium for 30 minutes I have completed my chores for today&#34; I said bowing my head to him awaiting approval. &#34;If you must&#34; I nodded thanking him for his act of kindness. I head to the gym and send my alarm for 25 minutes to allow myself enough time to clear up and head out for Tara run before I get ready for work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The time flew by as I jump in the warm shower nursing my aching body from my workout. Thoughts of Roman invading my head his perfect body, his sparkling eyes, large strong hands caressing my creamy white body. I drag myself from my thoughts biting my lip giving myself a flushed appearance. Please goddess let it be him I whispered to myself, dragging myself out the shower put some Moroccan oil in my hair, blow dry to throw it up into a messy bun as I begin getting organised for work in Bunkers. Put on some light make up, my well worn skinny jeans, my pink and grey plaid shirt with ¾ length sleeves, put on my pumps and good to go, checking the time its 6.40. Quickly deciding I&#39;ll eat at work takes 15 minutes run to get there. Check the fridge to find a pasta and salad with note. Enjoy work don&#39;t forget to eat - Roman. &#34;Thank you Bud&#34; my heart warmed sending him a link remembering my thoughts of earlier I blush again. No worries I knew you wouldn&#39;t have time to make anything. Please goddess be him. Only a month to find out but Roman won&#39;t know until he turns 18 the following week, I sigh heavily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh god I&#39;m gonna be late 6.55 by my phone I sprint out the door. I arrive at work at 12 minutes past. &#34;Oh, Amelia your here you look exhausted everything okay?&#34; Mr Powell looking over me. &#34;Sorry I&#39;m late I rushed and got here soon as I could&#34; &#34;nonsense dear its fine have you eaten?&#34;. I held up the food Roman made me, he cared for me like a father would his own. &#34;Now go grab yourself a drink and have food and meet me behind the bar once your done, not before flower.&#34; Giving me no way to argue with him which I loved he cared so much for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Starting to pick up now its 8pm the usual time. making sure we had glasses clean and ready to go, I notice Haisley and Libby walk in, I sigh heavily just my luck. They immediately take a seat at the reserved table, two cosmos put it on the tables tab. I weave in and out of the crowd already building and come to the table and place their drinks down &#34;Anything else?&#34; I muttered, without an an answer Haisley just shooed me away without even looking at me. I can&#39;t wait for the day I actually stand up for myself, well if it ever comes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hit me like I&#39;d been hit by a double decker bus, the power radiating through the room, high ranking wolves four to be exact, they all look mouth wateringly divine I don&#39;t recognise them so they must be from another pack. I see one heading towards the bar, copper soft curls, emerald green eyes with hues of brown, just enough stubble, chiselled jaw line and to top it off the perfectly defined body of a God surely he&#39;s got to be an Alpha &#34;Excuse me can I get 3 beers a morgans and coke and 4 blue essence shots please&#34; flashing a devilish smile. &#34;Sure, can I get you a tray to carry everything&#34; &#34;That would be awesome, so who are the beautiful girls in our booth they regulars or?&#34; &#34;Actually no they&#39;re not but their names are Haisley and Libby&#34; I said rolling my eyes &#34;Oh you don&#39;t seem too fond of them by rolling them eyes&#34; saying suggestively. &#34;We just don&#39;t get along&#34;* sending a frown across my face. &#34;If there&#39;s nothing else it will be..&#34; &#34;put it on a tab for the table&#34;  cutting me off half way through my sentence and turned to walk away. Well that was abit rude I thought to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a busy hour I find myself ogling over them all again except Libby and the copper hair guy had disappeared. One of the three looked disinterested in anything that was going on just drank his drink and left them to it, guard maybe? After serving a few others, I notice the guy not at the table but leaning with his back toward the bar. &#34;Hey what can I get you?&#34;  with no reply or even acknowledgement id even spoke. &#34;Look if you don&#39;t want a drink please move, I don&#39;t mean to be rude but people are waiting.&#34; my voice came out a little harsher than anticipated. &#34;sorry&#34; with an apologic look on his face my goddess he is a work of art, ice blue eyes with subtle tints of silver, morning stubble, honey blonde loose curls almost perfectly styled, without letting off the fact I&#39;ve spent this time completely over whelmed by him. &#34;I&#39;ll take a morgans and coke please&#34; &#34;Coming up but you look at unease people come here to let loose, if its your first time, I recommend our gin infusion usually help calm the nerves.&#34; giving a suggestively look. &#34;Worked here long?&#34; he gently pressed. &#34;The last 6 months or so its a job its pays&#34; my frown apparent by now I didn&#39;t like people questioning me about what I do. &#34;Sorry didn&#39;t mean to press just making conversation.&#34; &#34;Its fine, enjoy the rest of your night&#34; he turned to go back to his table, maybe he was just generally being nice either way I shrugged it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I serve a few more then start to get all the trash building up behind the bar. I exit the side door, I can feel eyes burning the back of my, I turn to find Haisley staring like she looking right through me. She burst into a laughter while gripping my arm like a vice uttering  &#34;don&#39;t go ruining this for me now or I&#39;ll show everyone the skank you are&#34;. I feel my arm burning from her grip, she let my arm go spitting at me as turned on her heel to walk away. I frown and look down at my arm to see the bruising already disappearing thanks to Tara I dont understand what I did wrong this time though. With that I head back inside to finish my shift without any other troubles hopefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A couple of hours later after keeping myself incredibly busy to avoid any chit chat with anyone, everything started to cal. 3am now and Mr Powell is approaching, &#34;well Amelia you have kept yourself busy tonight and I think someone may have taken an interest as they left you a hefty tip&#34;.  &#34;Who?&#34; I blurted out without thinking. &#34;That I can&#39;t answer there was just an bundle of cash for the bartender with golden eyes&#34;</p>
