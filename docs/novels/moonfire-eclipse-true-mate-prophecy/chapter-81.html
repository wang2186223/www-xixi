                <p>I let Amelia do her thing while I finished, sorting the bed out for her to sit comfortably. Amelia climbs into bed, she moves her pillows around after me shuffling everything around but I suppose she needs them where she needs them. I press play on the film and bring the tray between us and bring a strawberry with some cream on to her mouth, she accepingly opens her mouth to recieve my given pleasure, I hear her groaning, that sounds like music to my ears sending a yearning through my blood awakening my member with it. We continued to feed eachother with the delecacies I had arranged for us before I knew it one thing was leading to another, except I have to be a little more gentle than normal now that she&#39;s coming to the end of her pregnancy. I slowly let me tongue penetrate her mouth allowing our saliva to mix, making her pant ever so slightly at the pleasure, while I&#39;m caressing every inch of her gorgeous body, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever found her so sexy. Her body just reacting to every touch and ever breath, I stimulate her nipples and suck on them making her groan and twitch, I love that her senses are so heightening only adding to my pleasure. I let my lips trail their way down to her waiting flower making her jerk as I reach her clit. I continue to roll my tongue over her sparking more moans and groans from her making her body react increasingly more intentense, I slide my fingers into her entrance, slowly pentrating her walls, reaching around for her little g spot every time I hit it I get a loud moan in appreciation, I feel Amelia&#39;s body contracting around my fingers tightly knowing she&#39;s close to her climax, I pick up my pace and flick her bean with my tongue vigourously and I feel her warm juices coating my fingers as I slide them out I allow my mouth to taste her sweet nectar making me groan and pant as my member starts becoming inpatient. I bring myself up to her entrance, ***&#34;you ready beautiful?&#34; &#34;yes please Lucas&#34; &#34;tell me if I&#39;m too rough or it&#39;s too much&#34;*** I slowly push myself into her sweet entrance, and allow Amelia to adjust herself to a comfortable postiton only to my pleasure I groan louder, ***&#34;ohhh Amelia you feel devine&#34;*** I allow my hips to thrust in a steady pace, not too hard either to ensure Amelia&#39;s comfort and my god it feels better while she&#39;s pregnant, her walls and lips swollen. Making me reach closer into my own climax, I want to wait for Amelia to come closer to her own so I ease off slightly letting her build up as am I, as I feel her body now screaming at me to give her more I begin to pick up and give it harder, making her moan and pant harder and faster and I feel myself falling over the edge, I feel Amelia already in her climax, I give a few more power thrusts finally meeting my own release spilling into her now exhausted but clammy body, as I lay to her side. ***&#34;thanks Lucas, didn&#39;t realise I needed that.&#34; &#34;me either but it paid off&#34;*** my body still burning and member still going strong, I&#39;m extremely satified and clearly so is Amelia as she instantly starting to fall asleep, I just nestle into her arm and allow myself to drift away into the clouds too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, we managed to get a long lie in, no one had disturbed us, I awoke with the sun blaring through the windows, Amelia stayed sound asleep so I got up and cleared up our mess from last night and got cooking on brunch seen as it was gone breakfast time and coming up to lunch, I thought bacon and cheese turnovers and a sausage and egg baguette. Amelia must have smelt the food cooking and woddled into the kitchen area, ***&#34;breakfast smells good&#34; &#34;yes Amelia but, it is now brunch we slept late so I thought I&#39;d make us something to eat.&#34; &#34;Why what time is it?&#34; &#34;coming up to half 12 beautiful so your well rested and don&#39;t worry I have been informed the party isn&#39;t until 4 so we have plenty of time to lounge around until we get ready&#34; &#34;thank goddess for that I don&#39;t think I could hack rushing&#34; &#34;there would be no rushing anyway you are the Luna and they will wait on you.&#34;*** Amelia took her seat at the table to await her food. ***&#34;You know what Lucas, I think this place is going to perfect when we work out everything for our pup but we need to start thinking about buying certain things&#34; &#34;We can after this afternoon we will have more of an idea on colours and so on&#34;*** I completely forgot we haven&#39;t bought anything for here as I already kitted everything out in my parents home which is almost ready, so I was going to surprise her on the weekend after they complete the final touches. ***&#34;Perhaps we can go on the weekend?&#34; &#34;sounds good to me&#34;*** we continued to talk while we eat about baby names and what not Amelia is convinced it&#39;s a boy, so came up with some boy names but one that stood out for us was Nico, Nico Silverstone, sounds perfect, I&#39;m just happy with a healthy pup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Amelia straightens herself out after more sex she seems to be enjoying it more recently, it&#39;s got to be the hormones playing up. I run Amelia a bath after my shower and place her in and leave her to soak and clear herself up, ready for our gender reveal party. Once Amelia returned from her bath she continued to look through the wardrobe on what to wear, she decided on a grey neutral dress, flowy, didn&#39;t hug her bump but didn&#39;t hide either, it was perfect, I opted for casual jeans and a grey/silver shirt to match with Amelia. Amelia continued to curl her hair and put some light make up to make sort of effort even if she was starting to feel a little tired, I tried to tell her she should have taken a short nap this afternoons sex but she knew better, hopefully she will get the chance to escape early and catch a nap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We headed down to the field where they set up a marquee, all the decroations blue and pink, they looked so beautiful and everything tied together nicely, then I spotted a 4 tier cake perfectly iced and gorgeously decorated with a baby on top I still had no clue what we were having, I thought maybe they would have swayed more toward one colour than the other as a slight hint but no everything was evenly distributed. ***&#34;Hey looking forward to finding out?&#34;*** mateo nudged, ***&#34;as long as my pup is healthy I&#39;m not worried.&#34;*** I assured. ***&#34;Bet you want a boy though carry the Alpha genes an all&#34; &#34;na my pup can be whatever they want to be if they don&#39;t want to be alpha they won&#39;t.&#34; &#34;come on now is that Amelia talking?&#34; &#34;no actually I came up with it, I don&#39;t want them to have that pressure to be the perfect alpha or even take the title if they don&#39;t want to&#34; &#34;your going soft, too soft if you ask me&#34;*** I watched Amelia from the corner of my eye mingling well, but I can see being on her feet is straining her a little now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Amelia please take a seat, you don&#39;t need to over do yourself. everytime I go to sit someone else comes along it&#39;s becoming a chore, it may do some good to stand anyway. Well make sure you rest your legs too and don&#39;t tire yourself out too much.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a period of greeting everyone, and everyone writing in their guesses, Mark makes announcement that it&#39;s time to reveal, there are 6 people standing there with confetti cannons and two black balloons I&#39;m guessing theres one each for us to pop he hands us both a wooden skewer to pop them. Mark explains to us that when he gets to one we can pop the balloons which will reveal the gender of our pup. Nerves setting in for the both of us now, Mark starts his count down ***&#34;3......2......1....&#34;*** *Bang* the confetti cannons went off the same time as we popped the balloon pink and white confetti floating throught the air we suddenly came to realisations of we are a having a girl, tears of joy running down Amelia&#39;s face while I wrap my arms around her. ***&#34;She will be the perfect princess anyone could ever ask for&#34;***</p>
