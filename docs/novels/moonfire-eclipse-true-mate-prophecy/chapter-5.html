                <p>&#34;I AM YOUR CHOSEN MATE&#34; going through my head more times than I can count since last night. I was lucky to keep control with Damon trying his best to push through, I&#39;ve barely slept with those words playing around my head. I knew it I knew it, I told them something was off the minute they didn&#39;t have a scent. It was a set up and I walked right into the trap, my father giving me free time, to her being there. When will he realise I am not taking a chosen mate. I can&#39;t confront him yet, Damon and I need to calm down first or it will be world war 3, I won&#39;t be able to keep my composure and Damon will come to surface and thats something I need to avoid at all costs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Spoken to Jackson yet?&#34;  Mateo hates us all arguing but we are all so stubborn, this time I am not making an apology. &#34;Nope why should I? he was out of line by a million miles. I get it but you do need make up at some point we are brothers in all this. I&#39;m not taking the blame for fact his attitude sucked before she blurted out her all her bullshit.&#34; After that it was awkward so I called the taxi to come get us. &#34;Mat it was like an explosion went off in the taxi back. It was my fault she didn&#39;t go home with him, my fault he didn&#39;t get his leg over and what hurt the most is he said &#34;im going to be a weak pointless Alpha so why on earth would I apologise. I get it man but you can&#39;t go on like that&#34;I dont even link back, all she wants is power, domination and wealth the three things whores like her look for, then all of a sudden images of the bartender come to mind, her golden eyes, her mixed blonde messy bun looked like her hair was dyed but there was no indication it wasn&#39;t natural, there were no signs of regrowth or missed patches it was perfect so it had to be natural, honestly I&#39;ve never seen anyone with such golden eyes, breath taking and more importantly she treated me as a normal person not alpha just plain old me, quite liked being normal for once, my thoughts giving exhaustion and alot of tension, really gotta think about what&#39;s going on with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This tension and exhaustion is totally overwhelming, I&#39;ve trained hard lately but after the events of last night just added to it, so I drag myself from bed telling myself a shower will help. I like the shower to run until hot and steamy, I jump feeling the water take some of the tension away letting out a deep sigh. I lather up the shampoo, put it through my hair feeling the soap run down my body, when images of the bartender last night come to mind again, her head would probably only meet my chest, she&#39;s seems in amazing shape curves in all the right places looking like a goddess even if her clothes were on the larger side you could still see her silhouette. Flashing images of cupping her peachy cheeks bringing her into my embrace, feeling her soft lips brush against my neck sending pulses through my veins. I stop myself in my trailing thoughts I&#39;ve never thought of anyone like that before, never even felt even remotely interested could it be? I am the next alpha after all its possible I met her early. Maybe, just maybe, all I can do it hope at this point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>8.30 time for breakfast I guess heading down the stairs to the dining room, though some the tension lifted, it seemed my exhaustion had not. Perhaps Dr Preston will have something to help with that. Dr Preston have you got 15 minutes later? I need to run something by you linking in with the pack doctor, one amazing doctor at that. Yes Lucas I have some time around 3 if you can make it, I&#39;ll have some coffee ready for you. Thank you catch you later letting out a sigh of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sit down taking some bacon, egg, sausage and toast Mateo bringing me my coffee. &#34;Lucas you look like shit, did you even go to bed?&#34;  looking at me mouth agape, Damon pushing out a growl, &#34;matter of fact is did sleep, just not an awful lot&#34; &#34;We have training in an hour you know that right&#34; seemingly shocked Mateo uttered out. &#34;Yes I am aware and will be attending&#34; trying to drop the subject. Nathan strolls over casually &#34;Wow you...&#34; &#34;look like shit, I&#39;m aware&#34; not letting him finish. &#34;Take it Jackson isn&#39;t joining this morning?&#34; Mateo cautiously brought up &#34;Can you blame him after his behaviour last night, he&#39;s probably gonna bow his head in shame for a few days&#34; Nathan replied smirking away. &#34;Boys I will see you on the field I&#39;m gonna let Damon a quick run first&#34; leaving my half eaten breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I head for the tree line stripping off and placing my clothes in a bag hanging it on a branch close by. &#34;You ready for this.&#34; Damon shifting us into our wolf form, his silver fur glistening in the sunlight letting out a howl before heading into to the forrestry, hearing his paw pound the ground becoming lighter the faster we went, everything a blur Damon feeling on top form doing abit of hunting while we&#39;re here. We come a across an old gazebo by a pond in a small clearing thinking this must look magical in the moonlight. &#34;We will have to bring mate here.&#34;  Damon being all soft on me. I was thinking the same thing maybe can be our own little getaway. &#34;Come on Damon best get back we&#39;ll miss training.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shifting back to my human form throwing my clothes back on and walking on the field where Mateo and Nathan already warming up. &#34;feeling better now you let him out&#34;  Nathan asked I shrug it off. &#34;Come on Luc you never look that exhausted&#34; Mateo implied &#34;Just under alot of pressure at the moment I&#39;ll just sleep it off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Training went on for what seem like hours, I kept pushing and pushing myself, feeling my whole body ache, the exhaustion washing over me again. Evan checking the time 12pm. &#34;Good session guys catch you tomorrow morning&#34;1 applauding them with pride he really does put his heart and soul into training everyone, I just hope Nathan is just as proud as he, he will make a good trainer one day. Time for a shower hopefully it will help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lunch already starting to be cooked as I head up for another shower to take away the aches and bruising. Thanks to my wolf abilities I&#39;m fully healed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>again. Throwing on some slack clothes fisting my hand through my hair to try and give some sort of shape, put some sneakers on, good to go. Taccos for lunch, smells heavenly gives the place such a delightful aroma with all the different components. I head for the dining room inhaling every ounce I can realising just how hungry I am.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take a seat while I wait for the boys to come join me and for food to come out, my stomach now growling after not eating a full breakfast this morning. Nathan comes to join me &#34;you look abit better,&#34; saying it with extreme caustion not to offend again. &#34;Yeh feeling a little better but it&#39;s coming in waves so just on abit of a rollercoaster in all aspects I guess&#34; letting out a sigh. &#34;we got your back no matter what bro&#34; Mateo appears from out of space patting me on the shoulder, I nod in appreciation. Thank goddess food is here checking my phone 2pm already I have an hour, letting out a sigh I need some answers I can&#39;t act like this is going away, I&#39;m supposed to be the next alpha for goodness sake. I start to tuck in to food by the time I finish my second tacco I&#39;m ready for desert. I see Nova hovering around, I give her a call out and wave her over, &#34;Lucci!!!&#34; she screams in excitement. &#34;Hey sunshine do you know if we have desert? I need something sweet just like you&#34;  &#34;l&#39;ll go check for you&#34; Nova is just the sweetest girl ever, browny blonde hair long loose curls with a slight frizz, she&#39;s 8 so I can get away with pet names for now. I&#39;ve always treated her like a sister, she might aswell be with me and Nathan being so close. &#34;Sorry but no desert until tonight&#34; frowning at me. &#34;It&#39;s okay, I&#39;ll have you instead&#34;  throwing her over my shoulder playfully pretending to nibble at her legs hearing her laugh so infectious. &#34;Lucci put me down I&#39;m gonna pee&#34;. I put her on her feet,  gently giving her a hug before she runs off before she ends making a puddle on the floor. &#34;She&#39;s so adorable&#34; watching her walk away. &#34;Your gonna make an awesome dad&#34; Nathan exclaims, &#34;I&#39;ll do my best&#34;. I check my phone 2.50 &#34;gotta make a move&#34; &#34;catch you later bro&#34;  they both say in unison.</p>
