                <p>One by one the girls walked down the aisle, ***&#34;Rich I&#39;m scared everyone is staring&#34; &#34;can&#39;t say I blame them your a goddess youself, just hold on to me and look at the end of the aisle you will be fine&#34; &#34;thank you&#34;*** I whispered at his comforting words. This was it my moment to walk, seemed like it took forever, Lucas staring at me the whole time, I could feel the love radiating from us, he looked amazing, charcoal grey 3 price suit, silver ties and pocket square, his hair has the messy but put together look, his eyes sparkling in the lights that surrounded us and of course that stubble, he looked like a God. As I come to the end of the aisle I see his eyes welling up a little, ***&#34;you are my goddess Amelia, I&#39;ve never seen anyone so beautiful&#34; &#34;thank you, very handsome yourself&#34;.*** Rich places my hands into Lucas&#39;s ***&#34;please take care of my girl&#34; &#34;like my life depends on it&#34;.*** Brandon clears his throat to gather everyone&#39;s attention, to proceed. ***&#34;As you are aware we are here today to join Amelia and Lucas in marriage and to complete their mating ceremony&#34; &#34;we would like to thank you all for coming and sharing this special moment in our son and soon to be daughters lives. I believe they have prepared their own vows. So Lucas we will start with yours,&#34;***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;okay thank you, Amelia when I first met you, there was something about you, I didn&#39;t understand it, but turns out I found my true Luna that night, you are my light in the dark, my shoulder to cry on, my strength, my weakness and everything in between. I will spend the rest of my life caring, supporting, protecting and loving you, I couldn&#39;t of asked for a better wife than I have in you&#34;.*** Okay how am I supposed to match that. ***&#34;Amelia and yours&#34;*** nodding at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;How am I supposed to match such a beautiful speech I don&#39;t know but, Lucas you are my saviour my God and I am truly blessed I was chosen for you. You make me happy when I&#39;m down, laugh when I cry, your my home when I&#39;m lost. I never thought I&#39;d find love like this, but I stand here now filled with love and joy as I look in to your eyes I see our present and future together as one.&#34;*** Lucas actually shedding tears nd his hand starting to shake.***&#34;rings please can you now exchange rings,&#34;*** as we exchange our rings, his father babbles other things, you may now kiss your bride. Finally Lucas kissed me hard and deep, before I knew it both our canines were protruding, time to re mark. ***&#34;You are now Husband and wife, and Your mating ritual will continue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas rushes me to the bedroom where we complete mating, only this time we made love sweet sweet love. ***&#34;we have been here a long time now Amelia, I think we should head down and join the party before we shift to complete the ritual&#34;.*** I nod in agreement but I was enjoying having him to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We join the party, greeting some guests, people telling us it&#39;s such a beautiful wedding, how amazing we looked together. ***&#34;It&#39;s almost time Amelia will Nina and Rich be okay with the shifting or would you like me to keep them busy? I won&#39;t be shifting either way.&#34;*** I know they knew everything but I still didn&#39;t think they would be able to be fine with seeing this. ***&#34;could you keep them busy then as I don&#39;t want them to get frightened at everyone shifting, thanks Ma&#34; &#34;my pleasure Amelia&#34;*** as she takes them to the packhouse to ask about recipes and so on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha announces ***&#34;it&#39;s now time for Lucas and Amelia to complete the mating ritual by shifting and the rest of the pack will follow***. Lucas shifts quickly and nods to me to indicate its time , he howls at the moon and looks over to me shifting in my space Damon and Tara both extremely happy to be with eachother, nuzzling into one an other. To fully complete our bond Tara and Damon must mate which wasn&#39;t an issue for them they were more than happy. Both exhausted after hunting playing and mating they lay down for a short while just enjoying eachothers company. Time to head back everyones heading home, there&#39;s a blanket on the post ready for you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After an eventful night we literally had no energy left for anything other than wrapping ourselves up into a blanket and going to sleep in eachothers arms ***&#34;I love you hubby&#34; &#34;I love you too wifey&#34;.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally we&#39;re fully mated and married. Amelia had no idea what was coming next I&#39;d planned our honeymoon as soon as she said yes to Saturday. We would leave this evening on a plane to Greece I&#39;m glad she has no idea yet, just lucky we have a private jet saves having to go through the whole airport and what not, the family have a property in Greece that wasn&#39;t being used so why not make the most of it. I have my girl all to myself, doing whatever we please I couldn&#39;t be a happier man right now. It&#39;s also an escape from all the drama we have back here, we need to get away from it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Good morning beautiful, how is my wife on this fine morning?&#34; &#34;I&#39;m very well thank you how about you?&#34; &#34;I&#39;m the happiest man alive Amelia, how about going down for breakfast this morning, so I can show you off as my wife&#34; &#34;I&#39;d love to I&#39;ll just go get something appropriate on and we&#39;ll head down&#34; &#34;no worries&#34;*** I know Amelia prefers to have breakfast just the two of us but we should start being with the pack members more so they can get to know her and her them. I&#39;m not too sure when Da plans on us taking over the pack but I&#39;m pretty sure it won&#39;t be too long Ma is getting worse, I&#39;m sure when Amelia is more capable of controlling herself more she will do what she can for my Ma until then we can&#39;t risk both of them in the process.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We get down to breakfast the with hall cheering as we enter as newly weds, I get us both a coffee and the staff come over with different platers of food to choose from, Amelia sticks with yogurt, fresh fruit and some toast, while I go all out on a full hearty breakfast with all the trimmings letting grunts of approval. Mateo and Libby chuckling amongst themselves Nathan and Nikki just eating in silence. People walking back and forth congratulating us both and how we will make wonderful Alpha and Luna. Amelia just looks radiant, she has this amazing glow about her today more so than usual, it&#39;s amazing seeing how well she&#39;s communicating with everyone as if she&#39;s known them for years, I think she&#39;s gonna be just fine. ***&#34;Are you ready to head back up my Luna?&#34; &#34;ready when you are baby&#34; &#34;catch you all later&#34;*** saying our goodbyes as we leave the table and head back up to our room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Lucas your mother isn&#39;t too well today.**</p>
