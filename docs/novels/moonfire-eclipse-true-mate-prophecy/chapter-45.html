                <p>***Amelia are you comfortable?&#34; &#34;as comfortable as I&#39;m going to get hooking up to all this&#34;*** looking over at Amelia now hooked up to different machines Mark and one of the nurses just getting her set and ready. Amelia looking content, calm and collected while I&#39;m stuck here a bag of nerves, knowing I can&#39;t do anything, she&#39;s definitely the strong one.***&#34;Lucas can you get me a tea before I do this&#34; &#34;yes of course beautiful I&#39;ll get you one now&#34;*** she must be nervous to have asked for her tea she&#39;s a good actor I give her that I would have never said she was nervous and clearly not as nervous as I. I head back with her tea in hand trying not to spill it everywhere with my shakey hands. ***&#34;here beautiful becareful it&#39;s hot&#34; &#34;thank you baby&#34; &#34;right then guys before Amelia takes the leap and drinks the contents, I&#39;ve spoken to Jordan regarding effects it may have on her, he is unsure to say the least, he hopes it won&#39;t do much and she will carry on as normal as it works through her system, or it may send her extremely tired and will need rest, she cannot vomit for atleast 5 hours once this has entered her system, so I&#39;ll give you some antiemetics now to ensure that doesn&#39;t happen. Its best to relax and ride it through.&#34;*** Mark informed us making me even more nervous thanks for the confidence boost. ***&#34;So just so we&#39;re clear we have no idea on the effects so nothing should come as a surprise&#34;*** I exclaim, Mark nods ***&#34;got it, it&#39;s not going to harm my little Luna now is it&#34; Jordan has assured me she needs this in order to be who she ment to be&#34;*** Me and Mark converse ***&#34;Guys I am here mind, by the way I just drank it and I feel fine&#34; &#34;Amelia some warning would have been nice!&#34;*** I Snapped ***&#34;well you two are too busy thinking about if&#39;s, but&#39;s and maybe&#39;s it&#39;s not gonna change my decision or anything else so I asked the nurse for the vial&#34;*** She has a point it wasn&#39;t going to change anything. I just hope everything remains good with no effects.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia has been feeling okay for the last 7 hours now, vitals are stable she&#39;s just getting a tired now so Mark assured we would be okay to go back to the Packhouse, and if anything changes just alert him through link and he would be with us in a flash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After watching some TV, I get Amelia back to bed and make her some soup I don&#39;t want to upset her tummy so good old vegetable soup will be fine. I chop away at the vegetables and place them all in a pan ready and bring it to the boil and let it simmer for a while as I try to tidy up and make a list of things I would need to restock the cupboards and fridge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Is Amelia okay after her visit with Mark?** Da linked me. **Yeh she seems fine just put her to bed making her some soup then she can get some rest it&#39;s been stable so fat but recently there&#39;s been so much going on she must be exhausted. Right you are my boy, I hope everything goes well. Your mother seems to be getting more and more exhausted these days too soon enough she won&#39;t be able to fulfill her duty as Luna. Mark is trying to work on what&#39;s wrong but right now we have no answers I hope you can both can take on some duties to relieve her a little. Of course we can, let&#39;s hope everything comes together as it should, It&#39;s like we&#39;re in a losing battle whichever way we look at the moment. We will get through all of this Lucas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I get the soup dished out for Amelia and place everything on a tray for her and head for the bedroom. ***&#34;Amelia darling I have soup, bread roll and your tea here for you&#34; &#34;Thank you baby, I feel really exhausted now&#34;*** struggling to keep her eyes open. ***&#34;I know just try and have a little bit and you can have some rest.&#34;*** Amelia just nods and sits herself up right to take the tray to rest it on the bed. She clears most of it and I can see she&#39;s struggling more every minute now, ***&#34;thank you for having something Amelia, now you can get some rest, I&#39;ll get Mark to come check in tomorrow&#34; &#34;that would be amazing thank you&#34;*** I take the dishes back to the kitchen and leave the bedroom, door slightly open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Hey bro, hope Amelia is okay? we totally forgot its Mateos birthday next week, he just brought it up. What we gonna do?. Shit with so much going on I forgot completely. How about we throw a party here I&#39;m sure we can do something, Amelia is okay exhausted but okay thankfully don&#39;t know what I would have done if anything happened.  He wants to find his mate Luc wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to go out the pack, I&#39;m glad she&#39;s okay, just look after her, she is a diamond in the rough. I know but with everything I don&#39;t know who we can trust anymore so were better off just throwing a party in the hall, she may even be here in the pack, I know I&#39;m lucky to have her. Okay I&#39;ll pop over tomorrow and we&#39;ll come up with some plans with Amelia too. Sounds good to me, I&#39;ll see you tomorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morning was well underway and Amelia still sleeping 11am already Nathan came to go through some party plans, I just couldn&#39;t wake her and I know she would love to plan the party so I couldn&#39;t start without her. I tried everything to wake her, Mark on his way, I&#39;m pacing back and forth wondering what on earth was wrong with my beautiful Amelia. Mark storms in ***&#34;bedroom?&#34; &#34;yes I just can&#39;t wake her I&#39;m sorry to bother you&#34; &#34;it&#39;s okay how long have you been trying to wake her for?&#34; &#34;around half an hour&#34;*** Mark takes out some things from his bag and starts to examine her, while I pray that my girl is going to be okay. ***&#34;Well all her vitals are in check, pupils are reactive, her brain is working as it should, medically she&#39;s perfectly fine. I think her body is trying to change and it&#39;s using alot of energy, her body may have indeed put itself into a coma to make the changes happen without draining her&#34;*** I knew this was a bad idea ***&#34;what if she doesn&#39;t wake for a while&#34;*** both fear and anger running through my veins ***&#34;if she doesn&#39;t wake by tomorrow morning bring her over to the clinic and I&#39;ll do some blood work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s been 48 hours since she took that vial, I brought her to the clinic where she would be monitored where I haven&#39;t left her side since. Mark did some tests and as suspected by Mark her blood work was perfect and all her tests where fine.  Medically Amelia is perfect except she won&#39;t wake up, I&#39;ve been praying to Goddesses and God&#39;s to bring my Luna back. No such luck though, all of a sudden I feel her fingers trying twitch, seeing the monitor start to alter and her eyes flickering trying to open ***&#34;Amelia darling wake up for me please wake up beautiful&#34;</p>
