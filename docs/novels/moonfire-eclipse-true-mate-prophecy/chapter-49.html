                <p>Can&#39;t believe it happened, I don&#39;t understand what came over me but I just sunk my canines into his bare neck leaving my print on him, as he did for me. It wasn&#39;t even the plan but it just felt right at the time I saw my opportunity and took it. I thought my orgasms were amazing before but that was insane, my whole body reacted making me scream out, the sparks and pulses like electric going through me started to combine with burning lava both intertwining to become one. It sounds painful but my goddess its a whole new level pleasure and to top everything off I&#39;ve never felt closer to Lucas, now I could what he was feeling but I know he would feel me too, when two become one as they say. We won&#39;t be able to hide anything from eachother anymore. Since we marked eachother I just feel like we were in a budding romance which blossomed to complete our bonding, I feel my strength, power and energy heighten along with my senses, more importantly my love for Lucas was stronger than ever, now there&#39;s no pulling us apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stroll into the living room to find Lucas making a cuppa over at the small kitchen ***&#34;Good morning beautiful you look as radiant as ever&#34; &#34;thank you, you coming to cuddle up and watch come FBI files&#34; &#34;I would love to beautiful but I have a few things to take care of then I&#39;m all yours&#34; &#34;I think Libby and Nikki will be up shortly anyway, Libby needs to borrow some clothes so her and Mateo can go shopping, I think Nikki is going to assist her as she did you, meaning once we are both done, I have you all to myself beautiful girl&#34; &#34;can&#39;t wait chilled out day?&#34; &#34;sorry not possible, we will be going for dinner tonight I&#39;ve made reservations but it will be just me and you this time&#34; &#34;okay I was hoping to chill but where are we going?&#34;*** my excited voice pouncing at him like a playful puppy. ***&#34;somewhere every nice I will be wearing a suit, I advise a nice formal dress but we can discuss that later, right now I have to get things done so I can continue with the rest of the day with you&#34;*** giving me a deeper kiss than I anticipated, okay this is definitely even more breath taking than before. ***&#34;I&#39;ll see you later baby, enjoy&#34;*** I uttered while biting my lower lip before he wouldn&#39;t be going anywhere, I feel myself getting aroused now and the last thing I needed was for Lucas to notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Amelia I can still smell your sweet nectar down the hall, I&#39;d love to be your panties right now. Too late he did notice his words making my flower twitch.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara seemed more content today too, she&#39;s just happy we are marked. Since Lucas was comfortable having me in the room alone now I decided to take a shower to try and ease the slight ache still present after last night. As I exit the bathroom in just a towel and head to make a cuppa I hear my door open wide it&#39;s Nikki, Libby and Mateo. ***&#34;sorry guys I&#39;ll just go and pop some clothes on&#34;*** one of Lucas Tee&#39;s and a pair of shorts will do, a pair of skinny jeans crop top blazer and and some ankle boots should fit Libby. I throw my hair into a messy bun and head back to the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Your marked Amelia, your finally marked, you know what that means right&#34;*** Mateo a little over excited. ***&#34;Mateo calm down, we haven&#39;t spoken to anyone yet&#34;*** a little overwhelmed and still confused as to what it means, ***&#34;Amelia you will soon become the Luna of this pack, his father will hand over the title after your mating ceremony, you and Lucas will become the official Alpha and Luna of this pack&#34;*** I just brush it off ***&#34;Libby here&#39;s some clothes for you, and yes I am aware Mat, but it&#39;s kind of nerve racking I&#39;m not even ready to be Luna&#34; &#34;You gotta be kidding me right, you already think and act like a Luna now, your going to be perfect&#34;*** Nikki giving me her words of encouragement. ***&#34;Thanks guys means it alot still only happened last night so I have some time for things to settle&#34; &#34;on that note we need to get going so we can get this shopping done&#34; &#34;thanks for the clothes Amelia&#34; &#34;no worries and be prepared Nikki loves to shop it took us a very long time to get through everything&#34; &#34;no worries haven&#39;t had any girlie time recently or a proper friend ever it&#39;s kinda like I always lurked in Haisley&#39;s shadow pretty invisible.&#34; &#34;don&#39;t worry we have girlie evenings here, and there&#39;s no shadows to lurk in we are equal&#34;*** I try to cheer her up abit, she seemed thankful. ***&#34;come on girls we have to go or we&#39;ll never get back. &#34;okay okay, chill we leaving, see you soon Luna&#34; &#34;catch you later girls and Matty&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I potter around the room, I&#39;d discovered a new ability last night, Mateo had found his mate and the cherry on top being I was marked, as I rubbed over my mark sending sparks through my body once again. I wonder what other abilities I have, firstly I had a sense of when someone was masking themselves, now I have flames and fire, needed to control that though it become quite the dangerous if I can&#39;t control it. Maybe I can mind read or a protection shield or healing. It&#39;s strange I never ever thought I&#39;d have any of this just plain old me, instead I&#39;m a gifted wolf with the most amazing mate, I&#39;m so lucky to have everything I have. I feel my body warm to my thoughts Tara feeling extremely pleased with me for finally realising yes I am special and no one is going to take that away, I can finally say I love myself and everything that I am.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Amelia are you at home is it okay for me to drop by Lucas linked me you discovered a new ability. yes I&#39;m at home, of course I&#39;ll make you a cuppa, coffee with sugar and milk isn&#39;t it?. Right you are Amelia see you in a tick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mark appears at the door within minutes. ***&#34;aww Amelia, Lucas didn&#39;t mention you were marked, I&#39;m so happy for you both&#34; &#34;actually we both marked eachother the same time it was amazing, I didn&#39;t realise how life changing that experience would be and thank you&#34;***  I said excitedly. ***&#34;Well that is some lovely news. You will make an Amazing Luna&#34; &#34;thank you very much, sorry I almost forgot, your coffee is on the coffee table would you like to come and sit down&#34; &#34;that would marvellous Amelia thank you&#34;*** he muttered with a warm smile. ***&#34;about your abilities Amelia I don&#39;t think you will know them until you use them or they get triggered unless we try to work out what they are, Lucas mentioned you were a roaring bunch of flames last night and were able to throw fire&#34; &#34;yes it was kind of strange, Haisley wasn&#39;t allowed in the club with the amount of security she wouldn&#39;t have stood a chance anyway but either way it started an argument and as she angered me more and more I could feel my body heating up. It didn&#39;t hurt me but I think it was my anger that triggered it&#34; &#34;I suspect it was but you will need to try and control your anger in able to control the fire, are there any other abilities you are aware of?&#34;*** I sat thinking about everything ***&#34;not that I&#39;m aware of, could I try something I will need to be hurt in some form but don&#39;t worry I just want to see if you could potentially heal people&#34;. &#34;sounds good to me&#34;*** Mark slices into his arm which pours blood out instantly, thats abit much I didn&#39;t think he would go that far ***&#34;Now Amelia I&#39;m going to ask you to heal me, but you must focus on my wound and making sure it heals&#34;.*** I see a glowing gold light come over my hands while I focus my energy, ***&#34;Am I really doing this&#34; &#34;yes Amelia, look it&#39;s completely gone so I belive you now have 3 abilities according Jordan you should have 4/5 abilities in total but we can&#39;t be sure.&#34;*** As I stop my hands bringing them to myself they return the their peachy colouring returns.***&#34;This is amazing&#34; &#34;you are incredible Amelia but I do want you to be able to keep your abilities to yourself, others may envy you, fear you or worse want you for personal gain to get what they want, so becareful who you speak to about them especially Brandon, he thinks of himself alot of the time.&#34;*** I thought Brandon was nice, why does Lucas and Mark seem to think I can&#39;t trust him hes been nothing but nice, even protective of me. ***&#34;Why do both you and Lucas say that I can&#39;t trust him, he&#39;s been nothing my nice to me?&#34;*** I question ***&#34;he&#39;s all about his power and authority Amelia and he can be very manipulative so please don&#39;t allow yourself too close&#34; &#34;okay I guess you guys know him better than me&#34; &#34;thank you Amelia, now I must shoot, if you find any other abilities please in touch with me I will be able to devise better treatment plans and so forth if you may need it, you see your abilities may affect certain medication so Jordan tells me anyway&#34; &#34;Thank you Mark it means alot&#34; &#34;My pleasure Luna&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I continue to clean up and sort through a few things. Since Mark left I find myself in thought alot over my abilities and what others I may hold. Jackson pops to mind, if he knew, I&#39;d probably be taken and restrained so I wouldn&#39;t be able to protect my Lucas, but what our marking give him some power of my gifts, I hope so we would be unstoppable, no one would ever come between us again. With that I hear the door open &#34;Amelia darling how are feeling looks like you&#39;ve been busy with the place&#34;, ***&#34;I just thought I&#39;d re arrange a few things.&#34; &#34;It looks perfect beautiful&#34; &#34;Mark told me about your healing ability quite exciting isn&#39;t it. But he&#39;s right the less my Da knows the better&#34; he pulls me into his embrace, plants a kiss on my lips he tastes heavenly. &#34;for our first task of the day, you need to get changed beautiful nothing too special just comfortable will be fine we will come back before our reservation tonight&#34; &#34;why? where are we going? I was hoping to cuddle up&#34;, &#34;we have a lifetime together to cuddle up together, I have a treat for you&#34;</p>
