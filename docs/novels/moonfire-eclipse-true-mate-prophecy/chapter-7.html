                <p>I brace myself before walking through the solid oak doors. I see my mother already curled up on her chair with her mug of herbal tea, she swears by it but I&#39;ve never taken a liking to it myself. The first and last time I tried it I ended up spraying it all over the counter, making me chuckle at the fond memories with my mother, so many memories in this house which was once my home. I look around and  notice my coffee laid on the slate coaster on the coffee table, I feel a warm smile coming across my face wrapping my mother in my arms planting a gentle kiss on her forehead, &#34;Hello Ma, hope I didn&#39;t keep you from going up to bed , I miss you and needed to get some things off my chest with Da&#34;. &#34; No no don&#39;t be silly, It&#39;s fine my darling always happy to see my little wolf.&#34; squeezing me tighter into her embrace, god this woman has so much love to give and always willing to help, I hate seeing how fragile she&#39;s becoming. &#34;you look exhausted luc, your doing too much you know I&#39;ve tried to get your father to ease off a little, have you eaten seen as you skipped dinner?&#34; shaking my head not feeling like eating. &#34;Well I have news for you your eating you must keep your strength, come lets go to the kitchen and see what we can throw together&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I enter the large kitchen looking around with images of us cooking, giggling even the disastrous messes I made, gave me a warm feeling, my mother always made sure I could cook, emphasising I would have to take care of my Luna one day. &#34;Is an omelette okay?&#34; &#34;yes that is fine but you don&#39;t have to I didn&#39;t come here for food&#34; &#34;nonsense you are still growing my boy&#34; &#34;I hope you two aren&#39;t going to make a mess, clean up after yourselves&#34; my fathers voice coming from the living room. When did he get here? pushing my thoughts aside, continuing to converse with my mother. My mother pushes the fresh omelette in front of me, at the kitchen island, devouring my place, grunting and letting growls out in approval, nothing can match my mothers cooking. I wash up and clean while my mother watches me, &#34;you&#39;ve always been so attentive Luc, your mate will be so lucky to have you&#34; &#34;if I ever find her ma&#34; letting out a large sigh. &#34;don&#39;t be so silly you will have everything you deserve and more if I have anything to do with it.&#34; Ushering me to the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Conversation flowing well with the 3 of us, pack business with the integration of the black shadow pack coming to school, and offering eachother support and so forth, my father had been working tirelessly to get them on board but finally it was happening. Occasionally I&#39;d feel my dads eyes would pierce through me knowing full well why I was here, although he never made it obvious to my mother she was just so being smitten for us to be spending time together. I frown knowing I don&#39;t make enough time for her as I should, she&#39;s my mother I should be worshipping the ground she walks on instead I let my father come between us and I hated myself for it. Conversation coming to a lul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So how was last night little one I hope you loosened up I had to almost beg your father to let you have some free time.&#34; Ma quizzed &#34;Thank you Ma it was needed even if a few unexpected guests dropped in&#34; sending out an angry tone. &#34;oh that growl doesn&#39;t sound very nice, did Jackson or mateo get into trouble again&#34; my mother frowned knowing what them two could be like. &#34;Actually no Mateo was on best behaviour, I did fall out with Jackson but I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll sort itself out. It was me who ended up losing it.&#34; &#34;you know that boy has never respected you I still don&#39;t know why he&#39;s around&#34; my father pressed my mother nodding in agreeance, deep down I knew it but he was my brother he had my back when I needed it. &#34;Hes my brother, even if you don&#39;t approve&#34; I spat at my father. &#34;If it wasn&#39;t for you I wouldn&#39;t have this to deal with right now&#34; a growl escaping, my eyes pinned on my father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mother looking at both out with her mouth agape, &#34;You two spit it out what on earth is going on here?&#34;. The well established anger filling the room, heck it&#39;s probably filling the house waiting to explode. &#34;I&#39;m sure father can explain what he knows and I&#39;ll fill the blanks&#34; flashing my pearly whites clenching my jaw. &#34;oh were going to play games are we, you should know by now I don&#39;t play your childish games&#34; letting out an evil laugh. &#34;You two need to pack it in and tell me what the hell is going on here. Brandon you better start spilling something or goddess knows what&#39;s next.&#34; &#34;Ava shut up you have no say in this so keep your nose out&#34; clearly infuriated by her threatening tone &#34;Well I&#39;ll start then shall I? seen as you can&#39;t be man enough to explain yourself. You see Ma your well intentions to allow me to have a break from duty and obligation which I very much appreciate and know I do not blame you in anyway, you also made my father come up with another one of his ideas, setting a trap for me. There were two girls already waiting for us when we got there, btw dad making them mask themselves was already a second mistake&#34;. Trailing on to my mother explaining the events as they unfolded without mentioning the bartender that would complicate this I had to keep that between me and Dr Preston for now as much as I want to share with mother my heart clenched at the thought of possibly keeping a life changing piece of information from her but she will know when the time was right. &#34;Brandon, how could you we agreed we give him 8 months following his birthday to find his true mate.&#34; she said broken heartedly. &#34;Ava, nor you or this boy know what is best, look at us the power couple chosen not fated, we&#39;ve had a wonderful life together and this pack is a living proof we did everything right.&#34;  &#34;Brandon, yes we love eachother dearly and gave eachother the best life one could ask for but we both have our regrets you can&#39;t deny that to our son. I want to give him the chance we never had.&#34; she said sheepishly &#34;Oh Ava your so naive, this is why you were chosen, your beautiful, gentle yet strong, so easy to fall in love with you are the perfect Luna, that is why I want him to have a chosen mate, not someone that will argue and push the decisions he makes&#34;  feeling his attitude change speaking to her. &#34;But this one always chooses to think he knows better, Mr know it all always knows best, so no I will not drop it and you will follow in my footsteps, as I did my father and fathers father. You will take a chosen mate, end of discussion&#34; eyes piercing through me once again. anger boiling up again.</p>
