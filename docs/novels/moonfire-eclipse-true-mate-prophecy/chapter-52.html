                <p>Okay I must have tried on about 25 dresses now and still havnt found the one I hope Lucas was having more luck in the tailors. I feel myself getting extremely frustrated now with everyone agreed none of the dresses where sitting right on me. So the assistant insisted I put a blind fold on and she was going to try something a little different from what I&#39;d already tried. As I popped myself into the surprise number it&#39;s figure hugging, backless and strapless, it&#39;s extremely light and comfortable, I felt amazing it felt like my dress even if I couldn&#39;t see myself. The girls silent, no one saying a word, which was only making me feel even more nervous. As they untie the blindfold, my eyes take a little time to adjust. I look in the mirror in surprise, a ivory dress with a sweetheart neckline, mermaid style, it was perfect, lace detail all the way through no other colour bar ivory, a gorgeous long lace train paired with a matching veil it was perfect. The girls left completely speechless only confirming it was my dress, **it&#39;s flawless and the prefect tone and style for your skin tone and personality as if it was made for you Amelia** Tara exclaimed while my eyes misted up with tears forming, I never believed I&#39;d ever be doing any of this. ***&#34;I think we have our brides dress by the look on her face, now to find bridesmaids and a flower girl dresses.&#34;*** Ma pressed on knowing we have limited time ***&#34;you wanted silver you said we have these&#34;*** I look over while dabbing my eyes, their gorgeous one shoulder strap with floral detail on the strap, it has some diamanté detailing, with a longer at the back, shorter at the front, it&#39;s a chiffon material so it&#39;s light and airy looks comfortable and elegant. ***&#34;So girls what do you think?&#34;. &#34;We think it&#39;s perfect we couldn&#39;t of picked a nicer dress&#34;*** Nikki blurted out unable to contain her excitement. ***&#34;It comes as a part of a collection so comes with both shoes and a bag to match&#34; &#34;we&#34;ll take them&#34;*** Ma agrees, ***&#34;now what about our little flower girl Best till last as they say&#34;*** Nova looks over shyly, ***&#34;it&#39;s okay no need to be shy you&#39;ll have a choice of what you wear&#34;*** I said lovingly. ***&#34;ok thank you&#34; &#34;we have a junior bridesmaid dress similar to the two you have but it&#39;s double straped and the skirt is one length.&#34; &#34;what you think of that one?

I don&#39;t really want to go out and make a fool of myself&#34;*** I chuckled. ***&#34;that I can&#39;t blame you for&#34;*** Libby replied laughing herself. ***&#34;How about we just book into the spa, mani, pedi, massage, steam room, sauna, jacuzzi, aromatherapy rooms and finish off with a meal in the evening?&#34; &#34;that actually sound lovely Lib, but where?&#34;  &#34;there&#39;s one just the other side of town, it&#39;s really nice there, I&#39;ve been a few times with Haisley.&#34;*** Libby answered confidently until she realised it was reminding her of Haisley and she brought that up, she just bowed her head and sighed. ***&#34;Lib it&#39;s okay for it to get to you sometimes were not perfect, no one is, we all have feelings that we can&#39;t control&#34;*** I place my arm around her gently to reassure her. ***&#34;thank you for understanding&#34;***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the pack house Lucas more or less ready to go out, ***&#34;I&#39;ve been missing you&#34;*** I whisper. ***&#34;I know beautiful I miss you too&#34;*** planting a deep kiss on my lips ***&#34;Let&#39;s get our wedding sorted I can&#39;t wait to become your Alpha and your husband for the rest of our lives but we can have a few days just me and you before we get back to duties at the pack like a honeymoon maybe?, how&#39;s my Ma, she seems to be bursting with energy at the moment&#34; &#34;shes doing really well at the moment, I think she&#39;s really excited for our wedding, she is even calling me her daughter now makes me feel warm and fuzzy.&#34;*** ***&#34;I&#39;m glad she&#39;s doing well and I&#39;m glad you two are hitting it off as well as I&#39;d hoped&#34;  &#34;I won&#39;t be around tomorrow day the girls have booked to go to a spa for the day and an evening meal apparently I need a relaxing day before Friday because we&#39;re busy collecting everything, ready for Saturday. Oh and it&#39;s Nina and Rich doing the catering for Saturday, I hope you don&#39;t mind.&#34; &#34;no worries just enjoy yourself, you deserve to. Of course it&#39;s fine their food is amazing also Amelia I would like you to try and go to the gym at some point too to just let everything out, I&#39;m letting my frustration out in training but yours is building up I can feel it.&#34;***  I hear banging on the door, ***&#34;come on Luc your not getting out of this. I will drag your sorry ass out of there if I have to&#34; &#34;that&#39;s my cue, I&#39;ll see you tomorrow beautiful I love you&#34;*** kissing my forehead before turning to get out the door. ***&#34;I love you too&#34;*** frowning to myself before he leaves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s hurting more and more everytime he leaves and this dull ache for him doesn&#39;t go until he&#39;s here, right here with me. It&#39;s getting painful, I can&#39;t wait until we can spend our time together again, I&#39;m sure he&#39;s feeling the pain I feel too. we&#39;ve been apart far too much lately, even Tara is sulking. I start to clean and tidy up to take my mind off things. As I start to put the clothes away, a letter slips out of my jacket, oh I completely forgot about this so busy with wedding talk, the letter didn&#39;t even exist. Just a plain envelope with my name strange, who would just leave this on the boarder. As I open the letter I instantly recognise the handwriting, it&#39;s Romans but why would he write to me now after all this time.</p>
