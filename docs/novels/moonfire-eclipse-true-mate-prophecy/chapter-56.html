                <p>I finish up packing my suitcase, Amelia adamant she&#39;s doing her own and brings the suitcase out when she&#39;s finished. ***&#34;Amelia I love you&#34; &#34;I love you too can&#39;t wait to have you all to myself.&#34;*** sending me a cheeky wink. She definitely has her playful side out, she&#39;s gonna get it this week, she&#39;s gonna be sore by the time I&#39;m finished with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We head down to the front of the packhouse where everyone is waiting to say their goodbyes and wave us off. As we said our goodbyes Mark slipped her something, don&#39;t know what but it&#39;s probably to keep control of herself while we&#39;re not at the pack. ***&#34;I think we&#39;re ready to leave now&#34; &#34;Good, and don&#39;t don&#39;t forget we are a link away if we&#39;re needed.&#34;***  I usher Amelia into the black BMW and head around to the drivers side. ***&#34;ready Amelia?&#34;***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We arrive at the cottage after getting lost twice, which Amelia was very amused about, chuckling away at me. In my defense the sat nav was supposed to be guiding me but it was failing miserably. What should have been a 2 hour drive turned into 3 hours. I was exhausted and hungry when we got to the cottage upon our arrival staff were there ready to greet us, the smell of food already cooking soaring through the air as the door opened and drinks ready for our arrival, Nathan was right everything would be taken care of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We head in and one of the girls took our suitcases up to one of the bedrooms, the place was small but cozy, small, quaint kitchen and a small living room area with the dining table at the back. It was quite dark but with the fire roaring, it lit the place up nicely with the small soft wall lights just setting a romantic scene. Amelia looked like she was in love with the place, ***&#34;you like it Amelia?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like it, I love it, it&#39;s perfect it&#39;s what I always pictured my home to be except a little bigger&#34;*** atleast I know what kind of place were building as our family home, this but bigger sound perfect to me. I see a treeline in the distance maybe there&#39;s a small woods we can head out to later on for Damon and Tara to have some time too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Food will be ready in around 30 minutes if you need to freshen up&#34;*** the male instructed. ***&#34;Amelia let&#39;s get sorted for food then shall we?&#34;*** she followed me up the stairs, to find our room was the master bedroom with an ensuite, four poster bed, all been laid out perfectly with covering over the bed to give extra privacy and intimacy, rose petals scattered upon the bed, bathrobes and towels laid our perfectly with Mr and Mrs written on each bathrobe. I could see and feel Amelias energy, she&#39;s on cloud 9, she was loving every inch of this place. We unpacked our suitcases into the wardrobe and headed to freshen up in the bathroom which and twin sinks, double shower and free standing bath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Salmon fillet with a lemon butter sauce and freshly steamed potatoes and vegetables, presentation was stunning and the aroma it was giving off was just on another level. We sat for our candle lit dinner, served with wine. the flavours and textures where just phenomenal, Amelia agreeing by the way she was scoffing the food down. Amelia and I finish up food and our drink. The staff clear away our plates ***&#34;would you like desert or are you comfortable?&#34; &#34;that will be fine thank you very much&#34; &#34;it&#39;s our pleasure&#34;*** as they head off to clean up ***&#34;So Amelia can you tell me what you would like to do now?&#34; &#34;now I&#39;d like to head to bed I&#39;m tired and I think we should get some rest&#34; &#34;I agree as I&#39;ve spotted a treeline in the distance I was hoping we could go for a run tomorrow&#34; &#34;that sounds good Tara will love to be let out somewhere new&#34;*** Damon already prancing around my head. ***&#34;come on then let&#39;s take a shower and go to bed&#34;*** sending a sexy smirk her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hop in the shower first Amelia wants privacy apparently, why I&#39;ll never know what&#39;s come over her it&#39;s not like it&#39;s something I havn&#39;t seen before but I&#39;ll respect her wishes. I come out with just a towel around my waist, my jaw instantly gaping open, Amelia had other plans, she was dressed in a gold sexy basque, with matching breifs, all lace detailed and sparkling bringing out her gleaming eyes, now that&#39;s an image I&#39;ll never forget, her hair with soft curls, her face slightly blushed. My towel fallen off due to my now throbbing member,  her breasts look excentuated, her lips so inviting, the smell of her arousal invading my senses, making every part of me want her right now. I edge forward and pull her tightly into my embrace staring into her eyes, tracing her lips with my finger while the hand is busy holding her peachy ass cheek, ***&#34;now that is a surprise Amelia, look what you&#39;ve done to me.&#34;*** With her looking down at my member, giving me a smirk she takes it in her hand and starts to rub me up and down gently teasing me. I throw my head back letting out a moan. ***&#34;Amelia your one naughty Luna right now&#34; &#34;what are you going to do about it my alpha?&#34;***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>almost chuckling at her own words. I just let my mouth takeover hers gripping her tightly on her ass, giving her a spank, with her giving a little groan in the process. She gets me to loosen up my grip on her, falling to her knees, teasing my cock gently licking and kissing my head, sending my blood rushing. ***&#34;Amelia please don&#39;t tease&#34; &#34;are you begging alpha?&#34;*** she knows exactly what she&#39;s doing to me. All I&#39;m manage to get out is a grunt and ***&#34;yes&#34;,*** she takes my cock deep into her mouth, bobbing her head back and forth, sucking my head and she gets closer to my tip, I can already feel myself building, she continues in a steady rhythm, gradually picking up her pace and pushing me deeper, I feel my cock starting to twitch a little it&#39;s ready to explode, ***&#34;fuck Amelia I&#39;m gonna...&#34;*** too late I&#39;d already emptied my load, Amelia looking at me satisfied with her own actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Your turn beautiful&#34;*** I pick her up and throw her on to the bed, tearing off her gorgeous little panties, ***&#34;we won&#39;t be needing them&#34;*** throwing them to the floor. I gently start kissing her inner thigh and around her soft spot Amelia&#39;s heavy breathing, showing me her anticipation, as my soft kisses make her moan, I start to nip a little, making her body twitch. I slowly let my tongue do some work over her sweet bud, parting her lips from her entrance slowly dipping my tongue in and out her moaning getting louder and breathing quicker, indicating shes building up, I slide my fingers in to help her find a release, as my tongue licks and sucks over her bud, making her body start grinding to my rhythm. ***&#34;Lucas harder&#34;*** I start to get a little more rough my fingers going in harder and faster, my tongue going at her like a starving animal. Amelia&#39;s moans and screams louder than before I feel her body trembling, ***&#34;Lucas&#34;*** is all she could get out before her essence exploded over me, I smirk in satisfaction licking her juices off my fingers, offering to her which she tastes herself ***&#34;you taste divine Amelia, but I&#39;m not done yet.&#34;***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pick her up and flip her over into doggy style parting her legs just enough to gain access. with her already dripping I smash my entire length into her entrance making her buck and scream. I pound her hard, and spank her juicy ass every now and then caressing her tits inbetween. Her moans of pleasure just adding to my energy, I want to fill her every need. My goddess she&#39;s pushing herself back into me to meet my every thrust. I feel my orgasm building, Amelia&#39;s must be too as her body beging to shudder in reaction to my thrust, I pound into her harder and faster to bring his both into our climax, Amelia basically screaming my name now, I feel myself exploding into her as she releases her juices, sending us both into oblivion, my legs grow weak as I fall into the bed next to her. My cock now throbbing after it&#39;s adventure. Amelia must be really sore too, her breasts almost look bruised from my grip her ass looks red from spanking her. she looks like she&#39;s bitten her lip too. ***&#34;Amelia is your desire to entertain me forfilled beautiful?&#34; &#34;10 times over baby, although I am sore, I think I&#39;ll take a shower to ease the ache.&#34;*** I just smirk ***&#34;you had a good time then I take it&#34; &#34;if your asking if I&#39;ll be coming back for more then yes but not right now I need to heal a little first&#34;*** sending a wink my way.</p>
