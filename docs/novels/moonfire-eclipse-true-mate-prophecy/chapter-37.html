                <p>Happy to be back in the pack, although I&#39;d had a busy few days since being back catching up with pack news and some paperwork to catch up on. I also updated Mateo and Nathan on the Amelia and Haisley situation. They had no news from Levi while I was away either, things taking far too long to report back I do have a list of people joining the rebellion, my father also aware of the individuals on the list so they kept an eye on at all times, but nothing suspicious reported as of yet. Amelia is now accompanied at all times even when in our room I can see she&#39;s getting fed up with it all but I have to put her safety first. I can&#39;t lose her, she&#39;s my everything, I love her I&#39;d be a lost cause or even dead without her, I just hope she realises that letting a sigh escape me. **Hey baby I start with your mother tomorrow on some Luna training I can&#39;t wait to actually doing something.** Hearing the excitement through our link just melted my heart she&#39;s gonna be amazing, hell she is already amazing. **You sound excited beautiful. Well of course I get to be with the woman who raised the man I have for a mate and I also get to learn more about what my role will be, what&#39;s there not to be excited about. oh Amelia you amaze me everyday I love you. I love you too baby.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have training shortly then I&#39;ll be free to spend my evening with my darling Amelia, think I&#39;ll take her for a run and let Tara and Damon have a little time together, **yes Lucas I need to see mate it&#39;s been too long. I agree you&#39;ve been stroppy so hopefully you&#39;ll lighten up abit. thank you you haven&#39;t been in the best frame of mind either, mate will protect Amelia I promise, I think we need to get a gymnasium sorted for Amelia though she hasn&#39;t done anything since being here.** Damon suggested and I agreed she hasn&#39;t had anywhere to practice or let herself be free, perhaps we could actually see her perform too which would be amazing my member slightly twitching as the thought of her performing infront of me, in a skin tight leotard. I will see what I can sort after training and get something organised soon for her she deserves nothing but the best.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Training went well I&#39;m pushing myself to each limit I can feel my strength, speed and tactics getting better by the day now. ***&#34;Top form Alpha, how is your sweet mate doing she okay? I didn&#39;t get a chance to congratulate you officially I wish you the best of luck for the future&#34;*** his face so smug giving me a pat on the shoulder, anger soaring through me keeping myself from growling and snapping while Damon trying to push forward to take over. ***&#34;she&#39;s perfect and thank you&#34;*** is all I could manage before turning away otherwise I&#39;d probably of lost the battle with Damon pounding his way in. **We can&#39;t let him know anything Damon. Lucas he wants mate, I feel it he wants what&#39;s ours. Keep your cool she&#39;s protected at all times.** Damon growls at me in my head, making me feel anxious and knowing he&#39;s probably right, **I know we can&#39;t have eyes on her every second, but she&#39;s always got someone around her.** ***&#34;what was that about?&#34;*** Nathan approached, ***&#34;not sure he asked about Amelia and congratulated me somethings off I just don&#39;t know what. I need to mark her soon but I&#39;m still not sure she&#39;s ready.&#34;*** letting my nerves get the best of me, maybe I should just drop the subject. ***&#34;Amelia will let you know when she&#39;s ready you know that&#34;*** patting me on the back, I did know but I&#39;m scared it&#39;s going to be too late, if something happens to her I&#39;m gonna lose it. I shake my thoughts and head for a shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;No I want a gymnasium for gymnastics built for Amelia, with all the equipment and I&#39;ll need it soon as&#34; &#34;Lucas what your asking is alot of work for a week.&#34; &#34;Are you suggesting you and you team aren&#39;t competent or doing this Alan?&#34; &#34;no sir it will be costly though let me know when you need payment for whatever and I&#39;ll pay it no matter the cost.&#34; &#34;We&#39;ll get to it then&#34; &#34;Good Thank you&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I make my way to our room I smell spices and hear sizzling almost making my mouth water without even tasting it. I open the door, the aroma hitting me, it&#39;s almost melting my taste buds already, Amelia standing over the cooker making us food I signal Trent to leave hes no longer required while I&#39;m home.***&#34;Well this is a surprise, your making dinner for us&#34;  &#34;just because I don&#39;t cook doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t baby&#34; &#34;smell delicious what is it?&#34; &#34;southern fried pasta salad with a side of garlic bread, different dips and a bowl of sweet potato fries&#34;, &#34;sounds amazing I was going to say I&#39;ll lay the table but you&#39;ve already done that too&#34; &#34;can&#39;t I treat my mate after a long day working&#34; &#34; it has been a long day thank you, how was your day and how&#39;s the new body guard?&#34;*** I hope their getting on it took me hours to find Trent. ***&#34;he&#39;s okay, quiet alot of the time and takes this job very seriously&#34;*** I guessed as much it&#39;s what he&#39;s trained for and they said when I hired him he isn&#39;t very sociable. ***&#34;it&#39;s what he&#39;s trained for beautiful I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find some common interests between you&#34;*** trying not to let on his mate is into gymnastics too. ***&#34;come baby let&#39;s have some dinner&#34;*** as she brings the dishes over to the table returning to get the rest. ***&#34;thank you Amelia this is perfect, after this how do you feel about going for a run leaving Tara and Damon have some time&#34; &#34;That sounds perfect, Tara has been nagging to come out&#34;*** I start to dish some food onto my plate, it smells amazing, as I start to dig into food, the flavours are phenomenal each balancing eachother out, my taste buds tingling with pleasure. This woman can cook ***&#34;goddess you can cook beautiful&#34; &#34;thank you just something I picked up from Nina&#34;*** I can barely stop devouring the food I didn&#39;t even get time to speak everything was cooked perfectly, grunting and moaning as I ate, Amelia sat there giggling at me, I loved that giggle, it warmed my heart hearing that sound. As we finished up food I insist on clearing up after all Amelia cooked an amazing meal for me the least I could do was clear up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We sat on the couch and watched an episode of the fbi files, it was actually growing on me although I wouldn&#39;t admit it to the boys, they rip in to me enough now without even telling them I&#39;m enjoying it. ***&#34;You ready for a run beautiful be nice to stretch your legs for abit&#34; &#34;yeh let&#39;s go&#34;.*** We reach the tree line and strip down ready to shift, my body getting bigger by the day now, Amelia scaning my body with her golden eyes, I bring out a cheeky smirk and quickly shift, as she followed Damon went into a playful demeanour running away then trying to catch Tara gently nipping and rolling around, They both connected on every level as did me and Amelia. Damon is the happiest I&#39;ve ever seen him until a sound of something, in the distance caught Damon&#39;s attention, Tara and him both on high alert. **Amelia do you see anything?  No but I feel something watching us, Tara is ready to go all beast right now. Damon is too.** In the shadows we see a large black wolf approach, it&#39;s Jackson but he looked bigger than before not as big as me but bigger. **You two out late aren&#39;t you, Damon calm down I&#39;m no threat just yet. What do you mean just yet?** I barely keep myself calm **Lucas at the moment your safe and so is your pretty little thing here, although she does look abit weak for a Luna I&#39;m shocked you got this one with your capability.** Tara snapped aggressively. **Feisty though I see, tick tock enjoy the time you have both of you. Don&#39;t worry no need to alert the guards I&#39;m leaving, I&#39;ll see you again soon.** With that he disappeared into the woods out of sight **Come Amelia let&#39;s get you back.**</p>
