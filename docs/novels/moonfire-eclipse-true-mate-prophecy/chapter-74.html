                <p>After Mark speaking to Jordan about controlling my abilities and the latest development of my pup, Jordan requested I go stay with him for a few days to have myself under control and of course I haven&#39;t spoken to Lucas which means he still doesn&#39;t know about it all. I&#39;m hoping to keep it that way until I return. Mateo and Nathan broke the news I would be going away for a few days, he wasn&#39;t happy but didn&#39;t push for me to stay either. Nathan and Nikki are coming along with me while Mateo and Libby over see the pack and any paperwork that may need attention prior to my return. Lucas hasn&#39;t even indicated he will help with that he&#39;s just busy training and doing as he pleases really. It&#39;s starting to worry me that maybe he isn&#39;t fit to be a dad just yet especially with everything else going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one bar me the hospital and Nikki knew about the pregnancy and it&#39;s currently easy to hide as I&#39;m not showing properly, Mark did some research about desert wolf pregnancies and they only last around 5/6 months on average so I havn&#39;t really got all that much time to prepare. Nathan so looking forward to the road trip but still unaware of why or what is happening, he&#39;s just happy to get away as soon as I asked, he headed straight to pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;You all ready Amelia we are just waiting on you?&#34; &#34;okay, okay, give me a second, just finishing off.&#34;*** As I pack my scan photos and everything else to leave now trace of me being pregnant. My heart melts everytime I look at the photos, even since finding out I&#39;m now begining to get some flutters here and there which is strange how could I have not known before. Just wish Lucas could share this with me letting out a sigh. ***&#34;Amelia are you done?&#34;*** Nathan shouting at me from the living room. ***&#34;No need to shout I&#39;m sorted&#34;*** Lucas enters the room everyone fell silent. No one really getting on with Lucas at this point so people tread on eggshells. ***&#34;How long are you going for?&#34;*** his eyes piercing me. ***&#34;A few days&#34; &#34;well Nathan look after her or I&#39;ll have your head&#34; &#34;you will do no such thing, I&#39;m quite capable of taking care of myself thank you&#34;*** I snapped ***&#34;if you think so but you will be coming back to this room when you return no more of your tantrums&#34; &#34;that&#39;s rich coming from you, no one can stand being around you the way your behaving, I will return when you realise how much of a dickhead your being&#34; &#34;Amelia watch your tone with me or your not going anywhere&#34; &#34;I&#39;ll go wherever I please, come on let&#39;s go guys I can&#39;t be dealing with this now&#34;*** Lucas just turns and head for the bedroom I can feel his anger soaring through me, I just ignore it and leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s probably the most I&#39;ve spoken to Lucas in nearly two weeks. Nathan concentrating on the road ***&#34;Amelia you seriously can hold your own can&#39;t you, never thought you would stand up to him like that&#34; &#34;sorry but I can&#39;t be pushed around, I do everything for this pack, I have given him time and space, I supported him when he needed me most, I tried everything to avoid conflict and guess what it didn&#39;t work, yet I still get the blame for it, I&#39;m not taking it anymore&#34; &#34;I&#39;m with you on that he&#39;s turning into his father at the moment, I just hope he snaps out of it soon for everyone&#39;s sake.&#34; &#34;I second that&#34;*** Nikki replied. ***&#34;We are only about an hour away now guys so does anyone want a bite to eat I know a cafe just up the road&#34; &#34;yes yes yes.&#34;*** Nikki screeched, ***&#34;Amelia has to eat to&#34;*** she answered for me. ***&#34;Food for Nikki and my Luna coming up&#34; &#34;is there a toilet I&#39;m busting for a whizz more than anything&#34;*** they both just laughed ***&#34;sorry just didn&#39;t expect that to come from you&#34; &#34;well is there?&#34; &#34;yes Amelia there&#39;s a toilet&#34;*** thank goddness I don&#39;t think I could hold, it in the entire trip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;You go ahead for your whizz I&#39;ll order food for us.&#34;*** Nikki giggled and looks down at my tummy not to make it obvious or anything you know. I return to the table where Nathan and Nikki waited patiently for food. ***&#34;What did you order?&#34; &#34;you have cheesy fries and a quarter pounder burger&#34; &#34;thank you sounds delicious&#34;*** while we wait and chat amongst ourselves, I find my thoughts trailing off again what am I going to do if Lucas can&#39;t accept our pup? I wish I could take back time and stop everything from happening, things wouldn&#39;t be as they are now. I miss Lucas, I miss my home I&#39;m growing weaker by the day. Food arrives bringing me back to civilisation, ***&#34;Amelia everything okay?&#34; &#34;sorry just lost in thought&#34; &#34;don&#39;t let things get to you, it will all work out&#34; &#34;I hope so&#34;*** we continued to eat food and head for the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Amelia, It&#39;s been a while how are you? your glowing&#34; &#34;I know maybe a little too long, thank you for your help once again&#34; &#34;your most welcome, I notice Lucas isn&#39;t with you, is everything okay?&#34; &#34;honestly I don&#39;t know but at the moment I need to focus on me&#34; &#34;quite right with everything going on plus your pregnancy&#34; &#34;wait hold up did he just say pregnancy, Amelia are you pregnant and not told me?&#34;*** I bow my head hoping it wouldn&#39;t come out this way. ***&#34;yes Nathan but no one is aware of this other than the Doctors, Nikki, Jordan and now you I intend on keeping it that way until I am ready to discuss with Lucas, I don&#39;t want him adding to my stress levels&#34; &#34;my lips are sealed, but this is amazing news Amelia when did you find out?&#34; &#34;actually only found out out 2 days ago so it&#39;s still pretty fresh, and I&#39;m already 8/9 weeks and will deliever anywhere between 5/6 months so I don&#39;t have much time to prepare for this&#34;. &#34;Amelia you will make an amazing Mom don&#39;t even think about doubting yourself&#34;*** wrapping his arms around me, to try and comfort me, but it just doesn&#39;t get easier with another man hugging me. ***&#34;With that whole ordeal out the way, the main reason you are here is to control your abilities, and develop them, it will take training and practice to keep on top of them and you will feel your power grow as you do more and more. Let&#39;s head out back and see if we can figure out whats sending you a little irratic other than pregnancy itself&#34;***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Well now your shakra&#39;s are allined, I think we should meditate for short while, regain some energy and learn to focus and relax.&#34;*** Everyone seemed to enjoy our time together even Nathan joined in, Jordan explain it was good for all of us, it would help us to remain connected and reach our full potential. ***&#34;Where did you learn all this?&#34;*** Nikki quizzed ***&#34;I&#39;ve been around longer than you know you pick things up along the way, werewolves are especially interesting to me, they are fierce yet tame, loyal but not if mistreated and to find such a creature true to their species it&#39;s difficult to find, there&#39;s always some sort of war with differnt kinds even humans to show which is superior but werewolves, stick to their packs, they don&#39;t seek power or domination, they are quite happy in their lives without it.&#34; &#34;I agree on that one although you do get the odd ones,&#34; &#34;amoungst your own kind yes but you rarely see a werewolf seek to destroy another species. Amelia&#39;s race is more or less extinct due a powerful Coven of witches and warlocks, there are very little left of the race, she&#39;s important to begin a new race to keep the balance, the sun and moon goddesses are said to not be enemies nor do they seek friendship but they both need eachother to keep the earth balanced, with her prophecy many feared the end of the race and when her parents came to me believing she was indeed the prophecy, I swore to protect her and give her a normal life as they begged and gave up their abilities for her in despiration, she wouldn&#39;t have the life she has now&#34; &#34;wow, I never knew about the details, but why didn&#39;t anyone tell me these fine details?&#34; &#34;it wasn&#39;t the right time for you, you may have seeked revenge you were angry and bitter, you have come a long way Amelia.&#34; &#34;she has hasn&#39;t she, she&#39;s perfect, shame Lucas couldn&#39;t see that right now&#34;*** thoughts of Lucas entering my mind, how much I missed him and how I just wanted everything to be forgotten but I know the moment I see him my memory will start flashing through due to these damn abilities. ***&#34;30 minute meditate then we call it a day, there&#39;s an apartment across the road set up for you&#34;*** Jordan places on some calming music, reminding me of being at the seaside, waves crashing into the rocks, seaweed and drift wood being washed ashore, I find myself entering my own world of imagination, the wind blowing through my hair, Lucas laughing and giggling as we play around, Lucas is my best friend, my husband, my mate and my Alpha I need him to come back to me.</p>
