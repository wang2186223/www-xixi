I look into the room and it looked so much bigger than what it did from the outside two floors of shelves, all sectioned off perfectly. &#34;Lucas where do we even start?&#34; I questioned looking a little nervous. &#34;Good afternoon Mr. Silverstone how can I help you?&#34; &#34;Good afternoon Grant and please call me Lucas, I&#39;m looking for some research into desert wolves to be specific can you help?&#34; &#34;let me take a look&#34; He scrolls through a computer to see if there&#39;s anything he can help, eyeing me back and fore making me uncomfortable &#34;ah here it is, if you go to section 38, and it&#39;s on aisle 5 you should be able to find what your looking for, there are a few books there that will help you, are you aware how incredibly special they are, no need to hide I&#39;m just shocked to even be in your presence&#34; bowing his head to me. &#34;Thank you grant that&#39;s all for now &#34; &#34;your very welcome I&#39;ll bring up some coffee for you and what would the lady like?&#34; &#34;I&#39;ll take the same thank you&#34; &#34;My pleasure, Lucas you got yourself a keeper here, don&#39;t mess it up&#34; he said with a laugh while Lucas rolled his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This place is massive Lucas how did you know about this place?&#34;  admiring the sight of this building &#34;It&#39;s a part of one of our pack connections, he&#39;s werewolf too which I&#39;m guessing you already sensed but he doesnt have a pack he&#39;s basically rogue and didn&#39;t want to join us but we offered him a solution we have full access to the library and we pay him a monthly fee to keep the place running and give himself a wage.&#34; &#34;So you basically keep this place afloat&#34; &#34;yeah I&#39;ve asked if we can do some repairs and what not, the team are just waiting on clearance now, here we are section 38&#34; &#34;Oh look aisle 5&#34; I said excitedly.  we each scan over the shelves I grabbed 2 books and Lucas 3 in hand, &#34;I think we have enough for now I insisted&#34; Lucas nodding away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We begin to look through the books to find something that would give us some knowledge as to what we are looking for &#34;here lucas look, it says here desert wolves have special abilities, but I don&#39;t have any at least that I know of&#34; &#34;I recall Dr saying something but wasn&#39;t too sure as to what he ment&#34; &#34;it says here some have the ability to make themselves completely invisible, some can produce flames, some have special healing abilities, some can read minds, erase memories, wow who would have thought my species would be so powerful and I knew nothing about it&#34; &#34;I think your old pack were scared of you that&#39;s why they made you rogue thinking you would be able to destroy them&#34; I see him looking in despair &#34;it&#39;s okay Lucas none of this is your fault&#34; &#34;I just wish there was something I could do to change your past&#34; &#34;if you changed the past I may not be here with you so I wouldn&#39;t change a thing so you shouldn&#39;t beat yourself up over it&#34; &#34;Amelia your already so strong, so forgiving, your going to make a perfect Luna&#34; I love him more each minute, so strong and protective yet loving and gentle the perfect balance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amelia look here, it says here that there&#39;s a prophecy, a female wolf will contain many different abilities and will be one of the most powerful females in history, it says many will fear her, others will want her for own personal gain, once mated they share all their gifts with their mate, but unfortunately once the wolf dies the prophecy will die with it, marking the end of the desert wolf species who will then not be able to produce further pups of their own kind.&#34; my eyes glued open at his words, now this absolutely terrified me, what if the prophecy is dead and I can&#39;t give him pups. So many things running through my head. &#34;Amelia you havn&#39;t said a word is everything okay?&#34; &#34;Yes I just can&#39;t think of not having pups of our own&#34; &#34;we will worry about that when it comes to it but enough reading for today I&#39;ll lease the other two books and we&#39;ll go through them again.&#34; I nod unable to think of me being so unaware I don&#39;t have any abilities, I may or may not be able to produce my own pups, I may be completely useless after all. &#34;Thanks Grant I&#39;ll be back in a few weeks&#34; Lucas takes my hand and we walk out to the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remain silent the whole drive back, I see in the distance what looked like a large pack house and some kind or town. &#34;This pack is massive compared to the shadow pack&#34; &#34;We also have a lot more to offer, we have access to school, other packs exchange programs and we even have some human connections, What you think?&#34; &#34;It&#39;s amazing&#34; &#34;and it will all be ours in time&#34; I gulped rather loudly at the thought of running such a massive pack, he placed his hand on my knee, &#34;We&#39;ll be fine&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We pull up at the large building which I assumed would be the pack house. &#34;I need to get changed before we go to my parents is that okay?&#34; I nodded. He came around and lifted me out of the ranger, and held my hand while walking into the pack we received some stares and heard some whispering but he ignored everything. Mateo bumped into him in the hallway with Nathan, &#34;hey guys pop by later, I&#39;ll link you&#34; he said in a serious tone instead of his gentle playful demeanour. He unlocked his room after countless of stairs and led me in, I&#39;m speechless once again his room was perfect, blues, creams and silvers making it bright and airy, open plan kitchen diner and living room I&#39;m guessing his bedroom was separate to this room. I bet that&#39;s beautiful too. &#34;I&#39;m just gonna run and get changed make yourself at home&#34; I sit on the extra large corner suite, now this is a sofa I sunk in as I lean back, it&#39;s perfect. by the time I&#39;d become accustomed to the living room Lucas appears over my shoulder, &#34;You look comfortable my love, I&#39;m sorry to disturb but we must leave for my parents now&#34;</p>
