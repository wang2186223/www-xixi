                <p>The weekend drew upon us fast, I&#39;d spent alot of time with Lucas&#39;s Ma, we got on really well, she introduced me to some workers in different departments and places she would help out in when staffing levels were low or if they were just in need to catch up, which was nice. She also went through of the paperwork I would need to organise, luckily it&#39;s simple enough, just pack dealings, some letters here and there and proposal forms for business. Mostly pretty straight forward. Explained my role when we were a couple dealing with matters and how to handle certain situations, some things already came second nature to me. I could see why Lucas loves her so much, she&#39;s a breath of fresh air calm and collected and so incredible helpful. At times it felt like she was holding back on things but I didn&#39;t press if she wanted to share these with me she would, they must be quite personal. She was hoping that Lucas and I would take over in a week or two, his mother believes we will turn the pack around for the better, including better deals and so forth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I get into the shower letting the steamy water run down my body. Mateo made plans to go out with Lucas and Nathan tonight, so I was having a girly time with Nikki, takeaway, bottle of rhubarb gin Nina gave me on our visit and lemonade, some music and of course the wonderful company of my bodyguard Trent. I was actually getting used to him being around now, I look for him if I can&#39;t see him I&#39;m almost like a lost puppy. He was begining to talk abit more too not an awful lot but a little, I&#39;m sure he just doesn&#39;t want to be attached at the end of the day I&#39;m a job. I had to respect that nature, as hard as it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*knock *knock* ***&#34;Trent can you get the door please it&#39;s probably Nikki&#34; &#34;yes Amelia&#34;*** Nikki comes darting in the room luckily I&#39;d put my clothes on in time. ***&#34;That was close I only just put clothes on&#34;*** she laughed at my words, ***&#34;We are wolves Amelia we see naked people all the time when we shift it&#39;s no big deal&#34;*** I never really looked at it that way I just tried to cover myself whenever I could really. ***&#34;I guess your right&#34;*** shrugging my shoulders. ***&#34;What takeaway are we getting I&#39;m starving?&#34;*** Nikki exclaimed holding her tummy. ***&#34;You choose I&#39;m not too fussy I&#39;ll eat whatever normally&#34; &#34;okay so how about Indian?&#34;*** her mouth watering as if she already chosen. ***&#34;Yeh I&#39;m cool with Indian&#34;*** I havn&#39;t had an Indian since my old pack with Roman. ***&#34;I&#39;ll have a chicken madras, pilau rice and a nan bread&#34;*** Nikki giving me her order almost instantly, ***&#34;hold your horses let me get the eats app up first&#34; &#34;sorry I&#39;m just excited, I haven&#39;t had a girly night before.&#34; &#34;Me neither come to think of it&#34; &#34;it&#39;s a first for both of us then, what you gonna get&#34; &#34;I&#39;ll be having a chicken balti, pilau rice and some onion bhaji&#39;s&#34; &#34;I&#39;ve never tried that, sounds good&#34; &#34;you can have a taste when it gets here, Trent would you like an Indian?&#34; &#34;no it&#39;s okay Amelia thank you very much for your kind offer though&#34; &#34;you sure lucas is paying&#34; &#34;no my mate made me dinner before I came you enjoy girls&#34; &#34;no worries&#34; &#34;food should be here in around half an hour&#34;.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We had a couple of drinks while waiting for food, chatting about news and gossip around the pack, Nikki seems to get to know everything. She even knew about the whole Jackson charade and that was supposed to be low key. Apparently people were looking forward to our take over too, in hope that equality and balance is restored, also minimum wages to be set as it stands some people work for nothing but to be member of this pack. Maybe things I learn from Nikki could help me with my Luna role and sway some changes when Lucas and I take over. I miss him. ***&#34;Amelia he&#39;s only gone for a couple of hours with the boys I know that look&#34; &#34;sorry it&#39;s just so hard at times, it hurts to be away from him, you&#39;ll understand when you find your mate&#34;*** letting a frown creep in. One of the boys brought our food up ***&#34;Your delivery Amelia&#34; &#34;thank you Will, here take this I hope it didn&#39;t disturb you&#34; &#34;no not at all Luna anything for you&#34;*** I nod my head in appreciation for his actions he didn&#39;t have to bring it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We dive into food, I think Nikki had fallen in love with my curry seen as she finished what I didn&#39;t want, this girl could pack away some food for such a tiny frame. We had some music on in the background and did a little singalong and dance before Nikki had to head back for the night. ***&#34;I really enjoyed tonight Nikki, thank you for your company&#34; &#34;No Amelia thank you for having me here.&#34; &#34;We will have to do again sometime, or even head out ourselves&#34; &#34;that would be nice, anyway I best be heading off I have work tomorrow and you have a big trip&#34; &#34;no worries I&#39;ll see you soon&#34;*** shutting the door behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back to me and Trent it is then. ***&#34;FBI files?&#34;*** I asked gently ***&#34;whatever you want Amelia, but I do have to ask where did you learn to move like that, the dancing I mean.&#34; &#34;I was a self taught gymnast growing up, I haven&#39;t been able to recently we have nowhere for it here in this pack&#34;*** I sigh ***&#34;my mate does gymnastics, she was actually at competitive level but she just trains people now.
