                <p>Finally unpacked and settled back into the pack, kinda glad to be back, I have so much work to catch up on. Amelia almost ready to take over as Luna, my mother has started to become weaker again, but doesn&#39;t want Amelia&#39;s help just yet. I need to speak to Mark about blood samples too, I let out sigh and fist my hair, so much to do. Amelia wants to catch up with the girls so I go ahead and start on some paperwork.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The council meeting is in a few weeks and it will probably be Amelia and I that attend so it&#39;s imperative the both of us understand the proposals being put forward and anything that may become of interest to our own pack. I&#39;ll manage to drill it in, she&#39;s a quick learner and even better memory so, that&#39;s one thing we have on our side. My mothers situation continuously invading my thoughts, and my dad now isn&#39;t ready to give up the title as Alpha, why I&#39;m not aware but it also means my mother has to keep going with her Luna role which is completely draining her. One minute he&#39;s telling me he needs me to take over in another breath hes saying he&#39;s not ready to had over the responsibility. It&#39;s kinda messing with my head too just wish I there was something I could do for the both of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Mark any chance me and Amelia could pop in for some bloods? We met some hunters on our travels, they caught us with some arrows dipped in wolfsbaine but it didn&#39;t affect either of us. I was just wondering if you could run some tests as to why? Of course pop in when your ready, I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s one of Amelias abilities and it&#39;s affected you too through your marking, it would be a remarkable thing if you are immune. Thanks we&#39;ll pop by when we get a chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hear the girls giggling, Amelia&#39;s giggle so soft and sweet, making my whole body warm at the sound. I love the fact she&#39;s actually getting along here, even with her battles, she&#39;s coping well, she has good friends, everyone here has accepted her, she&#39;s always ready to help when someone asks, not to mention her outstanding beauty both inside and out, this girl is a gift from the Goddesses. Amelia brings me a cuppa, ***&#34;hope your getting on well there Alpha&#34;, &#34;if I wasn&#39;t so distracted by this gorgeous giggle maybe I&#39;d have more done but I don&#39;t mind, it&#39;s soothing to hear you laugh. I&#39;m glad you settled well my love&#34;.*** A warm smile coming across my face ***&#34;we also need to pop over for Mark to take some blood for some tests&#34; &#34;no worries, I&#39;m going to see your Ma inabit too&#34; &#34;no worries let me know when you want to go I&#39;ll pack this up and come with you&#34;***⁹ she just leans in gives me a peck and heads back to the girls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girls head off, Amelia decides a chicken ceasar salad sounds good for lunch so starts doing lunch before we head over to my parents then over to Mark for bloods. Hopefully We&#39;ll be in time for dinner with the pack tonight, so I can see the pack I should be taking control of anytime, well when Da decides he want to give his title in. I set the table as Amelia finishes up, ***&#34;here baby, food is served. hope you enjoy&#34; &#34;looks wonderful beautiful thank you&#34;*** as we tuck into our salad, Amelia starts to chatter on about gossip within the pack the girls had shared, seems like she loved the girls and you can tell she&#39;s never had that kind of bond with anyone. I love the confidence it&#39;s giving her to actually be accepted by others, if it wasn&#39;t for that vile pack I would have never found my girl, one thing I&#39;ll always be thankful for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Ma you sure your okay? you seem to be getting alot weaker again&#34;. &#34;oh it&#39;s fine darling I&#39;ll manage for now but I will let you know if I need you is that fair?&#34; &#34;I guess so.&#34; &#34;Lucas darling would you mind going to do the cuppas please?&#34; &#34;of course not&#34;***  I exit the room to put the kettle on sure that she just wanted to speak to Amelia alone, I try to listen in but everything I hear is muffled, between the kettle and I&#39;m sure my mother is making another noise to drown out the sound. I just hope everything is fine, I mean those two women in there are my world and there is nothing I wouldn&#39;t do for either of them. I make the cuppas and head back in both of them giggling at something. ***&#34;what&#39;s the joke?&#34; &#34;nothing little wolf&#34;*** must be Amelia giving the pack gossip she was laughing about earlier. I&#39;ve never really understood why women feel the need to gossip, do they have nothing better to do sipping at my coffee. ***&#34;How&#39;s things with Da?&#34; &#34;there okay, he&#39;s worried and frustrated and at the moment doesn&#39;t want to hand over the title for some unknown reason. That silly man will never know what&#39;s good for him you know.&#34; &#34;yeh why is that I&#39;m not sure but he also knows I won&#39;t be able to cope as Luna much longer, thats what&#39;s confusing me, he seems to be extremely secretive at the moment&#34; &#34;as long as your okay the moment thats the main thing, Da is always doing something&#34;*** we need to finish up here and head to the clinic. ***&#34;Amelia and I need to head off, Mark wants some bloods tested I may have acquired one Amelia&#39;s abilities we&#39;re not sure so Mark needs to run some tests.&#34; &#34;no worries I&#39;m glad you two are mates your the perfect match, you balance eachother just right.&#34; &#34;we&#39;ll hopefully see you for dinner tonight Love you&#34;, &#34;love you both too&#34;*** she responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Mark why are you taking 3 samples off each of us,&#34; &#34;so I can run other tests against them to see what differences you have and what similarities you have also I can run many tests with more blood&#34;*** I just nod, not that I would understand what he wants for what. ***&#34;That&#39;s all for now guys but, please if you need anything...&#34; &#34;just ask we know, we couldn&#39;t ask for a better doctor now could we&#34;*** I cut him off, he didn&#39;t look impressed but we&#39;d be fine. ***&#34;thanks Mark, see you soon.&#34; &#34;no worries Luna just a harmless link away,&#34;*** we said our goodbyes and offered a tip for all the work he had been doing. ***&#34;no you keep your money,&#34;*** Mark tried to refuse. instead I just left if it in a bundle on the desk. ***&#34;you do enough for us and the pack so it&#39;s up to you either invest in the clinic or spend it on yourself if you wish but I&#39;m not taking it back&#34;*** Mark just shakes his head as we walk out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Shall we head to the diner hall ready for dinner?&#34; &#34;sounds good to me, any idea what&#39;s for dinner?&#34; &#34;actually no I don&#39;t I could be tacos apparently they haven&#39;t had them for a while now, the boys usually start to moan if they wait too long for them.&#34; &#34;I haven&#39;t had tacos in a while now either.&#34;*** As we enter the packhouse I couldn&#39;t smell tacos, smelt more like a steak with all the sides. We take a seat at our table and wait for the others. ***&#34;Amelia I&#39;m worried about Ma&#34; &#34;I know, we can&#39;t force her to allow me to help I did try to convince her with no luck, but I did add that if she changes her mind she&#39;s only got to link me.&#34; &#34;thank you Amelia&#34; &#34; apparently she has Nina calling tomorrow too, for a catch up&#34; &#34;that will be nice she doesn&#39;t get many visitors since she&#39;s been poorly.&#34; &#34;just shows you who your true friends are I guess&#34;*** Everyone arrives for food, ***&#34;food smell delish tonight steak and all the sides can&#39;t go wrong with a good old steak, along as it&#39;s cooked medium/ rare anything else your wasting a good streak.&#34;*** Mateo&#39;s mouth already watering from it&#39;s scent. Food went by rather quickly I could see Ma getting more and more tired as the evening went along. ***&#34;Excuse us I&#39;ll have to get Ava ready for bed she&#39;s getting abit exhausted now &#34;.*** On the same wave length ***&#34;Amelia and I will have to go too to finish off upstairs before we can go to bed&#34;*** I&#39;ve missed our bed, luxury mattress supports in all the right places, Amelia begged for Teddy fleece bedding so my queen got her wish except now it&#39;s like a sauna in bed even if it is comfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to make the bed as best I could with the covers getting all jumbled, Amelia giggled at me. ***&#34;here&#39;s a trick for you&#34;*** she suggested, showing me how quickly a bed could be made without the hassle. ***&#34;see how much quicker that was&#34; &#34;okay smarty pants, it&#39;s still a little early want to watch a film?&#34; &#34;if you want to baby I don&#39;t mind but I&#39;d like to take a shower first&#34; &#34;you go ahead I&#39;ll find a film and make a cuppa.&#34;*** As Amelia heads for a shower I try to pick a film we watched alot of chick flicks recently, I need a good action film or something, perhaps bond himself or a war film? we&#39;ll go war, seems like a good shout, I out that to pause ready, I pop to make us both a cuppa. By the time I got back Amelia was coming out of the bathroom, good timing if I do say so myself. She braids her hair into two Dutch braids to sleep in for the night, I always love the way her hair looks after sleeping in braids, you can see all the multi tones going through the waves and the way the light bounces off her her hair making it sparkle like glitter. ***&#34;ready to watch the film?&#34; &#34;yeh, what are we watching?&#34; &#34;a war film beautiful is that okay?&#34; &#34;yeh thats fine, we&#39;ve watched so many chick flicks recently it&#39;s about time we changed things up&#34;*** goddess I love this girl she&#39;s ready for anything that comes her way.</p>
