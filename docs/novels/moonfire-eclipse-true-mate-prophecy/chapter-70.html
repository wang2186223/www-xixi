                <p>***&#34;I accept your challenge&#34; &#34;It will take place on the field at 11am tomorrow&#34;*** the council arranged. ***&#34;It doesn&#39;t have to be this way you know&#34;*** Amelia stuttered. My father just stormed out without a care in the world so that&#39;s it then a fight to the death it is, letting out a deep sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emotions and stress levels running high at the moment, I&#39;ve stayed silent alot Amelia just stayed out of the way not wanting to add to the pressure. I could feel her stress her emotion and her ache to wrap herself around me, she&#39;s trying to hard to keep herself going, while I&#39;m trying to work everything out in my head. The thoughts of my mothers letter, the thought of loosing Amelia when I take alpha thats even if I can beat Da, I&#39;m not sure on his fitness levels and fight tactics anymore, I haven&#39;t seen him train in so long I don&#39;t know what to expect. Perhaps he&#39;s gonna fight dirty maybe he&#39;s going to go into full on fury. All these things building up more and more. I gotta get out of here. **Lucas we will be fine you know that, I&#39;m here to defend protect and guide which I will with every ounce of my wolf. I know Damon it&#39;s just hard. I get it Luc you lost Ma it devastated all of us, now you need to take your own Da life, for you, Amelia and this pack, most importantly for him he&#39;s not the man he once was, mate is feeling all our tension and stress too it&#39;s not good for her either, she&#39;s being strong for all of us and will be whenever she needs too.** I let out a sigh knowing Damon is right she takes so much on, she does everything she can to help everyone and anyone, Amelia my perfect Luna, with everything she is and everything she will become, Goddess my love grows everytime I look at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Amelia, my beautiful wife, how are you holding up? you seem very distant&#34; &#34;I&#39;m okay just trying to drown out my thoughts by keeping busy, and help you the same time giving you time to process everything, I wish we didn&#39;t get to this you know, I&#39;m scared Luc I can&#39;t lose you&#34; &#34; your not losing me beautiful, I&#39;m always here, right here&#34;*** placing my hand on her heart knowing there&#39;s not much I can do to comfort her thoughts. She wraps her arms around me pulling me into her, letting out a sob. I lift her chin to look at her beautiful golden eyes, always so mesmerising, I can see her every emotion through her golden sparkle. ***&#34;Amelia everything will work out, I&#39;m doing this for everyone including him he&#39;s not the man he used to be, even before you met him&#34;*** she just nods letting more tears escape, I use my thumb to wipe away her tears. ***&#34;It hurts to see you cry Amelia, soon these tears will be gone I want nothing but the best for you and this pack, but right now I need to focus, I have to go train possibly go for a run with Damon try and get us prepared&#34; &#34;I understand, I might head over to the gym to just lose myself there&#34;*** I swipe my hand gently down her cheek and bring her lips to mine sweetly taking in each ounce of passion, love and courage I need from here almost leaving us breathless. ***&#34;I love you Lucas&#34; &#34;I love you too Amelia&#34;*** I head out the door to head down to training grounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Guys I&#39;m heading down the training grounds some help wouldn&#39;t go without a miss. Sure thing bro. No worries I&#39;ll bring my Dad too perhaps he will have some advice on a few things for you.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Training with the boys, pushing harder than ever to make sure there was nothing standing in my way, ***&#34;Lucas I don&#39;t understand why your pushing yourself so hard, your already in impeccable shape&#34; &#34;it takes away some of the anger too&#34; &#34;Lucas your father isn&#39;t the same man.&#34; &#34;I know that but I don&#39;t know anything about the way he&#39;s going to fight this, and I&#39;m angry it&#39;s come to this&#34; &#34;Lucas your father won&#39;t stand a chance, your faster, your tactical and immense stamina, where as your father is just brut force, plus he hasn&#39;t trained since before your mothers passing so he&#39;s probably a little rusty too.&#34; &#34;not to forget since mating Amelia your whole fighting demeanor has changed your father hasn&#39;t seen you train since Amelia he won&#39;t know what&#39;s coming&#34;*** Mateo added ***&#34;I wouldn&#39;t be so sure, but she does give me an upper hand. Only thing he can fight dirty, once wrong slip up from me and...&#34; &#34;Lucas wise up, your not thinking like that now, you have this in the bag the only standing in the way is you. Your emotions are what&#39;s going to get the better of you. There needs to be a cut off you have to let go.&#34;*** Nathan stated firmly, shocking me a little it&#39;s usually Mateo that jumps in, his face stern, he&#39;s extremely serious this time. ***&#34;Look I&#39;m not here to tell you how bad this is gonna feel and how it&#39;s effecting you right now, I will be there to pick up the pieces, but right now you need to let everything go and focus. I am here to support you, protect you and put you on the right path and that&#39;s what I will do either way.&#34;*** I&#39;ve never seen Nathan like this, I&#39;m abit taken back by his words have ,meaning and I respect him for that and he&#39;s right I do need to focus with what&#39;s at hand, so I just nod without adding fuel to the fire. ***&#34;Guys let&#39;s finish up I need to go for a run with Damon let him get some time to practice and train. I&#39;ll catch you for dinner unless Amelia is making food&#34;*** the boys just nod and begin to walk away ***&#34;Good Luck not that you need it&#34;*** Evan tapped me on the shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damons paws pounding against the ground, pushing harder and faster than before weaving between trees and bushes, **don&#39;t cause yourself an injury, I&#39;m not I&#39;m training.** Continuing to push, trying out hunting at speed and different tactics. **Damon I&#39;ve never seen all this. I&#39;ve been watching Tara and wanted to try a few things to see if I could do it my own way, which is paying off I believe. That it is but how is this going to help, I&#39;m becoming more flexible and my thought processes are much quicker now so my reactions to danger are sharper, I&#39;m not a complete idiot you know. Never said that just never really understood the reasoning.** Damon continued go mess around and work on things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon actually starting to exhaust himself takes a little break next to the stream, listening to the water trickle down, calming and soothing. Thoughts of Amelia come to me, images of her fluid dancing and gymnastics pouring in, thinking I&#39;ve been a dick, she&#39;s needed me too, **she doesn&#39;t want all this, she never did she tried everything to work around it but deep down she knew it was going to come to this it was in her letter too don&#39;t forget. Except she doesn&#39;t know the implications if Da had ever biten her she would have lost everything her abilities, her nature, more importantly I would have lost her.** With the thoughts of losing Amelia came thoughts of my Ma she had already gone he took her away from me, All because he couldn&#39;t be what she needed him to be, he was an asshole, it must have weakened him too thats why he&#39;s turned into a savage, induce fear gain control and respect. My poor Ma she must have been through hell and back, no wonder she gave up her fight. Everyone of my emotions now battling inside me. **Let it out, you need to, for everyone, for Amelia and Tara.** The fury the frustration and depression sinking me deeper and deeper unable to bare all at the moment, I feel myself going deeper into myself, everything blurred, my eyes flickering, I hear someone coming but can&#39;t seem to react, her scent invading my nostrils ***&#34;Amelia I....&#34;*** I couldn&#39;t continue my words I couldn&#39;t get anything out, all I hear is Amelia screaming ***&#34;Lucas you better not be leaving me, I can&#39;t do this alone please I need you I love you&#34;*** everything went blank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smell a familiar scent, my eyes flickering to open to see everything white apart from a small figure, it&#39;s Ma she&#39;s here wait, Am I dead? ***&#34;Ma where are we? Am I dead?&#34;*** she let out a chuckle, it&#39;s been forever since I heard that laugh, sending a warm comforting feeling through me. ***&#34;No my son not dead, unconscious&#34; &#34;but how? why?&#34; &#34;Lucas you sent yourself to a dark place where your head couldn&#39;t take anymore so you passed out, my little wolf needs to finish this.&#34; &#34;but I don&#39;t know if I can, I&#39;m so broken&#34; &#34;your not broken little one just going through hard times as we all do, my fight was over, yours is just the begining&#34; &#34;what you mean just the begining? all I want is a simple happy life, Amelia, my pups and the pack&#34; &#34; life is never that simple my boy. You will get there&#34; &#34;I don&#39;t see a way anymore, I don&#39;t have you to guide me anymore I don&#39;t have you to advise me when I&#39;m going wrong&#34; &#34;if you didn&#39;t screw up you&#39;d never learn remember that, you have Amelia, she will share your weight, help you, guide you and support you unconditionally, look how far she has come, she&#39;s taking the pack on solo, there wouldn&#39;t be a pack if it wasn&#39;t for her recently. she&#39;s taken on more than you can imagine aswell as her own emotions&#34; &#34;I know I&#39;ve been shit, I don&#39;t even deserve her, she&#39;s been aimlessly trying to get everything in check and make everyone happy the same time but at her own sacrifice&#34; &#34;because she will stop at nothing to help everyone else she&#39;s special, she is your strength and weakness and everything inbetween and your the same for her&#34; &#34;I just don&#39;t want to be a burden on her she has so much going on&#34; &#34;you need to speak to her more about your tension she will help I promise you, your the reason she does everything she does, There are times where you will need to do the same for her&#34; &#34;Thanks Ma&#34; &#34;Your welcome but I have to go now  and you need to wake up, one last thing she needs to train and control her abilities, her power is incredible but if she can&#39;t control it properly things could go horribly wrong for everyone. I love you my little wolf go back to your family&#34; &#34;Ma wait will I see you again&#34; &#34;I&#39;m always in your heart my boy&#34;***</p>
