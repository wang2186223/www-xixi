                <p>**Lucas your mother isn&#39;t doing so well today she hasn&#39;t got out of bed your father is well being Your father and just telling her to rest, as you know I&#39;ve ran numerous of tests and there&#39;s nothing medically wrong with her. I was wondering may be Amelia could try and help a little just to give me some more time, we just won&#39;t let your father know what Amelia did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We&#39;ll be there now Mark thank you for letting me know . **</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Amelia we must go and see my mother apparently she isn&#39;t doing so well today she hasn&#39;t moved from bed and the further tests that Mark has taken some bloods and ran some tests only prove she&#39;s medically fine. No body knows why she gets like this, but it&#39;s getting worse lately.&#34; &#34;just a thought here, is it because she doesn&#39;t have her true mate and the bond just isn&#39;t strong enough? I don&#39;t know how chosen mates work&#34; &#34;it&#39;s a possibility, it&#39;s crossed my mind.&#34; ***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We head to the bedroom where his mother is ***&#34;well Ma your not looking so great, bad day I take it&#34; &#34;just a little tired it&#39;s been a busy week this week.&#34; &#34;that it has Ma now Amelia is going to place her hands over yours, you may feel warm or cold maybe even a little woozy but it&#39;s okay it should help you out for a short while giving us a little more time to figure all this out&#34; &#34;Theres no need I&#39;m fine just need a little more sleep&#34;*** this is where I get my stubbornness from, ***&#34;no Ma I want you to feel a little better asleast&#34;*** Amelia leans down, ***&#34;Ma I won&#39;t if you really don&#39;t want me to but I won&#39;t hurt you, and I&#39;m doing this for you to feel a little more yourself, not for Lucas not for Mark not for me and not for Brandon, all for you, so what do you say?&#34;*** my mother just nods ever so slightly maybe even scared, in all honesty I am too I don&#39;t know how Amelia can feel so comfortable with this. Amelia places her hands over my mothers and closes her eyes and focuses, with her hands begining to glow a little, my mother face almost in shock, Amelia sat there for almost 5 minutes just hold my mothers hands, when Amelia lifted her hands away, and turned to me, ***&#34;that&#39;s all I can do, I&#39;m exhausted now.&#34; &#34;Thank you Amelia I feel a million times better whatever you did it worked, I feel much better&#34; &#34;Ava I do advise you to rest up today no duties or anything just light stuff, making a tea or something but you will need to keep that energy for now. As for you Amelia you look very pale, drained like someone took the life out of you so I&#39;d advise you got to bed and get some rest yourself.&#34; &#34;I will be Mark I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be able to stay awake even if I wanted to, I just want some sleep now.&#34; &#34;thank you again Amelia&#34; &#34;it&#39;s fine let me know when you need a boost, lets just keep this between us though&#34;*** as we make our way back to the packhouse Amelia started to stumble a little so I carry her bridal style, falling asleep almost instantly, so when we got in I  put her to bed. I noticed she wasn&#39;t wearing the ring either, I put it on her right away hoping it would give her some energy back a little faster as Jordan said it was for her energy or something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sat in the living room chatting with the boys for abit while Amelia sleeps, ***&#34;I&#39;m in two minds  whether to go in this honeymoon or not now, Ma is getting worse and Amelia is completely drained&#34; &#34;I have an idea, my parents own a cottage around 2 hours away from here I&#39;m sure they wouldn&#39;t mind you using it for the honeymoon, that way you can get back if you needed to?&#34;*** Nathan kindly offered. ***&#34;Actually that doesn&#39;t sound like a bad idea&#34; &#34;I&#39;ll double check with them and let you know,&#34; &#34;thanks&#34; &#34;how&#39;s things with Libby mat&#34; &#34;actually pretty amazing I think she&#39;ll want to be marked soon, it comes up in conversation alot but I don&#39;t know when, you&#39;ll know buddy&#34;*** atleast thats something to look forward to. ***&#34;forgot to tell you guys we potentially have another threat well it&#39;s to me specifically, remember Amelia used to bring up this Roman guy, well he sent her a letter, basically telling her she&#39;s going to be with him whether she likes it or not they chose eachother as chosen a long time ago but she found me, accepted me, he didn&#39;t do the same for his true mate he rejected her and still hung up on Amelia.&#34;***  the boys look in shock. ***&#34;you guys can&#39;t catch a break can you.&#34; &#34;the best part is that the black shadow pack stated she ran away to him when you look at her background it clearly states she was made rogue, so they are lying to their pack about her but the question is why? it had already crossed my mind they knew about her being a desert wolf and they felt she was a threat so they got rid of her but I still don&#39;t understand&#34;. &#34;he wouldn&#39;t stand a chance anyway your an alpha he&#39;s just a warrior&#34;*** both the boys laughing at mateos statement. ***&#34;these people need to get better lives&#34;.*** I nod in agreement with Nathan. ***&#34;I&#39;m gonna get some lunch ready now for my sleeping beauty in there. I&#39;ll see you guys inabit&#34;***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I think I&#39;ll do a nice chicken stir fry get Amelia&#39;s energy levels up abit, hopefully Evan and Trish will come through and give us the all ok, meaning we can still have our honeymoon. I set the table letting thoughts take me away, I wonder if it because Ma hasn&#39;t got her true mate that&#39;s why she&#39;s getting poorly, maybe Amelia knows more than she lets on, Ma and her have been spending lot of time together maybe my mother opened up to her the burden of a chosen mate, I know she was very driven for me to find my true mate but never really understood the whole thing, I was just happy someone was on my side. Maybe I had been over looking things between my parents? Guilt starting to wash over me, I should have listened more and tried to understand more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Mark how is Ma now?  she&#39;s better than she&#39;s been for a long time, your mother thanks Amelia very much for her services. How is Amelia? actually she fell asleep on the way home I put her to bed she&#39;s still sleeping but I&#39;m going to get her up for some food now, I&#39;ll be sure to let you know if she needs a check up. Thank you now go take care of your wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Amelia, you going to get up now for some food?&#34;*** Amelia stirs turning herself towards me, ***&#34;How did I get here? is Ma okay?&#34; &#34;you fell asleep beautiful it&#39;s okay you needed some rest but I&#39;ve made some lunch for us, hopefully you&#39;ll feel alot better after that. Ma is better than she has been for months thanks to you&#34;*** she just smiles softly, the goddess before me can make my heart skip beats at just one look, I&#39;m lucky to have such an amazing mate. ***&#34;Need a hand getting out of bed or are you okay?&#34;*** she sends me a devilish smile, ***&#34;could you carry me baby, I feel so weak&#34;*** I knew Amelia was feeling alot better at the point she just wanted me to hold her, ***&#34;of course beautiful&#34;*** lifting her her up and carrying her to the table to place her in her seat. ***&#34;you know you only have to ask if you want me to hold you, I love holding you anyway treating you like the queen you are&#34;*** she blushes a little knowing I&#39;d caught her. ***&#34;Lets have some food hopefully you feel right as rain shortly.&#34;***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia watching some TV while I finished up a few more bits of paperwork for some dealings with the Mayback pack, there will be a large meeting at the council headquarters in a few weeks to just go through some pack dealings, new deals, removals and if packs wish to withdraw or submit themselves apart of the union we share.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**The cottage is yours for the week, it will be stocked and cleaned ready for your arrival. there will be staff there also, the maintain the place and attend to anyone staying there so breakfast and so forth. Thank you Nathan I owe you and your family one. Go and enjoy your honeymoon we will see you when your back.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I draw to a close on the paperwork and Amelia is completely oblivious to anything around her she&#39;s sucked in to this new series, cold cases and whatever else it&#39;s got. I head to the bedroom to get packing for the both of us into two large suitcase. Amelia appears from the living room, ***&#34;where are you going then to be packing up?&#34; &#34;I&#39;m not going anywhere Amelia, We are going on our honeymoon.&#34;*** Amelia immediately jumping around like an excited child, ***&#34;where are we going is it nice? how far are we going I hope it&#39;s not too far because if your Ma plumates we need to be able to get back, but I&#39;m so excited I can&#39;t even think straight&#34;*** she looks like she&#39;s on some high form of sugar rush. ***&#34;it&#39;s about two hours away from here so we can get back if we need to, my original plans we had a private jet taken us to a Villa we own but giving the situation I had to think a little more safe Nathan helped out it&#39;s his parents cottage we are going to, will that be okay until we can sort out a proper homeymoon&#34;***  Hoping she will agree and not feel disappointed.</p>
