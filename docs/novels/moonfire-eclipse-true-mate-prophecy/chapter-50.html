                <p>I rush to get ready as Lucas is very inpatient today. I don&#39;t even know what I&#39;m rushing for but Lucas is really excited so I best get a move on. We head out the door and he ushers me into a BMW car. We head towards a newly built building I&#39;d seen it being constructed but didn&#39;t have a clue what they were planning. As we got closer ***&#34;Amelia I now need you to close your eyes&#34;*** I feel the car coming to a stop and he blindfolds me, safe to say I can&#39;t see a thing. he better be holding my hand my making sure I don&#39;t fall. ***&#34;Lucas is there really a need for all this?&#34; &#34;yes beautiful there is&#34; &#34;your like an excited puppy whats going on?&#34;*** I feel the air shift we must have entered the building, and I smell new everything smells new, paint, concrete, wood and maybe a plastic, my anxiety now playing hell but I&#39;m getting a little excited too, what is lucas playing at? Lucas walks me further until we come to halt. ***&#34;Amelia, I&#39;m going to take your blindfold off now,&#34;*** as he unties his knot gently trying not to tug on my hair, I try to adjust my eyes to the brightness barely making out anything. I look around in amazement as my misty eyes get a clearer picture, A gym, they didn&#39;t have a gym so I&#39;d been using Biannca&#39;s gym. ***&#34;Amelia I hope you like it, it&#39;s yours&#34;*** Lucas&#39;s words of excitement bouncing off the walls, echoing in my ears. ***&#34;Mine? I love it Lucas thank you, other people can use to too, I won&#39;t be able to keep all this for myself. It&#39;s amazing it has everything here&#34; &#34;I was thinking atleast you have so where to go when you need a release and didn&#39;t want you not doing your gymnastics because you didn&#39;t have a gym now you have it all here.&#34;***  I look around inn amazement he did all this for me, I appreciate he likes to shower me with gifts, I&#39;ve never been given anything really until I met him this but this has to be the most meaningful gift anyone could give me ***&#34;you are full of surprises Mr Silverstone this one has to be the best one yet, I love you baby&#34;*** planting a kiss on his perfect lips. I run off and start doing some tricks in the mats letting myself enjoy is while I felt Lucas&#39;s stare directly on me unable to peel his eyes away probably. The mats so new they still don&#39;t have the give in them making it easier, he had thought of bars, beams, trampolines, soft pits literally everything it&#39;s surreal is this all a dream because it surely feels like it. I must have been messing around a while as Lucas sat and watched in awe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After me messing around for a good while we head back to the pack house, still in complete shock what he had done for me and slightly tired now that I&#39;d been doing some gymnastics for a while. I wonder how everyone is getting on with shopping, hope they take it easier on Libby than what she did on me, I was completely exhausted when she was finished with me. Libby seems like she&#39;s being honest and didn&#39;t really have anything to hide. ***&#34;Any news on the black shadow pack this morning after Libby connected to ours,&#34; &#34;actually yes they called my father to ask what the deal was and well they couldn&#39;t really do anything about it seen as it&#39;s for a mate bond, council would throw it out anyway.&#34; &#34;so she&#39;s officially one of us&#34; &#34;that is correct beautiful&#34;*** I wonder how Haisley feels about it all, she&#39;s gotta be pissed that Libby is now mated to a Beta and Lucas&#39;s beta of all people I can&#39;t help but smile at my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas ushers me into the house, other whispering and talking like it wasn&#39;t suspicious at all. ***&#34;yes everyone we are both marked if that&#39;s what everyone is whispering about and I&#39;m very happy that we only have our mating ceremony to complete now&#34;*** Lucas almost yells at everyone, they all pause in silence. ***&#34;that got them to stop didnt it&#34;*** Lucas chuckled. We walked into our room, I head straight to put the kettle on, I need an energy boost so tea is pointless I&#39;ll go with coffee. ***&#34;what time is dinner tonight?&#34;*** I asked ***&#34;booked for 6&#34; &#34;so we only have 2 hours, how long is the drive 15/20 minutes&#34; &#34; so I have an hour and a half to get ready?&#34; &#34;yeh around that&#34; &#34;okay baby&#34;.*** I finish off, making coffee and sit down to drink it before heading off for a shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I get ready letting thoughts go through my head, what would happens if Jackson did manage to kidnap me? How would anybody find me, the thoughts on repeat now since Haisley and my show, she probably went running back to Jackson on what I did. I sigh hard before I know it warm arms enveloping me in, ***&#34;you need to stop this worrying beautiful I am here nothing is happening? &#34;you are safe, did you forget that I feel how you feel, what&#39;s going on in that amazing brain of yours&#34; &#34;just the whole Jackson situation it&#39;s fine&#34; &#34;we&#39;ll worry about that again.&#34;*** he gently kissed my forehead, he&#39;s right not now , so I pushed my thoughts to the back of my mind and continued to get ready, with my hair just dried leaving beachy waves, that would be fine, I continues to make up, light but elegant, with a golds and peach blend eye effect and a lovely rose peach colour lipstick to finish off. I was wearing my nude spaghetti strap with diamanté detailing, long dress with a slit, figure hugging on top with a slight flow to the skirt due to the slit, I was perfect, I&#39;ve got a white bag and shoes and a white shrug to go over my shoulders to complete the look. Everything matched perfectly bar my beachy waves so I go back to add a little more elegance to my hair I put it up in to a low neatly folded bun with a softly curled strand coming over my cheek, now I was ready. ***&#34;Lucas we will have to leave in ten minutes if you want to be on time&#34; &#34;I&#39;m here beautiful&#34;***I see hes amazed by my appearance, &#34;my, my,my, Luna you look exquisite.&#34;*** Already feeling thats he&#39;s highly turned on right now, ***&#34;Why, thank you Alpha you look captivating yourself&#34;*** Lucas wearing a light grey 3 piece suit with a very pale pink tie, making his silvery blue eyes pop, his ever so seductive eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon arrival at  The Blue Dragon restaurant they took both our jackets and took us straight to our table, which was with a spectacular view over the mountains and valleys. ***&#34;Mr and Mrs, any drinks you require while I go and get your menu&#34;, &#34;We&#39;ll take a bottle of Dom Perpignon 1947 please&#34;*** Lucas replied confidently,I never even heard of it to know if I like it, I&#39;ll trust him. ***&#34;yes sir, I&#39;ll get your drinks and bring your menus now&#34; &#34;thank you&#34;*** The waiter constantly looking at me, making me rather uncomfortable, Lucas reaches his hand over to me to comfort me. ***&#34;It&#39;s okay there&#39;s alot of people admiring your beauty, it&#39;s making me unsettled too&#34;*** The waiter returns and pours our glasses and leaves the bottle in the ice bucket for us, and hands us our menus, ***&#34;I&#39;ll be back shortly to take your orders&#34;*** Lucas just nods signaling him to go. I open the menu to find I don&#39;t know anything on the menu it&#39;s all fancy stuff, sitting there confused, I look over at Lucas who catches a glimpse of me looking confused. I take it you haven&#39;t been anywhere like this. ***&#34;I&#39;ll order for us it&#39;s okay, you&#39;ll enjoy I think I&#39;ll go easy on you and just get a lobster with all the trimmings.&#34;*** the waitress popping out of no where ***&#34;is that your order? sorry I overheard on the way to the table&#34; &#34;yes please.&#34; &#34;Good choice it will be with you shortly.&#34;***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Beautiful here isn&#39;t it, I&#39;ve been coming here with my parents for years&#34;*** I try to take in the surroundings ***&#34;could say that, I&#39;ve never been anywhere like it, don&#39;t they do simple menus&#34; &#34;it&#39;s all simple when you understand it, they just use different wording, that&#39;s their secret is sounds posher than what it is Amelia darling&#34; &#34; will you be okay here while I pop to the mens room&#34; &#34; we&#39;re in a crowded restaurant I think I&#39;m fine&#34; &#34;okay I&#39;ll be 2 ticks&#34;*** Lucas wonders off to the men&#39;s room, I can feel nervousness, but not my own but why is Lucas nervous surely it can&#39;t be that bad leaving me to use the toilet. I feel many eyes on me, I seen many of women ogling Lucas too, a little jealousy ran through me but I knew he only had eyes for me and I the same for him, we are the perfect combination and nothing was going to change that, ***&#34;hey beautiful sorry there was a few in there&#34; &#34;it&#39;s  fine but the stares didn&#39;t easy off&#34;*** saying it a little louder so people could hear. ***&#34;I&#39;m not surprised they have their eyes on you, your glowing my girl, if your glowing like that now can you imagine how radiant you will be carrying out pups&#34;*** I almost choke on my drink not expecting that to come out, we both wanted pups we knew that but I wasn&#39;t ready to share yet. ***&#34;don&#39;t worry I&#39;m not ready to share you yet either&#34;*** almost as if he could read my mind, letting relief shower over me. Three waiters approach the table and place out the food neatly, it smelt mouth watering, there was alot of food though. Surely we couldn&#39;t get through all this. ***&#34;enjoy your meal&#34;*** one waiter spoke. ***&#34;thank you&#34;*** I expressed my gratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we tucked into food, the food tastes 100% better than it smelt, almost melting in my mouth, I&#39;ve never had food with so much flavour, textures that all complimented eachother perfectly. ***&#34;I make a good choice beautiful?&#34;*** I moan in approval ***&#34;I told you you&#39;d like it make sure you keep room for desert though, you have to try the chocolate and cherry soufflé it&#39;s the perfect finish&#34;***  I couldn&#39;t promise this food is to die for. ***&#34;I&#39;ll try&#34;*** is all I could manage. Food went along and conversation flowing, deserts ordered, safe to say we are going to come here again, maybe I&#39;ll try something different. Our deserts came mine looked different from a distance that&#39;s because it was, It&#39;s like one of my chick flick films where the man proposes.... suddenly it dawned on me and looked to find Lucas on one knee to the side of me, I looked at my plate the sauce spelt  &#39;marry me?&#39;, I feel my eyes welling up, ***&#34;Amelia we may have marked eachother and will complete our traditional ceremony, but during that I want to become legally yours aswell for that we need to marry, I love you with everything that I am and all that I&#39;ll be, Will you be my wife, my mate and my Luna?&#34;*** okay tears are in full force, I can&#39;t even think of trying to speak I just dive into his arms and his him never wanting it to stop. Of course I&#39;m going to marry this man he&#39;s is my whole universe. ***&#34;shall I take that as a yes&#34; &#34;yes, yes, yes, I don&#39;t know how many times I&#39;m gonna say it but yes, I love you Lucas&#34;***</p>
