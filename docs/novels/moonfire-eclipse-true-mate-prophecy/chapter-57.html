                <p>Both of us snuggled under the duvet, I just trace lines over Amelias back, as she lays there nestled into my chest. ***&#34;Amelia is there something I don&#39;t know about my Ma it&#39;s been bugging me, maybe I haven&#39;t listened enough or something&#34; &#34;Lucas you havn&#39;t done anything wrong if that&#39;s what your implying.  I think it is the bond between her and your father thats making her weak and poorly though, Ma spoke to me about it&#39;s a gift to find your true mate and cherish it, she said doesn&#39;t feel complete, she loves your father unconditionally but there is part of her missing that she never been able to fill, suspecting that of a true mate. That&#39;s why, when you insisted on a true mate she would do whatever it takes to ensure that, it&#39;s painful for her I can tell, I think it&#39;s slowly killing her thats why I will do what I can she&#39;s a good woman and doesn&#39;t deserve the pain she&#39;s going through.&#34;***  trying to collect the information that Amelia had shared with me, one thing stuck, it&#39;s killing her their bond is killing her because her body still wants a true mate. I can&#39;t lose my mother there&#39;s got to be a way. ***&#34;Lucas I know it&#39;s alot to process but anyone can only take so much, I&#39;m here to help your Ma as much as she needs me to be&#34; &#34;Thank you Amelia I got so lucky to have someone as brave, kind and selfless as you&#34;*** trying to hold back my tears but I can&#39;t. Amelia just rests my head on her chest playing with my hair, ***&#34;I&#39;m here baby&#34;*** is all I hear from her she knew it was no time to keep telling things would be okay because no body really knew that. Thank the goddess for this one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We spent hours just talking and comforting eachother within our troubles throughout the night. Breakfast was brought up to bed for us in the morning, Amelia just wrapped the blanket around her as she didn&#39;t have anything on, I luckily had boxers. Breakfast looked outstanding too, croissants, bacon, poached eggs and toast and two coffees, ***&#34;thank you, this looks amazing&#34;*** I expressed ***&#34;your very welcome sir I hope you both enjoy&#34;*** Amelia left blushing as she&#39;s sat there wrapped in the duvet, I just giggle at the sight of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We get ourselves ready after breakfast ready to go for a run, think we both needed it to get rid of some tension. Damon almost bursting to come out now. Not a chance in hell big boy. these people are humans, you&#39;ll scare the shit out of them be patient. Well hurry up then I want to see mate. ***&#34;Amelia you ready to go my queen?&#34; &#34;think so just need to out some shoes on.&#34;*** we head out the door saying goodbye to the staff for a few hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Damon and Tara running around for a while they settle up next to eachother when I feel Tara jolt, damon smells blood, I see an arrow sitting in her back leg, I see two men running towards us, Hunters!, there&#39;s wolfbaine on these I, smell it but it doesn&#39;t seem to affect her Damon rips the arrow out with his teeth and Tara more or less heals instantly. Wolfbaine should have stopped her another couple of arrows fly hitting Damon and Tara both unaffected ripping them out and just run at an immense speed. To lose them. When the coast is finally clear both return to shift back and we both change into clothes both a little shaken and head back to the cottage. ***&#34;Amelia are you okay?&#34; &#34;a little shaken but okay, it was kind of exciting too.&#34; &#34;you realise there was wolfbaine dripping from them arrows?&#34; &#34;no I thought it was supposed to be poisonous to us how are we both here? how did we get away?&#34; &#34;I&#39;m not sure Amelia but I&#39;m glad your okay&#34; &#34; you too baby.&#34;***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We get back to the cottage and I make us a coffee each. One of the staff appear, ***&#34;oh you should have asked I&#39;d have happily made you a cuppa&#34;. &#34;it&#39;s okay your already doing so much around here&#34; &#34;it&#39;s my job and it pays well even when no one is here&#34; &#34;your very lucky to be serving such a generous family&#34; &#34;I have alot to thank this family for they keep me and my family afloat&#34;  &#34;it&#39;s okay to take a break sometimes you know.&#34; &#34;I do usually when I know noone is here&#34;. &#34;I&#39;m glad&#34;.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Amelia my darling you still okay?&#34; &#34;yes I&#39;m fine&#34;*** I sense a hint of jealousy from me talking to one of the staff. ***&#34;why are you jealous have you seen yourself you are a frigging goddess I have eyes for no one but you&#34; &#34;maybe you should watch the way you speak to people&#34;*** I let out a sigh plant a kiss on her fore head and hand her, her coffee. It&#39;s kinda cute that she gets jealous so easily. ***&#34;back to the matter at hand why did the wolfbaine not affect either of us?&#34; &#34;not sure but it&#39;s good either way none of us are injured and both as healthy as ever&#34;*** I&#39;ll have to speak to Mark about it I&#39;ll link him later maybe he will take some bloods when we get back to see if it has something to do with her blood mixing with mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the honeymoon flew by, but we had an amazing time, we went on a mini cruise of the shore line, with dinner included. We went to a theatre play which was really boring for my liking but Amelia loved it. We did an escape room game thing. Amelia was amazing but that&#39;s probably all the fbi stuff she watches, me I was terrible more like a bobble head detective not really doing much, we had a good time together through the honeymoon tonight marking our last night. We already packed up and just kept clothes out for the morning. Actually starting to miss the pack now though, it&#39;s probably been the longest I&#39;ve been away. Amelia just wanted to stay forever she was loving the freedom and the adventures, just proves to me I need to work on spending more time together and enjoying eachothers company outside the pack and duties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breakfast was waiting for us downstairs before we were heading off, ***&#34;you ready for reality to return Amelia?&#34; &#34;not really but I&#39;m sure the girls will soon change that&#34; &#34;the cases are in the car for you ready for your departure Mr and Mrs&#34; &#34;thank you&#34;*** we both muttered. We finish up breakfast and take our dishes out to the kitchen. Finally giving everything a once over to see if we had left anything behind. ***&#34;Thank you for your hospitality guys, heres a tip to split between you, we may be back in the future who knows&#34;*** I hand them an envelope and ushered my wife to the car and get myself in. ***&#34;Time to go home beautiful&#34;.***</p>
