                <p>We finish up dinner and Amelia heads back to see if she can find anything else, giving up after a short while, getting fed up with not being able to get any answers. We cuddle up and watch a film, both of us happy to just relax after what seemed to be a rough time at the moment, eachothers company is just what we both needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the film was coming to an end, Amelia started to get fidgety with that grinding herself against me, making my cock awaken such a relaxing evening and amazing company now all I want to do is tear her clothes off and fuck her in every way possible way. I catch a devilish grin from her in the corner of my eye making me note she&#39;s well aware of what shes doing to me. I playfully grab her and start gently play fighting with her which was far more of a turn on than I expected. Amelia just gripped on to me and started to push her tongue into my mouth forcefully showing me some dominance. I love it when she wants to be dominant and I&#39;m more than happy to submit most of the time, feeling abit naughty I pull away in order to try and take away her dominance by pinning her against the sofa, until she finally manages to get a grip of my hair pulling me down on her indicating she wanted me to pleasure her sweet arousal. I just gently nibble and kiss her thighs, making goosebumps appear over her skin. ***&#34;Lucas tear them off if you have to, I want you to feel what you do to me with every inch of that tongue of yours&#34;*** her wish is my command, in all fairness I wanted to taste her nectar, it&#39;s almost like a drug I will always keep coming back for more. I tore her shorts and panties off and threw them to the floor, ***&#34;won&#39;t be needing them anymore, they look better on the floor anyway&#34;*** I added smirking at her. I began to work on her sweet lips, parting them as my tongue glided over her, her juices mixing with my drool, ***&#34;my beautiful Amelia you taste divine, I want you to release yourself over me&#34;***, I mutter while sliding a finger into her entrance, Amelia pushes into me as I do. I keep at a steady rhythm as I feel her breathing picking up, her walls pulsating around my fingers tightening at every thrust, she&#39;s almost ready for her release, I take my fingers out and bring her to my mouth, I work my tongue to cover every inch of her possible, before feeling her warm, sweet nectar, coating my tongue and lips I keep going for her sweet entrance while gripping on to her hips to ride her orgasm out, with her quivering under each and every wave pulsating through her entire body. Amelia&#39;s body is my temple and that I shall worship for the rest of my days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Amelia begins to recover from her climax, she pushes me on the sofa to a sat up right position pinning me to the sofa. Amelia had gone into her mischievous domination self. Gripping on to my hair and kissing and nipping down my neck and biting into my mark, I feel my climax building now as my cock throbs for action. Before she steadies herself on her feet ordering me to take my garments off and back onto the sofa. Amelia praising me for listening but leaning in for a deep kiss. The smell of her climax lingering, I reach out to bring her atop of me, only to get a slap on the wrist, ***&#34;don&#39;t touch&#34;*** she ordered and she paraded around me not allowing me to make contact with her as she seductively grinds herself upon me, showing me just enough to want more. Wish this girl wasn&#39;t such a tease sometimes I&#39;m struggling to on hold here, I just wanted her bent over the coffee table and fuck every inch of that sweet pussy of hers, instead I&#39;m left begging for more. ***&#34;Amelia please I need you&#34; &#34;you do?&#34; &#34;Amelia my cock is throbbing for your touch&#34; &#34;seen as you&#39;ve been ever so patient.&#34;*** Amelia climbs straddling me being her flexible self she gets herself into a position to allow access for herself and me. Amelia starts with a slow and steady rhythm, to keep the intimacy intact, everytime I lean in to hold she just slaps and my arm, I place my hands behind my back allowing her full control of my body. She runs her hands over my chest and over my abs, tracing my muscle lines spending my blood rushing though each nerve ending ***&#34;Amelia I can&#39;t take anymore please &#34;*** Amelia still keeping up a pace, she suddenly goes harder and faster at me, finding her climax building along with mine. Amelia slows it for and utters ***&#34;can&#39;t have this over too soon&#34;*** this is like torture but always kept me on my toes. Amelia came on me hard and fast from them on finding herself in search for her climax. While both of us go harder and faster we both find our climax and ecstacy coming in quickly before releasing ourselves onto eachother. Letting our electricity and fire ignite into explosion. Both of us left panting and sweaty Amelia just lays atop allowing my body to relax her and steady her breathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both of us ended up falling asleep on the sofa last night, making it slightly awkward in the morning and slightly uncomfortable but we actually slept well. Amelia made breakfast, while I headed for a shower and changed. Amelia got back to reading just after breakfast, hoping to find something. Letting out sighs now and then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Luc Libby wants to spend sometime with Amelia and I need to have a chat with you. No worries come over just finished up here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Mateo and Libby are on their way beautiful&#34; &#34;no worries I&#39;ll pop and put some clothes on&#34;*** probably best seen as she&#39;s walking around in my shirt and her panties. Mateo and Libby enter and Amelia exits. ***&#34;she&#39;s just going to change, how&#39;s everything? Great all in all, except this pack is going to the hell Lucas, we can&#39;t keep going like this&#34; &#34;I know Amelia is looking to see if there&#39;s a way out except blood shed she doesn&#39;t want blood shed, can&#39;t blame her neither do I if I can help it&#34;*** Amelia comes back looking like a goddess, jeans crop top and her slippers, she looks incredible whatever she wears, she put a bin bag on and I&#39;d still find her hot as hell.  ***&#34;tea, coffee anyone?&#34;*** she offered all of us, all accepting a coffee. ***&#34;So how&#39;s everyone?&#34; &#34;Good Amelia, how are you?&#34; &#34;I&#39;m better than ever really&#34; &#34;have you found anything, not yet but I&#39;m still looking&#34; &#34;Amelia I need some advice can we talk&#34;*** Amelia and Libby go sit at the table to chat, while me and Mateo continue to talk about pack problems, my father has beheaded 5 warriors in the last 2 weeks for stupid reasons. Mateo is concerned it&#39;s getting too out of control, I agree he needs to be stopped but I worried of the consequences. ***&#34;We also have had two pack members wandering beyond the borders killed, and note left we&#39;re coming for you&#34; &#34;that&#39;s Jackson displaying his threats in hope of us trying to find something, were not playing into his hands just have a deserved burial and give my condolences&#34;*** Mateo just nodded and agreed it&#39;s probably our safest option right now. I need to keep Amelia safe at all costs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening Amelia got back stuck in the book reading and searching again. Time definitely not our side anymore, not that Amelia was aware of everything my father had been losing control of. After hours of endless searching and reading ***&#34;I&#39;ve got it&#34;*** is all I heard Amelia beyond excitement can barely get out any words I calm her down and tell her to explain. ***&#34;It may not be the best way in the world but it means no blood shed. The council can interfere and claim an Alpha unfit for his role, but the pack would need to vote after the interference if a new Alpha can&#39;t be appointed but I&#39;m sure we wouldn&#39;t need to worry about that you are the next in line you should automatically get the title.&#34;*** This could go one of two ways, my father leaves and doesn&#39;t return or he tries to harm me or Amelia, and I&#39;m guessing he&#39;s not going without a fight. So means blood shed but Amelia was excited and it is the only option so we kinda got to go with it letting out a sigh. ***&#34;Let&#39;s start filing motions tomorrow morning then beautiful.&#34;***</p>
