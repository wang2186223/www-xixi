                <p>Back at the pack house, there was alot of commotion and arguing going on, after breaking everything apart and sending everyone to their rooms we learnt the whole thing started off with the whole Jackson situation. People getting annoyed why weren&#39;t they made aware and others agreeing to secrecy, the list endless. After talking to a few pack members and getting some information apparently it started off with two boys bringing it all out and explaining that the leaders of this pack were not honest with the pack, frankly he wasn&#39;t lying but it was for the safety of everyone and the fact we needed the information if we released that we wouldn&#39;t have got anything. Lucas was already frustrated enough without this to top it off. The following day I gave him some space, he went for a run with the boys while I hung out in the room with Trent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat watching some stupid series I couldn&#39;t even make sense of because of over thinking everything. Why did everything hang in the balance with me being the decider and one wrong move on my front could tip the scales, as if the stress with Jackson and Lucas wasn&#39;t enough this just tops it all off. I just wanted an ordinary life instead I get lumped with being a prophecy, this just sucks. I make a cuppa and sit back down ***&#34;Amelia you are rather tense today, would you like to talk about it or I can take you to a gym so you can release some of your stress, all this isn&#39;t good for you&#34;*** Trent offered politely. ***&#34;I&#39;d love to go to the gym if it&#39;s possible, I don&#39;t think I could explain it in words its all jumbled around honestly but the gym sounds good. I would need to speak to Lucas about it at the moment hes rather worried about everything too&#34;***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Lucas, Trent has offered to take me to a private gym where I can do some gymnastics to reduce my stress levels, do you have any problems with this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You go ahead Amelia it might do you some good, clear your head abit, beautiful. I was just checking incase you didn&#39;t want me going anywhere at the moment with everything going on. I have full faith in Trent you carry on I&#39;ll see you for dinner, I love you. I love you too baby.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;All set to go?&#34;  &#34;I think so I just need to grab a few bits from the wardrobe&#34;*** I indicated. Trent nodded. I finally get to go to a bloody gym, it&#39;s heavenly, I put my leotard and few other bits in a bag ready to go. ***&#34;I&#39;m good to go Trent&#34; &#34;okay it&#39;s about 20 minutes from here so not too far.&#34;***  As we drive from the pack and out of town down the highway for a short while, we began to approach what looked like an abandoned building, my nerves creeping up on me now. ***&#34;Trent where are we going?&#34; &#34;like I said Amelia a gym it&#39;s private so you can have all the peace in the world here&#34; &#34;I don&#39;t like the look of this place, Trent your freaking me out, Amelia you need to trust me it&#39;s just a blinking gym&#34;*** my breathing getting faster my heart almost pounding out my chest, Tara ready to pounce at any second. I find my eyes fixed on a tall dark haired woman who is now approaching the car, this isnt making it easier. ***&#34;Amelia darling, Trent said you were abit scared to come in, it&#39;s fine, it&#39;s my private gym, I&#39;m Biannca Trents mate&#34; &#34;okay, I&#39;ll come with you&#34;***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I enter the building I see a whole gymnasium, with all the apparatus, beams, bars, pits, routine mats, trampolines you name it this gym had it. ***&#34;It&#39;s taken a while to get to this, we get very little funding.&#34; &#34;Sorry guys I just..&#34;*** I feel the guilt taking over my body ***&#34;it&#39;s okay Amelia there&#39;s alot going on your right to be cautious.&#34;*** Trent cutting me off. ***&#34;What do you normally do in gymnastics&#34; &#34;floor routines they let me express myself&#34; &#34;go ahead, there&#39;s a docking station there for you to use your music.&#34;*** I go ahead and warm up, while Biannca and Trent sit on the sidelines talking amongst themselves letting me do as I please. I was lost in myself from then just focusing on me and nothing else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I must have spent a couple of hours at it now. Biannca throwing in some tips now and then helping me perfect my moves. As I stretch myself out to cool down. ***&#34;Do you realise how talented you are? Have you ever had lessons&#34; &#34;self taught mainly&#34; &#34;Some people have to work hard to get to your standard even with a coach, you should be proud of yourself&#34; &#34;it&#39;s the only thing that allows me to release everything I suppose&#34; &#34;Amelia we better get going, Lucas already linked me he&#39;s making food now, I&#39;ll see you shortly my love&#34;*** think it&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve seen Trent actually relaxed, ***&#34;Amelia your welcome here anytime&#34; &#34;thank you&#34;*** I whispered as we head back to the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas and I curled up on the sofa watching a film, trying to avoid any discussion of events going on around us but I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about the note my parents left me and the vial Jordan had given me. I needed to make decisions soon. I just didnt know what to be thinking anymore, the only thing I know for sure is that I love Lucas with all my heart. ***&#34;Amelia, how you coping with everything?&#34; &#34;just confused and tired by it all really&#34; &#34;I&#39;m no different to you, I&#39;m just glad we have eachother to rely on&#34;*** luckily he was right but so much on my mind not even his touch was calming me at the moment so much anticipation and still have to deal with a note and a vial. ***&#34;whats on your mind beautiful you just can&#39;t seem to relax&#34;*** clearly noticing me battling with myself ***&#34;I know I&#39;m sorry just this note and vial playing on my mind, I don&#39;t know how I feel about it all&#34;*** Lucas wraps his arms around me ***&#34;I&#39;ll give you my opinion but of course you still need to make your own decision, I would read the note and hope I&#39;ve had some sort of explanation and give me something so I could move on. As for the vial I&#39;m not sure about it, I know nothing about it and wouldn&#39;t want to take any risks, but of course the decision is yours to make and I will support whichever you choose.&#34;*** I nuzzle myself into his chest, this man is just beyond amazing, I couldn&#39;t of asked the goddess for a better man. ***&#34;thank you baby I love you&#34;*** I commented gently, while he places a kiss on top of my head running his hand through my hair, ***&#34;I love you too&#34;***.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We go back to duties tomorrow so we made the most of our time together now. It&#39;s getting ridiculously hard to be away from him all day everyday, when we take over the plan is that Da&#39;s office is extended to make room for a desk and such for me too, so we don&#39;t have to spend all our time apart. Other than when we had other duties to tend to. I need a shower before then after being in the gym I feel abit gross and I don&#39;t think his mother will be too pleased if I smell of sweaty pits and have sticky hair. ***&#34;Lucas I&#39;m gonna head for a shower, I feel gross.&#34; &#34; you carry on beautiful I&#39;ll make you a cuppa&#34;*** I head towards the wardrobe pick out some random pj&#39;s and grab towel and head in the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let the steamy water run over my body, hoping to wash away some of my troubles with it, **Amelia you need to read that note, you will feel better after it, it&#39;s the only way your going to be able to find peace you cant keep this up you&#39;ll make yourself sick. I know Tara I just don&#39;t know if I&#39;m ready, everything was fine up until yesterday, now I have so much more on my plate.** feeling my emotions becoming unstable. **I&#39;m not just an ordinary girl, I have so much weight on my shoulders now Tara and I don&#39;t know how to take it all in. Amelia you can live your life as you please don&#39;t let the prophecy get in the way of that, your perfect the way you are, and your destiny is just to be you, I&#39;m here for that reason the prophecy would have been fulfilled you being you and without you knowing about it so please don&#39;t let it alter you.** Tara trying to reassure me and she&#39;s right it would have but jnstead someone put it on me in words. **We will get through this together with Lucas and Damon.** I feel tears welling up in my eyes, it&#39;s all so much I thought I wanted answers now I kinda wish I didn&#39;t have them. Its too much to bare all at once. I just sit in the shower letting my tears flow, **Amelia we are one and will get through everything I promise.** Tara hated it when I cry she just laid and whimpered knowing I had to let it out. I must have been here a while because all of a sudden I feel arms drape over me, ***&#34;I&#39;m here beautiful&#34; ***.</p>
