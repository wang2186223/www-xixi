                <p>*Dear Amelia,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know I should have written this sooner and I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t but I couldn&#39;t find the words to say, you ran away, I didn&#39;t know what to think anymore, you left me. I hope you are settled well into your new life without me. I&#39;m aware you found your mate after you ran away I was so hurt and so sure you would be with me forever and then to make things worse I found out you actually mated and went on to live with him and be his Luna. A Luna of all things life just kept throwing things at me. I was distraught to think you actually left me. My Amelia left me for an alpha, I had rejected my true mate thinking you would come back to me as we promised together for ever chosen mates, that&#39;s what we promised. Either way Amelia you will be my mate one way or another, I will come for you Amelia you are MINE! *</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*The pack security got tighter, training got harder and God only knows but the Alpha was secretive. Rumours flying around that there were threats to the pack other saying we were preparing for battle, I hope it&#39;s with the scum that has taken you away from me, I am now alone and weak while your living the high life. I&#39;m going to take every ounce of that away from you I promise you that and we can be together happily as we should have been.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I love and miss you Amelia, words cannot describe my feelings right now. I can&#39;t wait to be reunited my sweet*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Roman</p>
                
                
                
                <p>xxx*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell is this in aid of,  it&#39;s a threat but kind of love letterall at the same time. I never ran away for starters I was made rogue because of him and his actions which I have no idea of. How the hell can he put all this on me when he hasn&#39;t even bothered to check on me or anything else for that matter. Another hurdle to get over now great, as if we don&#39;t have enough on our plate. Question is do I handle this myself or should I tell Lucas, it&#39;s only going to infuriate him even more. Tara frantic **you cant hide this Amelia mate wouldn&#39;t be happy. I know I just don&#39;t want to hurt him and cause more stress than we have. Amelia you will hurt Lucas more if you hide it and he finds out another way.** I guess Tara is right it would break him if he knew I had hidden it if he find out from someone else making me feel uneasy about telling him, I decided Friday would be best he&#39;s out to enjoy tonight I&#39;m out all day tomorrow so Friday evening hopefully we will have some quiet time just the two of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Friday morning and afternoon had been busy to say the least between picking everything up and sorting out decor out with the staff, what we wanted what we didn&#39;t want, where everything was going to go and who&#39;s doing what, this stuff is exhausting. Luckily Lucas and I had the evening to just be together before we go our separate ways again tomorrow midday until we meet at the alter. We ordered a pizza and put a film on and cuddled up on the sofa. ***&#34;I can&#39;t wait for tomorrow beautiful we complete our mating process and become husband and wife&#34; &#34;I&#39;m excited too&#34;*** also feel a little uneasy too, all because of that stupid letter. ***&#34;Whats the matter Amelia you dont seem fully committed?&#34;*** Lucas asked. ***&#34;it&#39;s not that I love you Lucas I want you and only you for the rest of my life I&#39;m just scared that everything is going to fall apart after this&#34;*** showing my insecurities. ***&#34;what do you mean beautiful? talk to me I&#39;m sure we can work this out together&#34; &#34;firstly there&#39;s the problem with Jackson, now Roman too I just can&#39;t catch a break&#34; &#34;isn&#39;t that your friend from the old pack?&#34;*** I nod in defeat ***&#34;here he sent me a letter read for yourself&#34;*** As soon as Lucas starts reading I can feel his anger beginning to rise, letting out a growl as he reaches the end. ***&#34;Amelia this is not your fault, one you didn&#39;t run away you got thrown away, if the alpha isn&#39;t honest with it&#39;s pack that&#39;s a bad sign and Roman wouldn&#39;t stand a chance beautiful, I&#39;m not giving you up in this lifetime or the next you are my one and only&#34; &#34;I know that but it&#39;s as if he&#39;s blaming everything on me when I did nothing wrong, they blamed him for why I was made rogue, I kinda feel sorry for him he&#39;s been in the dark and rejected his mate for me and I don&#39;t want him back it&#39;s just confusing, I found you and I was never letting you go after that. why didn&#39;t he do or feel the same&#34; &#34;it&#39;s okay to feel like that beautiful and it&#39;s certainly not your fault for any of this. You are following your destiny and we just meet a couple of hurdles but we will get through all of this together.&#34;*** he brings me in tighter, planting a kiss on my head as a let out a slight sob, his reassurance is warm and comforting soon bring me back to calm and relaxed. ***&#34;come on baby let&#39;s enjoy the rest of this film then head to bed, no being naughty now Amelia we will have plenty of that after our wedding&#34;*** sending a wink at me, I just wanted him close I didn&#39;t want seductive playful Lucas I wanted the warm comforting loving Lucas, his company was all I needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saturday morning flew by Lucas and I sat down for a light lunch before he would be taken away from me, and the girls over run the place to get me and themselves ready. ***&#34;Todays the day baby we become one for the rest of our lives&#34;*** I express ***&#34;we became one the moment we met beautiful but today we make it official and you are completely off limits to anyone other than me&#34; &#34;double check Mateo has the rings when you head over&#34; &#34;don&#39;t worry they&#39;ll be in safe hands&#34;,*** I take our dishes and put them in the dishwasher, ***&#34;right it&#39;s almost 1 beautiful I&#39;ll have to leave soon, you need the time to ready yourself and the girls. Me and the boys will help Nina and Rich to lay out the food ready for after the ceremony&#34;.&#34;thank you send them up once your done with that&#34;, &#34;will do, I&#39;ll see you later beautiful&#34;*** planting a kiss on my head. ***&#34;later baby&#34; ***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gin was going down well while we were all getting ready and giggling at one and other. Lucas&#39;s Ma decided she would join us. Nikki was getting on with doing people&#39;s make-up and hair,  I was left until last. ***&#34;Girls it&#39;s half 3 now the ceremony is at half 4 we have an hour and no one is dressed&#34;*** Nina muttered. Libby and Nova go to get dressed, Lucas&#39;s Ma expressed that she would get back to Brandon to get ready and meet us there. Nina was already dressed, I just needed my make up and dress , shoes, jewellery and I&#39;ll be good to go. my hair pinned off my face into a half updo with gentle curls coming down my back, and a messy, elegant looking half up half down hairstyle, my make up now finished into perfection, soft nudes and golden browns, giving me a natural make over, I looked flawless, ***&#34;is the beautiful bride ready yet?&#34; Rich shouted from the living room. &#34;just need to get her dressed&#34; &#34;well hurry up&#34; &#34;don&#39;t get your knickers in a twist dear&#34;*** Nina chuckled. They helped slide me into my dress, it felt even more perfect than before, slightly more fitted too. Nikki carefully slid my veil into my hair avoiding destroying her masterpiece, Libby put on the necklace Jordan had given me and put my shoes on for me. ***&#34;come on ladies it&#39;s 4.25 we only have 5 minutes&#34;*** in the last word the girls opened the door to present me to Rich who started to well up instantly. ***&#34;now that&#39;s worth waiting for, you look gorgeous my girl, here this is a gift for you,&#34;*** a crystal hair piece that attached directly under my veil so when I took that off I would have the perfect hair piece to match everything else. ***&#34;now your ready my darling let&#39;s get you hitched&#34;. &#34;Thank You for everything Rich will you do me the pleasure of walking me down the aisle?&#34;*** I asked full of pride. ***&#34;I thought you&#39;d never ask&#34;***</p>
