                <p>It&#39;s been two whole days since the proposal, along with a whole lot of busy with telling everyone, the only people left to tell were Nina and Rich, which we would share the news tonight. Everyone seemed really excited for us and couldn&#39;t wait for the ceremony and wedding all in one then, then following week we are to take over the pack in the Alpha ceremony where everyone would be appointed, but he&#39;s still struggling to find a chief warrior. So I think he&#39;s doing some sort of trials with Evan today with the warriors to see who would be suitable for the title. While I&#39;ve been asked to join Ma today for some Luna stuff although I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be about Luna stuff at all more like wedding talk. I couldn&#39;t wait and to add her and Nina are the closest I&#39;m going to get to a mother after all. I let out a large breath feeling the sadness wash over me, If only she was here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Amelia are you okay?  yeh just thinking about my mother and how I wouldn&#39;t have her to share my big day, but I do have Nina and your Ma who treat me like there own. It&#39;s okay to feel sad beautiful it&#39;s only natural, have you thought about when you want to do this? cause I was kinda thinking Saturday but we would have to decide so Da can send out the invites for some members to other packs. Lucas you think we can pull off a wedding in four days? Yeh why wouldn&#39;t we? we have a massive field I can put a marquee on, and decorate then turn it around after the ceremony, we have plenty of decoration, flowers, an arch and so forth. Saturday it is then, I love you Alpha. I love you more Luna.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay so today will definitely be wedding talking. We&#39;ll make plans to go shopping for my dress tomorrow, Nikki will want to do my hair and make up for my big day. Oh lord what am I doing how the hell am I going to pull this off. I head to Lucas parents house where I will be meeting Ma, deep in thought I see one of the guards running towards me in the corner of my eye. ***&#34;Amelia I completely forgot about this, there&#39;s a letter here for you, I don&#39;t know who it&#39;s from but it was left at the boarder of the tree line&#34; &#34;Thanks Mike&#34; &#34;no worries Luna&#34;.*** I place it in my pocket and toddle my way to Ma&#39;s house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Amelia darling come in, I have tea waiting for you.&#34; &#34;Thank you&#34;***  We head into the kitchen, it&#39;s always the kitchen with her, she loves it in here. ***&#34;Congratulations on finally getting marked, I know Lucas is over the moon.&#34; &#34;We both are, I thought I loved him before but since marking it&#39;s just grown, I think we are both feeling the effects of our bond strengthening by the day&#34; &#34;I am so happy for you both, when do we plan on having the ceremony to finalise the process?&#34;*** I start to get a little nervous the fact we only have four days to pull this off. ***&#34;well that&#39;s what Lucas surprised me with this morning, seen as he wants to not only have a mating ceremony he wants to married legally by the state too, he wants all this by Saturday&#34; &#34;Saturday? ... we better get to work then&#34;*** she replied bursting with excitement. ***&#34;I would like you to come dress shopping with me along with Nina, Nikki and Libby&#34; &#34;of course I will why wouldn&#39;t I? your my daughter now&#34;*** I feel warm fuzzy feeling, she sees me as her daughter, I couldn&#39;t be happier so overwhelmed I wrap my arms around her. ***&#34;Hey, let&#39;s get some plans together what do you think&#34; &#34;Good idea, Lucas wants a big marquee put on the training field. he mentioned you have everything we would need?&#34; &#34;that is correct Amelia we have all the decorations and if he wants in on the training field on the field it is. I&#39;ll get the staff to sort decorations and placements out the morning of the wedding the main things to organise is flowers, dresses, shoes and accessories for you and the girls and suits for Lucas and the boys&#34; &#34;can&#39;t forget invitations, I&#39;d like them to be simple and elegant.&#34; &#34;I know someone we could see in one of the stores just inside the border she is probably the best I know. I also know a bakery just in the next town who could make your wedding cake., I&#39;m so excited&#34;*** I see her frown slightly ***&#34;Ma are you okay?&#34; &#34;yes dear just brings up the memories I don&#39;t have of that kind of thing, you see me and Brandon are chosen mates, arranged, it was never nice and fancy just a duty really. It still hurts now to know my true mate is out there&#34; &#34;Lucas did mention something but I didn&#39;t know it was still affecting you, I mean I thought you just fell in love after marking&#34; &#34; you do and I do truly love Brandon but I always feel a missing piece of me is somewhere and it hurts. That&#39;s why I was so keen on Lucas to find a true mate not a chosen it leaves a little hole you will never fill&#34;*** tears start to stain Ava&#39;s face I wrap my arms around her, while she trys to regain composure.***&#34;come on Amelia let&#39;s get in touch with some people to visit tomorrow&#34;.</p>

                <p>**Amelia my beautiful bride to be, I hope you and my mother have had a lovely day together, I&#39;ve informed my father of Saturday too and luckily he only has to pay a small sum to afficiate the wedding side so he is doing that and also we have sorted invitations out already and they have gone out thanks to the cavalry. Thats amazing Lucas one thing less for me to do tomorrow, flowers and cake are sorted, Ma said she will get staff to arrange the marquee and decor the day of the wedding as we won&#39;t be having our ceremony until dark. I think she will be getting staff to do the catering too. I have to go shopping with everyone tomorrow you and the boys, Rich and Da have an appointment in the tailors tomorrow at 11.30  do not be late. See beautiful I told you we could do it in 4 days love you see you later. I love you too baby.**</p>
