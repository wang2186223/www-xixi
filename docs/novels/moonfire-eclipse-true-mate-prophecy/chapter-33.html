                <p>I wake up to the smell of what I believe is waffles cooking, and Lucas not in bed. I start to think to myself was I a little too cold last night, I can&#39;t of been he hurt me, real bad, he can&#39;t just toss me around how ever he feels like, I have feelings too. I wipe the sleep from eyes and stretch out my body. I slept well considering the circumstances, heading out of the bedroom to find Lucas making waffles in just his boxers, ***&#34;Good morning beautiful, waffles be ready in just a tick&#34;*** happily, he&#39;s in a good mood this morning not sure im feeling the same. ***&#34;thank you&#34;*** I answered sweetly. ***&#34;Your in a good mood&#34; &#34; I am indeed&#34; &#34;what&#39;s on the schedule today?&#34; &#34;Firstly breakfast, then Mateo, Nathan and the informant Levi will be joining us to discuss any further information and what we need&#34; &#34;I have training just after lunch then I should be free for the day so I was thinking we could head out somewhere&#34;*** He&#39;s definitely feeling guilty. ***&#34;sounds like a plan then&#34;.*** As we eat breakfast and chat about what do we intend on doing about the whole Jackson thing and what the end result could be, Mateo and Nathan arrive. ***&#34;sorry guys didn&#39;t realise you were still eating ignore us and carry on.&#34;***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We finish up food and chat with the guys more about what we needed to find out about his plans and how we intend on pursuing. Levi finally joins us after what seems to been a while now. ***&#34;Sorry I&#39;m late Alpha, Jackson called a meeting&#34;*** bowing his head hoping for forgiveness ***&#34;it&#39;s okay, take a seat&#34; &#34;anything you have to report on the matter&#34;*** Mateo speaks out abruptly ***&#34;Mateo no need to be like that now was there&#34;*** I scowled leaving Mateo looking sheepish. ***&#34;Thank you, you must be the future Luna of this pack, Jackson now has to try and speed his plans up and is calling more training now&#34;*** he sighed. ***&#34;He has some support of another pack still reluctant to say what pack but I&#39;ve heard him mention the name Haisley alot not sure if that means anything to you guys, another thing he has plans to retreat from the pack soon. Although I can&#39;t give you an exact timescale on that.&#34;*** Shit we don&#39;t want him to leave so soon we need more information and The black shadow pack are involved, thats just great news just what I wanted to hear I went on to ask ***&#34;are there any pack members you can give me the names of, so we can keep an eye on them and their actions? also you mentioned the plans on leaving soon, how are you ment to give us information? or are you doing this to gain information from us? how do we know we can trust you?&#34;*** I press on ***&#34;I&#39;m risking my life just sitting here with you lot isn&#39;t that enough? I also won&#39;t be leaving when he leaves&#34;&#34;*** Levi exclaims ***&#34; what so you can stick around and feed information back&#34;*** Lucas shouted ***&#34;actually yes there are 8 of us who are sticking behind in order to feedback information and routines since he will be leaving he will need information but I can give false information, in order to protect you, I will do a blood oath now if you have any doubt in me&#34;*** for some reason I didn&#39;t doubt him, he didn&#39;t have to be here giving this information and doesn&#39;t mean we need to feed anything back to him he gains nothing in return so what harm could it do. ***&#34;if you give me a pen and paper I can give you names of the ones I know that are apart of this rebellion&#34;*** I hand him a note pad and pen ***&#34;thank you levi you may leave once you have completed that and be on your way don&#39;t make yourself suspicious and Thank you&#34;*** I appreciate  his support but don&#39;t want to seem weak either ***&#34;Yes Luna thank you, Also congratulations to you both I can already tell you we will already have an amazing Luna here.&#34;*** suggesting gratefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After everyone had left for training I sat in our room, flicking through channels and deciding what to watch to occupy my boredom while Lucas was busy we were ment to be going out later so I just didnt know what to do with my time, Nikki said she would see me today wonder if she had an hour spare to catch up but then I didn&#39;t know what she liked other than clothes, fashion, make-up and so forth, perhaps she could help me get ready for when Lucas got back so we could go out for abit but didn&#39;t know what his plans were did he want to go somewhere out of the pack or just for a run with Damon and Tara. I&#39;ll just ask Nikki to help im sure she&#39;ll be okay with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Nikki any chance your free?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yeh for about half hour before I have to head to the nursery one of the girls needs cover, why what&#39;s up?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could you come and give me a hand to get ready Lucas is taking me out but I don&#39;t know where or to do what so I was hoping you&#39;d be able to help with a good all rounder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>no problem your fashion guru is on her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thanks**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikki arrives in her excited manner, she has so much energy I don&#39;t know where she stores it all. ***&#34;Hey girl, sorry to have bothered you I just really don&#39;t know what to wear or what to do with my hair just thought I&#39;d ask you plus I don&#39;t know anyone else here&#34;*** I blush ***&#34;it&#39;s okay I&#39;m more than happy to help, I usually have Fridays free so maybe you could come hang with me and one of my mates that&#39;s only if you can, just to you know get to know some people around here.&#34;*** she offered generously ***&#34;thank you Nikki I might just take you up on that offer&#34;*** I replied ***&#34;so we know nothing about what your doing where your going, so safe bet usually I&#39;d go with a nice pair of jeans, some pumps, a nice top and blazer that way you can look pretty much the part for anything. Let&#39;s have a look what we have, dark skinny jeans, white pumps and blazer with a black crop top with spaghetti straps will look nice&#34;.***  handing me the clothes looking through my hair things ***&#34;come along I&#39;ll give you some waves then I better be going, sorry I can&#39;t stay a little longer.&#34;*** my hair looks beautiful with beachy waves, she always knows what will look best, I&#39;ve have done soft curls but the waves finish up the look nicely. ***&#34;Thank you Nikki, your a star&#34;*** I insist while checking out my hair ***&#34;no worries I&#39;ll catch you soon enjoy your date&#34;*** I&#39;ll try thinking to myself while she&#39;s smiling like a Cheshire cat as she exits the room. I hope he won&#39;t be too long now frowning to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ve been here a day and half and so much has happened already, I&#39;m mated, I got a new friend, large shopping spree I would have never had this in my old pack but now My old pack are working with the enemy Jackson, I don&#39;t know who&#39;s involved or to what degree but this is going to be a bumpy ride Tara offering some confort. I&#39;ll just have to enjoy my date with Lucas and hopefully push everything aside.</p>
