As I straighten myself out everyone notices I&#39;m awake, ***&#34;have a good sleep Amelia? you must have needed that you look far more alert&#34;*** making me consider had they all been just watching me at some point feeling a little conscious. ***&#34;yes thank you, I didn&#39;t even think I needed that much&#34;***  I was lying after last night&#39;s sex I definitely needed it ***&#34;I&#39;m glad, Lucas is quite the gentleman holding you all the way&#34;*** I wrap my arms around Lucas ***&#34;he is, quite the man you have raised here&#34; &#34;Thank you&#34;.*** We head down a dirt track, quite bumpy I&#39;m glad he woke me before this, I think I&#39;d have shit myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I see a large building in the distance was seemed like only one building standing alone with a few others in a further distance, I stare in awe, it&#39;s massive, like 5 times bigger than our pack house and it&#39;s stunning, old stone walls almost like a castle, ***&#34;this is amazing&#34;*** I whisper to myself. Lucas must have heard me, ***&#34;I know it&#39;s impeccable but the whole pack lives there and the further buildings are shops and few restaurants and that&#34; &#34;do they do it for safety?&#34; &#34;yes and they like to all be together it&#39;s how they have always ran this place so they know no different really&#34;*** shrugging his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we pull up in front of the house we are greeted by 3 smartly dressed men, ***&#34;Good evening, Glad you could make it on such short notice,&#34; &#34;we wouldn&#39;t miss it now would we&#34;*** Da replied ***&#34;Can we take anything to your rooms Alpha Silverstone&#34;*** I find myself thinking of the endless possibilities of this place ***&#34;yes they are in the trunk labelled, for you thank you very much, here&#34;***  handing over a tip as we walk towards the large building, both excited and nervous the same time, I&#39;d never been to anything like this or ever imagined going to one to be honest. Inside the doors is gorgeous creams and golds throughout the entrance with a large double staircase meeting in the middle heading to more stairways, alike. I just couldn&#39;t believe my eyes it was magnificent. ***&#34;Hey dude, congratulations finally getting your mate&#34; &#34;yeh was about time only waited a year and half, I see you found yours too congratulations both of you whens your ceremony?&#34;*** I see the nervousness in Lucas ***&#34;not sure yet I want her fully ready before I take her completely&#34;*** I feel the relief I don&#39;t think I&#39;m ready either ***&#34;you know what they say if you don&#39;t mark her soon she&#39;ll go into heat making you mark her&#34; &#34;I can hold I think, anyway Amelia this is Cole future Alpha of the Mayback pack and Cole this is Amelia my one and only.&#34;*** my eyes widen with his words I hope he can control himself  ***&#34;Lovely to meet you Amelia, I hope he&#39;s looking after you and all your beauty I&#39;ve never seen anyone quite so striking other than my mate of course&#34;*** taking my hand and pecking the back, felt quite revolting if I&#39;m honest, gentlemanly but revolting just have me a really cold feeling, only Lucas was to touch me he is my mate not this man feeling myself trying to resist showing any emotion towards it. ***&#34;nice to meet you too&#34;*** I smiled politely not knowing what else to say. ***&#34;Lucas, Amelia these men will escort you to your room, I hope you have a lovely stay with us, Dinner will be at 7.30&#34;*** I whispered ***&#34;thank you&#34;*** while Lucas just nods his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We are get to our room which is even decorated with creams and golds, four poster bed with gold silk sheets, sitting area with a cream fabric sofa, and small coffee table, it&#39;s perfect. I remember the feeling I had when Cole touched me which turned me cold. ***&#34;Amelia you look lost here, everything okay?&#34;*** Lucas looking over me concerned. ***&#34;I&#39;m okay I was just feeling sick and revolted when Cole kissed my hand&#34;*** Lucas laughed, ***&#34;thats normal beautiful it means your body will only ever respond to my touch no other male&#34; &#34;that maybe but I didn&#39;t like it and I would kindly ask you to refrain from allowing other men touching me in such manner again&#34; &#34;your wish is my command beautiful but for now we only have an hour until dinner and it&#39;s formal so I think we need to head for a shower and get ourselves ready&#34;*** sending a wink my way. Oh god I know what that means and my body already reacting to him I feel my arousal creeping in, and the sparks already setting off my nerve endings. I strip off before he could even ask me to join pulling him along with me ***&#34;So my Amelia is feeling little naughty too&#34;*** I press my lips into him and whisper, ***&#34;was it that obvious&#34;*** he turns the shower, while I deepen the kiss letting my tongue in evade him, we step into the shower without breaking our kiss, letting his hands wander and caress my skin, sending electricity through my body, I feel him cupping my breasts and squeezing hard and firmly on my nipples, letting moans escape breaking our kiss, he plants kisses down my neck and across my collar and down when he finally reaches my nipple sucking and nibbling hard enough to make me pant and moan for more. I reach my hand down and start to stroke his member while he leans back in for a deep kiss, he lets out a little moan, ***&#34;Amelia your perfect&#34;*** he whispers, I come to my knees slowly licking the tip of his now rock hard member which barely fit my hands with it&#39;s thickness, I start to take him in my mouth gently sucking while moving my head with the rhythm, as I start to ease in a little more I take him deeper, as far as I could without chocking, Lucas screaming ***&#34;fuck Amelia&#34;*** pushing my head further into him feeling his pulsating cock close to his release I take him faster and harder making him moan and pant, while releasing himself down my throat, he tastes magnificent as always he pulls me up and turns me to the shower wall parting my legs slightly bending me over grabbing my hips tightly while steady my hands on the wall, with one thrust he pounds straight in hard and deep making me scream with the pleasure overcoming me, he starts pounding hard and fast, I hear my cheeks slapping against his body, my orgasm already building at this man&#39;s cock, I feel myself trying to hold on, ***&#34;Cum for me Amelia, don&#39;t hold back&#34;*** the sound of his voice only adding to my pleasure making me pant and moan louder and, before I could even think to hold off with one final thrust I feel myself tighten and contract around his cock releasing my juices with it, letting out a scream of pleasure, I felt amazing, he felt amazing, ***&#34;Good girl I love it when you cant contain yourself makes me want to do it all over again but for now we can&#39;t we always have later to make up for it&#34;*** my body tembling at his words almost inviting him for more, I wanted more, I needed more, I needed Lucas.</p>
