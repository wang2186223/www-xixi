                <p>All is set in motion, she&#39;s going frantic, it&#39;s clearly working it won&#39;t be long until he can&#39;t hold her back. Jordan needs to finish up what he&#39;s doing soon to get out of the way. I don&#39;t think I could ever forgive myself if anything happened to him because of me besides I don&#39;t want to think about how Amelia would feel, she doesn&#39;t have many people to call family as it is losing Jordan would be like losing another family member. I could never do that to her. Letting my thoughts run away with me, I&#39;m losing focus thoughts of Amelia creeping in, I feel like it&#39;s painful to think of her right now I need to try and disconnect from this I have to focus with the job at hand, coming close to sunrise, we don&#39;t have long for this to work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I notice from the distance she escapes his clutches and is now heading to our lure. I sprint to the area and push Jordan away there&#39;s no time to explain before she starts to divulge into the body. I hear Jordan in the distance ***&#34;I hadn&#39;t finished your going to have to do this the hard way, I thought I would have enough time, I&#39;m sorry&#34;*** As his voice begins getting weaker, I link medics to collect him and take him back to medical aid. **No more magic Jordan needs to rest now he&#39;s done more than enough here.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mateo to my left, Nathan right. Let&#39;s kill this succulent whore. As we get into arrowhead formation as a trio. She quickly lifts her head from her meal, realising it was all a lure. ***&#34;oh look how sweet you gave me a meal to build my strength up, that was a big mistake&#34;*** bringing out her fangs and glowing ruby red eyes piercing through us. ***&#34;Why are you involved&#34; &#34;I will support my true mate with every inch of my soul&#34;*** **We need to watch her venom could kill us, Jordan said there&#39;s only few ways in which a wolf would be able to tolerate it, so keep your guard. Got it.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Bad choice&#34;*** Mateo spits while he leaps to take strike, she&#39;s too quick, we need to think methodically, ***&#34;Surely you could never harm a woman&#34; &#34;When she&#39;s a threat to me and my pack I&#39;d gladly rip her head off.&#34;*** Damon ready to pounce but I push him back I don&#39;t want to risk shifting. Me and the boys circle her trying to wait for the right time to strike. She&#39;s trying to keep an eye on our every move but with the sound from the background fighting and she&#39;s losing her patience. I strike at the core leaving her slightly shaken, Mateo following up with a leg strike which knocks her off her feet but in a flash she&#39;s up again looking unfazed by the attack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m met with a long stare, while she slides a dagger from her shabby boots. I feel the intensity of her stare more and more as she brings a slight grin to her face. **Damon time to play. About time.** I know I&#39;m not going to be able to keep up as well as Damon he&#39;s been working so hard on the agility and speed he&#39;s far better equipped then me. I launch myself into mid air to shift, I can see by the look on her face she&#39;s never been met by such a large wolf slighty nervous and rightly so we above average of the normal Alpha and we work hard for it. Damon darts around, like it&#39;s a game trying to get her off guard and final he makes a strike to her leg leaving her damaged and open to attack, Mateo goes in for a strike but the blade seems to catch his shoulder, Nathan manages to rip off a leg and throw it aside. The screeching piercing our ears almost feels like it&#39;s going to explode my drums. Catching Damon off guard she manages for slice across our chest, leaving a large gash with blood pouring, the pain radiating through us, Damon lets a loud howl out, the anger inside raging takes over the pain Damon takes his strike and rips her head off in one grip of his jaw, we collapse to the floor  while the blood pours over the ground and drips from our jaw we feel something warming up inside, I must be dying I see stars everything around me turns white.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait, I&#39;m burning now almost like I&#39;m on fire, the fire inside me igniting me, I feel my energy levels rising and everything around me begins to return to normal. Mateo and Nathan still burning the remains of the scum that did this. Jordan running over, ***&#34;thank goddess your okay, I thought you were a goner when you fell to the floor but I noticed you healing so darted over.&#34; &#34;Yeh safe to say this healing is a little more intense than I&#39;m used too but thank you&#34; &#34;Amelia would never forgive me if I didn&#39;t bring you home alive and probably want to kill me&#34; &#34;She&#39;s gone now only one more hurdle but seems that problem seems to have disappeared into the cottage.&#34; &#34;Okay let&#39;s take a break regather, work out a plan and gain some strength I&#39;m sure the medics will have something&#34; &#34;Sounds solid&#34; &#34;You two finished taking pleasure in burning we need to regroup and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>gain some energy, meet in the medic tent&#34; &#34;you got it bro just finishing up&#34;***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We sit down to a refreshing water with some added vitamin and energy booster. I try to think over everything, we have no layout of the inside, we have no idea if this thing has been altered into underground facilities. We are going in blind but with only four of us seen as Trent us busy with the warriors split in two pairs is our only option. ***&#34;So guys been doing some thinking split into pairs one takes the back and one takes the front one upstairs one downstairs?&#34; &#34;sounds good, me and Nathan will take the back, you and Jordan take the front, you take down and we take up?&#34; &#34;either way I&#39;m not bothered we need to unmask one in each pair needs to unmask so we can follow scent to find the other&#34; &#34;decide amongst yourselves who is going to unmask, I&#39;ll unmask just cause I don&#39;t want him getting the fae scent from Jordan&#34; &#34;Good point&#34; &#34;all sorted then is everyone rough and ready?&#34; &#34;aye&#34;*** everyone exclaimed in unison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we get closer to the cottage I keep getting pains perhaps I haven&#39;t healed fully but there&#39;s no time for that. I just needed this over with. I pull down my masking now, he&#39;ll smell me coming but the boys will need to be able to track if needed so it&#39;s nessasary just places me in more danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Approaching the cottage it smells revolting, rubbish and what smells like feacal matter everywere. All doors are locked which I easily kick off the hinges, feeling my temper rising in like a lion in search for prey. I scan the hallway, nothing noticeable all doors flung wide open, living room and kitchen diner clear can&#39;t find anything obvious, I begin to search for any hidden door ways by kicking in bookshelves and kicking up rugs to find nothing, feeling myself loose control Mateo and Nathan link in **All clear here. Here too. did you notice anything out back? There&#39;s a small garden shed why? he&#39;s gotta be somewhere, I&#39;ll head there follow us down. Got it.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching the shed the stench just keeps getting stronger, my stomach bubbling and contents rising almost making me hurl everywhere. I kick the door in to find a stair case in the middle of the floor, ***&#34;ready?&#34;*** I whisper to Jordan following right behind. ***&#34;I got your back&#34;.*** Making our way down I notice it&#39;s like tunnels these must be the tunnels all the men were staying in, finding room and after room torn up beds, blankets and pillows everywhere blood stained rags, **Mateo and Nathan catch up you got to see this.**</p>
