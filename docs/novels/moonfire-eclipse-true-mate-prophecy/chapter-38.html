She looks so fragile and pale, she hasn&#39;t said a word since we got back. **I told you Lucas he wants mate, you should have let me tear him apart. No Damon, Amelia is scared enough now can you imagine what she would be like if you started tearing shreds into another wolf! you back down until I know we have to.** I hand Amelia her mug and slide next to her and wrap my free arm around her kissing her head. ***&#34;Your safe with me Amelia, I promise you, I will give my life for you to have yours, always&#34; &#34;thank you Lucas I was scared of you losing it and ending up hurt more than anything, but something about him is off I don&#39;t know what it is but I could smell something when he came near and it&#39;s not pleasant.&#34; &#34;Amelia he was masked beautiful you shouldn&#39;t have smelt anything from him&#34;*** looking at her puzzled ***&#34;Lucas I could smell something rotting it was sickening&#34;*** seeing the look on her face she&#39;s telling the truth.

                <p>**Mark are you busy I just was wondering if you could pop by? I think Amelia has discovered her ability but I&#39;m not sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ll be right there give me 5.** I head to put the kettle on one tea and 2 coffee&#39;s Amelia sitting there a little calmer than before. ***&#34;Amelia, Mark is on his way he wants to check on you if that&#39;s okay&#34;*** she nods but doesn&#39;t say a word, ***&#34;heres your tea beautiful&#34; &#34;thank you baby&#34;*** is all she managed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*knock*knock* ***&#34;Mark thank you for coming on short notice&#34; &#34;My pleasure&#34; &#34;coffee is on the coffee table for you&#34;*** he nods and heads over to sit on the couch. ***&#34;well Amelia how are you feeling you look a little shaken up&#34; &#34;the whole Jackson situation starting to unravel and we were confronted with him tonight&#34;*** I answered while Amelia sat there. ***&#34;I was informed of the situation but tonight seems to come abit of a surprise&#34; &#34;could say that, question is that Jackson was masking himself, I couldn&#39;t smell a thing but Amelia here smelt something rotting.&#34;*** Amelia continued to not say anything ***&#34;now that is interesting, Amelia has this happened before?&#34; &#34;not that I&#39;m aware of but I never really been around anyone masking themselves&#34;*** with a puzzled look on her face ***&#34;she has been around someone masked before, Haisley the night I first met you in the club she grabbed you and laughed at you, she was masked that night&#34; &#34;I thought the smell was the bins that&#39;s why I changed them and took them to the dumpster&#34; &#34;okay, can I just check your vitals and keep them monitored for a short period&#34;*** Amelia nods. **Can you ask mateo to mask himself and come over please.** Mark linked so Amelia wasnt aware. **Of course** Mark wanted to put it to the test to see her true reaction I&#39;m guessing. **Mateo can you please mask yourself and then come to my room, it&#39;s a test for Amelia so don&#39;t show you&#39;ve masked yourself. No worries bro be over now.** I just hope it doesn&#39;t upset her too much or even scare her just incase it was just the smell of Jackson. Mateo stumbles into the room, I couldn&#39;t smell his usual musky scent so he did as he was asked. Amelia&#39;s face pale again, she could smell people masking, her vitals reacting to her sense ***&#34;Amelia can you smell him&#34; &#34;not Mateo&#39;s normal musky scent but the rotting horrible smell Jackson gave off&#34; &#34;it&#39;s true Amelia you can smell people that are masking, you will know when someone is concealing themselves by that scent your body is making you aware of possible danger through scent&#34;*** Mark confirmed with her. ***&#34;That&#39;s remarkable Amelia&#34;*** Mateo giving her a high five and they both laugh. My girl found her ability how amazing is she, she knows when someone is masking thats crazy. ***&#34;I do have some news for you both while I&#39;m here&#34;*** Mark said excitedly ***&#34;Amelia, Lucas  you asked me to find a some information regarding Amelia&#39;s past now I&#39;ve gone through endless connections and I&#39;ve found no luck until now. There is a Fae who knows of your parents and would like to meet you Amelia, rest assured he has allowed Lucas to come along. It&#39;s around a 2 hour drive from here but he claims it will be worth the journey.&#34; &#34;We don&#39;t do dealings with Faes Mark they always want something in return&#34;*** Amelia listening in attentively ***&#34;This one does not it&#39;s quite the opposite it is fulfilling his end of a deal apparently and Amelia is in no danger. That is all I&#39;m aware of&#34; &#34;that&#39;s amazing thank you, can you make arrangements that we go Saturday please&#34;*** Amelia shot out of the blue, I see the cheesiest grin, okay I&#39;m not getting out of this one. I nod in approval. ***&#34;I&#39;ll make the call tomorrow and let you know details then, but right now get some rest and I&#39;ll catch you tomorrow.&#34; &#34;thank you&#34;*** I whisper as he exits. Mateo also saying his goodbyes and heading out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Lucas I need to go to bed I&#39;m with your mother for the day tomorrow&#34; &#34;of course but first you need to have a bath to relax, I&#39;ll run you one now&#34;*** I run my girl a lovely bath with petals, candles all round, soothing aromas, bubbles and some soft music in the background, just what my beautiful girl needed. I carry her bridal style to the bath offer her a towel and leave her to relax. ***&#34;thank you Lucas this is perfect.&#34; &#34;your most welcome, now go and relax I&#39;ll get your tea and a film ready in bed&#34; &#34;how did I get so lucky baby?&#34;*** she melts my heart she doesn&#39;t even see how perfect she really is, ***&#34;I&#39;m the lucky one my Luna&#34;***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia returns from her bath smelling heavenly as usual, tea waiting on her bedside table, and film on pause she heads to the wardrobe, I forgot about clothes. she came out in one of my tee&#39;s and a gorgeous pair of my the edge of her cup taking little sips of her tea, savouring every drop of flavour in her mouth, it&#39;s almost like watching her in slow motion. She doesn&#39;t take her eyes from the TV, while I can&#39;t keep my eyes off her beautiful face. Unable to shake my thoughts and lean in for a kiss, I start to deepen the kiss and bring her body closer pressing her into me, I let on hand caress her body while the other fisten into the back of her head. Amelia&#39;s arms wrapped themselves around my neck, make my way to her already wet lips, gently rubbing over her sweet spot, making her moan for me. As I slide two finger past her now swollen lips I feel her body jolt in reaction to my entrance, so warm and wet, sliding in and out gently as I pull her in to kiss the same time, leaving her panting for more. This time it wasn&#39;t about pounding her, it&#39;s about loving her and appreciating every inch of her. ***&#34;your beautiful you know that Amelia, I love you&#34;*** I continue to kiss and satisfy her every need and ache, her moaning and panting becoming more intense I slide her panties off, as well as my boxers and bring her to hover over my now hard member, I let her steady herself over me and let her take what she wanted from me slowly and passionately sliding herself over me, making me start to pant and throb I can feel myself building already as I feel her body pound into me, her hands pushing at my chest, I can feel the sweat on her as I caress her body admiring the view of panting and moaning for me, I can feel her orgasm building up too as she starts to tightening herself around me trying hold back ***&#34;Lucas let go with me, I love you baby&#34;*** I couldn&#39;t take anymore anyway I gipped her and brought her crashing into my lips as we both met out release sending us both into oblivion, ***&#34;I love you beautiful&#34;.  &#34;I love you too baby&#34;***</p>
