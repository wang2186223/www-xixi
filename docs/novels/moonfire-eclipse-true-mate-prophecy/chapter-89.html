                <p>After travelling a while we stop and take a short break drinking some water and allowing our wolves to hunt down some food. Damon was on top form and has developed alot since Tara has given him some tips we both have nearly doubled in size, our strength and speed has substantially increased too, but I&#39;m still having trouble with a foggy mind with everything, I just hope this is my drive not my weakness. I see Jordan heading over to me, ***&#34;Hey how you keeping you look a little cloudy&#34; &#34;A little I just hope it will be more of a drive than a weakness&#34; &#34;I&#39;m giving you this as protection and strength&#34;*** handing me his own medallion ***&#34;You know I can&#39;t take it&#34; &#34;You can and will, you must protect your mate and your daughter, I made it my life&#39;s mission to ensure their safety and I know they are in good hands, if I don&#39;t come back from this I know they will always be protected, plus I have a ring that does the same thing but think of this as a gift&#34;*** I feel my eyes welling up when Jordan wraps his arms around me, whispering ***&#34;you got all of this together to ensure the safety of your pack, your mate and your daughter your not about to lose it all now. So hold your head up and be the Alpha you were born to be&#34;*** patting me on the back while I pull myself together, Jordan has been more of a father to me recently than my father ever was. Then I have the thoughts of Nina and Rich how they have accepted me and this world, there&#39;s alot at stake here I can&#39;t fail, I will not fail. **Failure isn&#39;t an option here, never was, we got this.** Damon growling intensively. I start to shout to gather everyone up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Right so everyone clear on the plans&#34;*** everyone shouting ***&#34;aye&#34;*** in unison. ***&#34;So first battalion push forward and second battalion hold back will see you shortly&#34;*** on the finishing note the Red River pack and Cresent Moon pack battalion show up on cue. ***&#34;Right on time Jordan and Cole will fill you in on the rest of the plans my battalion is going to push forward and start this thing, we wish everyone luck and protection stay safe we will all catch up when this is over with, I personally want to thank each and everyone one of you for your support and I can&#39;t thank you enough, I will see you all shortly&#34; &#34;it&#39;s our pleasure and it&#39;s an honour to stand beside you, good luck out there&#34;*** I just nod and head to lead my men to battle. Adrenaline setting in. Let&#39;s do this. Damon excitedly bouncing around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we approach the treeline we see the cottage well lit up, tents and huts scattered around, aleast we got the right place I guess. My men waiting patiently for their signal, a few preparing molotov cocktails to burn the tents and huts, as much as I wanted this to have no women and children hurt it&#39;s not going to give an advantage here we need to just knock down the force as much as we can in the first blow, Jackson probably won&#39;t show until most his army are gone, leaving him with no distractions for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone stood ready I give my signal and the men charge forward throwing huts and tents into flames and before we know it we are met with force, it doesn&#39;t seem like a substantial amount as it stands my men are giving their all, I see limbs and blood drowning the grass beneath us. Although it seems as if they were prepared for this, they have done their training. I start running towards the scumbags before me shifting into my wolf mid air, tearing up man after man. **This feels amazing just the work out we need. Calm down boy, this is only the beginning.** Damon now in his element focusing on his surroundings, using all his techniques to his advantage while holding back some key things to avoid prediction. Damon ragging bodies with his jaw taking all the pleasure he can get out of this, we have lost very little men so far things looking promising.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After waves of wolves one massive wave came from what I believe to be underground tunnels, these men slightly stronger and faster but no match for the training and work my wolves put in. I glance around catching Jackson standing on the porch smirking joined by a female, making Damon lose his control. **Wait! now isn&#39;t the time. We need to find out about that female something smells off! but we must wait for back up.** Letting out a growl I manage to reel Damon in and right on cue our second battalion arrive giving everyone a fresh outlook and burst of energy these men are fighting with everything they have. I see Jordan shift and glance over at me it&#39;s show time for him I guess, some the wolves backed up and ran off beyond the treeline in fear. I look over at Jackson who&#39;s smirk has disappeared while Damon let out an almighty howl, which of sent our wolves to fight harder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I head back to the treeline to take a full view of the field it&#39;s full of bloodshed, some of my own wolves but mainly Jacksons wolves, just behind me, I see they finished setting up the medical tent, and I linked 20 men to hold back here to protect the medics, I head back to the field and start tearing up the ground, chomping limbs with my jaw as I head in. I notice a few of my men injured and send them back to the medics, Mateo and Nathan holding up well both working together as a team. It&#39;s a proud moment for us all. I notice Trent in some trouble with 6 wolves surrounding I head in giving my all. **I got your back** giving trent a nod. Cole looks beat up real bad, I know their warriors and him aren&#39;t usually in conflict but didn&#39;t expect it this bad, I carried Cole on my back to the medic tent, shifted back and explained he&#39;s an Alpha and needed urgent attention. I clenched Coles hand ***&#34;you did good, get yourself patched up and head back&#34; &#34;Finish that asshole&#34;*** is all he could get our before passing out, get him sorted and back to the packhouse urgently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jackson&#39;s army now growing in numbers and strength, it&#39;s not far from the third battalion arriving which will set everything off again. Surely he hasn&#39;t got much more men, I find myself sitting in the middle of the field feeling like I&#39;m absorbing more and more energy, feeling my wounds disappearing, I begin to smell wolfsbain luckily it doesn&#39;t affect me, but it will the rest of our wolves. **Watch yourselves guys wolfsbain involved. Aye aye got it Alpha.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the third battalion arrive another load of Jacksons army appear but it&#39;s a much smaller amount I also sense not all of them are wolves but something else but theres so many different smells my nostrils can&#39;t filter it. We must be getting to the last of them. Jordan seems to have shaken up the ground a little, I can see cracked grounds amongst the blood and limbs, flames soaring, tunnels now all up in flames any shelters have been destroyed it&#39;s only the cottage that we haven&#39;t had access to. **I love you baby, end this once and for all, I&#39;m sending you energy and healing as we speak, I can&#39;t live without you either. Thank you beautiful, things going to plan at present I love you.** Hearing Amelia&#39;s voice only made things real again and before I could even think of protecting myself I find myself losing consciousness on the ground. It can&#39;t be over. All I see is darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Hello my dear you let yourself get distracted not that I blame you for that, Amelia&#39;s voice is so mesmerising and infectious, no worries though this isn&#39;t over yet and you haven&#39;t been that badly hurt, I just brought you into this. Thanks Ma you do realise this is important. Everyone has things under control for the moment, I can&#39;t be more proud of the man you&#39;re becoming a better Alpha than your father will ever be. You need a distraction, I feel uneasy about that woman with Jackson, seems like trouble waiting to happen. I know I just don&#39;t know what distraction I need. Don&#39;t worry son it will come, you&#39;ve had enough time now to fully heal and replenish your energy now you need to wake up don&#39;t forget don&#39;t miss the sign and you&#39;ll know what to do. Thanks Ma. Love you always my little wolf.**</p>
