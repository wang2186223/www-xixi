                <p>We finally filed the motion to rid my father of his title with Marks help of a psychological assessment included along with both our letters which would prove Ma knew it would come to this. I hope this works, with me being next in line it has been suggested I take the role with my Luna by my side. The only good thing nothing would be concluded until after Mateo and Libby&#39;s mating ceremony I didn&#39;t need anything ruining it for them. With both of them needing to find new outfits I allowed Amelia to go with Libby and Nikki to look for outfits for the ceremony, while I helped Mateo plus I needed to sort out a girls night for them and an evening for the lads along with Amelia&#39;s help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We head to catch a bite to eat, having found our suits, hunger started creeping in after Mr Fussy couldn&#39;t decide which looked better. Amelia already linked me missing me, in all honesty my body&#39;s aching to have her near now. Food came out and started tucking in. The boys talking about what we could do before Sunday Mateo wanted to go out, Nathan happy with whatever, and I would rather be with my wife but hey can&#39;t have it all. I&#39;ll come up with something with Amelia later on I&#39;m sure she has plenty of ideas. I get distracted by a familiar scent Jackson, Damon on high alert. He just scoots in next to me ***&#34;This is cozy now isn&#39;t it, how&#39;s everyone?&#34;*** Jackson trying to be a cocky dick. ***&#34;Your not welcome here leave now&#34;*** Mateo scowls. ***&#34;Don&#39;t be so hasty now I&#39;m only having a chat with my brothers, strange to see you away from your extraordinary Luna Luc, too many weirdos out there could be dangerous&#34;*** letting out a laugh. Unable to hold myself back any longer I grip him pinning him to the wall letting Damon surface ***&#34;You better leave now little boy, before you get torn to shreds here. You will never get close enough to her to know exactly how extraordinary she really is&#34; &#34;oh but Lucas I already did&#34;*** he spits trying to push me. The woman comes from behind the counter you two got a problem take it else where. ***&#34;Don&#39;t worry I&#39;m just leaving&#34;*** releasing Jackson flinging him across the room and giving her money for our bill with a sincere apology for my actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I should have never let him get to me, I should have played along, kicking myself for reacting it&#39;s exactly what he wanted from me. I soon wiped the smug look off his face when he felt me pick him off the floor with my one hand. Realising I had in fact got stronger far stronger than before, between the training, mating and I have Amelia&#39;s gift, he hasn&#39;t got a clue what he&#39;d be in for coming to challenge me. **Are you okay baby? all of a sudden I feel angry, my blood boiling. Everything is fine now beautiful bumped into Jackson that&#39;s all. Aslong as your okay that&#39;s the main thing. He had a warning from Damon so that could be why you feel it so intense everything is fine. I&#39;ll see you at home baby.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Amelia goes through the final things that needed to be organised for Sunday, I continued to the shower. Amelia seemed to have been back a while everything tidied up and cleaned down, fresh sheets. After my shower I find Amelia sat talking to Nova, I easedrop on them, Nova wants to do gymnastics and wondered if Amelia would teach her.***&#34;Of course she will, I think Amelia might be starting up a class soon&#34;*** I butt in. Amelia stares at me confused, ***&#34;Yes Amelia your talented enough and self taught so why wouldn&#39;t you be able to teach someone else.&#34;*** Nova gets overexcited and jumps over us. Amelia even gets a little excited but doesn&#39;t show it, I just feel every nerve of her jumping with excitement. ***&#34;Now my sweet girl I need to have Amelia to discuss some surprises for people is that okay&#34; &#34;okay just let me know when classes are, I&#39;ll be there I promise I&#39;ll train harder than anyone.&#34;*** that I can believe once that girls set on something there&#39;s no changing her mind, abit of a young Amelia really, I giggle to myself., thinking to myself while Nova skips along out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;So whats happening for these two?&#34;, &#34;you guys go karting or something and I&#39;ll sort out having a cocktail making class in the bunker and some refreshments and that kind of thing, then all of us spend the night together in the bunker for a party?&#34; &#34;sounds good to me beautiful atleast I&#39;ll be able to have my wife in the evening, dancing at my side.&#34;*** Amelia blushing at my words I know how much she loves to dance but I can&#39;t always control my hands wandering her body, it&#39;s pure perfection it&#39;s like no body else is in the room just me, her and the music.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were all set to go while the girls still sleeping we just headed out, they weren&#39;t leaving until 1ish. I decided instead of go karting I&#39;d sort us out with some paintballing we haven&#39;t been to the new one just the other side of the next town so was worth a shout. There was actually quite a few of us going in, we needed 3 jeeps so should be a good day, even rich was joining us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the 3rd game well underway, Mateo was having an amazing time even with the boys were giving him a hard time. Rich actually proved to be the best marksman I wonder if he had training of some kind, something he will have to give me a little insight to. We had to meet the girls at 7 at the bunker so I arranged a bite to eat when we finish. The klaxon went meaning our session was over it was 3 now so by the time we shower and change then head for food should be around half 4 by the time we are all ready so we would some time for a few before heading to the girls. I can&#39;t wait to see my sweet Amelia with everything going on and everything that&#39;s happened I hate leaving her side, I&#39;m always on edge, even with security detail on her at all times, look what happened last time and that&#39;s with a whole loads of security. I sigh to myself **Mate is okay Lucas she&#39;s well looked after with everyone there. I know just still puts me on edge.** Damon very relaxed with her being away from me, he knows she would have herself under more control and always has her guard up now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chatting amongst the lads through dinner, talking about training, the pack, mates and notice Nathan again going quiet, it&#39;s really starting to get to him now, hopefully he will find her soon. The girl who gets him will be one very lucky girl, Nathan wears his heart on his sleeve what you see is what you get, he is pure gold one in a million that one, bend over backwards for anyone. ***&#34;Ow guys I think we should start heading for the bunker soon or were going to be late and let&#39;s just say I get one unhappy Luna when I&#39;m late&#34;*** the boys just laugh, and show me their thumbs pushing into their palms, under the thumb indeed I am. My gorgeous girl will have whatever she wants whenever she wants and of course I&#39;ll bend over backwards to keep my luna happy, without her I&#39;m nothing I might aswell be rotting in a ditch somewhere, she completes me and that&#39;s all I could ever ask of her. The boys finish up their deserts some of them seemed to be wearing it but that doesn&#39;t shock me the way some of these eat giggling to my own thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night going smoothly Amelia in her element she&#39;s barely had a drink but is in full dance and party mode, the one thing I loved about her. Her confidence seems to shine since findng me, she&#39;s actually important to someone and I think that has a lot to do with it, I allow her to be herself, I give her the time to relieve her stress, she gets to keep at her hobbies whenever she likes. ***&#34;Amelia you look Amazing tonight&#34; &#34;thank you Alpha you look like a God yourself&#34;*** sending me a wink, she wants to be a tease now. My gorgeous spicy Amelia it is, we both dance away whispering and giggling over both our activities we did today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile I notice Nikki from the corner of my eye stumbling, it&#39;s extremely unusual for a wolf to get that drunk with our extremely fast metabolism and ability to heal to barely touches us. ***&#34;Amelia how much has Nikki had to drink?&#34; &#34;I&#39;m not sure I know she was knocking them back like water earlier but I thought she calmed down&#34; &#34;do you know if there&#39;s anything playing on her mind. We are going to have to get her home and bed now, I&#39;ve never seen her like this&#34;*** Amelia agreed and explained there was nothing she was aware of but she would speak to her tomorrow for tonight let&#39;s get her back for some rest. We give everyone our apologies and left them to it for the night while we take Nikki back even if she was still trying to refuse.</p>
