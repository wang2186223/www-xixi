                <p>I lay in bed tossing and turning unable to sleep, not only have I got a battle with Da on my hands but also this shit with Jackson now I let out a sigh, am I ever gonna catch a break around here. The only thing keeping my sanity right now is my little mate waiting for me. Tomorrow is the day I get to reveal all to her give myself to her completely, Everything on her terms of course how fast or slow she wanted to take things I wasn&#39;t sure how quickly desert wolves moved but I knew one thing I&#39;d do anything for her. Sweet thoughts invading my mind how her sweet arousal must taste, how her body would fit perfectly on mine, the electricity between us giving my every nerve ending the pleasure it desperately needed. I feel my member growing hard per at my own thoughts, I wanted her begging and screaming for me, I wanted her exploding her juices around me, I wanted every inch of her, she is mine and I&#39;m never going to give up on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel the sun beaming between the slightly open cracks in my curtains, today&#39;s the day, I am full of energy today even if I didn&#39;t get much sleeping last night, I can&#39;t help but be over joyed, I rush around breakfast, training, finished up all my other pack duties, I even had time to let Damon out for a run. I tried to keep busy all day just to keep my mind settled, I&#39;m going to see my mate tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Taxi be outside at 8 and Lucas good luck, not that I think you&#39;ll need it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I potter around trying to clean my room up before heading into the shower, my tension washing away with it, exhaustion washing over me as I think of her once more, the goddess she is. I finish washing myself off and rinse out my hair. Tonight needs to go perfectly or I&#39;m gonna lose my last inch of sanity. I put some serum in and blow dry my hair so that my blonde locks sit perfectly, leaving my shadow stubble just the way I like it. I head to the wardrobe and place my suit carefully not to mark, crease or make any kind of pulls I needed it perfect. &#34;Great choice of mask bro perfect match for my suit, cheers let me know how much I owe you for it. don&#39;t mention it I knew you&#39;d love it, consider it a gift.&#34; I look at myself over I look good, for a change I feel myself in a suit. I head into my living room where I find my mother sitting waiting for me. &#34;oh Lucas you look perfect&#34; she heads over trying to fuss over me straightening up a few things she finds out of place. &#34;Ma it&#39;s a party&#34; &#34;this isn&#39;t just any party for you Lucas don&#39;t play dull with me, it&#39;s your special night&#34; I cock my head aside, does she know or am I just over thinking this, &#34;Lucas you&#39;ve had a high amount of energy over the last couple of days, I find your in thought alot, your bigger and probably stronger and faster and the tip of the iceberg for me is your aura is changing which can only mean one thing my dear, she&#39;s going to be one lucky girl&#34; &#34;does Da know?&#34; &#34;no your secret is safe with me but I do suggest you tell him soon or it will hurt him that you&#39;re keeping something from him, you&#39;ll just have to give him some time to adjust and I&#39;ll work on him from my end but do want the details when you get a chance now run along or the boys be cursing me for making you late&#34; &#34;I love you Ma&#34; &#34;I love you too little wolf&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d spent most my evening just keeping my distance from her, I could tell it was her from the moment I spotted her, no one in the world has golden eyes as bright as hers, she looked more phenomenal than she did before, she is a gift from the goddess herself, her dress complimented her in every way, how did I get so deserving of the beauty before me. I notice she&#39;s sat at the bar alone now the female and male that were with her have disappeared, I notice a male talking to her over the bar perhaps he&#39;s a coworker, I walk towards her I get a full blast of her scent invading my senses, chamomile and lavender, calming yet sensual she&#39;s gonna be the death of me I&#39;m sure of it, here goes nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey excuse me can I get a Morgan&#39;s and coke please&#34; I could see her body tense up at my voice she remembered me, but was that a good thing, she didn&#39;t even need to turn around to know it&#39;s me, I can see some of her hairs standing on end, when she finally turns to look at me, I can&#39;t help but stare into those golden eyes, they are so full of love and passion, almost like an Amber flame igniting, can almost feel her body trembling she knew and she felt it, Damon over the moon with us finally meeting her as our mate. I have to control myself,  &#34;What would the beautiful girl next to me like?&#34; cocking my head aside playfully. I can smell her arousal plain, her body wants me, she wants me &#34;I... I... I&#39;ll take a pink gin please.&#34; I giggle at her trying to string words out of her mouth, I did get her off guard, the man behind the bar also laughing at her as if he&#39;d never seen her like this. &#34;I feel it too just trying not to make a show here, my little wolf.&#34; I whispered in her ear making my body ache for her with her body in such close proximity the sent of her arousal really not helping matters as member is growing in my pants. &#34;you smell heavenly little wolf&#34; letting out a growl of approval sending her into a trembling mess infront of me, I place my hand on her leg hoping to calm her a little, in which it was until the girl from earlier barged between us &#34;Amelia, me and Eric gonna head off I&#39;ll catch you tomorrow&#34; &#34;okay be safe I&#39;ll see you at 12,&#34; still trying to keep content &#34;So my little wolf has a name, Amelia, It&#39;s perfect, it&#39;s angelic&#34; my heart pounding in my chest &#34;yours?&#34; she asked &#34;my apologies I am Lucas&#34;. &#34;Well it&#39;s lovely to meet you Lucas&#34; &#34; you too My Amelia you too&#34; and how lovely it was, I was finally with her and she hadn&#39;t shoved me away nor was she scared these are good signs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We spend a while chatting and having a drink, not much was said on her behalf it&#39;s as if she&#39;s hiding something. Maybe she just isn&#39;t ready I need to be patient with her, I haven&#39;t been as forth coming either not letting her know I&#39;m a future alpha I didn&#39;t want to ruin this at any cost. Best thing I found out is the man behind the bar and his wife did this for her, it&#39;s her birthday, I&#39;d have to make up for it tomorrow &#34;So what&#39;s happening at 12 tomorrow, I was hoping you&#39;d agree to a date seen as this isn&#39;t the best way to do so&#34; &#34;I have to clean this place, but I should be clear after that so say around 4&#34; &#34;that would be perfect, please don&#39;t eat I&#39;ll have food organised&#34; &#34;what do you have planned then Lucas?&#34; &#34;you&#39;ll see little wolf, can&#39;t ruin the surprise now can I&#34;</p>

Lots to do today in preparation for our date it had to be perfect. I skip going down for breakfast and just settle for wheat bricks I had in the cupboard, &#34;Guys I&#39;m gonna need some help today. Meet me at the tree line by pack grounds at 11. Does this have something to do with your date? if not then no I&#39;m chillin. of course it does why else would I ask you to do anything on a Saturday.
