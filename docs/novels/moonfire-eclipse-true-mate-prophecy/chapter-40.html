                <p>Both Lucas and I dressed, we head down to the packhouse foyer to wait for Mateo and Nathan. ***&#34;Amelia you look beautiful, but a little nervous, are you okay with this? if not I can cancel&#34; &#34;yeh totally fine with it I just haven&#39;t met a fae before and he actually wants to meet me and knew my parents it&#39;s becoming real&#34; &#34;It&#39;s okay I&#39;ve got you no matter what nothing will happen to you&#34; &#34; I know it won&#39;t baby&#34;. &#34;It&#39;s about time you two showed up lets go it&#39;s a 2 hour drive atleast and it&#39;s already 11.15.&#34;*** I said making a point probably my nerves most of all ***&#34;sorry rushed after training&#34; &#34;Amelia doesn&#39;t like being late apparently &#34;*** Luc shrugged his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;We&#39;re about 20 minutes away now, but it&#39;s all single lanes typical of fae, to have a place in the middle of nowhere.&#34;*** Lucas pointed out, as we edged further into the countryside we come into a small village, but human village. ***&#34;They hide amongst humans from time to time or if a singular fae alone will reside in a human village and mind their business quite strange if you ask me but each to their own&#34;*** I look at Lucas who seemed unfazed by the events that could evolve today. As we arrive at a spiritual shop, the window display was magnificent and enchanting. We parked in the space Dr Preston informed us to use. ***&#34;Amelia are you ready for this?&#34;*** Lucas asked gently placing his hand on my thigh. ***&#34; If not I can always cancel&#34; &#34;Of course she&#39;s ready look at the girl, she&#39;s glowing&#34;*** I thank Nathan for answering for me. ***&#34;I&#39;m curious now let&#39;s go, I&#39;m not getting answers sitting here&#34; &#34;Lets go get your answers then beautiful&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we walk through the entrance I look in complete amazment, it&#39;s beautiful, crystals, herbs, gorgeous scents travelling through the air, if I though the display was amazing this is something else like a whole other world inside. ***&#34;Beautiful isn&#39;t it, Amelia, Lucas, Mateo and Nathan I take it&#34;*** I hear a voice coming from the further end of the room. As I walk toward the voice still unable to see anyone, ***&#34;Hello, yes we are here to meet Jordan&#34; &#34;of course you are&#34;*** I hear a bang from behind the counter, making me feel a little on edge ***&#34;sorry I was just putting some things by didn&#39;t mean to startle you&#34;*** still not putting a face to this voice although they can&#39;t of seen us either. A man emerges from behind the counter his skin glows, he&#39;s gorgeous but not really of athletic structure. ***&#34;Amelia, you have turned into a beautiful  young woman, there are hot drinks and biscuits waiting in the back for us&#34;*** ushering us through. ***&#34;sorry I haven&#39;t even introduced myself, I am Jordan nice to meet you all, no need to introduce yourselves though I&#39;m already aware of you all&#34; &#34;Can I ask how did you know there would be four of us it was only supposed to be myself and Amelia&#34; &#34;that&#39;s one of my tricks, I have immense senses I&#39;ve probably been aware of you for the last hour and kinda of see certain things of future&#34; &#34;that&#39;s amazing&#34; &#34;it is complicated but I see certain things but they can change based on choice&#34;*** Mateo is so intrigued now I have a feeling he would have this guy talking all day so I bit the bullet ***&#34;you were more than happy to see me, and said you knew of my parents and had some insight for me&#34;*** a little nervous for my answers now.***&#34;Firstly how has your life been?&#34; &#34;Well abandoned by my parents making me orphaned, a pack that hated me and seen me as a burden then cast me out rogue for something I had no idea I did, to finding Lucas, the only good thing about my life&#34;*** showing my frustration of my life ***&#34;must have been difficult growing up for you, I appreciate that very much, you are aware you are a desert wolf and know that your goddess is of course the sun goddess, you may be smaller but you are not to be underestimated my dear&#34;*** Jordan muttered giving off a smirk ***&#34;have you had any abilities come through, just one I&#39;m able to smell someone who is trying to mask themselves.&#34;*** feeling proud of ability ***&#34;that&#39;s brilliant, is there anything you know about your kind?&#34;*** he questioned, I sat trying to think what we actually knew  ***&#34;basically what you just confirmed, that we are the balance to a werewolf and we are able to do everything as they do but they don&#39;t get abilities like us, it&#39;s like a yin to a yang also that there&#39;s some prophecy.&#34;*** Lucas gripping me tighter with my words  ***&#34;that&#39;s correct and that&#39;s about it really&#34;*** oh this is going to be great help frowning ***&#34;so let&#39;s give you some information on what you really came here for then shall we, so back to your parents, they came to me for help, your race is well basically extinct except you and 3 or 4 others that I&#39;m aware of.&#34;*** We all listen intensively. ***&#34;They were desperate. I made a deal with them that hit me, I mean really tugged on my heart steings.&#34;*** seeing the sadness and hearing his sheer despare. ***&#34;I promised to ensure you are to be protected at all times and would provide you with whatever you needed when required&#34;*** he explains as if it was all still raw for him ***&#34;your parents gave their life in order to save yours, little Amelia, you are the prophecy&#34;*** Lucas&#39;s eyes widen, the boys in shock and me well I disn&#39;t know how to feel everything was alot to take in already ***&#34;you took my parents life&#34;,&#34;I didn&#39;t no, I took their powers which led to their death, still breaks my heart now&#34;*** I see tears filling his eyes, he&#39;s actually telling the truth. ***&#34;All I wanted was to help but in order for me to help someone I must receive to make an agreement, there is a note here they left for you when you were to come looking for me&#34;*** I look at the envelope, old, dusty and slightly discoloured, this contains all the answers I&#39;ve been looking for and he&#39;s given me more than I thought id ever get close to getting. ***&#34;So what does that mean for me?&#34; &#34;I am aware you are in danger, I&#39;ve seen it. Lucas, Mateo and Nathan you must protect her at all costs she is the key to keeping the sun and moon in balance&#34;*** they all nod in agreement without a word ***&#34;I&#39;ll guard her with my life&#34; &#34;I am well aware Lucas you will face some difficult times too and Amelia will be your answer to that too, you won&#39;t be aware of that until the time is right.&#34;*** Jordan looks between the two of us. ***&#34;She&#39;s my answer to everything and always will be, my light in the dark, the beat to my heart, the air I breath&#34;*** his voice full of admiration ***&#34;Hold on to it, it&#39;s a special thing love&#34;*** my heart throbbing listening to Lucas&#39;s words, I loved him more than life itself. ***&#34;I have a few gifts for you, one a necklace for protection. A ring that will energise you when your depleated you will need energy to use your abilities, and thirdly this vial, in which you need to drink&#34;.***  Lucas looking fearful and protective all at the same time ***&#34;no drinking anything Amelia you dont know now what this is or whether you can trust this man&#34;*** Lucas spoke sternly. ***&#34;you don&#39;t need to drink it right now Amelia but I believe you will in order to become who you are destined to be it contains your essense which will complete that missing piece of you, the good news is that Lucas hasn&#39;t marked you yet, which I would advise after drinking the vial, it will have benefits for both of you, I can put my life on that, Amelia your parents trusted me with your life, I&#39;m sorry for your growing up but it&#39;s made you the person you are, the pack I left you with was the only pack that would take you coming from a rogue, all I ever wanted was the best for you and still do, if there is anything I can help you with I am here and no there&#39;s no deals concerning you, your parents paid theirs and yours in order protect you.&#34;*** Jordan almost crying now I believed every word he said and I felt in no danger around him perhaps there&#39;s more of an explanation hidden in this note but I&#39;ll open that at home on my own just need my own space to process everything and figure this out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Amelia time is running out now, you and the boys must leave, get back to your pack, All of you need to be strong for eachother it&#39;s the only way of your survival, I wish you all the very best and please don&#39;t hesitate to ask if you need my help&#34; &#34;Thank you, you have given me more than I asked for, I am extremely grateful, I hope to see you again&#34; &#34;No doubt you will little one, now hurry you must leave and please wait until she drinks the vial before marking her, it will help both of you. I will give my life to you if anything goes wrong that&#39;s an oath&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We drive off hastily, Lucas did as he was told and hurried out of there. ***&#34;Why did we need to rush out of there?&#34;*** I questioned slightly confused. ***&#34;not sure but I&#39;m not waiting to find out either.&#34; &#34;Are you feeling okay Amelia?, you seem distracted&#34; &#34;just alot to take in thank you Nathan&#34;*** Lucas leans his arm over to place his hand on my thigh, trying to comfort me with all the information trying to sink in. My parents didn&#39;t leave me because they hated me they did it to protect me as the prophecy, as the prophecy I would have probably been living a guarded life one building and secluded from others to ensure my safety and they didn&#39;t want that for me. He didn&#39;t give me much on the prophecy but he said enough to know I have to survive for my race and create a new one. There aren&#39;t many left of my race so I need to create a new one to equalise the balance of the sun and moon. Me and Lucas are the last hope for my kind. I&#39;m sure not giving up on them.</p>
