                <p>As I pace back and forth in my living room waiting for Mateo and Nathan to get here to come up with something. I knew as soon as the words started to come out, he knows and he&#39;s in the know from someone but who and how? Nobody really knows anything, I can&#39;t trust anyone around here, although he didn&#39;t threaten her, I know it&#39;s a threat from the information I already know, does he know I know? So many things going through my head my blood boiling, I start to feel less control by the minute, &#34;Lucas I don&#39;t understand, you&#39;ve rushed me in here, your angry but I don&#39;t know why? your pacing back and forth isn&#39;t going to help anything&#34; &#34;Amelia please, your in danger and I don&#39;t know how to play this, I&#39;d quite happily rip his head off now but that isn&#39;t going to look good for a future alpha to rip off his present future Gammas head now is it and as far as most this pack knows it would be over a pathetic argument at the club just go to bed and I&#39;ll let you know everything in the morning&#34; I needed her safe and she&#39;s worried, I can tell she&#39;s also extremely confused. &#34;Lucas I am your mate if I am in danger so are you! now you either let me stay here and know what the hell is going on here or you clearly underestimate me as your mate, I&#39;m not as weak as you think&#34; She yelled firmly, luckily these walls are soundproof but she&#39;d taken me back by her own rage but at me, &#34;Amelia I just can&#39;t have anything happen to you please do as your told and go to bed&#34; she storms out slamming the bedroom door as she exits, I&#39;m gonna have to make it up to her right now she needs rest. I need her to co operate, I can&#39;t think with her questioning me, acting all authorative, not gonna lie it&#39;s kind of a turn on if I say so myself. It&#39;s different to the sweet, submissive little Amelia, either way I loved her but I&#39;d love to see her domination in the bedroom it sounds exciting. **Lucas your trailing your thoughts get to the matter at hand. I don&#39;t think you should have been so harsh on her though I think you really hurt mate, she&#39;s always been treated as weak and incapable and you just reinforced that yourself. I&#39;m not helping you out on that front you can grovel for all I care if you cost me my mate because of your insecurities you will pay.** Damon was right and I knew it I just don&#39;t know how else to protect her at the moment I need to think, I need a plan, I need him gone!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mateo and Nathan come in to the room. &#34;you okay bro what&#39;s up?&#34; &#34;He knows she&#39;s here, he knows it&#39;s Amelia she needs to stay protected we need to do something about this&#34; I feel my anger burning up again &#34;you need to calm down where is Amelia now?&#34;  &#34;I&#39;ve sent her to bed she needs to rest and I need to keep her safe&#34; &#34;fuck Lucas you can&#39;t just throw her in the bedroom, she has every right to know what the hell is going on here and it concerns her what do think your doing shutting her out&#34; &#34;I just don&#39;t know what to do right now&#34; &#34;what actually happened?&#34; &#34;he stopped her on the stairs on her way to meet Nathan and said something about her being the next Luna and congratulated us&#34; &#34;so didn&#39;t make any direct threats?&#34; &#34;he touched her god damn it and he knew she would tell me meaning it&#39;s to get to me and she&#39;s a pawn in this game&#34; &#34;Lucas you realise you need to inform your father and at the moment he has no reason to make him rogue so this leaves us in a sticky situation&#34; Nathan informed me of what I already knew but coming from him aswell just made me feel worse almost defeated before anything really began, I let out a large sigh &#34;I know&#34;. &#34;Lucas I&#39;m going to check on your mate seen as your a dick and probably feels like your punishing her for something she didn&#39;t do, she&#39;s my Luna too you know&#34;  Mateo muttered angrily and disappeared into my bedroom. &#34;I&#39;m only trying to keep her safe Nathan I just don&#39;t know how I can even think of letting her out of my room at this point I&#39;m scared.&#34;&#34;I get it but you can&#39;t keep her locked up and certainly can&#39;t treat her like that locking her away from it is only going to give her a reason to leave, your pushing her away&#34; I sigh hard at his words I even feel my eyes starting to fill at my own actions could cost me my beautiful Amelia &#34;it&#39;s okay but you will need to control yourself right now we need to meet your father and mother in the office and explain what we know. I think you should tell Amelia to come with us too so everyone knows where we&#39;re at&#34; I nod in dispare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Da , Ma can we meet in the office there&#39;s something we need to discuss. Give us half an hour and we&#39;ll be there.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mateo and Amelia emerge for the bedroom, her eyes puffy and bloodshot, I hurt her, I really hurt her, I made her cry &#34;We all meet my parents in half hour I&#39;ll make a cuppa for the mean time&#34; everyone nods. I make everyone a cuppa, everyone in silence drinking from their cups, the boys sloched in the sofa not uttering a word, Amelia wrapped in a throw, holding her chamomile tea I go sit with her but she seems reluctant to want me near her. &#34;I&#39;m sorry beautiful I...&#34; &#34;what? thought it be okay to shut me out, tell me I&#39;m in danger then keep me away from you where I should be made to feel safe, lock me away like everyone else does because I look weak and fragile. You hurt me, you don&#39;t get to just come here and act like nothing happened. A mate is what should make you stronger, you want me to be your Luna but if that&#39;s how your gonna treat me when things get a little rough, perhaps you need to rethink who you want as a Luna!&#34;  Okay I really screwed up and I knew her words were true I should have never reacted as I did &#34;Amelia I panicked I didn&#39;t mean to hurt you, I just want to protect you, I can&#39;t imagine being without you, I love you beautiful&#34; &#34;Lucas I love you too but that doesn&#39;t make it okay to treat me like you have&#34;. She went back to drinking her tea, without even indicating for me to comfort her.</p>
