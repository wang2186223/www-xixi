                <p>After my short nap on the sofa, I busy myself in the kitchen making myself a southern fried chicken pasta salad, I fell in love with it the first time Nina made it for me and of course begged for her to tell me the recipe. As I finish up I notice a large box with a golden bow sitting on my bed, wondering how didn&#39;t I notice this before. *For our special girl on her special night love Rich &amp; Nina x x x*. An ivory box with golden detailing it looked expensive and I hadn&#39;t even opened it yet. I gently tug at the bow unraveling the thick silk ribbon and brace myself for whats inside, it&#39;s a dress, shoes and a mask. The ivory shoes with some golden lace detailing medium height stiletto heels, gorgeous the mask matching them perfectly the mask tied back with golden silk ribbon. The dress just above the knee so soft and delicate, lace coming over the shoulders and and down the arms, coming down into a deep v over the chest area where silk would start to trace behind the lace perfectly, high side slit and to complete the dress some golden crystals placed carefully throughout the dress making it glistened under the light, it was perfect. I&#39;d never seen a dress so magnificent in all my life, like it was made for me and only me my eyes fill up letting out a single tear over the thought they got me this in an act of love, but why would I need this dress? I feel a warm breath hit my shoulder, &#34;do you like them?&#34; Nina whispered gently. &#34;like it? I love it, it&#39;s perfect, but why?&#34; &#34;It was made for you I designed them myself thinking I wanted to give you something no one else had, the reason being I&#39;m not having my girl work on her special birthday you and isabella have the night off to enjoy you&#39;ll see soon, but for now I have to get my girl ready. You head for a shower I&#39;ll go grab some things I believe your jewellery will match also if you would like to place them out for me too&#34; &#34;Thank you&#34;  is all I could manage before weeping on her shoulder unable to say anything else, words couldn&#39;t describe how I felt in this moment, Tara was also in awe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina finished off placing the final curls in my hair, the mixed blonde even more evident than ever the soft curls laying down my back and coming over my shoulders, looking in the mirror I&#39;d never seen myself so beautiful, my make up done to compliment the dress with gold and nudes, making my eyes look even more golden than before, thoughts coming to mind of my day, Nina and Rich knew everything now, about being a werewolf, never having parents, thrown out of my pack, mating and everything else that entails of being a werewolf they weren&#39;t bothered nor scared they treated me as they did from day one, loved and belonging. Nina looked at me satisfied with her work. I could hear it getting busier downstairs. &#34;it&#39;s almost time, we need to get you in your dress now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slid into my dress, it fit perfectly, it hugged my new found hourglass figure perfectly, how she got it so perfect I&#39;ll never be able to understand. She looked at me so proud like a mom would their daughter, Just on time Rich came in, &#34;Come on girls your taking for...&#34; not being able to finish his sentence, he just stared at me. &#34;Amelia you look like a goddess, I guess you were right to get it designed Nina it looks phenomenal on her.&#34; nodding in approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rich placed my mask on for the finishing touch, &#34;now your ready lets go have a drink isabella is waiting for you and getting inpatient at that&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk into the club to see it had been transformed banners, balloons, decorations all round they had thrown a party for me, a masquerade party at that. I was beyond happy by now all they had done for me and this is the icing on the cake. There&#39;s a chocolate fountain, food, sculptures, everything decorated gold and ivory to match my dress mask and shoes. They seriously don&#39;t take enough credit for what they can do. How did they pull this off, however they did it. I felt like a million dollars either way. It&#39;s all for me and I love every detail Tara bouncing around my head in agreement. I wrap my arms around them again thanking them for the millionth time, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever be able to thank them enough at this point for everything they have done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella sitting there waiting for me she&#39;s dressed in a sage green one shoulder wrap dress flowing to the floor she looked amazing the colours complimenting her eyes, her thick black hair in a perfectly placed messy bun with some loose curls poking out here and there she looked radiant tonight. We had been getting along so well over the last couple of days working together even hung out on nights off. &#34;Oh goddess Amelia you look amazing, your glowing tonight here I got you a strawberry daiquiri to get started.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the drinks kept flowing and the night drifting on between dancing, laughing and joking. She finds herself picking up a man who kept buying us drinks, I think she intends to go home with him, I say I think, she keeps saying she&#39;s got herself a hook up so that&#39;s her plans for me not so lucky, I find my mind wondering whether he would be here tonight, I sit at the bar with a pink gin, &#34;so what&#39;s my girl sitting alone at the bar, looking deep in thought&#34; &#34; oh it&#39;s nothing Rich I can&#39;t thank you enough for all this you didn&#39;t have to&#34; &#34;No your right I didn&#39;t have to but I wanted to your very special to us, your like the daughter we never had so we&#39;ll continue to spoil you.&#34; I roll my eyes at him knowing full well I wasn&#39;t gonna argue with him &#34;Hey excuse me, can I get a Morgan&#39;s and coke&#34; it hit me, that voice that drink, it&#39;s him, then his scent sandalwood and jasmine invading my nostrels it smells divine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel blood rushing through every part of my body, sparks igniting in every one of my nerve endings, his voice sending tembles through every inch of me, it&#39;s him he&#39;s here and he&#39;s my mate. Tara screaming through my head jumping around ecstatic &#34;mate mate we found mate Amelia.&#34; I didn&#39;t need to look at him to know it&#39;s him. When I finally turn I see he&#39;s also wearing a mask but I could tell instantly by his blonde locks and his bluey silver eyes last time looked at him he seemed off unable to relax, tonight he looked radiant, beaming as if he&#39;d finally caught his hunt, did he know can he feel it? &#34;What would the beautiful girl next to me like?&#34; he cocked his head aside playfully. Oh goddess this man is beyond perfection how did I not realise before my body pulsating eager to touch him, mate him and mark him he is mine. &#34;I... I...
