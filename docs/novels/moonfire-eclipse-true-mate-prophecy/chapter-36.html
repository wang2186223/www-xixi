                <p>We head down for dinner, Lucas in a navy suit, white shirt, while I wear a burgundy fitted formal long dress, with a deep v neckline, Lucas was nervous  with me next to him as I hadn&#39;t been marked, although he already expressed he had the most beautiful woman on his arm, was proud when people looked over at us with jealousy in their eyes. I think he was quite enjoying it, we sat our table accompanied by Ma, Da, Evan, Cole and his mate Jessie, she was beautiful, long black locks, slender figure and Hazel eyes and you could see she only had eyes for Cole. Chatting away through dinner I thought I&#39;d start giving Lucas a little something to keep him on edge, eating my food in certain ways, teasing him with every mouth full and licking my lips inbetween. **Amelia are you playing games with your Alpha you know how dangerous this could be.** A smirk coming across his face as his link comes to mind. **I&#39;m not sure what your on about baby, but I do like games what you want to play,** sending a wink his way. **Amelia my beautiful Luna, you know you can&#39;t win this. Can I not** I slide my hand on to his thigh under the table keeping it discreet, I start to caress and squeeze slightly, also feeling his boxers getting tighter as his member starts growing **Amelia, your such a naughty girl you wait until later. I&#39;ll show you naughty if you want naughty,** feeling him become tense under my touch trying not to react, swallowing deep to keep his composure. **oh goddess I love you beautiful. I love you too baby. *&#34;There will be a ball starting at around 9 o&#39;clock until late so they&#39;re trying to push dinner out quickly so they can rotate the room once dinner is over.&#34;*** I actually really liked the sound of that, me and Lucas dancing together, just hope he can dance. I&#39;m loving every minute of this trip so far, everything taken care of and even better Lucas doesn&#39;t leave my side just where I wanted him, Ava and Brandon seem really relaxed too enjoying eachother company away from pack duties. Evan just hovering over his with a stern look, ready to pounce on someone, hes a good bodyguard I must give it to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With food over and the room turned around champagne being handed out left, right and centre, it was a lovely atmosphere, Lucas knew so many people from different packs, I couldn&#39;t keep up with who was who, they all seemed lovely. I&#39;m guessing these are packs that all have some business together, they all seem to get along really well. I let Lucas know I&#39;m popping to the toilet, Evan followed with a command from Lucas. I go into the ladies toilet get on with my business and freshen up, I look in the mirror to see someone staring over my shoulder, ***&#34;Haisley what the you doing here?&#34; &#34;I&#39;m the one who should be here not you skank,&#34;*** slapping me across the face leaving a sting. ***&#34;Enjoy while you can it won&#39;t last, that I promise&#34; &#34;Jelousy won&#39;t get you anywhere we are true mates and that cant be changed by anyone&#34; &#34;your not marked so at the moment you need to think whether or not he thinks your worth marking and it&#39;s easily taken out of your hands that way&#34;*** *Knock Knock* ***&#34;Amelia are you okay in there your taking a while&#34;*** shit if I don&#39;t hurry up he will barge in here ***&#34;just a second I&#39;ll, be right there&#34; &#34;over my dead body will he ever accept an ungrateful spoilt little brat like you, you don&#39;t deserve a mate at all&#34;*** trying to control my anger ***&#34;over your dead body sounds good&#34;*** letting out a laugh as I turn on my heel and head out the door. ***&#34;Amelia what happened in there you cheek is red&#34; &#34;nothing I couldn&#39;t handle let&#39;s go have some fun&#34;***, with a nervous smile across my face trying to shake off what had just happened I&#39;d never stood up to anyone before other than the time Lucas pushed me aside but that was different I actually confronted someone, feeling proud of myself but all the more nervous I have a red mark, Lucas is sure to notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Hey beautiful you were gone too long&#34; &#34;sorry got a little caught up with something&#34;*** shrugging it off, Lucas face changed instantly ***&#34;what happened and why is your cheek red?&#34;*** letting out a growl. Well that didn&#39;t take long to notice ***&#34;It&#39;s nothing Lucas leave it let&#39;s not spoil tonight I will tell you about it later but right now I want to dance&#34;*** grabbing his hand to come dance with me, couple of hours went by and we were preparing to leave, I loved every minute of being with him, holding him dancing to my surprise he can actually dance. We mingled a little more and spoke to few more people who I already forgot, now lurking over me was her face in the mirror, I had to explain to Lucas who is going to be fuming with me for not saying anything straight away, this is going to change his mood completely as if he couldn&#39;t be angrier with me for not telling him yet he&#39;s gonna explode when I say she&#39;s here. letting a frown come across my face ***&#34;Come Amelia lets get you back, you need some rest I thought we&#39;d head out for a run in the morning after breakfast so it&#39;s going to be a long day for us and we head back Sunday so rest while you can beautiful&#34;*** saying firmly I could tell he wasn&#39;t letting it slip. I sigh hard and nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We get back to the room and Lucas puts the kettle on and makes my tea and himself a coffee but weak seen as we needed sleep we had 2 long days ahead of us. ***&#34;Amelia beautiful can you please tell me what happened now it&#39;s eating me up inside.&#34;*** I sigh hard and pause before telling him the story  without mentioning it was Haisley and I could see his face changing more and more the further I explained, trying to contain his anger but he also looked kinda proud of the way I handled it. ***&#34;So who was this girl then I wouldn&#39;t have thought anyone here would have done anything like that I will make a formal complaint in the morning&#34;*** I&#39;m gonna have to say or every woman here will be questioned ***&#34;that&#39;s the thing you can&#39;t because it was... Haisley... she&#39;s here&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His whole temperament changed from calm and collected on the way I handled the situation to, ***&#34;you should have said sooner, you know she&#39;s working with him and you left yourself in a dangerous situation Amelia. How could you be so careless, didn&#39;t you think about what she could have done to you?&#34; &#34;Lucas I am still here, I am not a child, I handled the situation as I seen fit you can&#39;t keep someone stuck to me every minute, I appreciate you are worried I do, but I also can&#39;t be watched every second it isn&#39;t possible.&#34;*** I see his face go from angry to desperate almost as if he&#39;s going to cry, ***&#34;Amelia please, don&#39;t hide these things and try not to get yourself in these situations again I can&#39;t live without you by my side, you make me who I am not the way I was raised you make me want to be a better person, friend, mate, an even better Alpha and in the future a better father than you and I ever had, I love you Amelia&#34;*** he begins to sob I just bring him into my chest ***&#34;I love you too baby, me and you against the world&#34;.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last night we just cuddled up and went to bed, emotions ran high before bed, we just needed to hold eachother and be with eachother, just pure love between us, we needed to feel close, we needed to relax, we needed eachother. We fell asleep in eachothers arms just laying there silently drifting off the sleep. Lucas kept hold of me more or less the whole time after the antics although we never seen Haisley at all other than when I did I wasn&#39;t sure if she supposed to be there or not. We met with his father before getting ready for the ceremony, we explained everything to him, of course patting me on the back ***&#34;well done for standing your ground&#34;.*** The pack held dinner early to allow enough time to prepare for the ceremony and after party and then their first run as a fully mated/married couple, also they will be taking the title as Alpha and Luna the same time so it will be their first run as leaders of the pack also. I&#39;m a little apprehensive on how this evening is going to go especially after last night, Lucas is not gonna leave my side at any given point, I can tell how worried he is, he&#39;s also informed Mateo and Nathan through link with the update and to ensure everything is all good back home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ceremony so beautiful, golds and whites everywhere were all seated waiting for Jessie to arrive, Cole inpatiently waiting pacing back and forth like any nervous groom. As she entered the filled room and a harp playing in the background setting the scene, it was perfect every little detail, her dress ivory and gold detailing similar to my birthday dress except her was an aline wedding dress. perfect for the occasion. as they pledge their oaths lucas leans into me, ***&#34;that will be us soon beautiful&#34; &#34;I can&#39;t wait baby&#34;*** pecking him on the cheek. Both Cole and Jessie disappeared to complete the next step of the ceremony as we all stayed, danced and mingled for a while. Lucas stuck to me like glue, he must have caught a glimpse of Haisley as he gripped me tighter, ***&#34;do not leave my side beautiful&#34;*** I give him a deeper kiss than intended ***&#34;never baby&#34;*** sending a wink to lighten the mood. Cole and Jessie got back to everyone where Alpha Mayback announced it was time, Tara was bouncing to come out, back to her playful self, and more than happy to come out seen as we didn&#39;t get our promised run this morning, Lucas was abit up tight and reluctant. Cole shifted first, he&#39;s a big wolf but no where near the size of Lucas, then Jessie and the rest of us followed suit Damon and Tara were like puppies finally freed to roam, they hunted and played alot before actually settling down together muzzle to muzzle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a late night we were both exhausted and ready for bed. We had another long drive ahead of us tomorrow meaning we needed to catch some rest, as much I wanted Lucas inside me, sending me in to oblivion neither of us had the energy and just needed sleep. We just went to sleep in eachother arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a trip were almost home, ***&#34;I hope you enjoyed your first trip as future Luna&#34;*** Da spoke, ***&#34;I loved it thank you for asking us to accompany you.&#34; &#34;We had to make a statement now my boy has found his mate. It will yours and Lucas before long and you think they did a good party darling they got nothing on this pack&#34;*** everyone nodding in agreement. I see the pack house in the distance and it hit me. Home sweet home the mayback pack is lovely but it wasn&#39;t home. This is my home.</p>
