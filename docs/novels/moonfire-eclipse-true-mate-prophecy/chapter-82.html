                <p>***&#34;She will be the perfect princess anyone could ever ask for&#34;*** I whispered in Amelia&#39;s ear while the crowd that had gathered were cheering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the next hour everyone came to congratulate us one by one, some even asked about a baby shower but Amelia wasn&#39;t so sure about a baby shower just yet, she has a lot on her plate being Luna and pregnant she probably doesn&#39;t get enough rest as it is so adding to that could put unneeded strain on her and pup so we would have to see how things plan out. Finally Mark approached us, ***&#34;happy with the outcome my wonderful couple,&#34;*** he asked ***&#34;over the moon thank you so much for everything you have done for us and our pup&#34; &#34;your more than welcome, next stage is to actually deliever this pup, I can see your growing well, and doesn&#39;t look like too much longer away now&#34; &#34;I hope not I&#39;m aching now and tired beyond resting.&#34; &#34;don&#39;t worry too much Amelia you will be perfectly fine plus if needed you have Lucas to do the running around.&#34;*** he continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the party in full swing people drinking, giggling and munching away, Amelia and I actually eased up and started to enjoy too. From last night to right now everything is perfect it&#39;s probably been the most relaxed I&#39;ve been, not sure I&#39;m going to be so relaxed as my little princess starts to grow up and get interested in boys but I&#39;m more than happy right in the moment, I thank the goddess and my Mother for everything they have done and always having their protection and gifting me this miracle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a split second I&#39;m brought away from my thoughts I hear howling and growling from a distance, my heart starts racing how could we be so stupid, we have been so wrapped up in everything else we still have an existing threat out there. **Lucas breach to North West of the Border, send back up** I link some of the pack to get the the north border, wolf formation. As I shifted I noticed Amelia looking over worrying, I didn&#39;t even have time to explain I was gone I have to protect my mate and my pup. As I approach the border I see they have eliminated some of our warriors but no sign of anyone else. **ITS A FUCKING DECOY RETREAT TO THE PACKHOUSE.**  As we headed back quicker I see wolves everywhere, Amelia no where to be seen. ***Where are you? heading up to our room I have to keep pup safe. Lockdown bedroom I will override from the office just stay safe Amelia, I love you.*** I notice Jackson in human form standing in the middle of everyone. I shift back and approach ***&#34;I see your gorgeous mate isn&#39;t here such a shame&#34; &#34;what do you want from Amelia?&#34; &#34;I know what she is and I know what she is capable of, I&#39;ve been watching for weeks now, you havn&#39;t been a very good mate have you, but her growing pup, it&#39;s probably perfect&#34;*** The wolves started retreating to the trees, I couldn&#39;t work out why, I could see Jackson &#39;s temper rising, ***&#34;For Fuck Sakes, I&#39;ll be back and you better be ready I&#39;ll have your head for this.&#34;*** I stood there confused as I didn&#39;t know what was going on or why they were retreating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I notice a famililar but not a wolf scent, it&#39;s Jordan he&#39;s here, ***&#34;I guess I got here in good time?&#34; &#34;could say that, thank you&#34; &#34;your welcome, I came for the reveal party actually&#34; &#34;it&#39;s a girl to keep you up to speed we&#39;re over the moon&#34; &#34;I bet you are congratulations now Where&#39;s Amelia?&#34; &#34;sorry I&#39;ll take you to her now she&#39;s locked in a panic room aka my bedroom which goes into a fully reinforced room to ensure safety for her and those that may need it.&#34; &#34;good thinking I must say&#34; &#34;just glad she remembered&#34;***, as I unlocked everything and giving Amelia a chance to breathe. Her and Jordan get chatting away I manage escape to meet Mateo, I feel so guilty how did I end up letting this happen?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Amelia*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Hope you can visit soon or once we&#39;ve had the pup well come to you&#34;*** I give jordan a hug and thank him for coming. Jordan had spent 3 weeks with us now to try and hold off any attacks prior to my delivery but has to head back now seen as the one who has the shop in Jordans absence while he is away is struggling. We have experienced a few mild attacks since the whole Jackson charade but nothing the guards couldn&#39;t handle. Everyone also decided I should have a baby shower before Jordan retreats back so that happened yesterday, leaving us with a combination anklet to give to our princess it&#39;s also adjustable so should carry he through until she&#39;s 1ish, he put more energy into my ring he gave me when we first met. Honestly I don&#39;t know where we would be at times without him. Lucas now has an energy ring too seen as he&#39;s accumilated some of my abilities. Them two actually get on really well, Lucas respects him alot and values his advice alot. As Jordan was leaving Lucas was whispering in his ear about something as much as I hated not being in the loop about things I knew sometimes it was for my own good not to know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas has become extremely protective now especially with me being so close, I think Mark has estimated around 2-4 weeks and I should be delivering which is starting to get quite nerve racking but I&#39;ll be glad when it&#39;s all over with. Lucas has been an amazing support, trying to get me to rest up calling Mark if he thinks there&#39;s something he&#39;s worried about, my appetite has slowed right down now. I&#39;m eating little and often now because our princess is now taking up so much room, also weeing my gosh no one ever mentioned I would be up every hour weeing can&#39;t even get a full nights sleep anymore, I sigh to myself I&#39;m sure it will all be worth it in the end. Getting more and more fed up by the day but Lucas was trying to get me out going for walks and letting Tara and Damon having time together, I would have thought it would be uncomfortable to shift but actually it didn&#39;t feel any different and Tara continued to be her normal self, that not suprising because it was only my human form that was carrying our pup. Damon obviously ecstatic it&#39;s a girl but I&#39;m starting to worry he&#39;s going to be very over powering and protective alot of the time even if he tried to reassure me different, Lucas kind of gives me the same vibe at times, although with our current drama we kind of have to be vigilant but once that&#39;s all over and done with we will all be set kind of free again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Hey baby, what&#39;s the plans for the rest of the day then seen as we have nothing to do?&#34; &#34;actually I have a surprise for you&#34; &#34;you do?&#34;*** what on earth has he been doing now? I&#39;m sure he wants to continuously be giving me something. ***&#34;come on, we only have to walk like 5 minutes tops&#34;*** All this walking is pushing my little princess further and further down she be falling out they carry on making me walk everywhere. We come to a stop at his parents house, ***&#34;This is your surprise Amelia&#34; &#34;your parents house?&#34; &#34;it&#39;s not my parents house anymore it&#39;s our family home&#34;*** he&#39;s gotta be kidding me right, that place is just a work of art and sentimental value. ***&#34;Amelia, I know this may come as a shock but I&#39;ve transformed it into our family home, I couldn&#39;t keep things the same there would be too many memories but I do have amazing memories here too and I want us to continue to make our own here&#34;*** he&#39;s serious, I have no idea what to say but look in complete shock, ***&#34;I was not expecting this in all honesty, I know but it&#39;s about time I looked at our future and this is our best option&#34;***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas hands me the keys to our new home, I&#39;m still in complete shock, I unlock the door and see he&#39;s transformed the entrance and grand staircase, white marble flooring heated I&#39;m guessing, silver and gold intertwined together to bring out the finishing touches, some lovely stone sculptures of wolves male and female, actually looking pretty similar to us, I turn left into the guest bathroom to find he used neutral colours greys and faded blues, lovely floating sinks all stocked up with pearl white hand towels. Cabinets made of beech wood, stocked with toilet roll, sanitary towels and so forth to ensure all guests would be tended to, also in the far corner a baby changing station for me during the day and any other mothers that may visit all stocked up with nappies wipes, creams and what not. ***&#34;Lucas how did you manage to get all this done?&#34; &#34;it&#39;s been worked on for weeks, I was waiting on it being ready for us to show you&#34; &#34;So far I love it&#34;.*** I head to the living room where I find it&#39;s sage and cream colour schemed, everything looked so light and airy I think they must have used a pine wood or something for the decor here either way it was a perfect match. Heading toward the kitchen diner, gone is the old black and dark colours to it booming with pure white cupboards and shelving, all the kitchen accessories in a matching chrome affect, granite worktops, island and breakfast bar. It&#39;s perfect, solid wood table and 6 chairs everything perfect matching. As I continue throughout the house everything was perfect, floral blush and grey in the master bedroom with an ensuite. Final room he showed me just got me in complete awe, Our princess&#39;s nursery, all greys and whites fit for our little princess everything already there waiting, including a pram, carseat the whole lot the only thing I needed to get her was clothes. ***&#34;Lucas this is perfect, the whole house is perfect, it&#39;s so light and airy, while your parents were here all I can remember was lot of it being quite dark, well put together but dark&#34;. &#34;agreed and thats not you, I needed light and airy. The celler also has supplies and what not if we ever need to lockdown to ensure you will always have supplies no matter the situation.&#34; &#34;when do we move here?&#34; &#34;Whenever your ready beautiful you say the word and our clothing will be brought here, also I have a cleaner to ensure this place is spotless everyday to make sure you have time for everything else and our pup&#34; &#34;would it be too much trouble if we moved tonight?&#34; &#34;not at all beautiful I was kind of hoping you would say today so we can take a break from the zoo we call a packhouse&#34;*** we both giggled at that. ***&#34;Lucas I can&#39;t thank you enough for the last couple of weeks, it&#39;s been testing and stressful, a stress free, relaxing evening sounds like the perfect plan.&#34;***</p>
