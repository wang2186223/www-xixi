                <p>My stress levels are at peak at the moment, I&#39;m so worried about everyone getting hurt, I have to distance myself. I can&#39;t put anyone in danger all because of that idiot, and all of a sudden he&#39;s shown more and more interest in Amelia, It&#39;s me he wanted there&#39;s no need for everyone else to get hurt. Amelia, my pup, our life could come crashing at any given time something needs to be done but this timing, this fucking timing for him to pipe up his game, it&#39;s almost as if he knows exactly what&#39;s going on. Amelia please hold on a little longer let&#39;s get this over with first, I don&#39;t want my pup coming into this world with all this drama, please Ma I&#39;m begging you give her strength, support and comfort she needs it now more than ever, something I can&#39;t fully offer, as much as it&#39;s hurting and making me weaker all I want to do is fall into her engulfing her calming scent, feeling the fire burn between us, fuck Lucas you can&#39;t, I fist my hair in frustration, I have to hold back for everyone. **Lucas you can&#39;t keep yourself away, you&#39;ll become weaker, you need to be at your peak right now, something is brewing I just can&#39;t tell what I keep feeling uneasy about things, please be focused on the whole picture here. I&#39;m trying to avoid her getting hurt and the added stress, I&#39;m not having our pup come into this Damon.** He lets out a whimper. **I miss mate Lucas and Tara will give me the strength I need too. I&#39;m not even sure she can shift in her state Damon.** I&#39;ll let him go sulk while I try and get some work done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Luc... you coming to training? Yeh be right down, just trying to sort my head out. Trent is here with Amelia too, although I didn&#39;t call him to take detail did you? No, Libby mentioned that Amelia was taking it into her own hands considering she&#39;s so close now, no risks just relax and wait for her time. Atleast she&#39;s putting herself first for a change. It&#39;s not for her it&#39;s for your pup Lucas. Either way it&#39;s about time she relaxed.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I head down to training, I begin to get a thudding feeling in my head, Damon must be trying to punish me for not being with Amelia. I shrug it off. ***&#34;about time you showed up. How&#39;s Amelia and the pup doing?&#34;*** Nathan persued ***&#34;they&#39;re okay, she&#39;s just trying to relax and rest up, while I try and keep her at a distance and safe it&#39;s me that Jackson wants not her, she doesn&#39;t deserve all this drama. Anymore updates on Birchgrove or the surveillence team?&#34; &#34;not at the moment, no one has managed to get in contact with the surveillance team, I think they are either presumed dead, captured or turned but Three peaks and Minitor have put on the network that they have pack members missing&#34; &#34;I&#39;ll get in contact although they are good 2 hours in opposite directions.&#34; &#34;I think we should pull out the maps and see if there&#39;s a central point in where all connects to maybe we can get a better idea of thier hideout&#34;*** Mateo suggested ***&#34;Good idea meet me in the office after training I&#39;ll bring Trent along if you send Nikki and Libby to Amelia to keep her company&#34; &#34;sounds good, hopefully we can nip all this in the bud before Amelia has our pup&#34;*** I let out a deep sigh with thoughts I might not be able to make my pups birth if all this is going on. Mateo pats me on the back. ***&#34;chin up, we&#39;ll sort this mess&#34;*** I nod in appreciation, hopefully I can get all this over with quickly, I&#39;ll take a small team with me if we can locate the hideout and get this over with, I fist my hair out of stress, realising I need to take a shower my hair feels awful it probably looks just as bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I get back to the room to find no one in here, I immediatly link, **Where are you? Is everything okay? Lucas I&#39;m fine I left a note on the fridge Trent has given me Craig seen as he was needed with you, only popped shopping quickly to get a few bits the girls are with me too. Sorry Amelia I panicked don&#39;t be long, make sure you stay safe. We will, princess is very active today so I had no chance of resting up anyway. Okay, don&#39;t over do it, I love you both. We love you too.** I let the relief wash over me, everything is making me so nervous I don&#39;t think I could cope if something happened now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I head straight for a shower, I&#39;m a mess, at the moment and need to tidy myself up, I shouldn&#39;t be letting myself go but there&#39;s so much to do and think about, with Amelia on leave I&#39;m doing everything, now I know how she felt when I was off on one doing nothing, except I could of helped but Amelia can&#39;t be dealing with this, I can&#39;t send her into an early labour with all this stress. I tidy myself up and head to the packhouse and meet everyone in the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;So boys what we looking at? sorry I&#39;m late, I thought I&#39;d make sure I made a little more effort I started to let myself go a little.&#34; &#34;I brought out the maps and that&#39;s as far as we got&#34; &#34;I take it we are all aware of the situtions&#34; &#34;I&#39;ve brought them to speed&#34; &#34;Anyone know how we could possibly plot?&#34; &#34;I know what I&#39;m doing just give me 10 minutes or so&#34;*** Trent insisted. ***&#34;So in the mean time we can ring around packs and see what&#39;s been going on&#34; &#34;got it I&#39;ll ring three peaks&#34;*** Mateo more than happy to help out. ***&#34;Nathan do you want to ring Birchgrove and see what&#39;s going on there and I&#39;ll ring Minitor see if we can work out what&#39;s happening&#34; &#34;Sounds good to me&#34;*** We all go ahead and ring around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the mean time Trent has managed to plot out the map and showing up to possible locations. One an Abandoned industrial warehouse, the other an old cottage. Trent explained that it would most likely be the cottage, it would be obvious to use a warehouse, due to it&#39;s size and probably out in the open. I went on to explain that in total Minitor have 50 missing pack members over the last 3 months, which for a small pack it&#39;s a substanial amount, I offered them to join us in unison as their pack is facing destruction, to which they appreciated but declined. I respect that, it&#39;s their pack their home, I probably wouldn&#39;t accept either but the offer is there. ***&#34;Sorry I took so long on the phone, Three peaks are missing 76 pack members in a month, it may not seem alot considering their pack size but Jackson is also taking from other packs, the size of that pack could be quite large by now to we may need to request for reinforcments.&#34;*** all of us in agreement, ***&#34;The agency will support us, I can also reach out to sole workers if nessasary&#34; &#34;that would be amazing thank you Trent, I&#39;ll call the Mayback pack and see if they can spare anyone to help. We also have a wild card which no one will expect&#34;*** All of them look at me puzzled as to what it is I&#39;m suggesting, Mateo literally cocking his head aside. ***&#34;Jordan we have Jordan for crying out loud, If he thinks that Amelia or my pups life is at stake he will be here in a heart beat&#34; &#34;you sure on that I mean you saw their response last time they backed off until Jordan left&#34; &#34;Not if they think Jordan isn&#39;t here, it&#39;s a trap they are running straight into.&#34; &#34;Okay, so what&#39;s your plan?&#34;*** Nathan asks nervously. ***&#34;Spring a surprise attack on them but retreat before we can get too deep into the fight, it&#39;s just so we can see what we&#39;re up against then render back into routines and wait for them to come to us and believe me they will come, but we can&#39;t go back to routine until reinforcments arrive, we got it?&#34; &#34;You better hope this works smarty pants&#34; &#34;It will&#34;*** I hope it does Amelia, my pup and the pack are at stake. Damon extremely unsettled prancing around. **We can&#39;t leave Amelia, Amelia needs us here. I know but what choice do we have?** There he goes again throbbing and thudding. ***&#34;Go enjoy the rest of the day, plans begin tomorrow&#34;.*** They begin to exit and Mateo pops his head back in, ***&#34;We have your back don&#39;t worry Lucas&#34;</p>
