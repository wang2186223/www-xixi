                <p>She&#39;s made her mind up, there&#39;s no changing it now, My Luna I hope were doing this right goddess I pray she&#39;s made the right decision, she&#39;s gotta be okay I can&#39;t live without her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Mark have you got time for Amelia and I tomorrow it might be a long visit, also a monitor for her vitals and equipment on stand by. Lucas my boy you sound on edge why would we need all this? Amelia is the prophecy, her abilities were taken away as a baby by the fae and he&#39;s placed all her essence in a vial she must drink in order to regain her true self,** saying the words making even more nervous but i must stand by her decision. **Now this is a development, I&#39;m guessing you want her in my presence as you don&#39;t trust the Fae. Amelia actually wants to be in your presence as well even though she&#39;s had a hard time trying to make her decision and she&#39;s not going to back down now, I just hope this fae is legitimate. I assure you this gentleman is a man of his word I&#39;ll clear my afternoon for you two I have nothing important anyway, you two are my star patients it&#39;s lovely being in your company surrounded by so much love and affection.** I hope Mark is right about this man or he will be giving me his life.  **It&#39;s not what it used to be but you two make lives worth saving. Thanks Mark say around 1ish so we can have some lunch before coming to you? that will be perfect Lucas see you tomorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Hey beautiful, had something to eat now?&#34; &#34;yes I feel much better now baby thank you&#34; &#34;I&#39;ve linked Mark we will be meeting him at 1pm tomorrow, he&#39;s cleared his afternoon to keep you monitored for a while after to ensure there&#39;s no after effects, he&#39;s with you on trusting Jordan, I&#39;m on edge and worried Amelia what if things go wrong?&#34;*** Amelia barely flinching trying to show her bravery but surely deep down she&#39;s nervous as hell. I can&#39;t imagine if things go wrong, I didn&#39;t want to imagine, my father knows nothing nor does my mother. Mateo and Nathan will also be devastated to learn that their Luna made a big mistake which could consequence with her life. My body running cold at the thought Damon seemed okay if I&#39;m honest just trying not to take any side. ***&#34;I&#39;m trusting my heart on this one I don&#39;t think this will go wrong, I can feel it&#39;s a part of me the more I look at it and hold the vial, I just hope thats not just what I want to believe.&#34; &#34;We will be the start of a new race if all this works out Amelia, that part I am excited for,  and focusing on or I think I&#39;ll be going insane.&#34;*** I never thought I&#39;d be raising our hybrid pups, but I&#39;ll happily be showing the world we did it, when everyone else doubted us. ***&#34;I will love you for forever more Amelia don&#39;t ever forget that&#34;*** trying not to sound like it&#39;s gonna be her last day. I needed her to know just incase anything happens to her, I wouldn&#39;t forgive myself for not not stopping her but having to respect her. Oh goddess you&#39;ve given me a tough path, I just hope I don&#39;t lose my way. **We wont lose our way we just need to focus on mate and we will be fine. Your right Damon it&#39;s all about us now ***&#34;always look on the bright side Lucas let&#39;s not think about maybes and let&#39;s just focus on our love and just being together that&#39;s all we need right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Luc we have some news on the Jackson front and just to inform you, your father just beheaded 3 traitors who trying to send information back. We are really low on truth serum now, you&#39;ll have to get some.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Thank you Mateo we&#39;ll meet in the morning in my room at 10, I have to be with Mark at 1pm so I&#39;ll be taking the day off from everything as will my little Luna.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I completely lost thought about the Jackson situation with everything going on with Amelia, how could I be so careless, she&#39;s probably at her most vulnerable too, and I forget about our main threat. I&#39;m just glad he didn&#39;t make an attack at this time or I think he&#39;d actually stand a chance with both Amelia and me being so distracted. I let out a sigh and let is wash over me. ***&#34;Lucas whats going on? your face has gone from peachy and sweet to anger and fury&#34;*** Ameila&#39;s right, it&#39;s like my blood turned to lava and ready to erupt, ***&#34;Amelia we can talk about it in the morning let&#39;s just enjoy for tonight&#34; &#34;we&#39;re doing this again are we? where you just hide things. I thought we had been through this&#34;*** she hissed, I fist my hair letting out a sigh knowing she wasn&#39;t going to drop it, all I wanted was to enjoy our night. ***&#34; we just had some information on Jackson and my dad has beheaded 3 traitors he caught trying to send information back&#34;*** she looked shocked ***&#34;did he atleast keep someone alive to interrogate&#34;*** surely my father wouldn&#39;t have lost that much control and kept one even being the hot headed alpha he is. ***&#34;I&#39;m not sure but Mateo will be here at 10 in the morning to fill us in.&#34;*** although it&#39;s gonna hard to get any rest time with this clouding over me.***&#34;I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to be able to relax until we&#39;ve spoken to Mateo we might aswel get him here now&#34;*** I sigh knowing she&#39;s right neither of us are gonna sleep with this. ***&#34;at this point I agree with you Amelia I&#39;ll link Mateo.&#34;***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Couldn&#39;t hide it from Amelia and neither of us will sleep until we have an idea of what&#39;s going on, so come to my room when you can.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;I&#39;m so glad you linked me to come over I didn&#39;t want to wait but I wanted you guys to get some sleep too&#34; &#34;I&#39;ll put the kettle on then shall I?&#34;*** Amelia asked gently. ***&#34;Good shout Amelia&#34;*** Mateo replied. ***&#34;Thanks Amelia your a star&#34;*** Mateo responded to Amelia handing him a steamy coffee, she finally sits in her corner spot of the sofa to get comfortable waiting for Mateo to tell all. ***&#34;It started with the guards noticing 5 men on the boarders of the pack lands with no other scheduled patrol, they got suspicious especially after being informed to be alert at a possible pending attack everything was to be dealt with discreetly to not alert other pack members.&#34;*** we had already tore up any routines and started to do random patrols and no patterns to avoid any system incase anything did get back. ***&#34;the guards alerted your father and proceeded to approach with caution and 3 of the 5 were still members embedded in the pack, one fled almost immediately, the other outsider is captured and being held in one of the cells, and the 3 traitors were beheaded on the spot. Your father tried to get information with just force but he didn&#39;t respond, some truth serum worked a treat opening up like a little baby after 4 doses.&#34; &#34;so what did we get out of him?&#34;*** Amelia asked eagerly ***&#34;well the intention was to learn patterns and routines in regards security measures in order to kidnap Amelia purely to gain your attention but obviously they had no luck on that thanks to your idea of random and 3 hourly changes to patrol schedule Amelia&#34;*** thats my girl, looking at her proud as ever ***&#34;is there any lead to the one who ran off?&#34;*** I pressed. ***&#34;na, trail ran cold about 2 miles west&#34; &#34;get a tracker out there I want an advantage here I need to find out what we&#39;re up against&#34; &#34;Scott will be tracking in the morning, his pup only arrived early hours this morning, but for now that&#39;s all we have, anything you want done in the mean time&#34;*** I need to interrogate this wolf, I&#39;ll get more answers than my father, he tends to lean towards a cocky approach me on the other I can be traumatising. ***&#34;Amelia will you be joining me in interrogating this asshole? although I must warn I can be over bearing at times and there probably will be blood shed&#34;*** looking over at her for a reaction. ***&#34;well you can&#39;t leave me here alone and you never know I might like that to Lucas along with his gentle playful demeanour&#34; &#34;Let&#39;s get to it then beautiful&#34;***</p>
