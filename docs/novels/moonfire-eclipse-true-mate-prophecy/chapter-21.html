                <p>I arrive Rich and Nina&#39;s place, it&#39;s modern and elegant, a lovely home. Amelia runs from the house and dives into my arms, &#34;I&#39;ve missed you&#34; &#34;I can tell beautiful, I missed you too&#34; a warm smile appearing on her gorgeous face, those plump lips are my ecstasy, I give her quick kiss before we head in. I could tell she didn&#39;t want me to stop but we have company. &#34;plenty of time for that Amelia let&#39;s get to dinner&#34; she threw a little pout and almost dragged me inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The house is so beautiful definitely a feminine touch, golds, teals and creams running through the downstairs with a large open plan kitchen and dinning room, &#34;Welcome Lucas, glad your finally here Amelia has been on pins waiting for you&#34; &#34;thank you for having my company, I&#39;m early though&#34; I said politely &#34;exactly she&#39;s been like it a few hours now&#34; Nina laughed, she got it just as bad as me then I take it. &#34;Anyway food is almost ready and the table is set so please take a seat.&#34; Rich waved his had toward the table. We sat at the table while Nina and Rich brought food over. Food looked as amazing as it smelt, these two must have experience, still not Ma&#39;s food though. A full roast dinner is just what I needed. We all chatted and laughed over dinner, Amelia was on cloud 9 having us all together, I could tell she wasn&#39;t used to this sort of thing maybe thats something we need to do more often spend time with family and friends having dinners, going out together, trips and so forth, I know she would love the idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia and I offer to clear up after dinner, so we cleared the left overs and loaded the dish washer together giving the dishes that would be harder to clean a quick wipe down, she splashed me on numerous of occasions, I loved how playful she could be, she&#39;s so happy and comfortable here, I just hope she can learn to be like this around my parents. &#34;Amelia you will pay for that one&#34; I chase her around with a wet cloth and flicking some water over her now and again. The atmosphere here is so calm I love it, I felt comfortable and she was completely in her element. After we finished up in the kitchen I asked if I could take her home, I needed to ask her about tomorrow and I just wanted her in my arms a little while before I head back. &#34;yeh that would be lovely thank you&#34; We said our thank yous and goodbyes to Rich and Nina who replied with &#34;your both welcome here anytime&#34; I appreciated that very much seen as this is the first time I&#39;d met them properly not while they were working. A very nice couple indeed even if they were human they knew all about us, which I trusted they wouldn&#39;t go telling anyone, they adored Amelia too much to bring her any harm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We get back to Amelia&#39;s apartment she sits herself down on her sofa and signals me to join her. &#34;Amelia I&#39;ve loved every minute of tonight, thank you.&#34; &#34;your welcome baby, I wanted you to ask to see me today so you come for dinner I didn&#39;t want to drag you away from any duties&#34; I could see she was ashamed. &#34;Beautiful girl don&#39;t bow your head or feel bad for wanting me, I want you too, I will do anything in my power to be around you. At the moment I havn&#39;t really got much on anyways so I&#39;m all yours&#34; she nodded shyly &#34;believe me when I say this I love you and nothing will come between us, I was hoping you would agree to come to dinner with my parents tomorrow they have agreed to meet you and give you a chance, my father took it surprisingly well, my mother is just bursting with joy that I&#39;ve found you and wanted you to be there already to meet you but I will only take you if you agree I don&#39;t want to push you into this.&#34; Her eyes meet mine widening, her golden eyes mesmerising, just making me fall deeper for her each time I see them but ahes nervous it&#39;s written all over her face. &#34;I will meet your parents and come for dinner but I&#39;m nervous what if they don&#39;t like me&#34; I look at her I see the pain through her eyes, &#34;You can talk to me beautiful, what are you hiding from me please I want you to trust me, and I want to help you through any troubles you may have, I am your shoulder to cry on&#34; I leave her rest her face on my hand and feel a tear fall I bring her to my lap and just hold her there I don&#39;t think she was ready for that, I cocked up stupid Lucas what did you do that for. &#34;it&#39;s okay Amelia I&#39;m here if your not ready, your not ready it&#39;s okay, I&#39;m sorry if you feel pressured&#34; I feel her calm down in my arms her breathing returning to nearly normal, &#34;it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want to tell you I just don&#39;t know how, I know next to nothing about who I am, who I&#39;m ment to be, Lucas you knew more about my wolf than I did it scares me I don&#39;t know what&#39;s been hidden from me and I&#39;m not sure I can take you hiding things from me either.&#34; &#34;Amelia I know as much as you do, I promise my pack Dr and Da are doing what they can to help uncover some of your past and you will be the first to know, I can put my life on that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at me hard with what seemed to be like she was having a battle with herself until she spoke &#34;your lucky to have all that I never have, my parents abandoned me, I was an orphan at the black shadow pack, I was treated poorly, I lived off left overs, I trained and worked out as much I as I could behind closed doors, I used gymnastics as my release, the only friend I had who I was so sure was my mate, I don&#39;t know what he&#39;s done or hasn&#39;t done but I ended up getting kicked out because of him, he hasn&#39;t even given me an explanation or anything for that matter after all the years he protected me, he was by my side then he just ditched me too. I had no one until Rich and Nina took me in and now I have you I can&#39;t lose you, I can&#39;t take anymore rejection or abandonment, it will kill me&#34; I just held her she finally poured her heart out to me and laid it all out she was a sobbing wreck, I hated seeing her so vulnerable but all I could do was hold her and be here when she needed me most. &#34;I&#39;m here Amelia, I&#39;m not going anywhere you won&#39;t lose me even if you tried, I love you more than you will ever understand&#34;  &#34;Can you stay tonight I don&#39;t want to be alone&#34; I felt her whisper into my chest &#34;I wouldn&#39;t be leaving you like this anyway beautiful, I&#39;m right here&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Won&#39;t be home tonight guys, Amelia needs me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No worries, take care of your mate we&#39;re okay here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you like me to run you a bath to relax a little?&#34; she nodded slowly &#34;I&#39;ll be right back I&#39;ll sort the bath out for you&#34; planting her gently back on the sofa, her bathroom is small, had what it needed, cream marble floor, bright white tiles, a small sink, a shower and a free standing bath pretty basic but very organised. I add in some bubble bath, light come candles if found living around I found a towel in a cabinet, I&#39;ll go and get her some pajamas to get her comfortable. I head back out and notice her curled up in a ball, &#34;won&#39;t be too much longer just finishing up&#34; she lifted her head, slid her head aside noticing I&#39;d got her pajamas from the wardrobe. I open the bathroom door &#34;Amelia your bath is ready beautiful&#34; she walked to the bathroom her face a picture, she was in complete awe, &#34;I just wanted you to relax abit I hope you can do that for me&#34; she nodded sweetly &#34;Thank you baby&#34; &#34;I&#39;ll get us a hot drink for when you come out, would you like to watch something in bed?&#34; &#34;but how I have no TV by my bed&#34; &#34;I can make some changes&#34; flashing a wink at her. She shook her head and closed the door. I&#39;ll take that as a yes, I move her furniture around so we could both see the TV in a perfect angle from the bed, I put the kettle on and see lots of tea, chamomile tea, I laugh to myself, Ma&#39;s gonna love her. I make myself a coffee and her a tea. While waiting for Amelia to finish up I search through for a film, surely she must like chick flicks, so I just put some chick flick on pause ready for her. I checked the cupboards and found some popcorn I grabbed that and placed it on the bed. All set for a movie and chill time. Just me and my Luna.</p>
