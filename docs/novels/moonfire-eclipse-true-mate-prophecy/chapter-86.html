I don&#39;t have long and my princess will be here. I have to set everything I&#39;m motion for tomorrow. ***&#34;Thanks Mark, have you got a timescale?&#34; &#34;Sorry I can&#39;t give you an answer to that it&#39;s as her body progresses&#34;. &#34;thank you I best get back and rest&#34; &#34;if you do need me I&#39;m always a call away anyway&#34; &#34;your a diamond&#34;***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia settled into bed with her tea and a series, I need to call Jordan to get here sooner this baby won&#39;t be long and we need this over by then.***&#34;Hey bud, how&#39;s things?.&#34; &#34;Good I guess we just need you to come earlier than expected, we had a false alarm tonight I&#39;m not taking any risks, Amelia has been put on strict bedrest until this is over, so what&#39;s gone from an investigative attack to I need to finish this. Mayback will be arriving at 7am tomorrow morning?&#34; &#34;no worries I will be there before them. I can be with you in the next hour and half tops.&#34; &#34;no worries there&#39;s a room ready either way.&#34; &#34;Thanks see you shortly.&#34;***  Thats one sorted now to get everyone together in the morning to discuss our plan. Craig has taken full time security of Amelia seen as Trent is currently busy with me. I&#39;m seriously stressed now. I don&#39;t think I could focus any harder even if I wanted to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Boys I&#39;m calling a meeting in the office in the morning, Jordan will arrive in the next hour or so and Mayback will be here by 7am so any training anyone wants to get in do it before 10.30. We need plans and we need them now so think of any decent suggestions please this is now battle to the end. I don&#39;t have time to mess around your Luna is now on bedrest until she goes into labour as we had a false alarm tonight. Get your shit together and be prepared.  You got it Alpha. We will be fully prepared by the meeting. Bud things getting serious now let&#39;s get this done. *howling**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I sit and go over everything in my head replaying the last few months, punishing myself for everything I&#39;ve done, all this could have been resolved sooner if I&#39;d have taken my head out of my ass but guess what I&#39;m the type of person who only thought of himself. I start to plead with myself that I should have done something before now and just got on with things instead I was angry and wallowing in self pity. **Enough of that go check on mate.** Damon always has to have his say, atleast he didn&#39;t say he was right again for a change. I head to the bedroom, Amelia still watching her series, some FBI thing, ***&#34;Hey beautiful how are you feeling now?&#34; &#34;I&#39;m okay, a little tired but in less pain and I actually don&#39;t feel that sick now, I guess Marks meds worked&#34; &#34;I&#39;m sorry everything is going on right now, you must understand I&#39;m doing this for our pup and our future&#34; &#34;I know, I&#39;m just worried this is going to take over the whole birth of our princess&#34; &#34;believe me I&#39;m trying for it not to, I want this over more than you know&#34; &#34;I know, I love you&#34; &#34;I love you too, would you like another tea and some snacks or are you okay?&#34; &#34;I&#39;m okay Lucas thank you, I&#39;m going to try get some sleep while I still can before this little one arrives&#34; &#34;Good idea, I&#39;ll be out here while I try get some things done before I come to bed&#34;*** I lean down to Amelia and plant a kiss on her head and share my good night before heading back out. I need to think methodically and logically here if I go off on a whim it could end badly. Taking things into consideration to make sure all angles are covered, I start to make some notes on ideas and plans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while of getting some plans together I hear a knock at the door. Who on earth would be knocking at this time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Jordan you came quickly&#34; &#34;well you did say we need to get things sorted, how is Amelia?&#34;*** with a concerned look ***&#34;she&#39;s doing good, resting up now while I get some plans together&#34;*** Jordan could probably tell I feel beaten already as I scratch my head in frustration. ***&#34;look things will be fine, I was thinking the sooner the better and daylight gives us an advantage there&#39;s no where to hide, when did you say Mayback where arriving?&#34; &#34;first thing in the morning but they will need rest and food before they are able to do anything&#34;*** not understanding where he was going with this. ***&#34;I have an idea but I will need to work things out a little before I can give you strategy, I will go make some notes and plans and get some rest, you should too we are in for a possible tough fight here, I may be your secret weapon in this but doesn&#39;t mean they won&#39;t either&#34;*** unable to to bring words from my mouth knowing his words ring true, I just nod and allow him to get some rest and food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tossing and turning in bed unable to get settled I decide to go back to the lounge and put on some TV and watch some of Amelia&#39;s crime programmes. I feel myself feeling uneasy and losing my consciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Hey dear, well your still thinking more about this battle than your darling mate. I should have guessed it would be you, I&#39;m trying to make this all perfect for us but no matter what I do I can&#39;t please everyone. I know but you do need to be with your wife too. I am but once this is over we will be free of the worries and threats. Well you better get this done quickly or you will miss the most important thing in your life. The end is near my son please don&#39;t be a fool. I&#39;m trying not to.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I find myself being awoken by the boys telling me that the meeting would be in the next 30 minutes, jeepers had I been out that long, I got up and rushed to Amelia who was awake in bed having some breakfast ***&#34;Good morning beautiful, glad to see you abit more perky&#34; &#34;I guess you didn&#39;t get much sleep last night, Craig made breakfast yours is in the oven keeping warm for you&#34; &#34;Thanks Craig your a legend&#34; &#34;no worries Alpha, I have everything here covered you go to your meeting&#34; &#34;Thank you, I&#39;ll be back shortly Amelia I love you oh can you make sure you rest please&#34; &#34;not like I have much choice&#34;*** I smirk and walk out. I scoff my breakfast down along with a black coffee knowing I&#39;m going to need the energy today. I finish up and tidy myself up abit while walking through the door and head to the office where I see everyone impatiently waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Sorry to wake you bro but we need to get a move on as you said and Mayback want a kip after the meeting so everyone is well rested. I&#39;ve also organised a feast for Mayback, Jordan and the warriors at 3, the girls weren&#39;t to happy but agreed&#34;*** Mateo whispered. ***&#34;Thanks bro&#34; &#34;We got your back you needed the rest that&#39;s why we held off&#34;*** Nathan muttered on ***&#34;It&#39;s okay I just want everything over with&#34;*** sighing I go ahead and get started with the meeting.</p>
