                <p>Lucas wonders into the room happily ***&#34;beautiful I see you&#39;re ready for our date, I just need a shower for obvious reasons, I&#39;ll get some clothes on and we&#39;ll head out&#34;*** showing himself full of mud from training, ***&#34;okay, can I ask what we plan on doing?&#34; &#34;You&#39;ll see soon enough&#34;*** letting out a big grin, how come he&#39;s so happy today, he was extremely angry yesterday what changed over night? I couldn&#39;t ask I didn&#39;t want to ruin his mood. As he ready&#39;s himself I go and make myself a quick drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas and I were heading out of the pack and towards town, still trying to puzzle where on earth we were going? we come across an old Inn. As we pull into the car park, Lucas smiles even more. ***&#34;There is really nice food here, and they do a mixture of cuisine so it&#39;s basically a good all rounder.&#34; &#34;okay, your bringing me for dinner?&#34;*** stating the obvious ***&#34;yes now come Amelia&#34;*** As we get the the front desk, Lucas starts talking to the waiter, ***&#34;table under Silverstone, yeh sir come this way.&#34;*** I uttered and they ushered us out the the garden area, how beautiful it is here trying to take it all in, in all it&#39;s glory. I notice there isn&#39;t any tables laid out so where we&#39;re we going I see a small gazebo and two others already seated, as we get closer I see it&#39;s Nina and Rich. What are they doing here? I ask myself ***&#34;It&#39;s lovely to see you little one, how is everything and yes this was organised by Lucas because you and him couldn&#39;t make it to dinner last night and he doesn&#39;t want to you or us to miss time isn&#39;t that cute of him&#34;.*** Actually it was, he could have just left it but no he always take others into consideration too. ***&#34;Thank you Lucas&#34; &#34;your most welcome beautiful, anything to see my girl happy, I don&#39;t want to drag you away from your family, family is important and special I don&#39;t want to change anything you have outside of me.&#34;*** We sit and order food and have a catch up, although I do feel a little intense to say the least, He knows the danger that Jackson holds right now and we know virtually nothing of his attack plans or if any of the information this Levi is giving us is true, what if we are putting Nina and Rich at risk too by seeing them. So much going on and I can&#39;t even tell them about it they will only want me to wrapped in bubble wrap. I try to control my thoughts and get back to enjoying the time we have with the two people I look to as parents reminding myself just how much I missed them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our desert comes out and of course it&#39;s as stunning as the starter and main meal, ***&#34;this place has one amazing chef I must say&#34;*** as I tuck into my ice cream and chocolate cake. ***&#34;Amelia darling you seem distracted is there something bothering you&#34;*** I hear Nina&#39;s sweet prying voice ***&#34;Not at all Nina just alot of changes in a short time, I&#39;m still adapting.&#34;*** I attempt to reassure her ***&#34;of course you will be it&#39;s not everyday everything happening at once&#34;*** I nod  thankfully it paI&#39;d off and tuck back into my cake. As we all finish up Lucas asks for the bill and card machine and pays everything off after Rich said he would be splitting the bill, ***&#34;You got the next meal it&#39;s my fault we missed you yesterday so I&#39;ll pay and you get the next&#34;*** Rich nodded in agreement even if he did look a little insulted by Lucas&#39;s gesture, but both men left a hefty tip. we head out front and go our seperate ways as we said our goodbyes and headed out Nina&#39;s final words ringing in my ears ***&#34;your glowing darling don&#39;t worry about a thing I see he&#39;s very protective of you but if you do need a break from time to time your always welcome to come over you know that&#34; &#34;thank you it means alot&#34;***  she pulls me in tight almost to say I know somethings bothering you I&#39;m here if you need me I love them so much ***&#34;see you soon guys thank you for joining us&#34;*** Lucas uttered. We head away back towards the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we get back to the packhouse Lucas looks uneasy about something, ***&#34;Lucas what&#39;s bothering you?&#34; &#34;nothing just Da linked me while we were out he wants to see us both now so I&#39;m just wondering whats so important if I&#39;m honest&#34;*** curiosity creeping in while he lets a frown come over his gorgeous face. ***&#34;Okay, it&#39;s fine we see your Da then head up and watch a film and snuggle up for the rest of the day/evening&#34;*** smiling warmly at him to try and ease his tension and the pure perfection he is. ***&#34;sounds good, no disturbances or distractions just us yeh&#34;*** almost questioning whether or not I&#39;d be inviting anyone ***&#34;of course Lucas why would anyone want to interrupt&#34;*** he sighed came around my side where he helps me out the car like the true gentleman he is, ***&#34;let&#39;s get this over with&#34;*** I hear him muttering to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;So we are to accompany you to an event this weekend? thats all this is about?&#34;&#34;*** both mine and Lucas minds put to rest. ***&#34;As the future Alpha and Luna of this pack it is important you show your faces to make yourselves known. We leave Friday morning.&#34;*** Brandon commanded. ***&#34;This isn&#39;t just about showing your face this is an action of you will not let your problems at the pack interfere with your duties its a statment towards Jackson, I will let you know the schedule of the weekend on the way.&#34;*** His mother added generouly, Lucas is annoyed he called him to the office for this but atleast his father was happy for him to introduce me, I&#39;ve never had that kind of thing before a surprise event sounded good to me. I&#39;m excited and nervous all at the same time, apparently it&#39;s for a mating ceremony for an alliance pack. ***&#34;Lucas this will be fun, I&#39;ve never done anything like this, it sounds amazing&#34;*** I insisted ***&#34;Fine we&#39;ll go on one condition, I get free time from now until we leave to spent some time with Amelia&#34;*** smiling at his Da, ***&#34;Fine, you may but you will need to mark her before long you can&#39;t just keep her wondering around unmarked, it puts her in danger and you know it.&#34;*** both of us knew it will need to be done soon ***&#34;I will only mark her when we are both ready&#34;.*** Silence hit the room that is until his Ma butted in ***&#34;come on boys give it a rest, Lucas enjoy some quality time with Amelia and Brandon let&#39;s get a hot drink&#34;*** trying to ease the tension. His father was right though I did need to be marked but I still wasn&#39;t sure if I was ready for that, time will tell ***&#34;By the way can you organise a higher security while we are away I dont want to come back with half our pack gone.&#34;*** his father added, we just nodded in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The quality time spent together did wonders, Damon and Tara got to spend some time together too, it made them both alot more content, we spent our time cooking and baking together, and just enjoying our company. Time flew by and we were already on our way to the other pack for a ceremony there was a long drive ahead so Lucas, his Da and his Da&#39;s chief warrior would share the driving. Lucas took the first round of driving so he could cuddle up to me the rest of the way, once he jumped back to cuddle me, I could feel the sparks of his touch returning after last night safe to say we didn&#39;t get a whole lot of sleep, my body still slightly aching and my lips sore, his hand caressing my thigh just starting to arouse me again and blushing knowing everyone in the car would have smelt it with their sense of smell, he sent me a wink and says ***&#34;later beautiful&#34;.*** I felt my face flushing crimson red at his remark with everyone in the car but I just didn&#39;t want to wait until later I wanted him now, this man knows exactly how to keep me hanging, I loved it and hated it all at once. He&#39;s all I&#39;ll ever need for the rest of my life, I plant my head on his chest and nuzzle around to find my comfort spot and he places his cheek resting on my hair and plants a gentle kiss, I feel myself relaxing, and slowly getting heavier.</p>
