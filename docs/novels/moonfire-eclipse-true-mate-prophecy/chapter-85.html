                <p>I continue to sit around in the office not knowing what&#39;s going on anymore. There are complaints from the pack there is no classes for the gymnastics seen as Amelia is unable to carry out her duties there. The rest of the pack has no idea what&#39;s going on, I still don&#39;t have a chief of warriors, although I have been thinking perhaps Trent would consider this placement, that way his wife could become the other gymnastics coach, perhaps I&#39;ll have a word later. I go ahead and ring the Mayback pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Hey bro, how&#39;s all the Alpha stuff going?&#34; &#34;It&#39;s all good here, actually really peaceful for a change how about you lot?&#34; &#34;actually I&#39;m ringing to ask a favour.&#34; &#34;things gotta be bad seen as Amelia only just had some warriors out me, go ahead&#34; &#34;well we have the Jackson situation, it&#39;s becoming abit more of a problem than we origanlly thought it would, he is now recruiting more and more people from other packs some how, either way, I&#39;m still not sure on the size of the pack and won&#39;t until we go on a practice run to his hideout.&#34; &#34;I&#39;m guessing your looking for reinforements, We haven&#39;t long sent a load, yeh I think this is bigger than antipated&#34;*** I utter nervously. ***&#34;That&#39;s fine I&#39;ll come for a visit with some reinforcement we got your back.&#34; &#34; Amelia doing okay?&#34; &#34;She&#39;s okay holding up I&#39;m trying my best to keep her away from all this, she could go into labour at any given point.&#34; &#34;oh gosh understandable then, give me a few days and I&#39;ll be with you, can you make sure there are around 30 beds ready and somewhere for me and Jessie&#34; &#34;Of course, Thanks bro I owe you, catch you soon&#34;.*** That&#39;s one thing settled, now to organise the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Nikki can you come to the office please.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Short time later after me signing some paperwork *Knock Knock* ***&#34;Alpha you called me?&#34; &#34;Hey sorry Nik wasn&#39;t sure if you were busy. Could you have a word with a few of the maids and help out we need to accomodate 30 guests and sort out my old room for Cole and Jessie please?&#34; &#34;yes no problem, why? what&#39;s going on?&#34; &#34;We have reinforcements arriving and Cole and Jessie from the Mayback pack coming over&#34; &#34;Does Amelia know about all this and why now?&#34; &#34;No and I want to keep it that way until I inform her later on, there have been a few developments that she will not need to know about, I want her as calm and relaxed as she can be for now&#34; &#34;Lucas it&#39;s no good hiding things from her, you know it doesn&#39;t end well.&#34; &#34;I will be telling her but it will be me to keep her calm and worry free&#34;*** Nikki just rolls her eyes at me, she doesn&#39;t believe a word I&#39;m saying but she is right I do need to tell Amelia what is going on, perhaps tonight over dinner. ***&#34;Nikki I will be telling her even if you don&#39;t believe me&#34; &#34;okay well I&#39;ll get going and get some of the things sorted for you&#34; &#34;Thank you Nikki&#34; &#34;your welcome Alpha&#34;*** turning on her heel to leave slamming the door as she walks out. I let out a deep sigh knowing full well what all this is going to intale. I try to finish up some emails and try to get everything out the way so I can go back to Amelia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I get back and relieve Trent of his duties and inform him to meet me here in the morning to go through a few things, for now Amelia needs to know what&#39;s going on. Amelia laid on the sofa watching some mystery film, her golden eyes so exhausted yet full of love and sparkle. I sit on the floor next to her pushing her hair out of her face, she&#39;s so beautiful she looks so fragile yet deep inside so strong and determined, my soulmate, my better half. ***&#34;Dinner is in the oven for you&#34;*** she whispered ***&#34;Thank you Amelia, have you eaten?&#34; &#34;yes I&#39;ve eaten, I&#39;m just tired now&#34; &#34;you look tired but I need to run a few things over with you&#34; &#34;okay, have your dinner first I&#39;ll wait &#34; &#34;okay beautiful, would you like a cuppa?&#34; &#34;yes please&#34;*** I head to the kitchen and make us both a cuppa and heat my food. How on earth is she going to take all this in, she&#39;s so exhausted, **Lucas you have to tell her you can&#39;t hide it. I know I just hate to hype her up before bed she needs her sleep. If she finds out you&#39;ve been hiding it, it will be worse. I know.** I continue to eat my dinner in all respect she still manages to cook up a mouth watering meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sit down along side Amelia with the rest of my cuppa, ***&#34;what is it you needed to run by me?&#34;*** here goes, ***&#34;well there have been a few developments, our surveilance team haven&#39;t responded or returned, so we are just as blind as before&#34; &#34;okay so what are we doing about that?&#34; &#34;well we have presumed dead, captured or turned&#34; &#34;okay so where does that leave us?&#34;*** I can feel the worry picking up plus it&#39;s written all over her beautiful face. ***&#34;Well there is also news of 2 other packs missing a fair amount of members, Trent, the boys and me have found a possible location to where Jacksons hideout is situated.&#34; &#34;Are you seriously thinking of going in to attack them?&#34; &#34;yes Amelia but not to fight as such more of and information mission really, the final taking will be here on our grounds. We also have the help of Trents agency and some sole workers he knows of plus Mayback are sending over more soldiers including Cole and Jessie.&#34;*** Amelia&#39;s stress levels sky rocketing, I bring her into me wrapping her up, ***&#34;Amelia I want nothing more than all of this to be over, I need to protect you and our pup, I&#39;m sorry if this is putting stress on you but I can&#39;t hide it either&#34; &#34;I know and I thank you for telling me, but what if I go into labour while your out fighting, you&#39;ll miss the birth&#34; &#34;it&#39;s a price I&#39;m willing to pay for yours and our pup safety&#34;*** she just nods ***&#34;is this what&#39;s keeping your distance&#34; &#34;sorry just find it harder now, I&#39;m trying not to comprimse your safety&#34; &#34;okay just get it over with&#34;*** She continues to watch her film.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sat there watching the film together, I can feel anger brewing up inside me although it&#39;s not mine, it&#39;s Amelia&#39;s I should have expected her to be angry, I mean I don&#39;t want to miss the birth of my pup but if that means I keep them both safe and away from any harm then that I will, I am not risking their lives, I&#39;ve done enough damage as it is. I feel the guilt washing over me. I keep hurting her and she just can&#39;t see I&#39;m doing it all for her. **Yes but she needs you too not just the pack Tara isn&#39;t happy either, she&#39;s growing weak Lucas. I get it Damon no one is happy, I&#39;m not happy but I&#39;m dealing with the situation as I see fit. There is no way in hell I am compromising Amelia and my pup over some psycho I used to call my brother, the one who used to have my back no matter what, you don&#39;t think I&#39;m not struggling with this either, I&#39;ve got the love of my life next to me, I&#39;ve lost both my parents one who I killed, She is all I have left. This isn&#39;t sitting easy with me, I&#39;ve dealt with enough, I&#39;m not sacrifing anymore.** I feel the thudding in my head again, except this time I start to feel uneasy and heavy. Its got to be Ma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Lucas what on earth are you planning now?&#34;*** yep it&#39;s Ma it&#39;s her that&#39;s thudding me. ***&#34;No wait no need to tell me I already know, how many times do I need to tell your stronger connected than apart.&#34; &#34;I know but I can&#39;t put her in danger she&#39;s due anytime and all this isn&#39;t helping matters it&#39;s only going to cause more stress, I can&#39;t have her go into labour because of all this going on, I will feel even worse than I do now, please try and understand&#34; &#34;I appreciate it I do and I know you want to keep her safe, but please tell her everything, and share your feelings and listen to hers too, it only divides you when you avoid it&#34; &#34;okay I&#39;m trying my best&#34; &#34;I know you are, you must wake up now.&#34; ***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Lucas!!&#34;*** I hear screaming ***&#34;sorry beautiful I was asleep&#34; &#34;it&#39;s okay I know your tired but I think I&#39;m having contractions!!&#34;***</p>
