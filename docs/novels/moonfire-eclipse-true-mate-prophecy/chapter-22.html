                <p>I come out of the bathroom to see he&#39;s moved my TV from where it was to a perfect alignment to view the screen from the bed, he&#39;d made my tea and himself a coffee, I thought to myself won&#39;t that keep him up all night, I didn&#39;t think to question him on it. He was right about the bath though it completely relaxed me I was in there until the water was going cold. I notice he already has a film picked it and there&#39;s popcorn on the bed ready for us. This man is a gem, a rare precious one at that. &#34;Thank you, you were right about the bath it&#39;s helped alot&#34; &#34;I&#39;m glad beautiful, least I could do for you now come we&#39;ll watch a film and go to sleep, I thought you might like a chick flick but wasn&#39;t sure which one so I just put something random on hope thats okay.&#34; &#34;that&#39;s fine, it looks like you picked mamma mia which is one of my all time faves&#34; &#34;I got something right then, I hope your tea is okay I didn&#39;t know if you took sugar or anything so I just made it as I would for Ma&#34; looking nervously while I take a sip &#34;It&#39;s perfect thank you&#34; he&#39;s such a gentleman, I wouldn&#39;t change a thing about him and he always knows how to calm me down, I keep breaking into these silly tears I thought I let go of the past, I clearly didn&#39;t I just need to accept it and focus on my life and future with Lucas from now on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were some way into the movie and and I felt myself nestling into Lucas more and more, he was just so comforting, his scent filling my nose, I could feel the electricity flowing through me at a steady speed, his hand tracing lines over my back steadily just enjoying being in my presence. I don&#39;t know how much longer I can withhold from kissing him, I knew I wanted him it was just a matter of time before I can&#39;t hold back anymore. I feel my breathing getting heavier, my body aching for him, I lean up to look at him,&#34;Amelia is every..&#34; I cut him off mid sentence  just planting my lips on his,its like it  was setting off an atomic bomb inside me sparks invading each part of my body, my arousal becoming heightend, each one of my senses signalling for me, my tongue invading his mouth for his taste, he deepens the kiss and pulls me into him, I can&#39;t resist him anymore I needed this, I needed him, I just needed a release. I let out a moan while he growled in approval, &#34;you sound magnificent&#34; my body arching into him my arousal dampening through my panties, I feel his member growing hard underneath me, I wanted more, I needed more I feel his hands roaming ever inch of my back before gently caressing over my hip gently making his way to cup my breast, not once breaking from his kiss, my body responding to his every touch, I lifted his tee over his head, and moaned as he parted from my lips, I let my hand wonder over his body, feeling every muscle so defined, so tense, he has a body of a God, I moan again in satisfaction of the man in front of me, and he was all mine. He slowly breaks from our kiss, kissing over my jaw line and down my neck slowly lifting my tank top off, he sat back admiring the view, &#34;now I&#39;ll never get sick of this sight, your just perfect and it&#39;s all mine&#34;  I watch his darkeningwith lust, he comes back to kissing me and letting his tongue invade my mouth, lapping around mine, he gently bites onto my lip and plants gentle sensual kisses down my neck taking extra care where he would mark me, &#34;please&#34; I begged &#34;not yet neither of us are ready for it yet but when the time is right I will gladly take you into oblivion&#34; he continues down my chest feeling his warm breath on my hard nipples he gently licks and sucks on one while caressing the other, another moan escaping me, while he moans and growls, I can&#39;t tell if he is refraining, bringing himself back up to kiss me again I feel his hands wandering cupping my firm cheeks, making my flower ache and drip for him, I can feel the electricity running through my core, I felt his hand firmly rub over my thighs edging closer as he finally meets my dampened fabric the only thing between his hand and my flower, he groans in delight, the intensity making me grind against his hand he slowly brings his arm around me planting me in a position to have a full view, his eyes full of intensity and lust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kisses me once more while rubbing over the thin fabric making my juices keep flowing, my back arching almost begging for him to give a release, smirking at my desperation. I notice his eyes a deep grey, he brings his hand back to my flower now only to feel my excitement drowning my panties, &#34;Amelia your so inviting it&#39;s hard to resist&#34; &#34;well don&#39;t then&#34; is all I could manage as he pulls off my panties and slides his fingers over my bud, rubbing and and grinding, I let out another moan &#34;Lucas please more&#34; begging him in that instant he slides a finger in, gently pushing in and out feeling my juices flowing over him, &#34;Amelia my goddess cum for me baby&#34; as he slides in another finger I feel myself arching and moaning louder, &#34;Lucas&#34; I&#39;m almost screaming at the intensity, I can feel my orgasm building up, he ploughs in faster and harder before I could hold back anymore I feel my release flow over him he keeps going to ride out my orgasm, &#34;good girl, your so sexy when you can&#39;t control yourself&#34; smirking at me licking his fingers, &#34;you taste divine but lets find out just how divine you taste on your second&#34;</p>

I&#39;m barely over my first orgasm, sending me into a moaning frenzy again, his tongue lapping, sucking and flicking my bud, &#34;Lucas more&#34; I growl, pressing his head into me further gripping his hair. I can feel myself on the edge of another orgasm he works his tongue faster, I let a large moan as I arch myself into him he quickly slides his tongue to invade me again releasing myself over him as he continues to lick and taste my essence, my body shaking from my last orgasm trying to regain my stability as I feel myself begining to calm a little I feel exhausted, that is was incredible I could have never imagined it being so good. He smirked at my pleasure, &#34;you my goddess are incredible now it&#39;s time for some rest you look exhausted&#34; &#34;but what about you&#34; &#34;my pleasure came from pleasuring my girl, your my ecstasy to forfill you forfilled me beautiful&#34; he planted a kiss on my head, I nestled myself into his naked chest I felt my eyes getting heavier before everything went blank.</p>
