                <p>chapter FIVE: THE FIGHT</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mike, still on the phone, glanced at Williams dismissively. He finally ended the call, looking at Williams with a condescending gaze. &#34;Are you insane? Didn&#39;t you see you were on the road? Do you know I can arrest and sue you for trying to make me hit you?&#34; Mike retorted, an air of arrogance surrounding him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confused and angered by Mike&#39;s indifference, Williams couldn&#39;t hold back any longer. In a burst of hot-tempered rage, he swung a heavy blow, landing it squarely on Mike&#39;s cheek. The force of the impact sent shockwaves through Mike&#39;s face, breaking two of his teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mike, taken aback by the sudden assault, stumbled backward. Williams, fueled by a mix of anger and frustration that had been building up, stood his ground. The tension in the air crackled as the confrontation escalated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The commotion drew attention, and a few employees gathered to witness the unfolding drama. Among them was Julian, who had emerged from the front door of the office building, her expression a mix of surprise and concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rushed toward the scene, realizing that the situation had escalated far beyond a mere argument. Mike, now composed, held his bleeding mouth, glaring at Williams. Julian, worried about her husband&#39;s sudden burst of violence, demanded an explanation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mike, what happened? Why did he hit you?&#34; Julian questioned, concern etched on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mike, still recovering from the unexpected blow, explained, &#34;Julian, this man here attacked me out of nowhere. I was on a call, and he just lost control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Williams, his anger unabated, retorted, &#34;He splashed mud all over me deliberately, and when I confronted him, he insulted and threatened me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian, caught between the conflicting narratives, felt the weight of the situation. She turned to Mike. &#34;Is that true? Did you intentionally splash mud on him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mike, a smug expression on his face, responded, &#34;I don&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about. I was just driving, and he jumped at me for no reason.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension in the air heightened as the conflicting accounts hung in the balance. Julian, frustrated by the lack of clarity, decided to diffuse the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough!&#34; she exclaimed, her voice cutting through the turmoil. &#34;I don&#39;t care who started it. We&#39;re adults, and this behavior is unacceptable. Williams, control yourself, or I won&#39;t tolerate it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Williams, still seething with anger, nodded in acknowledgment. Julian then turned to Mike. &#34;And you, watch your actions. We don&#39;t need violence here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mike, now composed but nursing his injured pride, nodded in agreement. The onlookers dispersed, leaving the trio in a charged atmosphere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Julian thought she had managed to restore a semblance of order, Mike decided to further escalate the situation. He took a step toward Julian, a silver necklace in his hands. &#34;Julian, I got you a little something. It&#39;s a token of our connection,&#34; he said, attempting to shift the focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Williams, still simmering with anger, couldn&#39;t comprehend what was happening. He watched as Mike clasped the necklace around Julian&#39;s neck, a gesture that seemed more possessive than affectionate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, the unraveling of emotions reached its peak. Williams, unable to contain the turmoil within him, pounced on Mike. A scuffle ensued, with punches exchanged and chaos reigning in the parking lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amidst the struggle, Mike retrieved a necklace from his pocket and presented it to Julian. The gesture, intended to be romantic, took a surreal turn as the scuffle intensified. Julian, caught in the middle, felt a mix of confusion and distress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the situation escalated, Julian decided to intervene. She ordered the security personnel to step in and separate the two men. Williams, still fueled by anger, struggled against the hold of the security personnel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chaos in the company&#39;s parking lot left a lingering tension. As Williams retreated from the scene, Julian, torn between the conflicting narratives, found herself facing a difficult decision. The incident had escalated to a point where actions needed to be taken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated and disappointed, Julian took charge. She ordered the security personnel to contact the police and have Williams arrested for his outburst of violence. Within moments, the police arrived at the scene, and Williams was swiftly detained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The flashing red and blue lights of the police car illuminated everywhere as they handcuffed Williams and led him away. Julian, grappling with the aftermath of the chaotic situation, watched as the police car drove off, taking Williams to the station.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Williams in custody, Julian had to deal with the aftermath of the altercation. She turned her attention to Mike, who was nursing his injuries from the scuffle. Concerned for his well-being, she decided to take him to the hospital for immediate treatment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the hospital, Mike received medical attention for the broken teeth and bruises sustained during the scuffle with Williams. Julian, conflicted by the events unfolding around her, stayed by Mike&#39;s side as he underwent treatment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mike, in pain but determined, vowed to take matters into his own hands. &#34;Julian, I won&#39;t let him get away with this. I&#39;ll deal with him personally. No one attacks me and goes unpunished,&#34; he declared, his tone laced with resentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian, caught in the middle of a tangled web of emotions, listened to Mike&#39;s words with a sense of unease. She had kept her relationship with Mike a secret, knowing the complications it could bring. Now, as tensions rose, she couldn&#39;t ignore the potential consequences.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the chaos, Julian had a business obligation to fulfill. She had a meeting scheduled that very morning to sign a ten million dollar contract with a reputable company. Mike, having recovered from his injuries, insisted on accompanying her to the meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they left the hospital, Julian&#39;s mind raced with conflicting thoughts. Mike, unaware of the complexities of her personal life, remained focused on the impending business deal. Little did he know that the upcoming meeting would further complicate the delicate balance Julian had been trying to maintain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian and Mike arrived at the company&#39;s office, their expressions concealing the turmoil within. The meeting room, usually a space for professional discussions, now held an air of tension.</p>
