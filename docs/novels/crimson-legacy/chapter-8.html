                <p>chapter EIGHT: THE SECRET COMPANY</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night draped the Peterson mansion in an eerie calm, broken only by the soft hum of distant city life. Williams lay on the cool bed of the empty room at the back of the building, a sanctuary where he sought refuge from the constant turmoil within the grandeur of the mansion. It was in this space that he could momentarily escape the strife that seemed to cling to every corner of his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the night progressed, a sudden interruption pierced the silence - the ringing of Williams&#39; phone. He reached for it, his mind a canvas of curiosity and uncertainty. The voice on the other end inquired, &#34;Please, is this Mr. Williams?&#34; With an affirmative response, the caller revealed himself as Mr. Donald&#39;s personal lawyer, Barr. Clinton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lawyer expressed his desire to meet Williams the following morning at his office, providing an address and urging him to bring his ID card along. The cryptic nature of the call left Williams intrigued, and a subtle excitement stirred within him. With a nod to an uncertain fate, he agreed to the meeting and prepared for the following day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The morning light bathed the city in a gentle glow as Williams, after completing his morning chores, discreetly informed his mother that he needed to attend to some personal matters. Mrs. Angelina, accustomed to her son&#39;s occasional enigmatic ventures, accepted the explanation without prying. As Williams left the mansion, his mother assumed the reins of the household, answering Lady G&#39;s inquiries about her elusive son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Williams entered the lawyer&#39;s office, the door creaking softly behind him. The air in the room seemed to hold a gravity, as if aware of the pivotal conversation about to unfold. Barr. Clinton, sitting behind his desk, looked up and offered a welcoming smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, Mr. Williams. Please, have a seat,&#34; the lawyer gestured towards the chair opposite his desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, Barr. Clinton. Thank you,&#34; Williams responded, taking a seat and adjusting himself to the serious ambiance of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lawyer&#39;s eyes held a certain depth, as if acknowledging the weightiness of the information he was about to share. &#34;I hope you&#39;re doing well, considering the circumstances.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Williams, though uncertain about the nature of the conversation, replied with a nod. &#34;Yes, thank you. I&#39;m here as you requested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barr. Clinton, now holding a more formal tone, replied, &#34;I&#39;ll need to confirm your identity. May I see your ID card, please?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Williams, realizing the necessity, retrieved his ID card from his wallet and handed it over to the lawyer. Barr. Clinton inspected it carefully, comparing the photo and details with the person sitting before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Mr. Williams. Everything seems to be in order. Now, let&#39;s proceed with the next steps,&#34; the lawyer affirmed, returning the ID card to Williams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your dad asked me that on this date, the 20th of December, I should let you know about one of his companies before his demise,&#34; Barr. Clinton began, his tone carrying the weight of solemn responsibility. He paused, allowing the words to sink in before continuing, &#34;He built the company in your name when you were still an undergraduate. It is one of the reasons he encouraged you to study petroleum engineering. You will now become the Managing Director of &#39;WILLY OIL AND GAS.&#39; Congratulations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The revelation hung in the air, a silent acknowledgment of a legacy carefully concealed. Williams, a mix of astonishment and gratitude, managed to utter a heartfelt, &#34;Thank you, Barr. Clinton. I had no idea.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barr. Clinton, with a subtle nod, reached into his desk drawer and retrieved a folder. As he placed it on the desk before Williams, he said, &#34;These are the documents of the company. Kindly sign your signature to it. The responsibility is now yours to bear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Williams, his mind still racing, took the documents and a pen. He scanned through the legal papers, absorbing the weight of the commitment laid before him. The intricate details of the company&#39;s structure, assets, and operations unfolded before his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Questions bubbled within Williams, and he couldn&#39;t help but voice his curiosity. &#34;Why did my father keep this a secret? And why reveal it to me now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barr. Clinton leaned back in his chair, his expression grave. &#34;Your father was a man of principle. He believed that success should be earned, not inherited. He wanted you to forge your own path, to prove yourself without the shadow of his wealth. However, circumstances have changed, and he deemed it fitting for you to know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Williams processed the magnitude of his father&#39;s intentions, Barr. Clinton continued, &#34;Running &#39;WILLY OIL AND GAS&#39; is a significant responsibility. Your father built it from the ground up, and now, it&#39;s your chance to carry on his legacy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a steady hand, Williams signed the documents, his signature a pledge to uphold the integrity and vision of the company. As he handed the papers back to Barr. Clinton, a sense of purpose filled the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Barr. Clinton. I appreciate you entrusting me with this responsibility. I won&#39;t take it lightly,&#34; Williams declared, a newfound determination in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barr. Clinton, offering a reassuring smile, responded, &#34;Your father would have wanted you to succeed, Williams. Make him proud.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Williams quickly took the copies of the signed documents, and placed in a file and requested to leave, as Barr Clinton acknowledged him with a hand shake and he left, when he got home he quickly went straight to his room and kept these document in his old file bag under the bed. He decided to keep everything a secret and later looked for his mum, and founf ger preparing the lunch for the family in the kitchen, he quickly assisted her,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Mum you should be resting by now&#39; he said</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;willie my son as she fondly calls him where have you been dear?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went to Buy some fruits and veggies and i used the opportunity to barb my hair ma hope there was no trouble in my absence he asked?</p>
