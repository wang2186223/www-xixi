                <p>chapter ONE: BAD MOUTHED</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trapped in a gilded cage of humiliation, Williams endures relentless abuse from his powerful in-laws—the Petersons. His world shatters when he uncovers their darkest secret: they murdered his father for exposing a billion-dollar money laundering scheme. Inheriting a hidden oil empire, Williams transforms from a &#34;worthless son-in-law&#34; into a vengeful heir. With allies among the betrayed and oppressed, he dismantles the corrupt dynasty piece by piece. But as empires crumble and blood spills, one question remains: Can justice heal wounds forged in betrayal? A tale of ruthless ambition and redemption, where the greatest secrets are written in crimson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come over here Williams! Don&#39;t make me wait!&#34; Lady G&#39;s voice echoed through the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mrs. Gina Peterson plopped on the living room couch, flanked by her friend Mrs. Bimbo, the senator&#39;s wife. Lady G, as everyone called her, yelled for Williams to hurry up and serve them some snacks and drinks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Williams, feeling the weight of his mother&#39;s watchful eyes, scurried into the living room. &#34;Yes, ma&#39;am. What can I get for you and your guest?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lady G sneered, &#34;Don&#39;t act smart, just serve us some refreshments, and make it quick. We&#39;re not here to wait for you all day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Williams nodded silently and hurried to the kitchen to fetch the snacks and drinks for the uninvited guests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Williams hurriedly served the refreshments, Lady G and Mrs. Bimbo delved into a conversation about politics and the state of the country. Their voices filled the room, drowning out the muted TV in the background.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you heard about that new policy the government is pushing?&#34; Mrs. Bimbo asked, sipping her drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lady G scoffed, &#34;Oh, you mean that ridiculous one? It&#39;s just a ploy to distract us from the real issues.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Williams, still within earshot, discreetly listened as the women discussed the intricacies of political maneuvering. Lady G, always one to share her opinions, leaned forward on the couch, her eyes narrowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re all corrupt, if you ask me. No one cares about the common man. It&#39;s all about their pockets and power.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mrs. Bimbo nodded in agreement, &#34;Absolutely, Gina. And that senator of yours, he&#39;s not any better. I heard he&#39;s involved in some shady deals.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lady G raised an eyebrow, &#34; You mean Senator Maxwell? Well, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised. These politicians think they can get away with anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Williams, still in the kitchen, pondered the irony of their conversation. Little did they know, the very man they accused was part of the intricate web his late father had fought against.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Williams busied himself in the kitchen, the harsh tones of his name sliced through the air. &#34;Williams! Get out here!&#34; Lady G&#39;s voice, filled with disdain, echoed through the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quickly wiping his hands on a towel, Williams stepped into the living room. &#34;Yes, ma&#39;am? Is there anything else you need?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gina, with a look of sheer displeasure, pointed at the fried rice. &#34;What is this, Williams? Did I ask for a tasteless meal? Are you trying to ruin our evening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Williams could utter a word, Lady G snatched the bowl of fried rice from the table and, without a moment&#39;s hesitation, poured it over him. The rice clung to his clothes like a mockery of his efforts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s what you deserve for serving garbage!&#34; Lady G sneered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if the humiliation wasn&#39;t enough, Gina delivered two resounding slaps to Williams&#39; face. The force of the blows stung, and Williams recoiled, his cheek burning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Useless boy! How dare you ruin our meal?&#34; Gina spat out, her face contorted in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mrs. Bimbo, instead of diffusing the situation, chuckled, adding fuel to the fire. &#34;Oh, Gina, you showed him! These people need to be put in their place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere in the room was thick with tension, and Williams, his dignity shredded, stood there, absorbing the unjust punishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amidst the chaos, Gloria, one of the cleaning staff in her late thirties, rushed in with a mop and a bucket. She bent down, trying to salvage what she could from the scattered mess on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lady G&#39;s rage thundered through the room. &#34;Gloria! What are you doing here? Leave immediately! If you stay, you might lose your job!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gloria, undeterred, continued her cleaning, shooting a sympathetic glance towards Williams. &#34;I can&#39;t just leave this mess, ma&#39;am. It&#39;s my job to clean up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lady G&#39;s face turned an even deeper shade of red. &#34;I said leave, or you&#39;ll regret it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gloria hesitated for a moment, then, reluctantly, she grabbed her cleaning supplies and made her way towards the door. Before exiting, she shot Williams a reassuring look, silently conveying her sympathy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Gloria left, Lady G turned her attention back to Williams. &#34;Clean this up, and I mean now! You have two minutes, Williams. And make sure to serve us something better than this tasteless excuse for a meal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Williams, still nursing the sting on his cheek, glanced around at the scattered rice on the floor. &#34;Two minutes?&#34; he muttered to himself, incredulous. He doubted the possibility of cleaning up the entire mess and preparing a new meal in such a short time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nevertheless, he bent down, determined to fulfill Lady G&#39;s outrageous demand. The minutes ticked away, and the pressure intensified as he scrambled to clean and cook simultaneously, a task that seemed nearly impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the  living room, the aftermath of Lady G&#39;s outburst lingered like a heavy cloud. Williams, with beads of sweat forming on his forehead, wielded the broom with urgency. The task at hand seemed impossible - cleaning up the scattered rice while facing the relentless barrage of insults and curses. Mrs. Bimbo&#39;s hysterical laughter echoed, adding to the torment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Williams swept, the room became a battleground of emotions. Mrs. Bimbo, still chuckling, looked at Gina with a mix of disbelief and disapproval. &#34;Your daughter married him? My, my! I didn&#39;t attend the wedding, and now I see why.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gina, fueled by her anger, continued her tirade, sparing no words. &#34;Useless boy that calls himself my son-in-law! You bring shame to this family!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mrs. Bimbo&#39;s shock transformed into a judgmental gaze as she observed Williams. &#34;He&#39;s a mockery to this family. I don&#39;t know how I cope with him. He&#39;s nothing but a burden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The insults hurled at Williams cut deep. He couldn&#39;t escape the relentless barrage, and with each word, the weight on his shoulders grew heavier. As he swept near Mrs. Bimbo&#39;s legs, she visibly shifted away, her tone sharp with warning, &#34;Don&#39;t hurt me with that broom!&#34; She tapped him angrily on the back, a gesture that further fueled the humiliation.</p>
