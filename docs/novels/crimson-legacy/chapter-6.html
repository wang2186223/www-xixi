                <p>chapter SIX: THE CONTRACT</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they awaited the arrival of the representatives from the contracting company, Julian and Mike engaged in a hushed conversation. Mike, still nursing the wounds from the previous night, expressed his determination to confront Williams and seek retribution.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian, uneasy about the turn of events, tried to divert Mike&#39;s attention from revenge. &#34;Let&#39;s focus on the business deal, Mike. We can deal with personal matters later,&#34; she urged, her words a delicate attempt to manage the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The representatives from the contracting company arrived, and the meeting commenced. Julian, a master of composure, navigated the discussions with a practiced ease. Mike, although physically present, remained preoccupied with thoughts of retaliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the meeting progressed, Julian felt the weight of the choices she had made. Her secret relationship with Mike, hidden from her husband Williams, had led to a series of events that now threatened to unravel. The impending contract signing hung in the balance, with the tension between the trio escalating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The contracting company&#39;s representatives, unaware of the personal drama unfolding, focused on the business at hand. Julian, determined to salvage the situation, signed the contract with a sense of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Williams was ushered into the backseat, the onlookers couldn&#39;t resist expressing their disdain. &#34;So this is the rubbish our director married?&#34; one worker whispered to another, the words carrying through the night air like a venomous hiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the police car, Williams, still grappling with the aftermath of the scuffle, sat in silence. The officers accompanying him exchanged knowing glances, their expressions a blend of indifference and judgment. The vehicle pulled away from the company&#39;s premises, leaving behind a trail of murmurs and mocking whispers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the police station, the atmosphere was charged with tension. The workers who had followed the unfolding drama eagerly anticipated the continuation of the spectacle. Williams was escorted inside, and the police officers, seemingly uninterested in hearing his side of the story, acted with swift authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The holding cell, a cold and dimly lit room, became Williams&#39; temporary confinement. The echoing laughter of the workers outside served as a cruel reminder of the public humiliation he now faced. The police, influenced by Mike&#39;s connections, showed no leniency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Williams&#39; mother, Mrs. Angelina Donald, received the distressing call from the police. Her heart sank as she listened to the officer narrate the events that had led to her son&#39;s arrest. Without hesitation, she made her way to the police station, her worry etched on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon arrival, Mrs. Angelina was met with the stern faces of the police officers. The situation seemed dire, and her attempts to reason with them fell on deaf ears. The officers insisted on holding Williams without a proper hearing, driven by the influence exerted by Mike, who had connections with the police hierarchy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to secure her son&#39;s release, Mrs. Angelina opted to bail him out. However, even the bail process was marred by mistreatment. As she paid the required amount, the police, under the invisible hand of Mike, subjected Williams to a beating within the confines of the station.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blows landed on Williams, a vulnerable target in police custody, served as a gruesome testament to the power dynamics at play. Mrs. Angelina, horrified by the brutality, demanded an explanation, but her pleas fell on deaf ears. The police, acting under the orders of an influential figure, showed no remorse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the chaos unfolded, Mrs. Angelina managed to secure her son&#39;s release. The door of the police station creaked open, and Williams emerged, visibly battered and bruised. The night air, which had carried whispers of mockery earlier, now bore witness to the aftermath of injustice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together, mother and son left the precinct, their heads held high despite the physical and emotional toll everything. Mrs. Angelina, a pillar of strength for her family, guided Williams towards a humble abode across the city - a small hut where she lived alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The journey to the secluded dwelling was silent, each step echoing the weight of the recent ordeal. Mrs. Angelina opened the door to the modest hut, revealing a space that, though humble, radiated warmth and familiarity. It was a refuge from the storm outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Mrs. Angelina tended to her son&#39;s wounds, her touch gentle yet filled with a mother&#39;s concern. Williams winced at the pain, both physical and emotional, but he found solace in the unconditional love offered by his mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>mother and son engaged in a conversation that transcended words. Mrs. Angelina, aware of the complexities surrounding her family, sought to understand the events that had led to the violent altercation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Williams, recounting the sequence of events, shared the challenges he had faced since entering the Peterson family. The disdain from Lady G and the relentless humiliation had taken a toll on his spirit. He spoke of the betrayal by Kunle, the family&#39;s business dealings,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mrs. Angelina, absorbing the weight of her son&#39;s experiences, offered words of comfort. &#34;You are your father&#39;s son, Williams. Remember his legacy and the integrity he instilled in you. We will weather this storm together,&#34; she reassured him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mrs. Angelina sighed, her gaze fixed on a point beyond the humble walls of the hut. &#34;Williams, my son, I never imagined things would come to this. Kunle, your own uncle, has taken everything we once had. Your father&#39;s legacy, the family businesses - all gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Williams listened intently, the weight of his mother&#39;s words sinking in. &#34;But, Mom, Dad always said the companies were for the family. How could Kunle take everything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bitter smile played on Mrs. Angelina&#39;s lips. &#34;Your father&#39;s intentions were noble, but we never put it down in writing. Kunle has manipulated the situation to his advantage. He claims he earned it, worked for it, but he forgets the principles your father stood for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sense of betrayal hung heavy in the air. Williams clenched his fists, a mixture of anger and helplessness coursing through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization of the gravity of their situation settled between them. The family, once united by a shared legacy, now found itself fractured and vulnerable. Mrs. Angelina took a deep breath, her voice laced with determination. &#34;We may have lost the businesses, but we haven&#39;t lost our dignity. We&#39;ll find a way to reclaim what&#39;s rightfully ours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Williams nodded, a flicker of hope rekindling in his eyes. &#34;We can&#39;t let Kunle get away with this. Dad&#39;s legacy deserves better.&#34;</p>
