                <p>chapter THREE: VERY TIRED</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the living room that evening, the ambiance seemed to soften as Julian and Lady G settled on the ornate couch. The air, once heavy with tension, now held a tentative calm. Lady G, clad in an elegant gown, looked at Julian, her eyes carrying a mix of curiosity and reservation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian took a deep breath, choosing her words carefully. &#34;Mom, I&#39;ve been wanting to talk to you about Beauty Wears Boutique. I&#39;ve been putting in a lot of effort, and there&#39;s an exciting development.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lady G, maintaining a composed demeanor, raised an eyebrow. &#34;And what might that be, Julian?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a hopeful glint in her eyes, Julian shared, &#34;Tomorrow, I&#39;ll be signing a ten-million-dollar contract with a prominent company in town. It&#39;s a big step for the boutique, and I believe it could elevate it to new heights.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lady G&#39;s expression softened, surprise and interest replacing skepticism. &#34;Ten million dollars? That&#39;s quite substantial. Tell me more about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Encouraged by her mother&#39;s newfound openness, Julian elaborated on the details of the contract, emphasizing the potential for growth and success. Lady G, though initially reserved, began to show genuine interest in her daughter&#39;s endeavors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been working hard to make Beauty Wears Boutique a success, Mom. Dad believed in me, and I want to honor his trust,&#34; Julian explained, her tone a mix of determination and warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lady G, for the first time, acknowledged Julian&#39;s efforts. &#34;Your father did see something in you. If you believe this venture will bring success, then I support you. I&#39;m proud of what you&#39;ve achieved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sense of relief washed over Julian, and a genuine smile touched her lips. &#34;Thank you, Mom. Your support means a lot to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lady G, perhaps realizing the significance of their moment, nodded. &#34;Just remember, success comes with challenges. But if you&#39;re willing to face them, then I&#39;ll stand by you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As their conversation shifted to more positive topics, the living room became a space where understanding and support bridged the gap between mother and daughter. Lady G, no longer dismissive, expressed genuine curiosity about Julian&#39;s plans for the boutique.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment of shared excitement about the boutique&#39;s prospects, Lady G&#39;s expression grew contemplative. With a hint of hesitation, she broached a different topic. &#34;Julian, there&#39;s something I need to discuss with you. It&#39;s about Williams.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian, curious and a bit apprehensive, looked at her mother. &#34;What about Williams, Mom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lady G took a deep breath, as if preparing for a delicate revelation. &#34;I had an encounter with him yesterday, and it was quite embarrassing. He was supposed to serve me and Mrs. Bimbo some refreshments, but things took an unexpected turn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian furrowed her brow, concerned. &#34;What happened, Mom? Why was it embarrassing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lady G continued, her tone measured. &#34;Well, he brought out a dish, and Mrs. Bimbo claimed it was tasteless. Instead of handling the situation calmly, Williams seemed flustered. He spilled the fried rice on himself, and Mrs. Bimbo made a scene, pouring the contents of her plate on him. It was quite humiliating.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s eyes widened in surprise and concern. &#34;Oh no, that sounds awful. I&#39;m sorry you had to go through that, Mom. I&#39;ll talk to Williams about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lady G nodded, a mix of frustration and disappointment evident in her expression. &#34;I understand that he might be going through challenges, but embarrassing me in front of guests is unacceptable. We need to ensure he doesn&#39;t repeat such behavior.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the kitchen, late at night, Williams finished getting things ready for the next morning. The smell of spices filled the air as he prepared breakfast for the Peterson household.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Checking the clock on the kitchen wall, Williams saw that it was already 11:48 pm. Feeling tired from a long night of work, he decided it was time to go to bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quietly, he went to the bedroom he shared with his wife, Julian. Opening the door carefully so as not to disturb the silence of the night, he saw Julian sleeping on the big bed. Williams hesitated for a moment, looking at the comfortable bed, but he knew he couldn&#39;t disturb Julian. The last time he tried to share the bed, she kicked him out and warned him never to get too close again. Since then, he slept on a mat on the floor. It didn&#39;t bother him much, so he spread the mat and lay down to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later in the night, Mrs. Gina Peterson, Julian&#39;s mother, walked towards her daughter&#39;s room. She discovered Williams still sleeping on the floor. In a hurry, she went to the kitchen, got a bowl of water, and poured it on him, saying, &#34;Wake up, you lazy fool! It&#39;s already 5:00 am, and you&#39;ve forgotten your duties in this house.&#34; Williams woke up, shocked and wet. Julian, awakened by the noise, joined her mother in insulting him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, you were still sleeping?&#34; Julian asked with disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Williams, trying to explain, said, &#34;I didn&#39;t realize it was morning already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mrs. Gina scolded him, &#34;You&#39;re becoming a problem in this house, Williams. It&#39;s time you remember your responsibilities and act like a man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scolding continued, making Williams feel humiliated. Mrs. Gina told him to clean up the mess and prepare a proper breakfast, saying they couldn&#39;t afford any more of his mistakes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Williams, wet and embarrassed, nodded silently. He began cleaning the wet floor, feeling the weight of the night&#39;s events.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the clock ticked towards breakfast time, Williams carefully arranged the dining table, ensuring everything was in its proper place. The clinking of cutlery and the gentle rustle of napkins filled the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mrs. Gina Peterson entered the kitchen, eyeing Williams with a scrutinizing gaze. &#34;Make sure everything is perfect, Williams. We can&#39;t afford any more mistakes,&#34; she instructed, her tone carrying a hint of skepticism.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Williams, though exhausted, nodded in acknowledgment. &#34;Yes, ma&#39;am. I&#39;ll ensure everything is in order,&#34; he replied, focusing on the task at hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the table was set, Mrs. Gina called out to Julian, who appeared in the doorway, ready for the day ahead. &#34;Julian, breakfast is served. Come and join us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The family gathered at the dining table. The air was thick with an unspoken tension as they sat down, each occupied with their own thoughts. Williams, maintaining his composure, served the dishes with precision, making sure to cater to everyone&#39;s preferences.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they began eating, the room was filled with the clatter of cutlery against plates. Mrs. Gina, ever observant, scrutinized Williams&#39; every move, ready to pounce on any perceived error.</p>
