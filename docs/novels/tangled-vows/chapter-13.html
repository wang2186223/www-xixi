                <p>&#34;Tapiwa, baby,&#34; Asher said in greeting with a wide smile when she reached the table he had been seated at, waiting for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like a gentleman, he stood up and pecked her cheek before guiding her to the chair on the other side of the small, two-seater table. If Asher noticed how stiff Tapiwa was, he didn&#39;t let on. Instead, he kept the smile firmly on his face and once she was seated, he walked over to the counter to place their orders, leaving Tapiwa alone with her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the next minute, Tapiwa sat still, trying to gather every ounce of courage she possessed as she listened to Asher&#39;s distant voice as he gave their order for drinks and a large chicken barbeque pizza. He hadn&#39;t bothered to ask her what she wanted, but that was fine. Tapiwa didn&#39;t want anything. She just wanted to get this over and done with so she could move on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For what felt like the hundredth time in the past half hour, Tapiwa felt her gut twist with dread. Something told her this day wouldn&#39;t end as pleasantly as she hoped. Asher had been too persistent in his need to see her. Finally, Tapiwa had caved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicole thought it was for the best. &#39;Rip it off like a strip of wax on your V,&#39; her friend had said. &#39;There is no reason to baby it. It&#39;s coming off and there is only one way to do it.&#39; That was easier said than done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Tapiwa thought she could have gotten away with it with a simple text message, that was the route she would have chosen. Unfortunately, she had to do this face-to-face. She didn&#39;t want Asher turning up at her parents&#39; house, demanding an explanation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least she&#39;d had the choice of where they met for this dreaded talk. Tapiwa had picked a very open and busy pizzeria at the mall. At this time of the day, the place was packed, almost every table both inside and outside occupied by patrons who chatted and laughed among themselves. Not the best place to hold a private conversation, but the perfect location to avoid a scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took Tapiwa a moment to realize that Asher was back at their table and silently watching her. Tapiwa met his gaze and fought the urge to squirm in her seat. She clasped her hands together on her lap, out of sight, and squeezed her fingers tightly to distract herself from the blood pumping in her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a beat, Asher let out a heavy sigh. Then he lifted a hand and waved it lightly between them. &#34;What is this, Tapiwa? I feel like you have been avoiding me. Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, it seemed Asher wasn&#39;t as thick as Tapiwa had feared. The man had noticed her attempts and wasn&#39;t going to beat about the bush. Suddenly, Tapiwa wished their drinks were at the table already so she could buy herself a few seconds and wet her now dry throat. No such luck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa cleared her throat. &#34;I think we need to talk,&#34; she managed to croak out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher arched an eyebrow. &#34;The famous words that started every breakup,&#34; he deadpanned. After a beat, he tilted his head to the side. All manner of humor had faded from his features. &#34;Are you breaking up with me, Tapiwa?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rip it off like wax, Tapiwa thought. &#34;Uhm. Actually Yes. I feel Uhm. This is not working out for me.&#34; Damn. Tapiwa inwardly cringed at how shaky her voice came out. She would have gladly welcomed hot waxing on every inch of her body rather than be seated across from Asher at that very moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tense silence fell over their table. Tapiwa didn&#39;t dare lift her gaze from the brown smudge of dirt on the table in front of her. She could feel his eyes on her, could almost swear she heard his teeth grind together. Was he upset? Why?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had only been dating for a few months. Nothing serious had taken place. As far as Tapiwa was concerned, this was supposed to be a relatively easy breakup. They hadn&#39;t invested their entire lives into it for years, for heaven&#39;s sake. But it seemed that wouldn&#39;t matter to Asher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are actually breaking up with me?&#34; A heavy dose of disbelief hung on every word Asher spoke. Then he chuckled, and the sound sent shivers down Tapiwa&#39;s spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up and met Asher&#39;s gaze. The man she saw wasn&#39;t the same charming guy she had met over three months ago. Something dark lurked in his gaze and it gave Tapiwa pause. It certainly made her rethink her approach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Asher,&#34; she hesitated. &#34;I like you. Really. But Uhm. I think we would be better off as friends and nothing more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa blinked. Somehow, she hadn&#39;t expected that question. She licked her dry lips and dropped her eyes back on the table. There was still enough chatter and movement around them to drown out their conversation and fill the tense silence. Yet, for some reason, Tapiwa felt as though she was alone with Asher on a cliff&#39;s edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want an explanation as to why I can&#39;t be in a relationship with you?&#34; Tapiwa asked cautiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher tilted his head, eyes narrowed, studying her. &#34;It&#39;s not that you can&#39;t You don&#39;t want to be in a relationship with me. Is this about the night at the party?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa&#39;s back stiffened as though a red hot rod had just been introduced. He didn&#39;t know, she reminded herself. Asher couldn&#39;t know she had slept with his brother. He wouldn&#39;t be so cool and composed if he did. &#34;What about that night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher scoffed. He then looked around them for a beat as though he suddenly remembered they were in public. When his eyes fell back on Tapiwa, they were several degrees colder. &#34;You have been acting weird since that night. What? Are you judging me for having a little fun? It&#39;s not good enough for your uptight personality?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t say that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, but that&#39;s what you are saying, isn&#39;t it?&#34; Asher sneered. &#34;&#39;This is not working out for me&#39;,&#34; he repeated in a mocking tone, glaring at Tapiwa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa shook her head, unable to comprehend this side of Asher. She had guessed he probably wouldn&#39;t like the idea that she was breaking up with him. But she hadn&#39;t for a second thought he would be bitter and try to make everything so ugly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Asher, breakups happen. Not all relationships work out and turn into lifelong commitments,&#34; she tried to rationalize.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t flatter yourself, sweetheart,&#34; Asher snapped. &#34;I wasn&#39;t proposing marriage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa flinched as though she had just been slapped. Suddenly, she didn&#39;t care enough to sit there and listen to Asher turn into an arrogant jerk. Maybe the guy had never been dumped before and his ego was bruised. Well, tough luck. She wasn&#39;t going to hold his hand and take everything he wanted to dish out until he felt on top of the world again. She stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where the hell do you think you are going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa didn&#39;t answer. Again, she was pleased with herself for picking a public place for this fiasco. Asher could be pissed and ready to throw a tantrum. But the tables full of people around them prevented that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wanting to give him a chance to follow her out or something, Tapiwa hurried out of the pizzeria, uncaring if she looked crazy. She just had to get out of there and put everything behind her. Now that her relationship with Asher was over, nothing was stopping her from doing just that.</p>
