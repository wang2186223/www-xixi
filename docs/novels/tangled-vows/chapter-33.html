                <p>Jadon was familiar with the term &#39;all hell broke loose&#39; but he was sure he had never personally experienced an event that warranted its use. Not until tonight, that is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pandemonium. It was another word that crossed his disoriented brain as Jadon tried to make sense of what had just happened. One moment he was riding an orgasm high so great that he was contemplating taking Tapiwa back with him to his house so he could do it all over again but this time on a bed and with more finesse. He was sure they could go a few more rounds before exhaustion took over and their bodies demanded sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then the door behind him opened and shit hit the fan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his semi-hard cock still buried deep inside Tapiwa&#39;s body, it took him a second to realize what was happening. It had been a second too long. Before he knew it, Jadon found himself out of the car, dragged off Tapiwa&#39;s warm body by a pair of rough hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like a bag of stones, Jadon landed with a painful thud on the cold, hard tarmac. Pain immediately radiated all along his left side which had taken the impact. Jadon groaned but he didn&#39;t move to defend himself just yet. He was more concerned with tucking his cock back into his trousers before their attacker got any ideas. Unfortunately, their attacker wasn&#39;t going to wait for him to get decent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You son of a bitch!&#34; Rage hung off the words foretelling of what was to come. Jadon didn&#39;t have to wait long to find out. A second later, Jadon felt the first punch to his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn. Whoever had hit him had fists like sledgehammers, Jadon thought as his head whipped back sharply from the impact. He immediately tasted the coppery taste of his own blood as his teeth nipped the inside of his cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next punch was to his abdomen. Or had it been a kick? Jadon wasn&#39;t sure. There was just sudden, intense pain that joined the dizzying buzz in his head from the first hit. Everything blended, making it difficult to process what was happening. The only thing he was sure of at that moment was that the fists hitting him belonged to a very angry man. Jadon was also sure he would be killed if he didn&#39;t get up soon and defend himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How dare you!?!&#34; the man shouted again before another blow landed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shit! That one felt twice as hard and Jadon fell flat to the ground, coughing and groaning as more pain assaulted him. Okay. This wasn&#39;t his finest moment, he thought after a handful of seconds. But he wasn&#39;t going to be some man&#39;s punching bag. Being caught off guard was one thing. Allowing himself to be reduced to nothing but a bleeding mess was something completely unacceptable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, while still feeling as though he couldn&#39;t draw a full breath into his lungs without coughing out a lung, Jadon pushed to his feet. That earned him another blow to the head that nearly sent him back down on his ass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he heard Tapiwa scream. &#34;No! Dad. Stop. You will kill him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dad? Well shit, Jadon thought with dread. That explained the rage he felt radiating off the man in buckets. Jadon had been discovered balls deep inside Tapiwa in the back of his car by her father. Damn. Talk about the worst timing in history.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second, Jadon almost burst out laughing. Not out of humor, just the awkwardness of the situation. Thankfully, he swallowed it down fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just then, someone brushed past him and it took Jadon a second to realize that it was Tapiwa. She stumbled out of the car and stood between him and her father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, stop!&#34; A loud cry followed the words mixed in with the sound of skin being smacked hard. Despite his pain, Jadon jerked upright just in time to catch Tapiwa stumbling back into him. He realized that her father had hit her and just like that, Jadon&#39;s anger spiked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jadon maneuvered Tapiwa to stand behind him, away from her father. Then he finally took a good look at the man who had almost beaten him to a pulp. And would probably still do it judging by the fury that burned in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking in the man&#39;s features, Jadon saw that the resemblance was obvious between father and daughter even though the man&#39;s skin was darker and he wore a severe scowl on his face. Jadon also immediately concluded he was in trouble if the man charged at him again. Jadon wasn&#39;t weak, although he never made it a habit to get into brawls. But even he could admit that the man standing in front of him wouldn&#39;t be easy to take down. For a man who should have been well into his sixties, Mr. Mvula looked to be in very good shape with lean, hard muscles clearly hardened by physical work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was also the small matter that Mr. Mvula had every right to be upset. No father wanted to find his daughter being fucked in the backseat of a car right in front of his house. Okay, Jadon mentally cringed. He had messed up. Again. And this time he had no one to blame but himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a commotion at the front of the house snapped all their attention. Jadon watched as two women and a young man about his age poured out of the Mvula house and rushed toward them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The older of the two women immediately moved to stand next to Mr.Mvula and Jadon hazarded a guess that she was the wife. Tapiwa&#39;s mother. Which meant the others had to be Tapiwa&#39;s siblings. Great. The whole family was there now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Allen,&#34; what&#39;s going on?&#34; Mrs. Mvula asked quietly, her frowned gaze fixed on Jadon and Tapiwa who hadn&#39;t stepped out from behind him despite everyone being able to see her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allen Mvula flexed his fisted hand. His face twisted into an even uglier scowl of disgust before the raw emotion coated the words that left his mouth. &#34;Why don&#39;t you ask your daughter?&#34; But before his wife could ask Tapiwa, the man seemed to grow impatient and blurted out, &#34;I found your daughter being fucked right in front of my house!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shocked gasps echoed around them. Every eye fell on Jadon and Tapiwa. Jadon felt Tapiwa&#39;s hands fist into the back of his shirt. She was shaking. The tremors were so strong they vibrated through him. Jadon wasn&#39;t sure what to do. This was one of those situations he had never thought he would ever find himself in. So, he kept his mouth shut, which only seemed to fuel Allen&#39;s rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The older man pointed a shaking finger at Jadon. &#34;You have destroyed my daughter!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jadon clenched his teeth together to stop his impulsive response from slipping out. He hadn&#39;t destroyed anyone&#39;s daughter. He and Tapiwa had sex. They were two consenting adults. The location had been wrong, he agreed, but Jadon thought Mr. Mvula was being a little over dramatic. Unfortunately, the rest of his family didn&#39;t think so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa&#39;s mother began to sob, nodding her head in agreement with her husband. &#34;How could you, Tapiwa? You have ruined everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No decent man would ever marry you!&#34; Allen bellowed. He took a step toward them and Jadon reacted by taking a step back, still using his body to shield Tapiwa. That made her father&#39;s glare turn murderous. &#34;This is your fault. You corrupted my daughter and now she is as valuable as a prostitute at the corner of the street!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, I don&#39;t think-&#34; Jadon started before the words were cut short by another punch aimed at his face. He dodged it. Damn it. Jadon understood the old man was pissed but he wasn&#39;t going to stand there and take a beating for free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allen&#39;s chest heaved, clearly pissed he hadn&#39;t landed another blow. He raised the finger again. &#34;I will not be put to shame.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pure dread washed over Jadon. He didn&#39;t need a magic crystal to know he wasn&#39;t going to like what came out of the older man&#39;s mouth next. He was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are going to marry my daughter.&#34;</p>
