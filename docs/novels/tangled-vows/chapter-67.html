                <p>Jadon wasn&#39;t sure what was happening. One moment he had been reeling from everything his mother had confessed to and just wanted to get the hell out of there, and the next, he was engaged in a fistfight right in the middle of the police station with Lute Mvula.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa&#39;s brother had stormed into the station, took one look at Jadon&#39;s hand around Tapiwa&#39;s wrist, and snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck! It seemed Lute would always catch him at a bad time. It was the second fight of the day and Jadon&#39;s body was already in a considerable amount of pain. For heaven&#39;s sake, he only had one eye to look through and keep track of what his opponent was doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lute went for his midsection, delivering two solid hits before Jadon was able to block and then return the favor with a strike to the ribs. His opponent grunted and stumbled a step back as though to catch his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s when Jadon caught sight of Tapiwa. She hadn&#39;t gone far when things got physical. Like the crazy, fearless woman Jadon was slowly coming to realize she was, she jumped onto her brother&#39;s back. The weight was so sudden that Lute staggered. Then he twisted and tried to dislodge her, but she held on like a crazy feline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More commotion joined the madness as officers finally reached them and had to first pry Tapiwa off her brother&#39;s back before they held Lute down when he tried to go after Jadon again. An officer grabbed Jadon&#39;s arm, but there was no need. Jadon had no intention of testing out more of his fighting skills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took another handful of minutes for things to finally quiet down. By then, Jadon realized they had a full audience, phone cameras included. He also noted that his father was standing next to him while the rest of Tapiwa&#39;s family was standing next to Lute, who had been handcuffed and was trying to argue his way out of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes swept the crowd, looking for Tapiwa. He nearly stormed across the space when he saw the officer holding Tapiwa, trying to lead her to her father. Allen Mvula stood like an imposing drill sergeant, demanding for Tapiwa to go to him. Thankfully, Tapiwa shook off the hold the officer had on her and quickly made her way to Jadon&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Needing a physical connection more than anything else, Jadon ignored the pain radiating throughout his entire body and pulled Tapiwa&#39;s body against his. He arranged her so her back was to his front and then just wrapped his arms around her and held on. Jadon wasn&#39;t sure how much longer he would be able to stay on his feet, but he planned to hold on for as long as he could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, the move acted like a spark to a can of gasoline for the Mvulas. Allen snarled, his hands balled into fists at his sides. &#34;Tapiwa! Get the hell away from that man and come here. Right. Now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa didn&#39;t move even as a deadly silence fell over the entire station. The detective that had been handling their case looked from Tapiwa and Jadon to the Mvulas. It looked like a man with a thousand questions, but he didn&#39;t voice them. Not yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, it was Lewis who spoke, addressing Allen. &#34;Mr. Mvula, I think you should calm down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allen looked as though he had been insulted. &#34;Don&#39;t tell me to calm down! You should tell your stupid son to let go of my daughter. Your family has humiliated me enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lewis half turned his head and locked eyes with Jadon. For a moment, he wondered if his father was about to order him to let Tapiwa go. Not that it would have made a difference. Jadon had no plans to let Tapiwa go. Unless it was what she wanted and even then, he wasn&#39;t sure he would be able to do it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to his surprise, his father turned back to Allen and said the last thing he&#39;d expected. &#34;Your daughter isn&#39;t a minor. I think it&#39;s safe to say she can make her own decision in this matter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That had obviously been the wrong answer because Allen Mvula stepped forward like a man about to punch someone. That was until the police detective stepped in his path. &#34;I have already arrested your son, sir. I have no trouble putting you in the same cell if you start more trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allen&#39;s jaw worked. He narrowed his eyes on the detective but obviously knew that was a fight he wasn&#39;t going to win. So, instead, he turned back to Tapiwa. &#34;If you know what is good for you, young lady, you will step away from that man and come home with me right this second.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that a threat?&#34; The detective cut in sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you threatening your daughter, sir?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allen looked genuinely confused. &#34;She&#39;s my daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The detective nodded. &#34;Agreed. But that does not give you the right to threaten or harm her in any way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa trembled in Jadon&#39;s hold. But then, as though sensing she was finally in a safe environment, she spoke up. &#34;I&#39;m not going back with you, Dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t do this,&#34; Miranda suddenly cut in, stepping forward. She looked at her daughter imploringly. &#34;Do what your father says and let&#39;s go home. We can fix this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears ran down Miranda&#39;s face and Jadon sensed more than felt the fight begin to drain out of Tapiwa. Anger rose in Jadon. She was being manipulated with tears and the promise of family, but he didn&#39;t believe everything would be &#39;fixed&#39; if she just went back home. Her father wanted her to marry an old man from the church to restore his family&#39;s honor. Jadon couldn&#39;t let that happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a firm grasp on what was most important to him, Jadon didn&#39;t hesitate. He released his hold on Tapiwa and immediately heard her shocked gasp. In a heartbeat, she turned her face to stare at him with wide, confused eyes. She thought he was letting go of her so she could go with her family, but that was the furthest thing from the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before more doubt crept into her mind, Jadon turned her around so their fronts were now touching. Then he firmly but gently cupped her face and kissed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time seemed to stand still. It wasn&#39;t smooth as far as kisses they&#39;d had went. It wasn&#39;t even urgent or steaming. No, this kiss was gentle and slow, and yet Jadon felt it all over his body. He felt electrocuted and wrapped in the warmest, softest caress ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, everyone and everything else, including the pain, faded into the background. He felt her hands gently crawl up his sides before she curled her fingers in his shirt as though she was trying to stop him from vanishing on her. Like that could happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, like all good things, the bubble popped and Jadon heard Allen&#39;s voice cutting through the air like a trumpet of doom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get your filthy hands off my daughter!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the struggle in the man&#39;s tone, Jadon assumed he was being held back, and he was grateful. Then a throat cleared next to them and Jadon felt Tapiwa tense in his hold. Reluctantly, Jadon pulled his mouth away and met his father&#39;s studying gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lewis looked from Jadon to Tapiwa and back. After a beat, he asked, &#34;What are you doing, son?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was an easy question to answer. Jadon almost grinned. Of course, he was staking his claim, but that wasn&#39;t the response his father was looking for and he still had Allen Mvula to deal with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man in question was still struggling with the police and demanding Tapiwa walk over to him right this second. Tapiwa didn&#39;t so much as move an inch. She stayed glued to Jadon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, clearing his throat, Jadon said to his father and all those within hearing range. &#34;Telling the world I want Tapiwa and I&#39;m going to marry her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a second of silence, and then Allen shouted like a deranged man. &#34;Over my dead body!&#34;</p>
