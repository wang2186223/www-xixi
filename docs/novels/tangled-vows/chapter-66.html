                <p>The detective arched a brow and folded his arms across his chest. &#34;That&#39;s not happening, Mrs. Paterson. Your son is being charged with criminal trespass, vandalism, reckless endangerment, assault and battery, and unlawful discharge of a firearm. That is before we come to the fact that he is under investigation for blackmail, stalking, and many other charges that have been brought to our attention.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time the detective was done listing the charges, Angela looked ready to blow. Her face took on a darker shade, jaw clenched hard. &#34;My son would never do any of that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are right,&#34; Lewis suddenly cut in, snapping everyone&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa&#39;s eyes narrowed. She wondered if the man was also about to defend Asher and throw all the accusations on Jadon. Tapiwa hadn&#39;t known how bad the family relations were until today and she couldn&#39;t help comparing it to her own family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her parents were not perfect. Hell, her father was trying to marry her off to an old widower and her mother had no backbone to stand up to her husband, but still, the Petersons&#39; situation seemed far more explosive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lewis turned on his wife. &#34;You are the one behind everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Angela and Jadon both said at the same time with equal shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lewis looked at his son. &#34;I found out who was using my account to pay the stalker.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence fell as the pieces slowly fell into place. This time, when the detective suggested they take the conversation somewhere more private, Angela didn&#39;t argue. So, within minutes, they were all in an office that had all the makings of a low-paying government employment look, joined by two more officers who stood against the wall like sentries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The detective turned to Mr. Paterson. &#34;Sir, perhaps you may start by explaining what you found out. Your son only informed us of your connection to the man they chased, whom they believe was a stalker.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa didn&#39;t miss the disapproving side eye the detective gave them. The man had already expressed his thoughts on their decision to deal with matters on their own. But what was done was done, and they had more important things to focus on. Like finally finding out who was behind the blackmail and the entire mess that had turned their likes upside down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lewis removed a flash drive from his pocket and handed it over to the detective. &#34;Everything is there. I had my accountant compile all the evidence. It will show that my wife, Angela, used my account to pay the man believed to be the stalker and several other payments that I suspect will lead to evidence of her buying drugs and covering up her son&#39;s messes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though they had all obviously already concluded that Angela was involved, they all looked at her with a mixture of shock and disappointment. None of which seemed to faze the woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like a regal queen who believed she was above the law, she lifted her chin and sneered at them all before her eyes landed on Jadon, and the hatred in her eyes intensified. &#34;I don&#39;t care if you now know. I still got what I wanted. You lost the CEO position that should have always been Asher&#39;s, and your reputation is worthless. You will never make anything without the taint of those pictures ruining everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jadon shook his head, seemingly out of words. His mouth opened and closed several times, but nothing came out. Thankfully, the detective was there to ask the relevant questions. &#34;Why? Why would you destroy your own son?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Angela scoffed, giving Jadon a disgusted look. &#34;He&#39;s not my son. We used a donor egg to have him. But I later conceived on my own and had Asher. Asher is my only son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You gave birth to both of them, Angela!&#34; Lewis shouted, and his control finally snapped. &#34;You promised you would love the child regardless of the egg that was used. You told me it didn&#39;t matter as long as you were a mother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I lied!&#34; Angela fired back. She threw her arms in the air. &#34;It mattered! If we had been more patient, then I would have had only Asher. My son. With my DNA!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lewis shook his head. &#34;You need help. All this while You have been treating the boys differently because one doesn&#39;t have your DNA! You should be glad he doesn&#39;t. See what your precious son has done!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Angela wasn&#39;t about to see reason. She slammed her fists into Lewis&#39;s chest, screaming. &#34;It&#39;s your fault for not giving him what rightfully belonged to him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The police officers moved forward and grabbed Angela. It took all three to hold her back. Tapiwa and Jadon stayed still, taking in the scene like it was a movie playing out in front of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emotions were high, and the voices were higher. Tapiwa wouldn&#39;t have been shocked if more officers rushed into the office for fear a fight had broken out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lewis pointed at Jadon, still shouting at his wife. &#34;He is my son! Or did you forget? I had every right to give him everything!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the words were said, Tapiwa felt Jadon jerk as though he had finally snapped out of whatever daze he had been lost in. Then, without a word, he grabbed Tapiwa&#39;s hand and tugged her behind him as he made his way out the door and into the large hallway that led back to the reception area and the front door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t need to say anything. Tapiwa felt the tension in his hold and the tremors he tried hard to suppress as he walked like a man on a mission. And the mission was to leave the police station as fast as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa had no problem with that plan. The truth was out, but the mess was far from over. They needed time to process and come up with a plan. They rounded a corner and Tapiwa opened her mouth to ask if they had a ride back home since they had driven to the police station with the officers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the words didn&#39;t leave her mouth as both she and Jadon came to a sudden stop when they saw who had just entered the police station.</p>
