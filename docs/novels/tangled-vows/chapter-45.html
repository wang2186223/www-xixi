                <p>Jadon shifted in his seat as though suddenly uncomfortable. He studied her face and then looked out the window, a frown creasing his forehead. &#34;I understand that your father threw you out because of our little indiscretion. You are now living with a friend, but I would like you to consider taking up my spare room. I think you would be more comfortable and I could help you get back on your feet. It&#39;s the least I could do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more he talked, the more Tapiwa felt the urge to slap the man. Little indiscretion? He had been dick deep in her body when her father found them and the man dared call it a little indiscretion. Was that why he wanted her to move in with him? Tapiwa mused as her anger simmered right under her skin. So that they could continue their little indiscretion?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly a humorless burst of laughter left her lips. Jadon startled and leaned away from her as though he suddenly feared she had gone mad. It just made her laugh some more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the next few minutes, Tapiwa laughed and laughed until tears burned her eyes and she knew if she didn&#39;t stop and get out she would end up humiliating herself by crying in front of this man that she somehow both hated and still wanted with every fiber of her being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took her a minute, but with a few deep breaths, Tapiwa managed to regain some composure. She stared at Jadon, who still looked worried and had his lips pressed together in a thin line. Tapiwa snorted. She was tired of this and just wanted him gone.  &#34;I can&#39;t even pretend to say thank you for the offer. So I will just ask you to take your offer and shove it where the sun doesn&#39;t shine. And while you are at it, delete my number and stay away from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A muscle ticked in the man&#39;s jaw. &#34;I think we already tried the whole &#39;stay away from me&#39; thing, it didn&#39;t work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This time, try harder,&#34; Tapiwa snarled. She then grabbed the door and ordered him to let her out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a long minute, he did nothing but stare at her. The air in the car vibrated with tension and something else. Something that told her if Jadon dared grab her right then and kiss her, she would cave. She couldn&#39;t let that happen. Her self-preservation woke up within her with a vengeance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly very agitated and fueled by too many emotions, Tapiwa banged her fist against the window. &#34;I said let me out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lock disengaged a second later and Tapiwa didn&#39;t waste time stumbling out of the car. Nicole was at her side in a second, a frown firmly fixed between her brows. &#34;What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing,&#34; Tapiwa snapped as she walked away from the vehicle as though it was a ticking time bomb about to go up in flames.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a matter of seconds, Tapiwa made it to the gate, grateful no one had called her back. But then, she heard the car engine roar to life and her curiosity got the better of her. Looking over her shoulder, Tapiwa almost shuddered at the look Jadon shot her before he suddenly looked away and ordered his friend to get into the damn car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following his gaze to the side, Tapiwa also then realized that Nicole hadn&#39;t followed her as she had assumed. Her friend still stood next to Jadon&#39;s car with his friend and from the looks of it, they were exchanging phone numbers. You have got to be kidding me.  Tapiwa thought in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A minute later, Tapiwa waited for Nicole at the gate as the car joined the main road and drove away. She almost wished it had taken all her confusing thoughts with it but alas, those stayed with her. Which was probably why she was quick to snap at Nicole when the woman finally joined her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of all the guys, him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicole looked up from her phone with a slight frown. &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa huffed. &#34;Jadon&#39;s friend! You got his number. Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s good-looking.&#34; Nicole shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa opened her mouth, not sure what she was even about to say but decided against it. Nicole was an adult and could make her own decisions. It had nothing to do with her. With that thought in mind, Tapiwa turned to get back into the yard. But just then, the hairs on the back of her neck tingled and unease crept up her spine like cold, dead fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning, Tapiwa scanned the area. For a second, nothing looked out of place. A scarce number of people walked around, going about their business, nothing unusual. But then she saw him. A dark figure standing under a large tree along the main road above.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man was shrouded in the shadow of the tree&#39;s canopy but Tapiwa knew without a doubt it was the man from the pool. The same man who had threatened to drown her. The air in her lungs left with a shocked gasp that instantly caught Nicole&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; Nicole looked around but didn&#39;t seem to notice Tapiwa&#39;s nightmare under the tree several feet away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sudden wave of raw fear made talking impossible. Tapiwa&#39;s ears filled with the drumming of her thundering heartbeat. Sweat broke out on her forehead. At that moment, she wished Jadon hadn&#39;t driven away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tapi?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa blinked and darted her eyes at her worried friend before she looked back at the dark threat just standing there, watching them. But he was gone. Confused, Tapiwa&#39;s frantic eyes darted around but there was no man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shudder rocked her body again, stealing the strength from her legs. Swaying, Tapiwa wrapped her arms around herself and shook her head. No. She couldn&#39;t deal with this.</p>
