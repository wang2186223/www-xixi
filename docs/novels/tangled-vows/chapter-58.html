                <p>The next morning came too soon for Tapiwa&#39;s liking. That probably had something to do with the fact that she had spent most of the night getting tangled in the sheets and had only found rest when the crack of dawn broke through the pitch black of night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The urge to stay in bed and hope to catch a few more hours was tempting, but now she was up and although the sky outside the house was as gray and cold as her mood, she couldn&#39;t stay in bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mumbling to herself like a demented old woman, Tapiwa took another shower, which she hoped would energize more of her brain cells. She sadly realized her brain cells remained in hibernation as she dragged herself from the guest room she had been using to the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Naturally, Tapiwa listened carefully for any signs of Jadon. She heard nothing, so she assumed he was either sleeping or out of the house already. After the abrupt way they had separated yesterday, she thought it was probably for the best if they didn&#39;t see each other so early. Especially not when her mind was still foggy with lack of sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, before she could relax and look forward to a cup of coffee and maybe some scrambled eggs on toast, she stepped into the kitchen and found herself staring at an obviously exhausted Jadon seated on a stool at the island with a bottle of water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a heartbeat, Tapiwa wasn&#39;t sure whether to leave or go in. While she hovered at the threshold with indecision, Jadon brought the bottle to his lips and gulped down a third of the bottle as though it were something much more than water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was stressed. She could see that, and Tapiwa thought she had a pretty good idea of the reason behind it. She didn&#39;t know how to fix it, though. The sexual tension was palpable. They both felt it and yearned for it. Resisting was making sleep impossible and being around each other without dealing with the desire was like torture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought occurred to her that she could simply state she wanted more in the same way she had stated the boundary that was holding him back, but just the thought of opening her mouth and saying the words made her heart almost beat out of her chest. Okay, so that wasn&#39;t happening. At least not right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, instead of dwelling on that, Tapiwa went for the tentative normalcy they had established since she had entered his house. &#34;Can I make you some eggs for breakfast?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Better make enough for four. Kaelo called me fifteen minutes ago and told me he was bringing Nicole.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa stopped halfway to the fridge and turned to face Jadon with a concerned frown. &#34;Has something happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jadon shook his head, a single shoulder lifting in a shrug. &#34;He didn&#39;t mention a problem. He just said they had an idea.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa wondered what sort of ideas made people visit before eight in the morning but she kept her mouth shut and her thoughts to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the next few minutes, she busied herself pulling all the ingredients out of the fridge and then set about making breakfast. It all seemed so domestic and normal despite the tension still hanging heavy in the air between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, the air pulsed with it so much so that by the time there was a knock at the door announcing their guests, Tapiwa was ready to run out of the room. She did, but only to answer the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey!&#34; Nicole said, full of cheer, when Tapiwa opened the door and let them in. She was immediately all over Tapiwa with a tight hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey yourself.&#34; She returned with a chuckle, happy to see her friend. Even though the mischievous glint in her eyes told Tapiwa that she was in for a world of questions after their last conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Completely oblivious to the silent message passing between the two women, Kaelo grinned and held up a brown paper bag toward Tapiwa. &#34;Good morning, Tapi, I brought beignets.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be-what?&#34; Tapiwa asked with a frown even as she took the bag, her curiosity already heightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Beignets. They are the best thing ever made.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doubtful of that over-the-top praise, Tapiwa opened the bag and was immediately assaulted by the wonderful scent of vanilla and sugar. She was a little confused when her eyes landed on the square, fried dough covered in a dusting of sugar. Tapiwa dug in and took one, too curious to wait for the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she took a bite, Tapiwa knew she would be asking for the bakery&#39;s address from Kaelo as soon as she swallowed. God, that tasted so wonderful a moan slipped out of her before she could hold back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaelo chuckled, clearly pleased with himself. But then he looked over her shoulder and his smile took on a teasing quality. Tapiwa didn&#39;t have to turn to know Jadon was there. She went to turn around and see for herself, but Kaelo decided to throw his arm over her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The move was so unexpected that Tapiwa froze, giving Kaelo the perfect opportunity to lean in and speak right next to her ear. &#34;You know, you could come and live with me and I would make sure you have beignets every morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you done?&#34; Jadon&#39;s voice cut in sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughing, Kaelo released Tapiwa and then wrapped his arm around Nicole instead and guided her toward the kitchen, leaving Tapiwa with Jadon in the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that realization, her heart rate picked up, and Tapiwa wasn&#39;t sure why. They were living in the house alone and hadn&#39;t done anything and they were unlikely to do anything now that their friends were in the house with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, that didn&#39;t stop Tapiwa from shoving the rest of the beignet in her mouth and turning around, desperate to get back to the kitchen. Her plan was however halted when she realized Jadon now stood in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uhm We Uhm. We should get in there and hear this plan,&#34; she stuttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jadon nodded, a frown creasing his forehead, but he didn&#39;t look in a hurry to move. For a long second, they just stared at each other. And then, as though something had snapped inside him, he groaned and stepped closer. &#34;I can&#39;t hold back anymore,&#34; he said, his voice low and raspy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa parted her lips to ask what he was talking about; the words didn&#39;t leave her mouth. With another groan, Jadon dropped his head and captured Tapiwa&#39;s mouth in a heated, desperate kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All manner of thinking left Tapiwa&#39;s mind. Suddenly, the only focus she had was Jadon&#39;s mouth and how it moved over hers. It was all achingly familiar already, even though they had very few memories of kissing. She didn&#39;t want him to stop, even though she was aware that they would both need oxygen soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then the soft thud of something landing at her feet snapped them both from the fog of desire they had almost allowed to consume them. They separated, but only enough to realize she had dropped the brown paper bag of beignets. Thankfully, none had fallen out of the bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Embarrassed, Tapiwa didn&#39;t move as Jadon lowered his hand and picked up the bag. Once he was upright again, he smiled at her. &#34;Glad I was so good you forgot all about the sugary goodness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh,&#34; Tapiwa&#39;s cheeks grew hot. She covered her face with her hands. &#34;Please never say that again,&#34; she begged, but she was laughing. It felt good to do it too. The sexual tension was still there, now even heavier than before, but the kiss had held promise they could work things out somehow and so some of the urgency behind the need calmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa thought it was that newfound calm that allowed her to walk back into the kitchen with Jadon. It was the same calm that stopped her from bursting into flames and just melting to the floor when both Kaelo and Nicole looked between her and Jadon with arched brows, as though expecting something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully, Jadon was quick to remind Kaelo he had a plan he wished to discuss, and that plan didn&#39;t involve what may or may not be happening between them. With that handled, they all settled down to eat as Kaelo got talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think whoever has been blackmailing you still has an eye on you and it pisses them off that you two are still together,&#34; Kaelo said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jadon set his fork down on his plate. He frowned. &#34;We already guessed as much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you also guess that you could use that to your advantage?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That had Tapiwa sitting up straight. &#34;What are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaelo&#39;s fingers tapped on the island top in a fast beat. He shared a look with Nicole and then darted his eyes between Jadon and Tapiwa. &#34;I mean Instead of playing it safe, we provoke the guy.&#34; Kaelo shrugged. &#34;Instead of staying in here where it is obviously safe, you go out and get seen in public.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mean become bait?&#34; Jadon snarled, not liking the idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time since they had sat down to eat, Nicole spoke up with a shake of her head. &#34;Not exactly. We were thinking we all go clubbing. Like a double date. You guys will be seen in public, being at ease and happy. That is bound to push this person&#39;s buttons.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And piss them off more than they have already been,&#34; Tapiwa said. &#34;What happens when they do something else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaelo arched a brow. &#34;What else can they do? They already publicized the pictures.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I still don&#39;t like it,&#34; Jadon cut in. &#34;There are still too many unknowns in this matter. We risk making things worse instead of better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But this might be the only chance you get to provoke them into making a mistake and exposing themselves. Once we know who they are, we can take care of the problem once and for all, instead of living in a constant state of apprehension, because you don&#39;t know when the other shoe will drop.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa hated to admit it, but Kaelo had a valid point and when she looked at Jadon, she saw that he too agreed even though he liked it as much as she did. But what other choice did they have if they hoped to get their lives back to normal?</p>
