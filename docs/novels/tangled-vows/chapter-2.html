                <p>Warm legs wrapped around his waist. He held them in place with a firm grip as he thrust hard into tight heat. He couldn&#39;t see her face, but he heard her gasp, it fueled his pleasure until he felt as though his entire body would come apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sweat trickled down his chest and fell on her bare flawless caramel skin. His gaze traveled up from her flat stomach to her bouncing breasts. Damn, the fullness of them made him want to touch and lick them. Even the large oddly shaped birthmark peeking out under her left breast teased him to reach out. He wanted to, but first, he wanted to see her face again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he couldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jadon Paterson groaned and the sound of his own frustration ripped him from his sleep and the dream. He immediately sat upright and then regretted the movement and held his breath as he fought not to spill bile all over the sheets tangled around his legs and his hard cock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several minutes later, Jadon finally had his body under control and he stood at the foot of the bed in utter disbelief. &#34;What the hell?&#34; he muttered under his breath. He grabbed the back of his neck, squeezed, and threw his head back to stare at the ceiling for long seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes closed, he drew a deep breath and then dropped his head back down and glared at the bed as though it was responsible for whatever mess he was in now. Originally, he wanted to believe it was all just a dream. But he wasn&#39;t that stupid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad is going to kill me,&#34; he gritted out through clenched teeth. Just as soon as the old man found out Jadon had done something so reckless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A steady throb started at his temples, something he didn&#39;t need since he had woken up already feeling as though his head weighed a ton. Jadon didn&#39;t think he had a hangover, he had only drunk one bottle of beer last night from what he remembered. That wasn&#39;t enough to even give him a buzz. Strangely though, he felt as though he had locked lips with a bottle of old scotch and hadn&#39;t let go until it was dry. Since he hadn&#39;t, he couldn&#39;t explain why a mini elephant was tap dancing on his brain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He also couldn&#39;t explain how he had ended up without a stitch of clothing on his body, in a bed he didn&#39;t know, and with his genitals covered in what he was certain was dried flakes of bodily fluids of the sexual variety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it! Jadon rubbed at his face and pinched the bridge of his nose. There was no doubt in his mind that he&#39;d had sex sometime last night and with no sign of a condom in sight, his gut churned at the repercussions of his carelessness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yep. His father would skin him alive and then kill him when an unknown female showed up nine months from now with a damn baby. Or maybe the old man would end him now when the news spread that the new CEO of Paterson real estate development company had a random night with an unknown female at a party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman hadn&#39;t even stuck around. Jadon had woken up to an empty room. Whoever had been in the bed with him last night was long gone and he had no way of knowing who she was. He was certain the woman in the dream was the missing lady, but just like in the dream, he closed his eyes and tried to recall her face. Nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a huff of frustration, Jadon shook out his arms at his sides and then bent down and retrieved his clothes. It took him a few minutes to be fully dressed and leave the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite feeling like the biggest idiot on the planet and not pleased to be doing the obvious walk of shame at the ripe age of twenty-six, he kept his head up and walked with confidence. His father always told him to never show the world how unsettled he was. Even when he felt as though he was about to pass out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucky for him, he didn&#39;t have an audience. Certain pieces began to fall into place, though. Jadon realized he was still in the house where the party had been held last night. That was good. It meant he hadn&#39;t wandered off with an unknown female like a complete idiot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wide hallway, brightly lit up from a glass wall at the end where it seemed to split in two different directions, was littered with empty bottles and cans and smelled like the back alley of a club. But there was no one there to witness Jadon leaving the room and hastily making his way toward what he hoped was the exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully, his sense of direction still appeared to be working. He found the stairs and was almost at the bottom when he spotted the front door just a few feet away, passed the remnants of what could only resemble the aftermath of a frat party and not a birthday party for responsible adults.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jadon shook his head in disbelief. There was a table completely overturned on the left, blocking the doorway to what must have been the living room, if he remembered correctly. And a guy, clearly passed out but still holding a half-full bottle of whisky against his chest, was sleeping on it. He had no shoes on, only socks. At least the guy still had his clothes on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The creamy white carpet that covered the floor was a total loss. Jadon could see several wet stains in various shades of red and brown among the clutter of broken glass, empty cups, and more overturned furniture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the last time Jadon was allowing his brother to drag him to a party for one of Asher&#39;s friends. Jadon hadn&#39;t partied this hard when he had been in college and he saw no point in going through the experience in his late twenties when he was supposed to be showing maturity and a sound mind to run a company their father had formed over two decades ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, the fact that he had woken up naked in a foreign bed with a missing bed partner was enough of a deterrent to ensure he never tried it again. Now he just had to get out of there before someone who hadn&#39;t marinated all their brain cells last night actually saw him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved fast around the broken glass and bottles and was almost at the door when it opened and a man stepped in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost in slow motion, as though the man couldn&#39;t afford to move too fast, he jerked back in shock when his eyes landed on Jadon. And then he smiled. &#34;Jadon! You are still here!&#34;</p>
