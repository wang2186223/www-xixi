                <p>Tapiwa expected Jadon to answer her question and elaborate on his thoughts. She expected them to maybe discuss what was going to happen about their situation. Jadon coming to see her in the middle of the night told Tapiwa that something had changed. What that change meant for her, she had no idea but she was willing to find out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, what happened next stole the air from Tapiwa&#39;s lungs and left her grasping at his shirt as though she needed a firm hold on him to ensure she didn&#39;t float away on the cool breeze outside the vehicle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike the tentative, soft kiss they had shared in Jadon&#39;s office yesterday morning, the one Jadon claimed from her now was so passionate her toes curled on either side of him and her innermost intimate muscles clenched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A loud moan tore out of Tapiwa&#39;s throat. She threw caution to the wind and eradicated any sliver of space that had existed between their bodies moments before. With no underwear on under her pajamas, the close contact with his hard body was both frustrating and exhilarating. She felt everything yet the barrier of clothes still prevented it from fully registering to all her senses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A groan of frustration slipped out of her. Or perhaps it had come from Jadon, she wasn&#39;t sure. All Tapiwa knew was that one moment they were kissing, Jadon&#39;s tongue tasting every inch of her mouth, and then the next, he had her on her back in the backseat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her pajama shorts went down to her knees while her shirt found its way up, trapped by her arms. Jadon&#39;s still impeccably dressed form hovered over hers. He suddenly grabbed her right breast just before he bent his head and took her nipple inside his warm mouth and sucked hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The zap of electricity was sudden and intense, spreading from her breast to her core. Tapiwa arched her back, desperate for more. Her arms came up around Jadon, frantically grabbing at him to draw him closer. There were too many clothes still on his body and Tapiwa couldn&#39;t understand why through her haze of desire. She wanted skin. She wanted more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, as though reading her mind, Jadon gave her more. His fingers found her wet pussy and stroked once before she suddenly felt something much harder and broader against her heated center. Before any clear thought entered her mind, Jadon pushed forward and Tapiwa&#39;s mouth fell open in a silent scream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a dizzying moment, Tapiwa thought her heart stopped beating. She couldn&#39;t breathe as her body fought to comprehend the new sensations. There was pain and discomfort because, of course, Jadon had to be well-hung. But there was also a buzz of intense pleasure that hummed just below the surface still out of reach but promising to me mindblowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck! You are tight,&#34; Jadon groaned as he rolled his hips and settled deeper into her body. Tapiwa whimpered. He froze but he didn&#39;t pull out. Not that she wanted him to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Breathe,&#34; Jadon whispered in a strained voice, his mouth now on her neck trailing kisses and sucking her skin hard enough to leave a mark. &#34;Tapiwa, I need you to breathe. Tell me you&#39;re okay so I can move. I&#39;m dying here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An unexpected chuckle burst out of Tapiwa. Startled, Jadon lifted his head and frowned down at her. &#34;Okay Laughing isn&#39;t what I expect when I am buried deep in a woman&#39;s tight body. What&#39;s so funny?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa couldn&#39;t help it, she chuckled again but sobered fast when it made her muscles clench and the hard cock buried in her body twitched. She gasped and then licked her lips, all the while holding his narrowed, heated gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully, she found her words again because it seemed the man was waiting for an answer. &#34;You are talking about dying but I&#39;m the one being split in two by your cock. Have you any idea how big you are?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked shocked by her words. Then a smirk took over his face. &#34;Oh, baby, that&#39;s the wrong thing to tell a man.&#34; Jadon rolled his hips again before he pulled out until only the swollen head remained. When he slammed back in, Tapiwa wasn&#39;t sure whether she wanted to slap him or beg him to do it again. He didn&#39;t give her the time to decide though. Jadon repeated the move again and again, something that must have been difficult to do considering they were in the back of a car and space was limited but he made it look effortless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As minutes ticked by, Tapiwa threw her head back and moaned, feeling the buzz increase inside her body until she was chasing it with all her might. When the fireworks exploded behind her closed eyelids, Tapiwa was sure she was floating. She was only vaguely aware that Jadon moved twice, three times and then he tensed on top of her and released a deep groan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a long minute, heavy breathing filled the car. Along with the scent of sex and sweat. Neither of them moved. Tapiwa didn&#39;t want to say anything and risk popping the bubble they were in. She felt so good but the thoughts were already trying to creep back into her mind. But Tapiwa shoved them down with a mental shake of her head. Reality could wait just a few more minutes, she thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, the universe didn&#39;t think they needed a few minutes. Suddenly, a door was pulled open, and cold air rushed in. It was worse than being dumped in a tub full of ice-cold water. Someone shouted but Tapiwa couldn&#39;t make out what was said, she was only aware of the fact that Jadon was suddenly tugged backward off her body and out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instinct made Tapiwa rush to right her pajamas and hide her body as she watched Jadon fall to the ground outside the car with a grunt of pain. Then she looked up and met the eyes of the person who had burst into their moment like a storm and crashed it. Her blood went cold. Oh, god. She was dead.</p>
