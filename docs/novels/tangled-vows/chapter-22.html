                <p>To anyone watching, Tapiwa probably looked as though she was headed for the bathrooms as she walked along the wall and made her way to the back of the church where the entrance opened up into a large corridor. Good. She didn&#39;t want anyone guessing her intentions. Especially not her brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of the main hall, two doors led outside on either end of the corridor just passed the offices on her left and the bathrooms on her right. Directly opposite the main hall, lining up the entire wall was a row of Sunday school classes for the children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring any form of guilt that tried to rear its ugly head, Tapiwa turned to her right. She quickly made her way passed the bathrooms until she was outside. Then she leaned against the wall and pulled her phone back up. However, instead of texting Jadon again, she made a call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He answered on the first ring. &#34;What did you tell him?&#34; he asked, clearly not bothering with pleasantries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa stared at the almost dry lawn in front of her, barely seeing it. His voice in her ear sent shivers down her spine and she wasn&#39;t sure if she liked it or if she wanted to investigate what it all meant. Not right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was I supposed to tell him something?&#34; she countered after a beat and then bit her lip, shocked at her own boldness when she spoke with this man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jadon&#39;s huff sounded frustrated. &#34;No. But I wouldn&#39;t have been able to stop you if you did,&#34; he said. &#34;What did he want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa sighed and closed her eyes for a moment. &#34;To get back together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another beat passed. &#34;You told him no.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a statement, not a question but Tapiwa still answered. &#34;I told him no. I haven&#39;t changed my mind.&#34; Tapiwa didn&#39;t know why she was telling him this. Or why it felt so easy to talk to Jadon on the phone after she had practically run away from him after their confrontation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly feeling self-conscious, she looked around, squinting at the bright sunlight. She was still alone even though she could hear the amplified voice of the pastor as he continued with his sermon. It was a good reminder that she couldn&#39;t stay outside too long. Sooner or later one of her family members would come searching for her. That was if some other random, nosy member didn&#39;t locate her first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you break up with Asher because of what happened between us?&#34; Jadon suddenly asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa was startled at the question. &#34;Uhm&#34; She hesitated even though the answer was simple. Especially now that Jadon knew about their one-time reckless endeavor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before the words could form on her tongue, movement to her right suddenly caught her attention and like a ghost summoned by mentioning his name, Tapiwa watched in horror as Asher made his way toward her with determined steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cut the call. Tapiwa didn&#39;t think twice. She ended the call, shoved the phone back into her pocket, and turned to hurry back into the church building. Unfortunately, for her, Asher was faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand shot out and grabbed her arm, halting her escape. Tapiwa clenched her jaw. She whipped her head around and glared at him. &#34;Let go of me, Asher.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who were you talking to?&#34; he demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa blinked in shock at the question but then she recovered fast and attempted to yank her arm free. That only earned her a tighter hold she was sure would bruise, even with the barrier of her jacket. She grimaced. That was the last thing she needed. &#34;You are hurting me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher&#39;s glare dropped to his fingers wrapped around her upper arm. He seemed to consider it for a second before he marginally loosened his hold. But he didn&#39;t release her. &#34;Tell me who you were talking to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A scoff of disbelief escaped Tapiwa. &#34;That is none of your business. What are you even doing here, Asher?&#34; For heaven&#39;s sake, Tapiwa began to wonder if God was really against her. The man was worse than gum under her shoe. She couldn&#39;t get rid of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your mother invited me to church.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course she did, Tapiwa thought with irritation. Why her mother couldn&#39;t just keep her nose out of things, Tapiwa didn&#39;t understand. &#34;Well, good for you but the service is inside. Maybe you should get in and listen to the message,&#34; she suggested stiffly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Asher didn&#39;t budge. His eyes narrowed. &#34;You were talking to another man, weren&#39;t you? That&#39;s why you won&#39;t answer my question,&#34; he accused. Then his fingers tightened again as he drew her flush against his body in one rough tug. &#34;Is that why you broke up with me? You already have another man in your life?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pissed and a little terrified by his actions and words, Tapiwa pressed her free hand against his chest and attempted to push him away. &#34;No!&#34; she bit out when he didn&#39;t budge an inch. &#34;There is no other man. Now. Let. Me. Go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Never,&#34; Asher growled. Then, before Tapiwa knew what was happening, Asher grabbed her other arm and held her still as he suddenly dropped his head and found her mouth with his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second, Tapiwa froze, uncertain of what was happening or how to react. Instinct made her press her lips shut, refusing him entry even when his wet tongue pushed hard against them. But then anger flared in the pit of her stomach and for a second, it was enough to give her the strength to push Asher away and rip herself from his hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking as shocked as she felt, Asher stared at her wide-eyed. She wasn&#39;t sure what exactly had shocked him and she didn&#39;t care. Before Asher could recover and move toward her again, Tapiwa slapped him hard across the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound cut through the air like a thunderclap. Tapiwa flexed her suddenly warm hand before she curled it into a fist at her side. She opened her mouth, but she realized she really had nothing to say and wisdom beckoned she retreated to safety before the man reacted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, she shut her mouth without saying a word, turned on her heels, and ran back into the church.</p>
