                <p>&#34;Tapiwa, where have you been?&#34; her mother asked as soon as she stepped through the front door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa froze, trepidation clawed its fingers around her neck, and threatened to cut out her airway. She gulped and stared at her mother, trying to read her face. Was Miranda angry? Disappointed? Did she know about Jadon? Oh god, please no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The walls suddenly felt as though they were closing in on Tapiwa. She didn&#39;t move even though every cell in her body screamed for her to run and hide. Meanwhile. confused by Tapiwa&#39;s stillness and silence, Miranda frowned. She stepped closer, wiping her hands on a kitchen towel. &#34;Are you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question and concern heavy on her mother&#39;s features snapped Tapiwa out of her haze of dread. Quickly, she realized Miranda wasn&#39;t pissed. That could only mean the woman didn&#39;t know. Tapiwa&#39;s shoulders sagged. Relief washed over her like cool water. She nodded, managing a small smile. &#34;Yes. I&#39;m fine, Mom. Just a little tired.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda immediately relaxed and smiled wide. &#34;Of course. Well, I bet the surprise waiting for you in the living room will bring the energy right back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Surprise?&#34; Tapiwa&#39;s nerves went back on high alert. Her eyes darted to the door that led to the living room, certain she didn&#39;t want to find out what it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, her mother didn&#39;t notice her instant hesitation. Or she chose to ignore it. Either way, the older woman beamed and gestured enthusiastically for Tapiwa to get in there. &#34;Come on. He has been waiting for over an hour,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He? For a split second, Tapiwa wondered if it might be Jadon. But then she remembered that she had stepped out of his car only half an hour ago. And when she had walked away from the mall, he had still been parked there, glaring at her through the windshield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Furthermore, now that she gave it a little more thought, she doubted her mother would be so enthusiastic about Jadon. No. There was only one man that her mother gushed over like a teenager with a crush. Asher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa almost didn&#39;t walk into the living room. Truth be told, if her mother hadn&#39;t been right behind her, she might have turned on her heels and ran. As it turned out, her escape route was blocked and she had no choice but to walk into the living where she found Asher, dressed in a suit, seated in her father&#39;s favorite one-seater with his left leg raised, ankle resting on his right knee. He looked like he owned the place instead of a guest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will leave you two to talk,&#34; Miranda helpfully informed them, the smile still very much present on her face. Then she was gone. Not good, Tapiwa immediately thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t thought this day could get any worse. She had been wrong. Standing in front of Asher while she still felt the ghost imprint of Jadon&#39;s hands on her and the faint smell of his cologne clinging to her senses was unnerving, to say the least. Not to mention, the knowledge that there were pictures of her and Jadon in the hands of a blackmailer somewhere. It was all enough to make her break out in a sweat and pass out. Thankfully, anger was right there battling the emotion. It was enough to keep her thoughts in order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before Tapiwa could demand to know what the man was doing there, Asher lowered his leg. He then bent down and picked up a small, black gift bag and a large bouquet of red roses that had apparently been waiting on the carpet, hidden by the small coffee table. Then, his face void of any emotion, he stood and stepped forward, extending both toward her like an offering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These are for you, Tapiwa,&#34; he said evenly as though that hadn&#39;t been blatantly clear in his actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa didn&#39;t take them. She curled her hands into fists at her sides. Unease ran down her spine making her legs twitch. She was ready to take off and dash out of the room. &#34;What is this?&#34; she croaked, refusing to meet his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m apologizing for my actions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nearly scoffed. Apologizing? Was the guy high? Tapiwa hadn&#39;t had any experience with apologies in a relationship, but she was certain they were never carried out this cold. She shook her head. &#34;No. There is no need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I lost my temper the last time we spoke and for that, I apologize,&#34; Asher insisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Asher&#34; Tapiwa glanced over her shoulder, making sure they were still alone. They were. She then looked at her ex-boyfriend, hoping he didn&#39;t give her a repeat of their breakup in the pizzeria. &#34;I meant what I said. I can&#39;t continue with this relationship. I&#39;m sorry. So please just take your flowers and gift and leave. There is nothing to apologize for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher blinked but the blank expression on his face didn&#39;t change. The hairs on the back of Tapiwa&#39;s neck tingled. She shifted her weight from foot to foot. A long silence stretched as the man only stared at her. Tapiwa didn&#39;t know what to do. Suddenly the version of him angry and insulting was far much better than the unusual calm he was displaying. This felt like she was talking to a feral dog that was only asleep. What happened when it woke up?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Asher?&#34; she tried when she couldn&#39;t take it anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tiniest twitch appeared in his jaw. Asher exhaled heavily. Then, still not saying a word, he looked down at his cuffs and adjusted them before brushing an invisible speck of dirt off the lapel of his jacket. When his eyes met hers again, nothing had changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a step toward her. &#34;I really don&#39;t like these games, Tapiwa. But I understand you are a woman and you just want to see how far I can chase you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will let you play your games, Tapiwa. But there really is no need. You know how much I want you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not playing any games, Asher,&#34; Tapiwa gritted out, her anger spiking. God, the man was refusing to listen. It was like talking to a brick wall. &#34;We are done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher&#39;s lips twitched and curved up into a smile. It wasn&#39;t pretty. &#34;No. We are not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa gulped. The urge to run hit her again. Something was very wrong with Asher and she didn&#39;t want to find out what it was. She took a step back, away from him. But just then, her mother stepped back into the living room, a frown fixed between her brows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is going on here?&#34; Miranda demanded, her gaze darting between Tapiwa and Asher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher regarded Tapiwa for a long second and then he looked at her mother and the ice disappeared from his eyes like a switch had been flipped. &#34;Nothing, Mrs. Mvula. Just a little disagreement between love birds. Your daughter is just slow to forgive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh.&#34; Miranda shot Tapiwa a disapproving look. &#34;Really, Tapiwa, the man came over and brought you such lovely flowers and a gift. Whatever he did can&#39;t be that bad you can&#39;t forgive him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa glared at Asher, who stared back calmly as though he hadn&#39;t lied to her mother. She gritted her teeth. Fuck it! &#34;That&#39;s not true, Mom. I ended things with Asher days ago but he won&#39;t accept my decision.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gasp filled the room. Miranda covered her mouth with her hand before she lowered it and asked in a horrified tone, &#34;You ended things?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Tapiwa confirmed, her back straight even though she wanted the ground to swallow her whole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda looked between Tapiwa and Asher again. &#34;But why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was just angry at me for not giving her some attention at the party,&#34; Asher cut in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not it!&#34; Tapiwa hissed, wishing she could slap the bastard for putting her in that situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As though sensing Tapiwa&#39;s intentions, Miranda suddenly stepped forward her hands raised. She looked at Asher. &#34;Okay. How about you leave, for now, Asher? I will have a word with my daughter and get to the bottom of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa wanted to scream. There was nothing to get to the bottom of. Why couldn&#39;t they just accept that she wanted out of the relationship without a fuss? They had only been dating for a couple of months. It hadn&#39;t been a marriage for crying out loud. But no, they were determined to make a mountain out of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As though to prove Tapiwa&#39;s point, Asher turned and faced her mother, his voice earnest. &#34;Please talk to her. I really like your daughter and it would break me to just lose her when we haven&#39;t even had a chance to see where we were headed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh! Tapiwa groaned inwardly. Somebody, please shoot her.</p>
