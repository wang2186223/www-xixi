                <p>Jadon stared at what his best friends would have called goat food on his plate and tried his best not to grimace in disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He honestly didn&#39;t know what to make of the green goo that was artistically placed on the plate and then decorated with three purple leaves, six mushrooms, three thin strips of baby carrot, and ten peas. Yes, he had counted every item on his plate because it was just that ridiculous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What made it worse was the fact that the plate of non-existent food actually cost more than he would have paid for a good steak and chips at his favorite restaurant. Jadon almost took out his phone to snap a picture of the joke for his friends. Unfortunately, he doubted his date would appreciate it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Melody, that was the name of his date. She was the same woman he had spoken to at the gym on a dare from his friends. Jadon hadn&#39;t planned on calling her ever. But after he drove away from Tapiwa last night and couldn&#39;t get her out of his mind, he figured he needed to go out and see another woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jadon also thought being seen in public with another woman would lessen the blow when the story of him and Tapiwa hit the waves. Part of him felt like a worm for using Melody like this. But then he looked down at the plate in front of him and he didn&#39;t feel so guilty anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jadon had made the mistake of asking her to recommend her favorite place for their date. He hadn&#39;t known the woman planned to starve him. So, yeah. He wasn&#39;t going to feel any guilt for using her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Jadon suspected the woman was using him too. Melody looked great. She was beautiful and had a great body which probably came from eating like a baby bird before she visited the gym to take pictures. However, he didn&#39;t think she made it a habit to visit restaurants that charged an arm and a foot for three carrot sticks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The excitement in her eyes as well when they arrived and were seated at the romantic table for two was a dead giveaway. Melody was living a fairy tale through his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As though to prove his point, she looked up from her plate and beamed at him. &#34;This is great!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jadon swallowed down the snort he so wanted to release. Instead, he gave her his most professional smile. &#34;Indeed. I&#39;m glad you picked this place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, yes. I have been here a few times and absolutely loved the food.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He highly doubted it but decided not to burst her bubble. &#34;I am always open to new experiences. If the food is so great then they will make a loyal patron out of me as well.&#34; Jadon picked up his fork and stabbed a pea covered in the green goo. Lord help him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here,&#34; Melody suddenly said, snapping Jadon&#39;s attention away from the mystery on his plate. He looked up and found her extending her phone toward him. &#34;Take a picture of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eighty minutes later when Jadon walked Melody out of the restaurant to his car, he swore to himself that he would delete Melody&#39;s number as soon as he dropped her off back at home. In fact, he would block her number and probably change gyms so that there was no possibility to ever run into her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jadon also promised himself to give his two idiot friends an earful about picking up random women in the gym. God! Melody needed a serious reality check and Jadon had almost given it to her. Only the fact that they were in public and also the fact that he knew he hadn&#39;t genuinely wanted to see her had kept his mouth shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully, the night was almost done and he would push it all away and forget about it. He just had to get her home, which he did half an hour later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being the perfect gentleman even when he couldn&#39;t wait to get rid of his date was easy. Jadon walked around the car to the passenger door and opened it for her outside her gate. Taking her hand, he helped her out of the vehicle but released it as soon as she was on her feet and he was certain she wouldn&#39;t fall because of her ridiculous heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; Melody said with a shy smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jadon nodded and took a step back, already planning his exit. To his surprise, however, Jadon realized he hadn&#39;t given credit to how far Melody was willing to go to live out her fantasy. From one second to the next, Jadon found himself with an armful of the woman. Then her lipstick-covered lips were on his in a hard press of a kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His body went stiff and it took everything in him not to push her away. It wasn&#39;t the first time a woman had made a move on him, but it was the first time Jadon felt like washing his mouth from the contact. A very different reaction to what he had felt when he shared a kiss with Tapiwa in his office yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jadon had wanted to savor the taste of her even though he hadn&#39;t actually had the opportunity to sink his tongue into her mouth. His body had come alive, his blood heating up and pulsing with rapid heartbeats. It had all been so different and the memory of it just made his current predicament even more unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully, he didn&#39;t have to endure it for long. His reaction or lack thereof finally seemed to register with the woman and she broke their contact, taking a step back. A confused frown creased her forehead as she looked up at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are not really into me, are you?&#34; she asked tentatively before releasing an embarrassed, soft chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jadon felt bad. He should never have called the woman regardless of his reasons. He shook his head. &#34;Melody, you are a nice lady and I had a good time with you tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But? Coz&#39; I can hear a &#39;but&#39; coming.&#34; Melody wrapped her arms around herself looking self-conscious and on the brink of running.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just don&#39;t feel a connection,&#34; Jadon explained calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a beat, Melody seemed to chew on that. Then she nodded, a forced smile plastered on her face. &#34;I guess that&#39;s okay. You can&#39;t force these things. Thank you for tonight, Jadon. It was nice even if it hasn&#39;t ended how I would have liked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jadon smiled. It was the most genuine smile he had given her all night. The woman was a social media addict, taking pictures of everything and posting them for the world to see. She also talked nonstop about things she clearly knew nothing about while pretending she was someone she was not. But she had enough grace to take his rejection without a fuss. And for that, Jadon was willing to rethink his earlier plan of action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about friends?&#34; he suggested with an extended hand toward her. &#34;I think we would do better there. We can meet for drinks and such. I will even introduce you to my friends. You could also bring some of yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She seemed to consider it for half a second and then her smile was back. Melody shook his hand. &#34;Friends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Jadon drove away from Melody&#39;s house ten minutes later, he had to admit to himself that the evening hadn&#39;t been a total waste. He had gone out and been seen in public with a beautiful woman who was possibly going to be a friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had failed was his goal to push Tapiwa out of his thoughts. If anything, after the unexpected kiss Melody had planted on him, Jadon couldn&#39;t get Tapiwa off his mind for even a second. Not that she had been far from his thoughts before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So it was hardly a surprise that he pulled the car over, off the road, and reached for his phone. With the barest hesitation, he found Tapiwa&#39;s number and made a call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone rang three times and Jadon thought she wouldn&#39;t pick up his call when he heard the call connect. But then there was silence. Jadon drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and stared at the dark road ahead occasionally illuminated by the headlights of a passing vehicle. He waited even though he wasn&#39;t sure what he was waiting for, but still, the woman on the other end of the call didn&#39;t say a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Jadon couldn&#39;t hold his tongue. &#34;Aren&#39;t you going to say something?&#34; he demanded, his tone heavy with frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence continued for another beat and then he heard a heavy sigh and her soft voice followed a second after. &#34;What do you want, Jadon?&#34;</p>
