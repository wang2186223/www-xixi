                <p>Tapiwa watched as the sky outside the window turned a mesmerizing shade of orange, red, and violet as the sun made its final journey toward the horizon to mark the end of the day from hell. She released a shaky breath from her aching chest and buried her puffy face into the soft pillow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wearing a borrowed extra large T-shirt and a pair of shorts, Tapiwa felt as though her life had come to an end. Literally. But she had no more tears to shed. That was a good thing, she thought. Because after spending hours crying, Tapiwa was exhausted, dehydrated, and just a mess. She had a feeling she looked worse than something a cat might drag into the house. That thought didn&#39;t help her low mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just then, as though sensing at least one of her needs, a bottle of cool water appeared in her line of vision. When Tapiwa didn&#39;t immediately grab it, however, Nicole pulled the bottle back, opened it, and then brought it closer to Tapiwa&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need to drink this,&#34; Nicole said softly as though she was trying to coax a nervous pet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to,&#34; Tapiwa croaked. God, she sounded pathetic even to her own ears. It made her want to cry again so she buried her face further into the pillow. Anything to hide just how terrible she felt even though it had to be written all over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Tapiwa had turned up on Nicole&#39;s doorstep hours ago in her pajamas looking like death warmed over, Nicole had gone into a panic. It had taken Tapiwa almost an entire hour to explain everything that had happened because she couldn&#39;t stop crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicole had cried too, because, how could she not when she saw how much Tapiwa was hurting both physically and emotionally? But then her friend had helped her bathe and apply tissue oil on the welts left behind by the leather belt. Nicole had also given Tapiwa a painkiller and helped her into bed. Tapiwa hadn&#39;t moved since.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her brows furrowed in concern, Nicole sat down on the edge of the bed still holding the bottle of water. Slowly, almost as though she thought Tapiwa would flinch from the touch, she brought her hand to Tapiwa&#39;s swollen cheek and brushed the strands of hair away. &#34;Tapi, I know you probably just want to lay down and hope that everything will just right itself But it doesn&#39;t work that way. You know that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicole sighed when miraculously, Tapiwa found a new fountain of tears to explore. She wiped at the new tears but continued to speak. &#34;Don&#39;t do that, Tapi. You have done enough crying. Shit sucks but you have to pull yourself together or you will get sick and then where would that leave you? Where would it leave me? How am I supposed to handle you if you fall sick?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t get sick,&#34; Tapiwa argued weakly and sniffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, you will. You haven&#39;t moved in hours. You need to eat and drink some water for your body to heal. And then you need to calm down enough to think rationally about your next step. Staring at the window and crying will not land solutions on your lap like free Christmas gifts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicole wasn&#39;t the best at pep talks but Tapiwa could see her friend was really worried about her. She didn&#39;t want that. Managing a snort for the Christmas gift reference, Tapiwa finally sat up. She immediately groaned as her muscles protested and had to be helped the rest of the way until she sat with her back gingerly against the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicole smiled encouragingly. &#34;Good. Now you eat something.&#34; Before Tapiwa could protest, Nicole handed her the bottle of water and then stood from the bed only to return a moment later with a bowl of cold cereal with slices of bananas and strawberries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa arched a brow at her friend because, how could she not? They were talking about cereal in cold milk with some pieces of fruit. &#34;Really healthy,&#34; Tapiwa deadpanned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Nicole asked in mock innocence. &#34;I added fruits. And milk is healthy. Calcium. It&#39;s good for your bones and teeth. And And&#34; She narrowed her eyes as her brain obviously cooked up more points. Finally, she snapped her fingers together, excitement rolling off her. &#34;And I gave you the healthy cereal, not the cocoa puffs. This one is whole grain and low sugar.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa couldn&#39;t help it. She burst out laughing. Her shoulders shook as she threw her head back and just let the laughter take the hurt away even for just a second. &#34;Admit it,&#34; she said when she finally sobered. &#34;Your mother bought it and you just want me to eat it so you don&#39;t have to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not looking the slightest bit guilty. Nicole shrugged. &#34;You need to eat and I need to get rid of five boxes. Five boxes, Tapi. The woman went and bought so much and she knows I don&#39;t eat that brand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She wants you to at least eat healthy,&#34; Tapiwa answered before taking a spoonful into her mouth. The truth was she had no appetite and cereal wasn&#39;t what she would have picked to eat if she had, but she couldn&#39;t turn down the food after her friend had gone to the trouble of cutting the fruits and arranging them into a happy face of sorts on top of the cereal. Nicole was trying to not only feed her but cheer her up as well. And for that, Tapiwa was grateful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence fell around them, only broken by the sound of Tapiwa chewing crunchy cereal. By some miracle, Tapiwa forced half the bowl down her throat into her stomach. Just as she was about to tell Nicole she couldn&#39;t eat anymore, there was a knock at the door. She stiffened, nearly dropping the bowl all over her lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully, Nicole was quick and took the bowl from her. &#34;Jesus. Relax, Tapi. It&#39;s probably just Amy, she called earlier and said she would bring you a bag of clothes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the cereal Tapiwa had eaten suddenly churned in her stomach. A bag of clothes? It sounded so final as though her family was completely cutting her out of their lives. Has it gotten to that level? Tapiwa mused. She didn&#39;t want to believe that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But a minute later when Amy entered Nicole&#39;s one-roomed apartment dragging Tapiwa&#39;s largest suitcase behind her, Tapiwa feared it was indeed so. Her family was throwing her out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, this is awkward,&#34; Amy said once she was inside. She rubbed the back of her neck, and all the while a grimace pinched her face as though it actually hurt her to be the one to deliver the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa was speechless. She didn&#39;t stand from the bed, couldn&#39;t even move to hug her sister. All she could do was stare at the suitcase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully, Nicole was there to play the good host. It was her place after all. &#34;Amy, why don&#39;t you have a seat? I can offer you something to drink. Juice? Wine?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amy shifted on her feet, the picture of awkward on steroids. &#34;Uhm. Actually? I can&#39;t stay. Dad told me to deliver the suitcase and be back home within an hour. There is a cab waiting for me outside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A whimper escaped Tapiwa&#39;s throat. She shut her eyes, refusing to see the sympathy in her sister&#39;s eyes. The fact that Amy hadn&#39;t even made a move to hug her or ask how she was spoke volumes. Tapiwa didn&#39;t want to face any of that right now. She just couldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, with her eyes still firmly shut, Tapiwa listened as Nicole walked Amy back to the door. In a low whisper, Nicole asked Amy if Tapiwa&#39;s father had said anything else regarding Tapiwa. Really, at this point, Tapiwa was just torturing herself but she held her breath and listened, desperate to know something. Anything that would shine some glimmer of light on the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a short silence. Then Amy&#39;s low voice crushed any trace of hope Tapiwa dared hold on to. &#34;He doesn&#39;t want Tapiwa&#39;s name mentioned in the house, Nicole. Dad is pissed. He even took down any picture with her face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was silence after those words. Tapiwa didn&#39;t care. She&#39;d heard more than enough. Allen Mvula wanted nothing to do with her. Who knew sleeping with a guy could bring so much hell into her life? Tapiwa sure as hell hadn&#39;t known it would get to this point. Guess she had been wrong and now had to face the consequences.</p>
