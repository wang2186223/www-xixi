                <p>&#34;Hey, Tapiwa, are you okay?&#34; Neo asked, his voice full of concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa&#39;s attention snapped up from the posters she had been arranging. They were for a book launch being held at the library for an upcoming children&#39;s book author.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa realized she had been staring at the colorful prints for over five minutes instead of sticking them on the notice board like she should have been doing. Her cheeks went immediately warm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uhm Hey, Neo. I&#39;m fine. Sorry. Was just lost in my head for a bit.&#34; She gave him a smile she hoped backed up her words and got him moving. No such luck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The furrow between Neo&#39;s brows deepened. &#34;Are you sure? You came in late today and honestly, you haven&#39;t really been yourself. Something is obviously wrong. Don&#39;t think I haven&#39;t noticed how stiff you are. Tapiwa, you have a bruised cheek for heaven&#39;s sake. Please, tell me what&#39;s wrong. Maybe I can help. Did that ex of yours do this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it! Tapiwa dropped her eyes to the poster, grinding her teeth together. Nicole had warned her that going to work wasn&#39;t such a good idea while she was still bruised and healing, but Tapiwa couldn&#39;t just lay down on Nicole&#39;s bed all day letting her thoughts run havoc over her. She had to keep busy for the sake of her own sanity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She also had to work in order to get paid. Because, Tapiwa had reached the conclusion that if her father didn&#39;t forgive her sometime soon like today, then Tapiwa should be looking for ways to support herself. She couldn&#39;t rely on Nicole. Nicole didn&#39;t work and survived on her parent&#39;s generosity. Tapiwa no longer had that privilege.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa just hadn&#39;t expected her co-worker to be all up in her business. She should have though. Neo had already shown way more interest in her life than was probably healthy. The urge to tell him to just mind his own business was high. Tapiwa really didn&#39;t want to tell her embarrassing story to the world. The people who knew were enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine, Neo. Just a little trouble at home. Nothing serious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; Neo sounded skeptical and reluctant to drop the matter but something on Tapiwa&#39;s face must have said the topic was closed because he gave her a nod and then set down a bottle of orange Fanta she hadn&#39;t noticed him carrying. &#34;I Uhm thought you might want a drink. It&#39;s a little hot today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh.&#34; Tapiwa glanced at the bottle as though it was a poisonous snake ready to strike at her. &#34;Thank you,&#34; she managed with a small smile. The truth was she didn&#39;t want anything from Neo. She didn&#39;t want him to get the wrong impression and after the mess she was already in, Tapiwa didn&#39;t want further complications related to a man. If all the men could just leave her alone, she would have been grateful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just then, as though her guardian angel was on strike and Tapiwa had the devil tap dancing around her with a large grin on his face, the door of the library opened and Asher Paterson walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Tapiwa realized who it was, icicles slipped into her bloodstream and she shuddered. With a silent gasp, Tapiwa dropped to her knees, out of sight. She only remembered Neo when she heard the man make a shocked sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snapping her eyes up at Neo, she realized he was about to speak. Obviously to ask what the hell was going on. Tapiwa couldn&#39;t have that, She quickly pressed a finger to her lips and made the universal signal to shut the hell up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, Tapiwa turned on her knees and crawled as quickly as she could along the cracked, cold old tiles for the back of the library, all the while trying to make as little noise as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa was already at the back door that led to the storage rooms and staff bathroom when she heard Asher&#39;s thunderous voice demanding to know where Tapiwa was. Again, Tapiwa was glad her boss wasn&#39;t around to witness her life implode. Strangely enough, there were no usual students and occasional curious adults around to witness it either. Only Neo. She would deal with that later. Right now, though, she needed to get away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took her a few minutes to make her way out of the building through a window because she didn&#39;t have a key for the back door. Tapiwa thankfully didn&#39;t have the time to think about how ridiculous she must have looked as she clambered out of a small window. Asher&#39;s raised voice echoing throughout the library was more than enough motivation to climb through anything just to get away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no doubt in Tapiwa&#39;s mind that Asher&#39;s sudden appearance had everything to do with the man finding out she had slept with his brother. God, that was one confrontation she was not willing to go through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa stealthily moved around the building toward the front where the gate stood. It was the only way out of the yard unless she wanted to climb over the fence. Yeah, that wasn&#39;t happening. Tapiwa knew she would most likely break her leg and then she would be a sitting duck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The logical option would have been to hide behind the building and wait for Asher to leave, but Tapiwa didn&#39;t want to risk it if Asher suspected she was around and came looking. Also, waiting would have meant dealing with Neo once Asher was gone. That wasn&#39;t something she wanted to do either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, Tapiwa peeked around the corner and noted that Asher was still inside the library. His car was parked haphazardly at the gate as though he had been in too much of a rush to get to her to park in the designated parking spaces. The man was unhinged and in serious need of professional help. Thankfully he wasn&#39;t Tapiwa&#39;s problem. His next girlfriend could worry about that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five minutes later, Tapiwa couldn&#39;t believe she had escaped Asher&#39;s madness as she tried her best to look normal and not run down the sidewalk back to Nicole&#39;s place. But just to be certain her luck wasn&#39;t short-lived, she turned off the main road and took a narrow alley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t take the bus because her handbag was back in the library under the front desk. That meant Tapiwa was in for a long walk until she found a cardless ATM that would allow her to withdraw from her bank account. From experience, she knew the closest one was at the mall at least half an hour&#39;s walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa&#39;s mind was still reeling as she walked out of the alley into a back road when her phone buzzed in her pocket. Apprehension slammed into her but when she checked the caller ID she saw that it was Neo calling. Of course, he would call, Tapiwa thought with a sinking feeling in her gut. What had Asher told her co-worker? She didn&#39;t want to know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa stared at the phone until the ringing stopped. Part of Tapiwa expected Neo to try again, however, it seemed he got the hint. Instead, the message notification dinged a few seconds later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neo: What the hell is going on, Tapiwa? Please call me when you get this. I want to help. And don&#39;t worry about work. I will cover for you but whatever is going on, sort it out fast before you lose your job.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another wave of apprehension washed over Tapiwa. She couldn&#39;t afford to lose her job. Not right now when the rest of her life was going tits up.</p>
