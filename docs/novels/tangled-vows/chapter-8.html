                <p>Jadon had purposefully arrived at the restaurant late. Every minute he could shed off the night was a minute he saved his mind and heart from turmoil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He already expected the worst as he approached the table, not the best mindset for his birthday, but who could blame him? What he hadn&#39;t expected as the table came into view, however, was the beautiful young woman sitting at the table with his family, looking like a ray of sunshine in a dark, cold room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearly stumbling over his own feet, Jadon had abruptly stood a table away and studied the beauty next to his brother. For some reason he couldn&#39;t comprehend, Jadon&#39;s heart climbed up his throat and began to beat there. All the sounds in the restaurant disappeared, leaving behind only the rush of his own blood. He blinked, then blinked again. What the hell?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was dressed in the most colorful dress he could see in the room. But it was more than that. Skin the color of caramel glimmered under the lighting that had been strategically placed around the restaurant to enhance the sensual yet formal setting. Of their own volition, his eyes traced her bare arms, shoulders, and neck, until he settled on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was looking down, barely lifting her head as she spoke. Jadon had never seen someone look so beautiful and practically crawling out of their own skin at the same time. He couldn&#39;t see her hands, but he could have bet every coin he had that she was squeezing the hell out of her fingers with nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did she have to be so nervous about? And who was she? Why was she at the table with his family? So many questions hit Jadon in a breath. He shook his head to try and clear them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jadon had never had such a reaction to a woman, much more, a woman he didn&#39;t even know. It was unsettling and he almost turned around and walked out of the restaurant. It was a dinner to celebrate his birthday but Jadon knew everyone at that table would gladly grab an excuse to be anywhere else. They weren&#39;t that close to make a big deal out of a canceled dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before he could decide to leave, his father said something to the woman and a shy smile played on her face as she lifted it. Jadon felt as though the rug had been pulled out from under his feet again. He took two steps forward, and just like that, he had her attention. Then everything went tits up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jadon,&#34; his father called again and gestured toward the empty seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jadon wasn&#39;t sure what to make of the last five minutes or the fact that the woman looked at him as though she had just seen a ghost. The question burned at the tip of his tongue to ask. Unfortunately, there were three other people at the table and an entire restaurant they had already entertained more than he would have liked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, Jadon did as he was told. He set the glass of water down on the table and moved to take his seat. It was a round table, the only vacant chair was between the woman and his father. Just as his hand landed on the back of the chair to pull it out, the woman jumped out of her chair and announced she needed the bathroom. Then she was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay? Jadon wasn&#39;t sure he shouldn&#39;t take that personally, but it clearly looked as though the woman was running away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell is wrong with that girl?&#34; Angela hissed even as her eyes darted around as though to make sure their table was no longer the center of attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think she&#39;s just nervous,&#34; Asher answered with a light chuckle. &#34;Meeting the parents and all that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jadon paused as he settled himself in his seat. He arched a brow at his brother and finally asked the question. &#34;She&#39;s your girlfriend?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a heartbeat, Asher&#39;s smile widened. He nodded. &#34;Yes. That&#39;s Tapiwa. Sorry again that I didn&#39;t introduce you two the other night. But I thought today would be perfect so she could meet everyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You could still have given us a heads-up,&#34; Angela muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It pained Jadon to agree with his mother, but he did. He would have liked to have some warning that there would be a breathtaking, beautiful woman at his dinner celebration. Wait, what? Jadon mentally shook his head. Tapiwa was Asher&#39;s girlfriend and however strange his reaction had been to the woman, he reminded himself to take his mind firmly off her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That resolve only worked for the five minutes it took for Tapiwa to return to their table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still looking as unsettled as she had been before she fled to the bathroom, Tapiwa&#39;s eyes darted toward Jadon and then dropped to the table. She didn&#39;t sit down. &#34;Uhm Thank you so much for the invitation here tonight,&#34; she said carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was running. The realization hit Jadon before the words left her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Uhm. I&#39;m not feeling too well. So, I&#39;m just going to go home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher stood, concern etched on his face. &#34;Are you sure? Maybe you could just sit down for a minute?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa shook her head no. She gripped the back of the chair she had occupied as though to steady herself and then met Asher&#39;s gaze. &#34;I&#39;m sorry. I just need to get home.&#34; After a brief hesitation, she turned and faced Lewis and Angela. &#34;It was really a pleasure meeting you both.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jadon expected her to look at him, but she didn&#39;t. Tapiwa turned on her heels and walked away from the table. He was almost amazed she didn&#39;t literally run away as though the hounds of hell were on her heels. But then, maybe it had something to do with the fact that Asher had a hand on the small of her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unsure what to think of everything, Jadon sighed and turned his attention back to the table. That&#39;s when he realized both his parents were watching him. &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know the young woman?&#34; Lewis asked evenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jadon frowned at his father. &#34;I never met her before tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure?&#34; Angela pressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I would remember if I had.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Angela looked unimpressed. She scoffed and then reached for her glass of wine. &#34;I hope so. The last thing we need is to find out you went out with your brother&#39;s girlfriend. Even though I really don&#39;t understand what Asher sees in the girl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s the daughter of your friend,&#34; Lewis stated, arching a brow at his wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That got Jadon&#39;s attention. He looked at his mother. &#34;What friend?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Angela waved a dismissive hand in the air. &#34;An old friend. And it doesn&#39;t change the fact that the girl isn&#39;t suited for Asher.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jadon met his father&#39;s gaze and caught the subtle shake of his head. Lewis was telling him to just let it go like he always did. Jadon didn&#39;t argue. He had no desire to rouse his mother&#39;s anger this evening. It was his birthday after all. The least he could do was enjoy the meal without Angela Paterson focusing her irritation on him like she usually did if he voiced his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Angela only had the patience and love of a mother for one of her sons and that wasn&#39;t Jadon. Asher could do no wrong in his mother&#39;s eyes. On the other hand, Jadon could never seem to do anything right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right on cue, the golden child walked back to the table minus his girlfriend. Jadon suppressed the immediate need he felt to ask if she was okay. Really, he couldn&#39;t understand his instant fascination with the woman but he had to ignore it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher sat down and sighed. &#34;Sorry about that. She&#39;s gone home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is she getting home? I thought you would take her,&#34; Lewis said with a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Angela didn&#39;t miss a beat. &#34;Oh, for god&#39;s sake. The girl can perfectly make her own way home. Now, let&#39;s get on with this dinner already.&#34; She lifted her hand to signal for the waiter, clearly indicating that the topic was closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jadon wasn&#39;t surprised. He sank back in his seat and drew a quiet breath. God, he wanted the dinner to be over already.</p>
