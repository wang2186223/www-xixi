                <p>It was already past one in the afternoon but Jadon looked so put together in a navy blue suit and white shirt. It might have been due to the cool air circulating the entire building, but the man didn&#39;t even look as though he had sweated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa on the other hand, felt as though she had been chasing chickens in the sun for hours for how sweaty and dusty she felt standing there in yet another awfully clean space. Shifting her weight from one foot to the other, Tapiwa began to wonder if a phone call would have been such a bad idea. It would have saved her from standing under his scrutinizing gaze and feeling like a sample under a microscope. Thankfully, Jadon spoke and saved her from doing something embarrassing like dusting her skirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hadn&#39;t thought I would hear from you again after you cut my call short.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa fidgeted again and then brought her hands together in front of her, clasping them together. The man hadn&#39;t offered her a seat. She wished he had. Her legs felt shaky but she squared her shoulders and met his gaze. &#34;If I had my way you wouldn&#39;t have. But if you must know Asher had shown up at my church so I had to cut the call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jadon&#39;s brows dipped into a deeper frown. &#34;I had no idea he attended the same church as you. I actually had no idea he went to church at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t know whether your brother attends church or not?&#34; Tapiwa asked only half curious by the fact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t spend my time tracking my brother&#39;s every move,&#34; Jadon snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe you should,&#34; Tapiwa fired back. She suddenly felt a wave of irritation wash over her at the drama of everything and how she was stuck in the middle of it. It didn&#39;t help that Jadon sounded accusatory and Tapiwa felt the sudden urge to defend herself. &#34;Then you would know that he only came to my church because my mother invited him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jadon pursed his lips apparently not pleased by that explanation. &#34;I see,&#34; he said flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa narrowed her eyes, not understanding his problem. But then she huffed out a breath and waved a hand in the air. &#34;Look, I didn&#39;t come here to discuss Asher.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nodding once, Jadon finally pointed at the visitor&#39;s chair in front of him. &#34;Then sit down and tell me why you are here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grateful to get off her feet, Tapiwa lowered herself into the chair only to regret it a second later when she realized how close she was to Jadon and that she had to tilt her head back a little to meet his gaze. A gaze that was so intense she couldn&#39;t look away. &#34;Uhm&#34; Tapiwa lost her train of thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jadon continued to stare for a minute then he seemed to snap out of it. Abruptly, Jadon straightened away from the desk and walked over to the wall of glass. Tension pulsed in the air. Tapiwa wasn&#39;t sure what was happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, what brought you here?&#34; Jadon asked in a harsh tone without looking at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right. Tapiwa shook her head and tried to gather her thoughts. &#34;Someone attacked me and tried to drown me in a pool yesterday,&#34; she blurted out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jadon turned so fast that Tapiwa almost thought he would topple over and fall. For a moment, he just stared at her. Then, like a man possessed, he rushed back to her and pulled her out of her seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jadon held Tapiwa by her arms and looked her up and down before focusing back on her face. &#34;Are you okay? What happened? Who attacked you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shocked by the strong emotion in his voice, Tapiwa shook her head. Realizing she wouldn&#39;t be able to talk if she kept looking at him, she dropped her gaze. He was just too close. So close she was swamped by his warmth and scent. It made her dizzy and grateful he was holding her steady. &#34;Uhm I don&#39;t know who it was. Maybe the man who followed me the other day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you talking about?&#34; Jadon demanded, his hands tightening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa realized she would have to explain things. So, she did. She told Jadon about the man on the road she thought had been following her. Then she narrated the ordeal at the pool and the message she had been given for him. Tapiwa hadn&#39;t realized she was trembling until Jadon wrapped his arms around her and whispered in her ear that she would be okay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost as though in a daze, Tapiwa leaned her entire body against Jadon&#39;s. Her cheek came to rest on his shirt-covered firm chest while her hands fisted in his jacket. It felt good. She felt safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jadon rubbed his hands over her back seemingly just as lost in the hold as she was. But then he pressed his lips to her forehead and kissed her there. Without thinking, Tapiwa lifted her head off his chest and tilted it back for a better angle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something sparked in the air, holding them in place. Their gazes met and held for a beat before Jadon lowered his head again and this time his lips brushed over hers in a feather-light kiss. Tapiwa gasped as though an electric current had just traveled through her body firing up every nerve ending.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, it also awakened some of her brain cells and Tapiwa knew it was a very bad idea to be kissing Jadon Paterson. Another gasp escaped her lips but this one was filled with horror. As though sensing the sudden change, Jadon let go of her and stepped back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa didn&#39;t wait to hear what he had to say, or what he would do. Maybe he realized it was also a mistake. She couldn&#39;t wait to find out. She turned on her heels and ran for the door. Tapiwa had to get away before she allowed this man to do something they would surely both regret.</p>
