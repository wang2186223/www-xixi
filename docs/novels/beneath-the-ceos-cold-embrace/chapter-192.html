                <p>Victoria&#39;s eyes widened in shock, and she struggled fiercely, but the difference in strength between men and women was too great. She was held tightly in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long while, he finally let her go. Looking at the breathless Victoria in his arms, he curved his thin lips into a smile. &#34;Victoria, you can&#39;t escape.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he ignored her angry expression and turned to leave the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria stood there, staring blankly at William&#39;s retreating figure, unable to snap out of it for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suddenly remembered all the things he had done to her in the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hurt and humiliation, the protection and indulgence, all intertwined into a dense web that enveloped her completely, leaving her nowhere to hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, she took out a small mirror from her bag, tidied up her appearance, and, after confirming there was nothing amiss, turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the hallway, Samuel asked softly, &#34;Finished talking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34; Victoria&#39;s expression was calm, with no intention of hiding anything. &#34;He wants to sue my mom for Ms. Scott.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel was taken aback and instinctively asked, &#34;You&#39;re not against it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was silent for a moment before speaking softly, &#34;My mom is the kind of person who will stop at nothing to achieve her goals, regardless of the consequences. If she really hurt Ms. Scott, I have no right to oppose William&#39;s actions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel gazed at her quietly, then gently put his arm around her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria suddenly remembered something and looked up at him. &#34;What were you talking about with Ms. Scott earlier?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just some casual conversation,&#34; Samuel thought for a moment and added, &#34;More like an elder showing concern for a younger person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just a moment ago, Daisy had told him that once William set his sights on someone, his possessiveness would be unimaginably strong, and no one could predict what he might do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel didn&#39;t comment on this, just smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever William wanted to do, he was welcome to try.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more William did, the more he would push Victoria towards him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William was very efficient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In just one night, all news reports about Nora&#39;s suicide were taken down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the search terms were gone, and the media received a strict gag order. Anyone who wanted to stay in the industry had to keep their mouths shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the power of capital-arrogant and domineering, yet leaving people helpless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although there were still some sporadic discussions online, it wouldn&#39;t be long before they were replaced by other hot news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria went to Samuel&#39;s studio as usual to pick up the monthly paintings, thinking that she might be able to have lunch with Samuel afterward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the studio, Ryan was working on his laptop. When he saw Victoria come in, he was slightly taken aback, a hint of hesitation flashing across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victoria, you&#39;re here.&#34; Ryan stood up, greeting her somewhat awkwardly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I&#39;m here to pick up this month&#39;s paintings.&#34; Victoria responded with a smile, her eyes searching the studio for Samuel. &#34;Where&#39;s Samuel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He has a public lecture at the university today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; Victoria sighed in disappointment. &#34;I&#39;ll just take the paintings and go then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait a minute!&#34; Ryan called out to her. &#34;Victoria.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria stopped and turned to look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stared at each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan pressed his lips together, not saying anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria, sensing something was off, raised an eyebrow in confusion. &#34;What&#39;s wrong with you? You seem weird.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan hesitated for a long time before finally speaking. &#34;Victoria, I need to tell you something, but don&#39;t get mad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it? Why so serious?&#34; Victoria looked calm, with no sign of panic in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just found out that Samuel&#39;s dad is setting him up on a blind date tonight,&#34; Ryan blurted out, his eyes fixed on Victoria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria paused for a moment, then her expression returned to normal. &#34;I see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan was surprised. He had expected Victoria to be furious and question him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But her extraordinary calmness left him at a loss. &#34;You&#39;re not mad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mad? Why would I be mad?&#34; Victoria asked lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shrugged and continued, &#34;It might just be a well-meaning gesture from his parents. Nothing to make a fuss about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aside from that initial moment of surprise, Victoria remained exceptionally composed, genuinely seeming to trust Samuel from the bottom of her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan frowned in suspicion. &#34;This doesn&#39;t seem right!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria looked puzzled. &#34;What&#39;s not right? Trusting each other in a relationship is the most basic requirement, isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That depends on the situation! You&#39;re way too calm. This isn&#39;t how someone should react when they hear their boyfriend is going on a blind date. Can anyone be this rational in a relationship?&#34; Ryan stared at her in confusion. &#34;Victoria, do you really not care at all about Samuel going on a blind date?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t care. He&#39;s probably just humoring his dad. Nothing to worry about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you considered that the blind date was arranged by Samuel&#39;s dad? It might mean he doesn&#39;t approve of you as Samuel&#39;s girlfriend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria hadn&#39;t thought about it that way. She frowned slightly and said slowly, &#34;Why does it have to be so complicated?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course it is! Dating might be between two people, but marriage involves two families. Many couples end up divorcing because of conflicts with their in-laws. Samuel really loves you, and I hope you two can make it. You need to handle these issues properly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria hadn&#39;t thought that far ahead. She looked at Ryan in shock. &#34;Wow, Ryan, you, a single guy, can think so far ahead and so much!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan glared at her. &#34;I don&#39;t usually think this much, but Samuel is my good friend, so I worry more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria laughed. &#34;You&#39;re really a good friend to him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But are you just going to wait? Wait for him to come clean with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria shook her head with a smile. &#34;It&#39;s fine if he doesn&#39;t. Everyone&#39;s entitled to some secrets.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan&#39;s expression changed slightly, and he cautiously asked, &#34;What if it were William? If you knew he was going on a blind date, would you be just as indifferent?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was about to say &#34;I wouldn&#39;t,&#34; but the words got stuck in her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strange feeling of suffocation rose in her chest, as if something was lodged in her throat, unable to go up or down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t need to say anything; her reaction said it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan pressed his lips together, deliberated for a moment, and then spoke softly. &#34;Victoria, your current boyfriend is Samuel. You need to step into your role as his girlfriend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a friend, Ryan was very considerate and usually wouldn&#39;t bring up such personal matters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He must have been really concerned to speak up for Samuel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria opened her mouth, but the words she wanted to say were swallowed back. In the end, she just smiled gently and said softly, &#34;I understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that she had listened, Ryan was silent for a moment before continuing. &#34;There&#39;s one more thing. Samuel didn&#39;t want me to tell you, fearing you&#39;d get angry. But I think you should know the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, as if making a decision, and then said, &#34;When your dad had an accident in Xandria, Samuel found out and immediately took leave from school, bought a ticket for the earliest flight, and went to find you. But...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s expression turned serious. &#34;But what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But someone reported him for laundering money through high-priced paintings.&#34;</p>
