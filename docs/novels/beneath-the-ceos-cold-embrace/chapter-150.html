                <p>The sharp sound of a knife piercing flesh echoed through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William let out a muffled groan, and bright red blood trickled down the handle, pooling on the pristine white floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;William!&#34; Alice screamed, her face pale with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William clutched his abdomen, panting heavily, beads of sweat forming on his forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing him in such pain, Alice quickly helped him sit down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Call an ambulance, now!&#34; she urgently instructed the bodyguard standing outside the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alvin hadn&#39;t expected Victoria to be in so much pain, and he felt a pang of regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he had known it would turn out like this, he wouldn&#39;t have gone along with Alice&#39;s plan to find them. He just wanted Victoria to break up with William for good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Scott family&#39;s situation was too complicated, and Victoria was too kind-hearted and naive. William was not right for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But who could have predicted this outcome?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had chased Victoria all the way back home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Victoria got home, she slammed the door shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alvin knew she was in a state of emotional collapse, and it wasn&#39;t the right time to talk. He could only wait outside for her to process everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria curled up on her bed, hugging herself, silent tears streaming down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William, William, how could you be so cruel?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her vision blurred, and her tears soaked the pillow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never doubted William&#39;s feelings for her, but at this moment, she realized how wrong she had been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had foolishly fallen in love with an enemy!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria lay on the bed in a daze, memories of William&#39;s handsome, gentle face, his affectionate smiles, and his kisses flashing before her eyes, as if it all happened just yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was all a lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, Victoria opened her eyes to find the room filled with daylight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared blankly at the light seeping through the curtains for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She groggily opened the door to go to the bathroom, but stopped in her tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alvin was curled up by the door, leaning against the wall, his head drooping wearily. It was clear he had been sitting there all night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hair was disheveled, streaked with gray, and the morning light made it look even more striking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face was etched with exhaustion and weariness, and his usually straight back was slightly hunched, as if he had aged ten years overnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s heart tightened, and her eyes instantly welled up with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never expected Alvin to stay by the door all night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last night, she had been heartbroken, crying her eyes out in her room, completely oblivious to Alvin&#39;s feelings. Now, thinking back, Alvin must have been in just as much pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad,&#34; she called softly, her voice thick with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alvin&#39;s body trembled, and he slowly lifted his head, his bloodshot eyes filled with worry and affection as he looked at Victoria. &#34;Victoria, you&#39;re awake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried to stand up, but his legs were numb from sitting too long, and he almost fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria quickly supported Alvin, her hand touching his cold arm, and she couldn&#39;t hold back her tears any longer. &#34;Dad, why did you sit here all night? You didn&#39;t have to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alvin steadied himself and gently patted Victoria&#39;s hand, forcing a smile. &#34;I was worried about you. Hearing you cry in your room last night broke my heart. I know you&#39;re hurting, but I don&#39;t want to see you give up. The Carter family has been through so much, but as long as we have each other, we can get through anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria threw herself into Alvin&#39;s arms, sobbing uncontrollably. &#34;Dad, I&#39;m sorry. I shouldn&#39;t have been so impulsive and made you worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought about her attitude towards Alvin last night and felt a deep sense of regret. Alvin had already sacrificed so much for the family and endured so much suffering. How could she continue to be so reckless?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alvin held Victoria, gently stroking her hair. &#34;Hey, it&#39;s not your fault. I should have protected you better. I promise you, I won&#39;t let you suffer like this again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They held each other for a long time until Victoria&#39;s emotions gradually calmed down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sniffled and said, &#34;Dad, don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m okay now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alvin released her and looked at her kindly. &#34;Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria nodded firmly, forcing a smile. &#34;It&#39;s just a guy. Besides, it was never going to work out between us. I won&#39;t waste my tears on someone like him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alvin was relieved to hear her words. &#34;That&#39;s the spirit. As long as you can move on, I&#39;ll be at ease. Now go freshen up, and I&#39;ll make you breakfast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daisy arrived at the hospital, William was in surgery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked up to Alice and suddenly slapped her across the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice was caught off guard and stunned by the blow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alice, if anything happens to William, I&#39;ll kill you!&#34; Daisy roared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes were filled with a chilling fury, and she looked like she wanted to tear Alice apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice clutched her reddened cheek, her eyes dim. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, Ms. Scott. I never thought things would turn out this way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy laughed bitterly. &#34;Alice, I thought you were a bit crazy, but I believed you genuinely loved William, so I didn&#39;t oppose your relationship or even your marriage. But look at what you&#39;ve done. Do you know how many times he&#39;s been hurt because of you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice gritted her teeth, saying nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy sneered. &#34;I&#39;m warning you, stay away from William from now on. Stop bringing him trouble!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice&#39;s eyes reddened, and she shook her head. &#34;I can&#39;t leave William. Without him, I&#39;d die.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy gave her a look of disgust. &#34;Enough. Whether you live or die is none of my business. You better pray William is okay, or else...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could finish, the door to the operating room opened, and the doctor wheeled William out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy and Alice rushed over. &#34;Doctor, how is he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor removed his mask, revealing a face that was both unfamiliar and familiar. &#34;William lost a lot of blood and is out of immediate danger, but...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy and Alice&#39;s faces paled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor sighed. &#34;He needs to stay in the hospital for observation. If his recovery doesn&#39;t go well, he might need to be moved to the ICU.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; Daisy said politely, nodding in gratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice stood in a daze for a moment, then hurried to William&#39;s bedside, leaning over him and whispering, &#34;William, wake up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy stared at William&#39;s pale face, her brows furrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Alice so worried, she knew it would be impossible to make her leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was a hospital, and forcibly dragging Alice out could cause a scene. If things got out of hand and affected the Scott family&#39;s reputation, it would be bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After much consideration, Daisy finally decided to hold back her anger and wait until William woke up to deal with it.</p>
