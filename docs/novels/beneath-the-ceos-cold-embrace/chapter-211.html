                <p>Carol was already trying to shoo Victoria and Diana away, and with Wendy worried about Carol&#39;s depression, even if they wanted to stand up for her, it would be pointless if she didn&#39;t cooperate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they walked out of the hospital room, Diana grew increasingly frustrated, gritting her teeth. &#34;Hasn&#39;t she had enough of this misery? We&#39;re clearly trying to help her, can&#39;t she just be strong for once?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was in a foul mood too. Seeing Wendy&#39;s condition made her think of herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Nora hadn&#39;t physically abused her when she was young, the long-term mental torment and suffocating oppression had nearly driven her to the brink of collapse. If Alvin hadn&#39;t come back, she might not have escaped the fate of being forced to sacrifice by Nora.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In comparison, how much better off was she really?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Diana spoke up, &#34;Victoria, look over there. Isn&#39;t that Samuel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria followed her gaze and saw Samuel, indeed. He was talking to a doctor, looking focused and serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the few days since she last saw him, he seemed to have lost weight, with a faint stubble on his chin and a tired look on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the doctor gave some instructions and left, Samuel turned around and his eyes met Victoria&#39;s. He paused for a moment before walking over to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victoria, what are you doing here?&#34; Samuel&#39;s voice was hoarse and low, filled with obvious fatigue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wendy&#39;s in the hospital. I came to see her. What about you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s my dad.&#34; His voice carried a hint of bitterness, and he forced a wry smile. &#34;He&#39;s pretty sick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was taken aback and quickly asked, &#34;What did the doctor say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve contacted a specialist team from Harborview City. The surgery is scheduled for next month.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Diana, sensing the need for privacy, quietly stepped back to give Victoria and Samuel some space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was shocked by the news. No wonder Samuel had been out of touch these past few days-this was what had been going on!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep sense of guilt welled up inside her. As his girlfriend, she hadn&#39;t been there for him during such a critical time. &#34;Samuel, I...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Samuel!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A clear voice called out from the other end of the hallway. It was Hannah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She waved at him with a bright smile. &#34;Mr. Brown is looking for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel&#39;s expression changed instantly. He looked at Victoria first, hurriedly explaining, &#34;I didn&#39;t ask her to come.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Hannah, Victoria understood a bit more. She nodded. &#34;I get it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She continued, &#34;Mr. and Mrs. Brown both like her. With her here, you can be more at ease.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel should have been pleased with Victoria&#39;s understanding, but his feelings were complicated. A subtle, indescribable sense of loss crept into his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had already taken leave from school, managing the company for Elmer while also taking care of him at the hospital. He was utterly exhausted, with no energy left for sadness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria spoke softly, &#34;With Ms. Wright here, I won&#39;t go visit your father now. Call me when the time is right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want Samuel to be caught between her and his parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel gazed at her for a moment, then slowly looked away and nodded. &#34;I&#39;ll head back now. I&#39;ll contact you later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Samuel.&#34; Victoria called out to him, biting her lip with an apologetic look. &#34;I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t know until now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head with a bitter smile. &#34;How could this be your fault? It just happened recently.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised his hand as if to touch her cheek but stopped midway and slowly lowered it. &#34;You have your entrance exams in two weeks. I might not be able to be there with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m confident. Just take care of Mr. Brown.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been spending all her time outside of work studying. With her strong foundation and Samuel&#39;s previous tutoring, she was well-prepared for the exams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want to burden him with her issues. He had enough on his plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel looked at her silently for a long time before sighing. &#34;Alright, I&#39;ll go now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; Watching him walk away, Victoria felt a pang of heartache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seemed to have lost a lot of weight. The once confident and spirited Samuel now looked so worn and defeated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bad feeling rose in Victoria&#39;s heart. She felt that the distance between her and Samuel was growing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows furrowed with a hint of worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Diana came over and patted her shoulder. &#34;Victoria, don&#39;t overthink it. I heard from a friend that Elmer&#39;s been unwell for a long time. He delayed going to the hospital, and now it&#39;s serious. Samuel must feel really guilty for not taking better care of him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria nodded. &#34;I understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that Victoria was preoccupied, Diana didn&#39;t press the matter further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day, at dawn, Victoria hurried to the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She went straight upstairs to find Tony and ask about Nora&#39;s condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her deep-seated resentment towards Nora, as a daughter, she couldn&#39;t completely abandon her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tony informed her that Nora was stalling, neither agreeing to the surgery nor clearly refusing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But her health was deteriorating, and she couldn&#39;t afford to delay much longer. The hospital had no choice but to ask Victoria to try and persuade her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let her be,&#34; Victoria said, surprisingly calm. &#34;She doesn&#39;t want Bobby to lose his health because of her. But Bobby&#39;s Medical Parole was granted for the transplant surgery. If he doesn&#39;t get it, he&#39;ll be sent back to prison. That&#39;s why she&#39;s stuck. If I were the donor, I&#39;d probably be on the operating table by now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tony sighed helplessly. For now, they could only wait. &#34;I&#39;ll try to contact Bobby and have him talk to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria didn&#39;t say much more. Asking someone to give up their health for another was a form of moral coercion, even among family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, whatever Nora and Bobby decided was their business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The she went to visit Wendy&#39;s room, only to be told by a nurse that Wendy had already been discharged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria felt a surge of anxiety and quickly took out her phone to call Wendy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This line is currently busy. Please try your call again shortly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s heart raced. She tried again, but it was still busy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She called Diana, asking her to find a way to contact Wendy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After making those arrangements, she headed to Elmer&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knocked gently, and after a moment, the door opened to reveal Hannah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah&#39;s eyes flickered as she looked Victoria up and down. A woman as striking as Victoria was hard to forget, especially since she was the girlfriend of the man Hannah admired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria hadn&#39;t expected her to be there. After a brief pause, she nodded slightly and said softly, &#34;I&#39;m here to see Mr. Brown.&#34;</p>
