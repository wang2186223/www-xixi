                <p>As a junior employee, she could only snag a seat in the back row of the audience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After finding an empty spot, she leaned back and closed her eyes, hoping the event would wrap up soon so she could head back to her room and rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delmar took the stage, officially kicking off the event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s head felt heavy, and the host&#39;s voice seemed distant and muffled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until Marcella took the stage, greeted by thunderous applause, that Victoria was jolted awake. She forced her eyes open and looked toward the center of the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcella, with her elegant demeanor, began with a thank-you speech, then launched into a detailed account of her unique creativity and the challenges she overcame to present the award-winning piece.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria, exhausted, closed her eyes again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe Marcella&#39;s confidence was too overwhelming, or the atmosphere too lively, but the host decided to add an impromptu Q&amp;A session.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcella&#39;s previously triumphant expression faltered for a moment but quickly returned to her charming smile. &#34;Sure,&#34; she said cheerfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The audience, full of industry peers, was very supportive. Someone immediately raised a hand and asked, &#34;Ms. Simpson, your design concept is incredibly innovative. How did you get the inspiration to blend traditional elements with modern style so seamlessly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, at that time, I...&#34; Marcella maintained her polite smile, but inside, she was panicking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This project was from months ago, and she barely remembered the details. Many of the creative ideas had come from Victoria. How was she supposed to answer this suddenly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Marcella was quick on her feet. Smiling, she said into the microphone, &#34;Such a basic question. I&#39;ll let my assistant answer it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, pretending to be playful, she added, &#34;Come on, ask me something more challenging!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The host began looking for Victoria. &#34;Ms. Simpson, where is your assistant?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcella raised her voice, &#34;Victoria? Come on up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To the audience, it seemed like she was giving her assistant a chance to shine. Who wouldn&#39;t praise her for being so considerate?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria slowly stood up, her face pale. She stared at Marcella. Others might not notice, but she could see the warning in Marcella&#39;s eyes despite her smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria remained calm. She believed she was just doing her job. When she learned Marcella would represent Starry Studio Gallery to accept the award, she didn&#39;t mind. She certainly wouldn&#39;t expose Marcella now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she felt so unwell that she had to pinch her palm hard to stay alert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking the microphone from the host, Victoria clearly explained the design concept, the source of inspiration, and the integration process.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She even answered potential follow-up questions in detail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone started clapping, and soon the whole room erupted in applause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Delmar, sitting in the audience, nodded in approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If even a junior employee could explain things so clearly, it showed that Starry Studio Gallery was truly full of talent!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcella kept smiling, but she was furious inside. She had only asked Victoria to answer a simple question. Who told her to go on and on?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now it seemed like Victoria was trying to make it clear that most of the credit for the project belonged to her, not Marcella!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria didn&#39;t plan to stay on stage. Seeing that the host had more questions, she bowed slightly to the audience and turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after a few steps, she seemed to remember something and turned back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcella&#39;s smile froze again. She glared at Victoria and whispered, &#34;What are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria ignored her, picked up the microphone, and said firmly, &#34;Just to clarify, I&#39;m not Ms. Simpson&#39;s assistant. I&#39;m a full-time employee at Starry Studio Gallery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then put down the microphone and walked off the stage steadily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delmar smiled, his eyes following Victoria. He turned to the person next to him and said, &#34;This young lady is interesting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcella stood on stage with a forced smile. She was supposed to be the star, but Victoria had stolen the spotlight!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The original plan was to return in three days, but Marcella showed no intention of leaving. Terrence, busy with work, had to return to Silvermist City first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria had planned to go back with Terrence, but Marcella insisted she stay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victoria, you need to remember, you&#39;re working for me,&#34; Marcella said casually while painting her nails. &#34;I still have some loose ends to tie up here, and I need your help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria saw Terrence off downstairs. Terrence had a good impression of her and gave her some advice before leaving. &#34;Marcella&#39;s dad is our boss. Just go along with what she says. Don&#39;t oppose her. She&#39;s just a bit spoiled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand. Thank you, Mr. Wheeler.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Terrence&#39;s car drove away, Victoria stood there for a long time before slowly looking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t afraid of Marcella&#39;s pettiness. The real reason she didn&#39;t want to stay was William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victoria?&#34; A voice called from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria turned to see a tall, handsome young man standing there. Despite the maturity and worldliness that time had added to his face, his innate vitality was still evident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria instantly recognized him. It was Alton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years ago, Victoria had met him while working on a home exhibition project for the Bridges Group in Silvermist City.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, Alton was cheerful and wealthy, a golden boy in everyone&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alton had fallen for Victoria at first sight and publicly confessed his feelings, which led to his ex-girlfriend Sofia injuring Victoria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William had intervened, and the Moore family had apologized and compensated Victoria, preventing Sofia from being sent to jail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, Victoria was sent by the gallery to Harborview City to work on another exhibition for the Bridges Group, where she worked with Alton again for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that project, Victoria hadn&#39;t seen him again. She had only heard that the Bridges Group&#39;s investments had failed, their funds had dried up, and they had declared bankruptcy two years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alton had gone from a carefree rich kid to an ordinary young man working hard in the corporate world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria hadn&#39;t expected to run into him here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victoria, what a coincidence! I can&#39;t believe I ran into you here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alton looked genuinely happy. &#34;How about we find a place to sit and catch up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria didn&#39;t want to go back upstairs to face Marcella, so she agreed and followed him to the hotel&#39;s lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, you&#39;re here for the exchange event?&#34; Alton asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, accompanying our gallery manager.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alton sighed. &#34;Honestly, I admire you. You&#39;ve stuck to your dreams all these years, not letting anything distract you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria smiled and looked at him. &#34;Where are you working now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alton pulled a business card from his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re the Sales Director at the Scott family&#39;s Infinity Unity Group?&#34;</p>
