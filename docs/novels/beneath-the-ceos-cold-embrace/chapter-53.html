                <p>Victoria suddenly looked up and locked eyes with Samuel, her heart doing a little flip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel caught her panicked look and a mischievous glint appeared in his eyes. He leaned in closer, his warm breath tickling her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria instinctively tried to back away, but Samuel moved even closer, pinning her against the car window with nowhere to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Samuel, what are you doing?&#34; Victoria&#39;s voice wavered, and she felt the mix of tobacco and his body wash scent surrounding her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His presence was overwhelming, and she felt like she was drowning in a sea of fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel didn&#39;t say a word, just placed a gentle kiss on her forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was stunned, her mind going blank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until Samuel pulled back that she snapped out of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Samuel, you!&#34; Victoria was at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel gave a small smile and said softly, &#34;Don&#39;t worry; I&#39;m not going to rush you. Take your time. I&#39;ve got plenty of patience.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria hesitated for a moment before nodding, her cheeks turning pink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel then settled back in his seat, started the car, and headed towards Victoria&#39;s place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dropped her off at her apartment entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria got out of the car and turned to thank him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel grabbed a box of nutritional supplements from the trunk and handed it to her. &#34;I&#39;ve noticed you haven&#39;t been sleeping well, so I got these sleep aids for you. Make sure to use them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was touched by his thoughtfulness. She pressed her lips together, took the box, and thanked him sincerely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was about to leave, Samuel called out to her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, by the way, my parents are coming back soon. They heard their bachelor son finally has a love life and want to invite you to dinner. Would you be up for it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was caught off guard and was about to refuse, but Samuel quickly added, &#34;No pressure. It&#39;s just that I&#39;ve never had a girlfriend, and they keep questioning if there&#39;s something wrong with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rubbed his temples in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria couldn&#39;t help but laugh. After a moment, she nodded and agreed, &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel smiled, a glint of satisfaction in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They set a time to meet, and Samuel drove off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Victoria walked through her door, her phone rang. It was Nora.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment of hesitation, she answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nora&#39;s cold, mocking voice came through, &#34;Victoria, living the high life now and forgetting about me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria frowned, her tone icy. &#34;If you&#39;re calling to give me grief, I&#39;m hanging up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you dare!&#34; Nora snapped, &#34;I&#39;m your mother! Have you no conscience?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria sneered, &#34;Conscience? Mom, do you remember what you and Bobby have done recently?&#34; Her voice cracked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nora was silent for a moment before recovering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Those were just minor things. Why are you being so petty? We&#39;re family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Locking me in the basement,&#34; Victoria said, her voice dangerously low, &#34;almost killing me and subjecting me to online harassment. You call those minor things?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nora was speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria took a deep breath, trying to keep her anger and sadness in check. &#34;What do you want from me today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria had lost all hope and just wanted to know what Nora had to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nora hesitated for a moment before slowly saying, &#34;The hospital is demanding payment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria knew that Nora only ever contacted her for money, but she still held onto a tiny sliver of hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, Nora was still the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking of this, Victoria hung up the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nora, hearing the busy tone, angrily threw her phone on the ground, shattering the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria actually hung up on her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuming, Nora cursed, &#34;Ungrateful brat, even a dog would be more grateful than you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nurse entering the room heard Nora&#39;s sharp curses, knowing instantly they were directed at Victoria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They said women could empathize with women.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nora, as a mother, was beyond heartless and unfair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been staying in a high-end VIP hospital room for months, all paid for by Victoria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet every time Victoria visited, she never received a kind word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nora was always attentive and caring towards Bobby, who constantly asked her for money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria had been hospitalized several times, and Nora acted as if nothing had happened, completely indifferent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nurse thought that if it were her, she would have gone mad long ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mother like that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though the nurse was silently cursing, she still picked up the phone and placed it on the bedside table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Adams, are you alright?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nora glared at her and snapped, &#34;Why so much nonsense! Give me my medicine!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nurse rolled her eyes, handed Nora the medicine bottle, and reminded her, &#34;Ms. Adams, the medical fees your daughter paid for you have all been used up. If you don&#39;t pay the remaining fees in the next few days, we&#39;ll have to discharge you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Nora immediately got angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She retorted, &#34;What do you mean? Are you saying I can&#39;t afford to pay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the nurse shrugged and said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nora, furious, pointed at the nurse and yelled, &#34;Get out now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nurse, uninterested in arguing, left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room fell silent, and Nora, clutching the medicine bottle, was seething with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no choice but to call Victoria again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that time, Victoria was focused on revising her competition entry. When she finally checked her phone, she saw that Nora had called numerous times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rubbed her temples and redialed. &#34;Victoria, are you crazy?!&#34; Nora&#39;s voice exploded through the phone. &#34;Why didn&#39;t you answer my calls?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria replied, &#34;I have no money. I can&#39;t help you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How dare you speak to me like that?&#34; Nora shouted, &#34;I&#39;m being mistreated here. The nurses look at me like I&#39;m a plague, afraid I&#39;ll stick around! Victoria, can you really bear to see me kicked out of the hospital and die?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you, I have no money. Don&#39;t you understand?&#34; Victoria was also angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had tolerated Nora enough, but Nora kept pushing, thinking she was easy to bully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Nora was momentarily speechless, but she didn&#39;t believe Victoria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Victoria&#39;s sugar daddy was William from the Scott family, a billionaire family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could she have no money?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was just angry and didn&#39;t want to help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nora knew Victoria was decisive and strong-willed, not afraid of confrontation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nora took a deep breath, trying to calm her anger, and gently persuaded, &#34;Victoria, even if you&#39;re mad at me, you can&#39;t ignore your father. The house has been auctioned off. If he knew I was kicked out of the hospital and homeless, how heartbroken would he be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria laughed coldly, mocking, &#34;The luxury apartment Bobby lives in was secretly bought by you in his name, right? Why don&#39;t you move in with him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nora&#39;s heart skipped a beat at Victoria&#39;s words.</p>
