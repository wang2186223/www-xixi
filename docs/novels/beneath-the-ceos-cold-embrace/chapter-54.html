                <p>She kept this matter very secret. When she found out that Alvin was in trouble, she quietly sold her jewelry and exchanged it for gold bars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the fuss had died down, she used the money to buy an apartment in the center of Silvermist City, making it convenient for Bobby to attend school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought she had been very discreet. Even when she was hospitalized and had no money, she didn&#39;t use it. Who knew that Victoria found out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nora felt extremely guilty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stammered in rebuttal, &#34;What nonsense are you talking about? How could I have such skills!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria sneered, she had guessed that Nora wouldn&#39;t want to admit it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria didn&#39;t say anything, and Nora pitifully said, &#34;Victoria, are you really going to ignore me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A trace of mockery flashed in Victoria&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is Nora, always taking and never giving!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nora said many nice things, but Victoria remained unmoved. She had long lost her patience with Nora&#39;s act and was well aware of her cold-hearted nature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She decided to break off with her, &#34;Mom, you took that one million dollars from me when you tricked me into signing the settlement agreement with Ella without any guilt. Bobby betrayed me and helped Ella cyberbully me, he must have received a lot of money too, right? Now you come to me for money; do you think it&#39;s appropriate? Do you really think I&#39;m a bank, giving you money whenever you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the end, Victoria&#39;s heart, which had already turned cold, still ached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hadn&#39;t she decided to live her own life and not be sad for unworthy people anymore?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did she still feel heartbroken and upset when she heard Nora&#39;s words!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria closed her eyes, and when she opened them again, her expression had returned to indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have no money for you, figure it out yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nora&#39;s face turned red with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, she took a few deep breaths to calm herself, then said in a deep voice, &#34;Victoria, considering our mother-daughter relationship, as long as you obediently pay my medical bills, I won&#39;t make things difficult for you. But since you are so ungrateful, don&#39;t blame me for being ruthless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll give you three days. If you don&#39;t pay the remaining medical bills, I&#39;ll expose your sexual relationship agreement with William online, let everyone see how disgraceful Joshua&#39;s student is. By then, not only will you be ruined, but your teacher&#39;s reputation will be destroyed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After saying this, Nora couldn&#39;t wait to hang up the phone, afraid that Victoria would continue to pester her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria stared at the phone screen, her eyes filled with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gripped the phone tightly, trembling all over, and slowly slid down to the floor by the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes reddened, and tears kept falling down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up at the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this moment, the sky was overcast, dark clouds covered the entire city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rain became more violent, with large raindrops hitting the window glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat there in a daze, letting the rain soak her clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long time, she finally cried out, &#34;I am also your child, why have you never considered me! Why do you treat me like this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hanging up the phone, Nora let out a long sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She actually didn&#39;t want to break off with Victoria, after all, since Alvin went to prison, it had always been Victoria who supported her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Offending her wouldn&#39;t end well for herself either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But since Victoria was so unyielding, she had no choice but to use extreme measures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, she didn&#39;t really want to completely break off with Victoria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Victoria was determined not to pay this time, she couldn&#39;t really expose her, that would be like shooting herself in the foot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nora bit her lip, then dialed another number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although she didn&#39;t want to be threatened by Nora, Victoria was very afraid that she would really expose her scandal online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would do anything for money!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only she was exposed, it wouldn&#39;t matter much, after all, she had long been considered lowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now she was seen as Joshua&#39;s student, if her relationship with William was exposed, Joshua&#39;s reputation would also be damaged!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was something Victoria absolutely couldn&#39;t allow to happen!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After thinking all night, Victoria decided to go to the hospital and pay Nora&#39;s bill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her haggard face, the nurse who had been scolded by Nora quickly pulled her aside and whispered, &#34;You&#39;re here to pay your mom&#39;s bill, right? No need, it&#39;s already paid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was stunned, &#34;How is that possible? Did she pay it herself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she have a change of heart and decide to spend her own money?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nurse rolled her eyes, &#34;Of course not, it was someone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was even more puzzled, &#34;Who?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nurse sighed dramatically, &#34;It was Mr. Scott!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;William?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nurse nodded affirmatively, &#34;Yes, who else but Mr. Scott could afford to pay a year&#39;s hospital bill in one go; it&#39;s nearly a million dollars!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After saying this, she gave Victoria a jealous look and walked away muttering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Listening to the nurse&#39;s complaints, Victoria stood frozen in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It really was William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stormed over and pushed open Nora&#39;s hospital room door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nora was leisurely lying on the bed looking at her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Victoria come in, she was startled, quickly locked her phone, and turned to Victoria, frowning, &#34;You still know to come?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria ignored Nora and questioned, &#34;Do you have any shame, letting William pay your hospital bill?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Nora immediately got angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly stood up, pointed at Victoria, and shouted, &#34;If you had paid it, would I have had to lower my dignity to ask him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria sneered, &#34;So it&#39;s all my fault?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nora choked, &#34;If it&#39;s not your fault, is it mine? If you had been filial, would I have had to beg William?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spoke so righteously, as if it was really Victoria&#39;s fault.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was so angry at her shameless words that she trembled all over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nora, as if not seeing this, continued, &#34;Besides, you&#39;ve been sleeping with him for so long, if this were ancient times, you&#39;d be his concubine. I&#39;m practically his mother-in-law, isn&#39;t it only right for him to pay for his mother-in-law?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria, enraged, stepped forward and swept the kettle and cups off the table, smashing them to pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The loud noise startled Nora, leaving her stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she came to her senses, she glared at Victoria and raised her hand to slap her, &#34;How dare you act out in front of me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Nora&#39;s hand was about to touch Victoria&#39;s face, a deep, cold male voice reached their ears.</p>
