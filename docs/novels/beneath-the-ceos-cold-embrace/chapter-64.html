                <p>After she finished speaking, she broke down into hysterical sobs, crying so hard she could barely breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow, feeling heartbroken, wrapped her arms around Ella&#39;s shoulders and draped a coat over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Speaking softly, Alice continued to cry uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing this, Zachary sighed deeply, his voice light but filled with exhaustion and weariness, as if he had aged ten years overnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s my fault, I let Ella down, I broke my promise. Ella, if you really hate me, you can take your kidney back! I&#39;ve made up my mind, even if I die, I won&#39;t let William go to you.&#34; Alice cried bitterly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella was stunned, her eyes wide with shock, unable to believe that Alice could say something so shameless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her chest heaved with anger, and she pointed a trembling finger at Alice, saying, &#34;You... you, you bitch, are you even human? Fine, you want to give it back to me, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, Ella grabbed a fruit knife from nearby and lunged at Alice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing this, William&#39;s expression changed, and he kicked Ella away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a loud crash, Ella fell to the floor, hitting her forehead on the corner of the coffee table, immediately drawing blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of searing pain hit her, and Ella screamed in agony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ella!&#34; Willow screamed, rushing over to support her. &#34;Are you okay, Ella? Does it hurt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella was in too much pain to speak, and Willow, panicking, pulled out her phone and dialed 911. &#34;I need an ambulance, please help, my daughter is hurt!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cried out, her voice hoarse and heart-wrenching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William glanced coldly at the blood-covered Ella, his brow furrowing, his gaze growing even colder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing his indifferent attitude, Willow became even more furious and shouted at Alice, &#34;Alice, you damn bastard, if anything happens to her, I won&#39;t let you off!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice&#39;s eyes filled with tears as she cowered beside William, silently wiping her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William pulled her into his arms, comforting her softly, &#34;It&#39;s okay, I&#39;m here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he turned to Ella and said, &#34;I said I would compensate you on her behalf. If you want ten million dollars, or even a hundred million dollars, just say the word; I can give it to you. But from now on, Alice owes you nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella felt that the pain from her head injury was nothing compared to the pain William&#39;s words caused her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suddenly laughed, looking at William with a sorrowful expression, &#34;William, I risked my life for you, and this is how you treat me? You keep humiliating and hurting me for this mentally unstable Alice...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough! Ella, stop talking! I don&#39;t care what you think.&#34; William couldn&#39;t hold back and interrupted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine, I brought this on myself.&#34; Ella laughed bitterly, slowly getting up from the floor and heading upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow thought she was going to change clothes and quickly followed, &#34;Sweetie, I&#39;ll go with you to change clothes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William glanced in their direction and said to Zachary, &#34;Mr. Garcia, Alice just got back, I&#39;ll take her to my place to rest for a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, go ahead.&#34; Zachary sighed helplessly, watching everything unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William picked up Alice and strode out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as they stepped out of the living room, a dark figure suddenly fell from above, landing in front of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice screamed in fright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Ella!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lay on the ground, half of her body stained with blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow looked down from the third floor, seeing Ella covered in blood, she was so scared that her legs gave out and she collapsed to the floor, unable to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William pressed his lips together, squatted down to check on Ella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, he said in a deep voice, &#34;Take her to the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice stared blankly at Ella&#39;s horrific state, her eyes gradually turning blood-red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few days later, Victoria went back to the hospital for a follow-up as per the doctor&#39;s orders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afterward, she quietly peeked into Nora&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although she had decided not to care about her anymore, she couldn&#39;t help but check on her condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The young nurse saw her and couldn&#39;t help but sigh, &#34;Nora has such a good daughter, but she wasn&#39;t cherished. It&#39;s really foolish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If anyone treated Victoria well, she would give her heart and soul in return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nurse stepped forward and led Victoria aside, &#34;Ms. Carter, you don&#39;t need to worry too much. Your mother&#39;s condition is quite stable, and she has caregivers looking after her. You can rest assured.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; Victoria nodded. &#34;Please take good care of my mom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s our duty,&#34; the nurse smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was about to leave when the nurse stopped her and asked, &#34;Ms. Carter, do you know someone named Ella?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, the story of Victoria, William, and Ella was no secret in the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was taken aback, then nodded, &#34;I know her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nurse continued gossiping, &#34;She jumped off her house, did you know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jumped... jumped off her house?&#34; Victoria&#39;s mind buzzed. Ella actually jumped off a building?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nurse shook her head, &#34;I don&#39;t know the details, but it seems she jumped from the third floor. Luckily, she fell into a flower bed, so her life isn&#39;t in danger, but she&#39;s seriously injured.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria left the nurse&#39;s station in a daze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t believe that Ella would have such a strong and impulsive nature, willing to jump off a building and risk her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How deep must her love be?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria shook her head. No matter how deep the love, if you fell for the wrong person, it was destined to be a tragedy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moreover, doing this only brings pain to those who care and joy to those who hate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People would be glad to see you gone, out of their way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Victoria took the elevator to the first-floor lobby, she saw Willow pushing Ella&#39;s wheelchair, waiting for the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Victoria knew Ella was seriously injured, seeing her in this state still shocked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella&#39;s face was pale, her arms and legs wrapped in bandages, even her head and neck were covered in gauze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Except for her face, she looked like a mummy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria stared at her, unable to react for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella also saw Victoria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her previously lifeless face suddenly filled with intense hatred. She glared at Victoria and cursed through gritted teeth, &#34;Bitch! Are you here to laugh at me?&#34;</p>
