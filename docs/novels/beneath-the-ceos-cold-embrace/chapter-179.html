                <p>It was Alice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without even glancing at Victoria, she rushed straight to William&#39;s bedside, her eyes red and her voice trembling with emotion. &#34;How did this happen? I was so scared when I heard you got hurt!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria hadn&#39;t expected her to show up at this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William frowned slightly, a hint of impatience in his eyes. &#34;Why are you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard Ms. Scott was in trouble in Xandria, so I thought I&#39;d come to help. My aunt has some pull here. But as soon as I got off the plane, I heard you were hurt.&#34; Alice spoke while looking at William with concern, her eyes brimming with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only then that she noticed Victoria in the room. A flash of hostility crossed her eyes, but she didn&#39;t act on it. Instead, she greeted Victoria politely, &#34;Ms. Carter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, as if it were the most natural thing in the world, she asked, &#34;Could you get me a glass of water?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria almost nodded instinctively, but the words caught in her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly regained her composure and said softly, &#34;The doctor specifically said William can&#39;t drink water right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I see.&#34; Alice smiled apologetically at Victoria, then turned her full attention back to William. &#34;Is the pillow height okay? Do you want me to adjust it? If there&#39;s anything else bothering you, let me know, and I&#39;ll call the doctor right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice&#39;s attentiveness made it seem like she and William were still a couple in love, even though their engagement had long been called off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This made Victoria feel out of place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling awkward, Victoria said softly, &#34;I&#39;ll step out for a bit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice turned to her, smiling understandingly. &#34;Sure, Ms. Carter. You go rest. I&#39;ll take care of things here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was about to agree when William looked at her and said coldly, &#34;Is this how you repay someone who saved your dad&#39;s life?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was stunned. Just a moment ago, he had been stubbornly denying that he saved Alvin. How did he change his tune so quickly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she didn&#39;t get angry. After all, he had a point. She was indeed in the wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, she immediately stepped forward, her attitude becoming particularly attentive. &#34;I won&#39;t leave. I&#39;ll stay and take care of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice lowered her eyes slightly, hiding her complex emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria didn&#39;t have time to guess what Alice was thinking. She said calmly, &#34;Ms. Garcia, I&#39;ll stay here. You&#39;ve come a long way and must be exhausted. You should go rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William, lying in bed, had a barely noticeable smile on his lips, seemingly satisfied with Victoria&#39;s response. He then closed his eyes, looking content.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice still wore a smile and replied softly, &#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, she seemed particularly agreeable, completely different from her usual sharpness. Her gentle demeanor matched her appearance, surprising Victoria with the change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the hotel, Alice threw a fit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her aunt, Catherine Potts, had just returned from shopping and walked into the room to find Alice throwing things around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine raised an eyebrow, walking in slowly in her elegant high heels. &#34;Now you&#39;re worried? I heard you were quite decisive when you agreed to call off the engagement, even more so than your sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice collapsed onto the sofa, covering her face with her hands, her voice choked with tears. &#34;He stabbed himself to break off the engagement. What could I do? If I pushed him any further, I&#39;d end up like Ella, completely despised by him. I just didn&#39;t want to burn all bridges, leaving myself some room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine removed her scarf and sat at the vanity to take off her earrings. &#34;And what was the result? You can&#39;t be soft-hearted with men! You went through so much for him. You should have insisted on not breaking off the engagement, and if he pushed you, you could have threatened to jump off a building or slit your wrists. I don&#39;t believe he would have continued to confront you. You gave him freedom, and now look at you. You&#39;re not even his fiancée anymore, and you have to watch others&#39; faces when you visit him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice bit her lip, her eyes red as she looked up. &#34;Aunt Catherine, what&#39;s the point of saying this now? It only makes me feel worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine stood up, walked over, and patted her shoulder gently. &#34;Alright, crying here won&#39;t help. You should think about how to get that Victoria away from him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice took a deep breath, forcing herself to calm down. &#34;Aunt Catherine, I want to stay here for a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure?&#34; Catherine looked at her, her gaze scrutinizing. &#34;I arranged for you to meet some outstanding young men. Don&#39;t you want to give them a chance? Maybe after meeting them, you&#39;ll forget about William. A smart woman doesn&#39;t stubbornly choose just one man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice shook her head firmly. &#34;In this life, my heart belongs only to him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Alice&#39;s determination, Catherine sighed softly. &#34;Then you need to be clear-headed. You&#39;re already at a disadvantage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not necessarily.&#34; Alice composed herself, lifting her head with a determined look in her eyes. &#34;Maybe staying by his side as a friend will give me more opportunities.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catherine didn&#39;t fully understand the deeper meaning of this, but she didn&#39;t interfere much in young people&#39;s romantic entanglements. She just reminded Alice, &#34;Keep your priorities straight. I&#39;ve heard rumors that your stepmother is secretly transferring assets. Be cautious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Alice&#39;s expression turned thoughtful. After a moment, she smiled slightly. &#34;Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By midday, William was allowed to drink water and have some liquid food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria fed him some soup, but he couldn&#39;t drink much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the painkillers wore off, the burning sensation from his wound grew more intense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pain, though not lasting long, was sharp and relentless, making it hard to bear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William kept his eyes tightly shut, his brows furrowed, and beads of sweat formed on his forehead, trickling down his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria had already consulted the doctor and knew he was in agony from his wound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing him in such pain, she quickly ran to the bathroom, soaked a towel in warm water, and carefully wiped the sweat from his forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s eyelids fluttered, and he slowly opened his eyes, his gaze hazy as if looking through a mist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you tired?&#34; His voice was dry and hoarse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not tired.&#34; Victoria shook her head gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked quickly to the table, picked up a water jug, poured a glass of water, and inserted a straw, bringing it to his lips. &#34;Drink some water to soothe your throat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to sit up.&#34; William tried to move, attempting to prop himself up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t! What if your wound opens up?&#34; Victoria quickly reached out to stop him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not that fragile.&#34; William gritted his teeth, his voice muffled, still trying to exert himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing his determination, Victoria had no choice but to help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She supported his back with one hand and pressed the button to raise the bed with the other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she grabbed a pillow and placed it behind him to make him more comfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s mind cleared a bit, and he looked at Victoria&#39;s tired face, frowning again. &#34;Come here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Victoria was puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She obediently took a couple of steps closer to the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William reached out, pulled her to his side, and moved over, making room on the bed. &#34;Lie down and rest for a while.&#34;</p>
