                <p>Fueled by the booze, Rufus flashed a sleazy grin, his greasy, pudgy face lighting up. &#34;Ms. Carter, don&#39;t be so shy. Be my woman, and I&#39;ll make sure you&#39;re happy,&#34; he slurred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, Rufus shut the bathroom door and reached for Victoria&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria screamed, quickly covering herself and struggling desperately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let go!&#34; she shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fought with all her might, but Rufus&#39;s grip was too strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rufus laughed, holding her tightly with both hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to break free, Victoria kicked and hit him with everything she had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But how could a frail woman overpower a fat man?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William and Kirk were deep in conversation when they heard the commotion from the bathroom and immediately stopped talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kirk knew exactly what kind of person Rufus was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at William to gauge his reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But William&#39;s expression remained unchanged, cold as ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kirk then touched his nose and continued chatting, pretending he hadn&#39;t heard anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the surface, William appeared calm, but under the table, his hand was clenched into a fist, veins bulging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Damn it! Doesn&#39;t Victoria know to ask me for help?&#39; he thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just because she was mad at him, she&#39;d rather be violated by that ugly Rufus?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria wanted to call for help, but her throat, sore from being choked by William the night before and the alcohol just now, burned with pain. Combined with the alcohol she had consumed and her overwhelming fear, she couldn&#39;t speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could only let Rufus tear open the buttons on her shirt, pinning her hands above her head against the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rufus&#39;s alcohol-laden mouth kissed Victoria&#39;s delicate neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria felt extremely nauseous, but her body was limp, unable to muster the strength to struggle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at the bathroom door in despair, hoping that William would remember their time together and come to her rescue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She desperately tried to shout, &#34;William, help me!&#34; But no sound came from her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the commotion in the bathroom was too loud for those outside not to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only reason William hadn&#39;t reacted must be intentional.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was deliberately letting someone humiliate Victoria, to get back at her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his eyes, she was nothing more than a whore to be humiliated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she realized this, her heart was filled with despair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the more desperate she felt, the more she couldn&#39;t belittle herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had a new job and new friends. William couldn&#39;t, and didn&#39;t deserve to, ruin her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rufus&#39;s repulsive, fat hand had already reached under her skirt, moving upward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an instant, Victoria became fierce. Her hands and feet were restrained, but she still had her mouth!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She used all her strength to bite Rufus&#39;s ear, tearing off a large chunk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bitch!&#34; Rufus cried out in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Furious and humiliated, he raised his hand and slapped Victoria hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria fell to the ground, her cheek quickly swelling and reddening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring everything else, she got up and ran out of the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stupid bitch!&#34; Rufus cursed and chased after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria stumbled to the table, not caring about William&#39;s extremely displeased expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She grabbed a wine bottle and smashed it over Rufus&#39;s head as he caught up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard, Rufus took the hit to the forehead, blood splattering everywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glared at Victoria, seething with hatred. &#34;You bitch, how dare you hit me? I&#39;ll kill you!&#34; he snarled, swinging his fist at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria, exhausted, couldn&#39;t dodge, watching helplessly as Rufus lunged at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the critical moment, William stood up, grabbed Rufus&#39;s fist, and kicked him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rufus hit the ground, screaming in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Rufus in such a state, Kirk quickly checked on him and found that, aside from the missing chunk of his ear, he was mostly unharmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then glared at Victoria and William and said, &#34;What are you doing? This was supposed to be a celebration, and now you&#39;re trying to kill him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William shielded Victoria behind him, his gaze deep and cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you know what filthy thing he did?&#34; William asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kirk was momentarily stunned, then laughed, &#34;Mr. Scott, you can say whatever you want, but do you have any evidence?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This seemed to remind Rufus, who struggled to his feet and shouted, &#34;Who the hell do you think you are? Didn&#39;t you give her to me yourself? Now you&#39;re playing the hero?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William stiffened, glancing back at Victoria, who still had her head down, her expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing this, Rufus grew even more arrogant and sneered, &#34;William, you got tired of Victoria and tossed her to me. Now you&#39;re pretending to be righteous? How disgusting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s face darkened, almost dripping with anger, and he roared, &#34;Shut up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rufus laughed maniacally and said, &#34;Who do you think you are? Telling me to shut up? Do you believe I&#39;ll terminate our contract right now and make you lose everything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, William laughed, but his eyes grew colder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He suddenly walked over to Rufus, squatted down, and patted his flabby face. &#34;Do you think you can offend me so easily? I tailored products for your company, knowing all your strengths, weaknesses, and even your secrets, like your tapioca-free tapioca flour,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rufus and Kirk&#39;s faces turned pale; they didn&#39;t expect that William even knew about that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William stood up, looking down at them. He continued, &#34;I hope you&#39;ll double the advertising fee for the Scott Group&#39;s hard work, or I might start talking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that threat, William pulled Victoria away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rufus and Kirk exchanged glances, and after a while, Kirk sighed, &#34;Rufus, we&#39;ve really lost big this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rufus&#39;s face turned ashen as he realized he had been set up by William-using Victoria to create a rift and then seizing the opportunity to extort more investment. Utterly cunning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gritted his teeth, eyes filled with malice. &#34;Once I deal with William, I&#39;ll skin him alive and sell that slut Victoria as a prostitute!&#34; he spat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William led Victoria out of the hotel and into his dark blue Maybach, where Harry immediately drove away. Throughout the ride, Victoria kept her head down in silence. William, feeling inexplicably guilty, reached out to wipe the blood from her mouth, but she turned her head away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car fell into a suffocating silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William couldn&#39;t stand the silence. He suddenly asked, &#34;Why didn&#39;t you call for my help earlier?&#34;</p>
