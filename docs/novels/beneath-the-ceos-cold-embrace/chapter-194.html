                <p>William&#39;s gaze was intense, but his hand on her waist stayed steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s get you inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply, he guided Alice into the restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria had a perfect view of the scene unfolding between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they walked in, Alice was practically nestled in William&#39;s arms, her cheeks flushed. Her delicate and vulnerable appearance would evoke sympathy from anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria glanced at them briefly before looking away, uninterested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendy whispered, &#34;Looks like they&#39;re rekindling their old flame.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first glance, it did seem that way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Victoria didn&#39;t care much. Whether they got back together or not, what did it matter to her? She wasn&#39;t William&#39;s girlfriend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the meal, Victoria got up to use the restroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she came out, she saw Alice leaning against the sink, mumbling about feeling unwell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William gently held her, letting her rest against his chest, soothing her softly, &#34;I&#39;ll take you to the hospital for an IV soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I hate hospitals. I never want to go there again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s just an IV, it won&#39;t hurt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m scared.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria pursed her lips, initially intending to walk past them as if she hadn&#39;t seen anything. But that felt too deliberate, making her seem guilty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a deep breath, walked over casually, and turned on the faucet to wash her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she looked up, her eyes met William&#39;s in the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused briefly, then quickly composed herself and asked calmly, &#34;It seems Ms. Garcia had too much to drink. Do you need help?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William stared at her deeply for a moment, about to speak, when Samuel suddenly appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victoria!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria looked surprised, &#34;Samuel? What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m having dinner with friends upstairs. I ran into Wendy and the others on my way down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he approached, he noticed William and then Alice in his arms. His eyes flickered slightly, and he smiled, &#34;What a coincidence, Mr. Scott. Ms. Garcia had too much to drink? Need a hand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need.&#34; William&#39;s expression remained cold and aloof, as always. He didn&#39;t even spare another glance, just held Alice&#39;s shoulder and asked softly, &#34;Can you walk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice looked up at him with misty eyes, shaking her head pitifully, &#34;My legs are weak, I can&#39;t stand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded slightly, then without another word, scooped her up and strode away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria lowered her gaze, grabbed a paper towel to dry her hands, and said softly, &#34;Let&#39;s go too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel followed her, hesitatingly asking, &#34;Why are you here today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria stopped, &#34;Our boss is treating us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel nodded, seeming relieved, but there was a hint of disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria found his behavior odd and turned to look at him, &#34;Samuel, is something bothering you today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel was taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head slowly, &#34;What could be bothering me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned and left quickly, as if eager to escape something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was even more puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Samuel left the restaurant, someone called out to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Samuel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned around to see a long-haired girl in a black coat, her straight hair cascading over her shoulders, smiling brightly at him, &#34;We agreed, next time it&#39;s my treat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel was momentarily stunned, instinctively glancing towards the parking lot, then quickly said, &#34;Ms. Wright, you&#39;re too kind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks for treating me today. Next time, I&#39;ll take you to a movie, okay?&#34; Hannah Wright&#39;s cheeks flushed slightly, a bit shy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel responded casually, saying, &#34;My friends are waiting for me,&#34; and hurried away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Easter was coming up, and Starry Studio Gallery was gearing up for a big Easter-themed exhibition. Diana asked Victoria and Wendy to pick up some flowers and decorations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria had gotten her driver&#39;s license while working as William&#39;s secretary, and under his guidance, her driving skills were pretty solid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car she drove was a second-hand one Alvin had found. It looked ordinary but was spacious enough for daily use.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victoria, let me drive.&#34; Wendy had just gotten her license and was eager to get behind the wheel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure, you drive.&#34; Victoria, always indulgent towards her, handed over the keys without hesitation and settled into the passenger seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendy was thrilled, gripping the steering wheel tightly, her eyes wide open, staring straight ahead, nervous sweat forming on her forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria sat beside her, occasionally reminding her softly, &#34;Turn signal on, turn slowly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing a Rolls-Royce merging ahead, Victoria&#39;s heart tightened, quickly advising, &#34;That&#39;s a luxury car ahead, keep your distance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she finished speaking, there was a loud crash as their car collided with the Rolls-Royce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendy was silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s mind went blank for a moment. Hearing Wendy&#39;s tearful voice brought her back to reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victoria.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendy was completely stunned, her voice trembling, &#34;Did I just rear-end a Rolls-Royce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendy&#39;s family was well-off, but her mother was very strict, giving her little pocket money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she asked for money, her mother would likely exaggerate the situation to her father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendy didn&#39;t want to be used as a pawn in their power struggle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria quickly calmed down, speaking gently, &#34;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll go check.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she handed the keys to Wendy, Victoria had mentally prepared herself for minor accidents. But rear-ending a luxury car was beyond her expectations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria got out of the car, just as someone stepped out of the Rolls-Royce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately, the accident didn&#39;t happen in a busy area, so there was no traffic jam.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, it&#39;s our fault. My friend just got her license.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victoria?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria looked up, &#34;Harry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t expected to see a familiar face. Just as she felt relieved, her heart sank again, wondering if the car belonged to William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure enough, William stepped out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing it was someone they knew, Wendy quickly got out, &#34;Mr. Scott, I&#39;m sorry, it&#39;s all my fault.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s deep eyes briefly rested on Victoria before looking away coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s hand tightened in her sleeve, but she maintained a distant demeanor, matching his coldness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was it you driving?&#34; He directed the question at Wendy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; Wendy looked down, embarrassed, &#34;How much will the repairs cost? I&#39;ll pay, but can I do it in installments?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria wouldn&#39;t let her pay, immediately saying, &#34;No need to pay, we have insurance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William glanced at his car, saying indifferently, &#34;The insurance won&#39;t cover all my losses. The extra amount could buy you a new car.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria frowned, seeing Wendy&#39;s pale face, silently blaming William for scaring her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t believe he would be so serious about this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But since they hit his car, paying for the damages was only right. She said, &#34;Whatever the cost, I&#39;ll pay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria looked at Harry, &#34;You have my number. Let me know the repair cost.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harry didn&#39;t dare respond, glancing at William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria turned to Wendy, &#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they got back in the car, before Victoria could close the door, it was pulled open again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out.&#34; William grabbed her arm, pulling her out of the car.</p>
