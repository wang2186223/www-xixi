                <p>Victoria gently pulled her arm away. &#34;I liked it better the way it was before. The way you are now, it kind of freaks me out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, come on,&#34; Marcella teased, her eyes sparkling with amusement. &#34;I used to think you were such a pain, but now that I know you better, you&#39;re not so bad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gee, thanks.&#34; Victoria didn&#39;t think that was much of a compliment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was probably because she&#39;d been helping Marcella in her pursuit of Alton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcella&#39;s playful expression faded as she spoke more seriously. &#34;Actually, I&#39;ve been thinking about something...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was surprised by what she heard next. &#34;You want to stay here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcella shrugged. &#34;I was never really into the gallery. Staring at paintings and sculptures all day gives me a headache. I told my dad to transfer me to the branch here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria knew Alton was popular with the ladies, but she hadn&#39;t realized he had this much charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Marcella was just an illegitimate child with little inheritance rights, Alton had managed to captivate her so quickly. He must have some serious skills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed like he had gone through a lot during the years his family had fallen on hard times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, if you want to stay, that&#39;s your decision.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course not!&#34; Marcella linked her arm with Victoria&#39;s again. &#34;We&#39;re a dream team! I can&#39;t do this without you! You&#39;re so upright, I can&#39;t just leave you behind!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria didn&#39;t believe a word of her grandiose speech.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s with that look?&#34; Marcella avoided Victoria&#39;s gaze, feeling a bit guilty. &#34;Okay, okay, I admit it. You did help me out a little.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria raised an eyebrow. Just a little?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine, fine! I owe my success to you, happy now?&#34; Marcella said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria looked away. To be honest, it was true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting Marcella&#39;s approval wasn&#39;t easy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, Victoria, will you stay here with me?&#34; Marcella batted her eyes in a rare display of cuteness, which only gave Victoria goosebumps. &#34;I heard Mr. Scott wants you to work at Infinity Unity Group. I&#39;ll get the gallery to let you go and give you a hefty severance package. How about that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you just talk normally, Marcella?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t care. You have to agree! Otherwise, I&#39;ll keep talking like this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria frowned, feeling like she didn&#39;t know her anymore. But the offer of several times her severance pay from Starry Studio Gallery was tempting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, I preferred the old you. This sudden friendliness is a bit unsettling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, come on! I&#39;ve always been this sweet and simple! I just listened to Hannah before and thought you were scheming. Naturally, I was cautious around you. But now, I genuinely consider you a friend!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria didn&#39;t know how to respond to her sudden sincerity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcella then spent the entire afternoon listing the benefits of staying in Harborview City, pestering her until Victoria finally agreed to discuss it with her family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she left Victoria&#39;s room, Marcella called Alton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did what you said and appealed to her emotions. She said she&#39;d think about it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alton chuckled softly on the other end. &#34;I knew you could do it, babe!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course.&#34; She smiled as she returned to her room, clutching her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the door of Victoria&#39;s room slowly opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria lowered her eyes, a slight smile playing on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder Marcella was so eager to convince her to stay in Harborview City.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria closed the door and immediately booked a flight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d been in Harborview City long enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for William&#39;s offer to join Infinity Unity Group, it was tempting, but she preferred to move at her own pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, she still had an instinctive desire to keep her distance from William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her flight was in the evening, and as she packed, she received a call from Daisy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victoria?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy wanted to meet, and since there was still time, they arranged to meet at a café near the hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria spotted Daisy as soon as she walked in. Daisy looked fantastic, exuding both youthful energy and mature charm, the kind that could captivate people of all ages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You came to Harborview City and didn&#39;t even visit me. That&#39;s not very nice!&#34; As soon as they sat down, Daisy took the initiative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My bad, really, Daisy. I know I was wrong!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was always sincere when admitting her mistakes to Daisy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy couldn&#39;t help but laugh, not really holding it against her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s cut to the chase,&#34; Daisy said directly. &#34;I&#39;m here to ask for your help. William should have mentioned that I&#39;m in a bit of trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was taken aback. She had thought William was just making excuses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It turned out Daisy&#39;s situation was much more serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the situation. My dad&#39;s been a bit muddled lately, making poor decisions, and it&#39;s put me in a tough spot at the company. I&#39;m not looking to fight for anything, but if Wayne&#39;s involved, there&#39;s no room for compromise!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what can I do? I don&#39;t know anything about this,&#34; Victoria asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy raised a hand to stop her, frowning. &#34;When did you become so hesitant? Where&#39;s the girl who braved Xandria with William?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria sighed. &#34;Is it possible you guys have too much faith in me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t flatter yourself. Did I say I valued your skills?&#34; Daisy said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria fell silent. That was harsh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to build our own team within the company, but there aren&#39;t many trustworthy people around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria blinked. Was that the reason?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy leaned forward, her gaze intense. &#34;I&#39;ll ask you straight. I&#39;m in trouble. Will you help me or not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could Victoria say no?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She realized she had no resistance against Daisy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The father-daughter duo was really going to lose to Daisy!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they left the café, Daisy patted her shoulder approvingly. &#34;Do well. I have high hopes for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria smiled wryly. &#34;Thanks for the vote of confidence, Daisy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dropping Victoria off at the hotel, Daisy waved. &#34;I&#39;ll pick you up tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Victoria could respond, Daisy had already driven off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she hit the road, Daisy&#39;s phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at the caller ID, pursed her lips, and looked away, planning to ignore it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call ended after a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, it rang again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy&#39;s expression turned amused, but she still didn&#39;t answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call ended again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, it was quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as she pulled into the garage, her phone rang again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, she answered it leisurely. &#34;I&#39;m starting to think you put a tracker on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man&#39;s voice on the other end sounded slightly annoyed. &#34;Why didn&#39;t you answer sooner?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did it on purpose,&#34; she replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could hear the deep breath on the other end before he slowly asked, &#34;Did she agree?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew you&#39;d be anxious about her. Don&#39;t worry. With me on the case, what can&#39;t be done? She&#39;ll start next week.&#34;</p>
