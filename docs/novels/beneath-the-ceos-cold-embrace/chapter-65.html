                <p>Victoria immediately put away her slight pity for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella deserved this outcome entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watching you make a fool of yourself? Ridiculous.&#34; Victoria&#39;s lips twitched as she mocked, &#34;Do you think everyone&#39;s interested in you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You...&#34; Ella had just opened her mouth when a sharp pain surged through her body, causing her to groan in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow quickly reached out to hold her, &#34;Ella, what&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria couldn&#39;t be bothered to argue with her and lifted her foot to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing this, Ella hurriedly called out to her, &#34;Victoria, I have something to say to you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria stopped in her tracks, her back to Ella, and mocked, &#34;What? Haven&#39;t you insulted me enough?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella signaled Willow to push her wheelchair in front of Victoria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because it was a private hospital, there weren&#39;t many patients.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victoria, if I were you, I would never be a mistress hiding in the shadows. I would do everything I could to win him over and be his legitimate girlfriend!&#34; Ella stared at Victoria with a vicious look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Victoria squinted slightly, &#34;Ella, you lost the man to someone else and now you want to incite me to get involved in this complicated mess, hoping to kill two birds with one stone? Do you think everyone is as stupid as you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you dare say you haven&#39;t coveted him?&#34; Ella sneered, &#34;Do you think pretending to be pure and weak can hide your ugly desires?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria didn&#39;t deny it and retorted, &#34;Compared to someone like you who loses their mind for love, I am indeed very smart, much smarter than you! And let me tell you, I have no interest in your William. If he hadn&#39;t forced me, I would have stayed far away from you two!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Ella&#39;s face turned extremely ugly, &#34;You&#39;re lying! If you weren&#39;t good at seducing men, why would William always be infatuated with you? As his fiancée, he has never touched me...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up!&#34; Victoria interrupted her coldly, &#34;I have no interest in your relationship, nor do I want to get involved in your love triangle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think saying that will make her let you go?&#34; Ella suddenly laughed, &#34;Alice Garcia is a lunatic! As long as she knows you&#39;ve been with William for so long, you won&#39;t have a good ending!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Victoria stopped abruptly and turned to look at Ella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice? Was she the woman William was holding that day?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could she be Ella&#39;s sister?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella&#39;s expression was twisted and crazed as she spoke word by word, &#34;My dear sister, who seems harmless and gentle, is actually terrifyingly vicious!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, she struggled to lift her clothes, revealing a horrifying scar to Victoria, &#34;Look at this! This is the scar from when I donated a kidney to her! She promised that if I gave her my kidney, she would let me marry William. But as you saw, on my wedding day, she showed up and effortlessly took William away! Now I&#39;m missing a kidney and being ridiculed by countless people because the groom ran away! And all of this was orchestrated by my dear sister!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the end, Ella was screaming hysterically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria listened quietly to Ella&#39;s accusations and finally spoke after a long pause, &#34;I told you, I&#39;m not interested in your affairs. Whatever you want to do is your business, don&#39;t drag me into it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she didn&#39;t linger any longer and walked towards the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella seemed to hear an extremely ridiculous joke, &#34;Do you think you can stay out of it? Just wait, your end might be worse than mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria ignored her and left directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Starry Studio Gallery recently took on a project to design the display for a newly opened home goods department store.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The owner of this building had always been a major client of Starry Studio Gallery, so Diana paid extra attention to this design, ensuring every detail was perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria, Wendy, and the other dozen employees of Starry Studio Gallery, along with the store staff, worked overtime for almost a month to get it mostly done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only minor adjustments were needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The building&#39;s owner also opened for a trial run, only for some VIP members.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria had been on-site these days, recording and adjusting based on customer feedback and attitudes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she was working diligently, her phone kept ringing non-stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyed, Victoria took it out and saw it was that idle rich kid again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rich kid&#39;s name was Alton Bridges, the son of the home goods department store&#39;s owner, and a college student.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A while ago, when he came to inspect the mall on behalf of his father, Diana assigned Victoria to accompany him and listen to his feedback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After getting to know each other, Alton, for some reason, broke up with his girlfriend and started pursuing Victoria madly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every day, he sent flowers, food, and luxury goods non-stop, despite Victoria&#39;s constant rejections and polite indications that she wasn&#39;t interested in him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this guy was like velcro, impossible to shake off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the phone rang for a long time, it finally stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was about to check the layout and decor of the hall for any needed adjustments, she saw Alton having someone carry 444 roses, standing in the center of the hall, shouting at her, &#34;Victoria!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone around was silent too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my god, is this handsome guy confessing to this lady?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course! Who else would send 444 roses? It&#39;s so romantic!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So lucky!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria, however, didn&#39;t feel romantic or lucky at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She only felt extremely embarrassed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lowered her head, pretending not to see him, and used the blueprint to cover her face, wanting to leave this place quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the more she avoided him, the more persistent Alton became.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victoria! Victoria! The one in the brown coat, Victoria, look over here!&#34; Alton waved his arms excitedly, shouting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victoria, why don&#39;t you go over and talk to him?&#34; Wendy teased, having heard the commotion, her eyes sparkling with anticipation to see Victoria&#39;s reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria glared at her and walked over helplessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victoria, do you like these roses?&#34; Alton smiled brightly, showing his white teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was overwhelmed by the strong floral scent and sneezed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly covered her nose, &#34;Mr. Bridges, I can&#39;t accept these flowers, I&#39;m really sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be like that!&#34; Alton looked at her with a face full of grievance, &#34;I really like you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria sighed, &#34;I&#39;m sorry, you&#39;re not my type. Please give up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alton was stunned, then asked, &#34;What type do you like?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria thought for a moment and decided to use Samuel&#39;s standards, &#34;I like mature, steady, gentlemanly types who also appreciate art like I do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And her words were all overheard by William, who was there with Alice to pick out furniture.</p>
