                <p>&#34;He got away!&#34; William growled, clenching his teeth. &#34;The people I sent to find him came up empty. He vanished without a trace. I bet he skipped the country!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s face went pale as she listened, her voice shaking. &#34;It&#39;s all my fault. I should&#39;ve listened to you. I shouldn&#39;t have gone looking for clues on my own. I ended up tipping him off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the end, Victoria&#39;s eyes were red, tears welling up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was filled with self-loathing. Just when they had found a lead to clear Alvin&#39;s name, she ruined it due to her foolishness!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s heart ached. He quickly tried to comfort her. &#34;Don&#39;t beat yourself up. I promise I&#39;ll find the evidence to clear your father&#39;s name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was not just for Alvin, but also to uncover the truth about his own parents&#39; deaths!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria sniffled, trying to hold back her tears. &#34;William, thank you for saving me and for helping me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression was one of sorrow and despair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William gently patted her shoulder, speaking softly. &#34;Don&#39;t cry. Focus on getting better first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I feel fine,&#34; Victoria insisted. &#34;I was just a bit shaken up. I want to be discharged this afternoon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William frowned, worried. &#34;That&#39;s not a good idea. You&#39;ve been through a lot. You should stay in the hospital for a few days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was stubborn. &#34;I&#39;m really okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the exhibition coming up, she didn&#39;t want her condition to delay their work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her determination, William had no choice but to relent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thanks to Victoria&#39;s meticulous planning, the home design exhibition went off without a hitch and received rave reviews.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s work in Harborview City was done, but William needed to stay a couple more days to handle some Scott family matters. Victoria had planned to wait for him so they could return to Silvermist City together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unexpectedly, she received a call from Ryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan&#39;s voice sounded anxious. &#34;Victoria, where are you right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was taken aback. &#34;I&#39;m on a business trip in Harborview City. What&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan angrily replied, &#34;Samuel&#39;s been in an accident and is in the hospital. Come see him right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s heart skipped a beat, her mind going blank. &#34;How is he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was in a car accident. He&#39;s in critical condition at Dawn Healthcare Center,&#34; Ryan&#39;s voice was hoarse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria immediately stood up. &#34;Okay, I&#39;ll book a flight and come right away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hurriedly bought the earliest flight to Silvermist City.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria arrived in Silvermist City at 8 PM. She quickly hailed a cab to Dawn Healthcare Center.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she reached the hospital room, Ryan was by Samuel&#39;s bedside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her, Ryan looked relieved and grabbed her arm. &#34;You&#39;re finally here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria anxiously looked at Samuel lying in bed. &#34;What happened? How did he get into an accident?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan sighed. &#34;It&#39;s because of you! Ever since he got back from the Arctic and heard you and William were in Harborview City, he&#39;s been out of sorts. I&#39;m really at a loss with him. He&#39;s thirty years old but acts like a kid when it comes to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria bit her lip, feeling guilty. &#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Ryan said, patting her shoulder in an attempt to comfort her. &#34;Don&#39;t blame yourself. He&#39;s not dead, just has a broken leg.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Victoria let out a sigh of relief, her heart finally settling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to look at Samuel. His eyes were closed, his face pale, and his forehead wrapped in thick bandages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His handsome face was covered in scratches, and his lips were bruised, making him look pitiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Victoria&#39;s worried expression, Ryan sighed. &#34;Victoria, you need to think carefully. Who&#39;s better for you? William, who keeps hurting you and flirting with others, or Samuel, who&#39;s mature and devoted to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria lowered her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew the difference between William and Samuel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how sweet things were with William in Harborview City, once they returned to Silvermist City, William would go back to Alice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was just a thief, stealing a few days of happiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking of this, Victoria softly said, &#34;Thank you. I&#39;ll think about it. I have a few days off. I&#39;ll stay and take care of him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; Ryan nodded. &#34;He&#39;ll be happy to see you. Take care of him for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he left the room, giving Victoria and Samuel some space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria walked to Samuel&#39;s side and sat down. She gently touched his forehead, whispering, &#34;Samuel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling the heat from his forehead, Victoria was startled. He had a fever!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly called for a doctor to check his temperature and start an IV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After everything was settled, Victoria leaned back in the chair by the bed, closing her eyes in exhaustion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So much had happened recently. She needed rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she was drifting off, she faintly heard Samuel&#39;s weak voice: &#34;Victoria, don&#39;t leave me. Don&#39;t go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened her eyes and looked at the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the dim light, Samuel&#39;s face looked even paler. He was clutching the blanket, his expression pained, his brows furrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing him like this, Victoria felt her heart ached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held his hand, gently stroking it. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m not going anywhere. I&#39;ll stay with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel seemed to hear her; he calmed down and gradually fell asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria sighed softly, leaning against the bed, slowly closing her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, Victoria felt someone touching her forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you awake?&#34; Samuel&#39;s voice was deep and soothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria opened her eyes to see Samuel gazing at her, his eyes filled with deep affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you feeling better?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Samuel&#39;s bandaged ankle, Victoria looked down, feeling guilty, unable to meet his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel smiled and gently ruffled her hair. &#34;Silly, I&#39;m fine. But why did you come?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria bit her lip. &#34;Ryan called me yesterday and told me about your accident. I was so scared. How could I not come?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes reddened, tears threatening to fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ryan always talks too much. Don&#39;t take it to heart,&#34; Samuel comforted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No...&#34; Victoria started to say, but her phone rang, interrupting her.</p>
