                <p>Victoria heard the phone click, paused for a moment, and then suddenly gave a helpless smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, she didn&#39;t want to let it go just like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sofia insulted her in front of so many people and even injured her, just because her family background was better than hers, right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she just let it go, wouldn&#39;t that mean she was easy to bully and let others trample on her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what could she do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since Alvin had his accident, there was no one to protect her anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she didn&#39;t know if William helped her this time because he truly felt sorry for her injury or just because he was provoked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moreover, he already had Alice by his side now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she didn&#39;t let it go now, what would happen when William decided to leave her alone in the future? Who would stand up for her then?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more Victoria thought about it, the more humiliated she felt. She buried her head in the pillow, her eyes slightly red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, she got up from the bed and called Samuel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because her arm was injured, she couldn&#39;t go to the studio to paint with Samuel on Saturday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Samuel received her call, he was a bit worried. &#34;Victoria, are you sick?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria didn&#39;t want him to worry, so she chose to hide the truth. &#34;No, I&#39;ve just been really busy lately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel was stunned for a moment, then smiled bitterly. &#34;Victoria, even after all this time, you still keep your distance from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Victoria felt a pang in her heart, and her eyes couldn&#39;t help but moisten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sniffed, trying hard to control her emotions. &#34;I&#39;m fine, just a bit tired lately. I&#39;ll be okay after some rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel pondered for a moment and then gently advised. &#34;If you need anything, remember to tell me. There&#39;s no need for formalities between us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria bit her lip and nodded. &#34;Okay, thank you, Samuel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At William&#39;s command, Sofia was released.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, the Moore family called, wanting to bring Sofia to apologize to Victoria in person, and of course, they also invited William to attend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lloyd and Thalia were humble and extremely polite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria initially refused, but couldn&#39;t resist Thalia&#39;s persistent persuasion, moved by her motherly love, and finally agreed to attend the dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At 7:30 PM, Victoria arrived on time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she reached the hotel entrance, a black Maybach stopped in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver got out and opened the rear door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man in a suit and tie, exuding an air of nobility, stepped out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at Victoria with deep eyes, as if they contained a thousand mountains covered in snow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William walked towards her, and their eyes met, both showing complex emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long while, William hoarsely called out, &#34;Victoria.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria sighed lightly and looked away first. &#34;Mr. Scott.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William glanced at her arm, his eyes darkening. &#34;How&#39;s your arm?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria nodded, lowering her eyes slightly, and said self-deprecatingly. &#34;I&#39;ve become a regular at the hospital. This little injury is no big deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing her say that, William felt a surge of inexplicable anger. &#34;No big deal? Then what do you consider a big deal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was stunned, not understanding why he suddenly got angry, and remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William stared at her for a moment, then suddenly sneered. &#34;I forgot how tough you are, just like how shameless you can be!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After saying that, he walked past her and headed into the hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria stood there for a long time before slowly reacting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He actually called her shameless!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How dare he insult her? How dare he?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria felt a tightness in her chest, a breath of anger stuck in her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clenched her fists, holding back her anger, and caught up with William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they opened the door to the private room, the Moore family and Alton all stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sofia, having been detained for a few days, was much more subdued, but Victoria could tell she was still full of resentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alton glanced at Victoria with some embarrassment, then lowered his head in fear of William beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he had known she was William&#39;s woman, he wouldn&#39;t have dared to provoke her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lloyd awkwardly smiled. &#34;Mr. Scott, you&#39;re here, please have a seat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William, with a cold expression, sat down in the center, while Victoria sat to his left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once everyone was seated, Lloyd eagerly raised his glass to Victoria. &#34;Ms. Carter, this incident was all because Sofia was young and ignorant...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Victoria could speak, William interrupted Lloyd. &#34;Young? Victoria is less than a year older than your daughter. Is she not young?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lloyd awkwardly closed his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he hadn&#39;t mentioned it, no one would have thought Victoria was so young.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because she no longer had that youthful naivety, but rather a mature and composed demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lloyd carefully continued. &#34;Sofia has realized her mistake. Ms. Carter, I brought her here today to apologize to you, hoping you can forgive her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria looked at Sofia, who seemed composed and not at all remorseful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at her briefly, then turned to Lloyd and calmly replied, &#34;Mr. Moore, it wasn&#39;t you who did it. There&#39;s no need for you to apologize to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William, amused by her assertiveness, chimed in. &#34;Exactly, if the person who made the mistake doesn&#39;t apologize, then let&#39;s just forget it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sofia slammed the table, her eyes wide with anger, and accused. &#34;I just hit you once, and you had me detained for so many days. Now you&#39;re turning the tables on me. Do you have any sense of reason?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you say?&#34; William narrowed his eyes dangerously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria placed a hand on his arm, signaling him to stay calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria looked up at Sofia, her clear eyes flashing with cold light. &#34;It seems Ms. Moore doesn&#39;t think she did anything wrong. In that case, there&#39;s no need to continue this dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You!&#34; Sofia&#39;s face changed, clenching her fists in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lloyd frowned and quickly tried to smooth things over. &#34;Ms. Carter, it&#39;s a misunderstanding. Sofia didn&#39;t mean it that way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sincerely said. &#34;Ms. Carter, this is all my fault for not educating her properly. Please be magnanimous and let&#39;s just forget this ever happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, why are you begging her? She just wants to extort more money.&#34; Sofia said indignantly, full of sarcasm, then turned to Victoria, &#34;Tell me, how much do you want? The Moore family can afford it. Name your price!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was shocked by Sofia&#39;s shamelessness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had come to this dinner just to get an apology, but Sofia insulted her like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And judging by Lloyd and Thalia&#39;s expressions, they didn&#39;t seem to oppose her actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To them, she was just here to get compensation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria smirked, looking at Sofia with a half-smile. &#34;Sofia, I&#39;m afraid you can&#39;t afford the compensation I want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How much do you want?&#34; Sofia looked at her disdainfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria curled her lips and slowly said. &#34;One billion dollars.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sofia burst into laughter, pointing at Victoria with an exaggerated expression. &#34;Are you crazy? Do you know how much a billion dollars is?&#34;</p>
