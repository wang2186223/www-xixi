                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll sign.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria didn&#39;t hesitate for a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more Nora pressured her, the more she wanted to end it all quickly and cut ties with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked up the pen and swiftly signed her name. Then she asked Dr. Myers in detail about the surgery schedule and precautions, planning to arrange her work around it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back home, she called Elara and told her everything that had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elara was furious, stomping her foot. &#34;Are you out of your mind? You&#39;re messing with your health! Even if you have another kidney, this is gonna take a toll on your body. You&#39;re not even married yet. What if your future husband finds out you had this surgery? Even if he doesn&#39;t care, you wouldn&#39;t want to be a burden, would you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elara tried to talk some sense into her. &#34;Forget about your mom. After everything she&#39;s done to you, why do you still care? If you ruin your health, what about your dad&#39;s injustice? He&#39;d want you to live well. If something happens to you because of this surgery, how could you face him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria lowered her eyes, holding back tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought she was mentally prepared, but when Elara mentioned Alvin, her heart ached sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had indeed overlooked Alvin&#39;s feelings and could imagine how heartbroken he would be if he knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long pause, she said softly, &#34;Elara, please don&#39;t tell Samuel or anyone else about this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that she couldn&#39;t persuade her, Elara sighed helplessly and turned away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elara was both angry and heartbroken. She wanted to scold her, but seeing Victoria&#39;s forced strength and lonely helplessness, she just couldn&#39;t bring herself to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a mother like that, what could she do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could she really just watch Nora die?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Victoria refused, Nora would definitely spread it around, using blood tie and morality to guilt-trip her, making her live in guilt and blame for the rest of her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What a misfortune!&#34; Elara&#39;s eyes reddened. She stopped trying to persuade her and just asked, &#34;What about Samuel? Would he agree if he knew?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He doesn&#39;t agree, but he said he&#39;d respect my decision. He had a car accident recently, and I didn&#39;t tell him about the surgery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elara hesitated but finally said, &#34;Victoria, if you go through with this surgery, Samuel&#39;s parents might not accept you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s expression was calm as she nodded. &#34;I know. If they really oppose it, there&#39;s nothing I can do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This surgery made her see reality clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ordinary happiness she longed for might never be achievable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elara felt sorry for her. &#34;Samuel truly likes you. He&#39;s done a lot for you. It would be a shame to give up now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elara,&#34; Victoria forced a smile, &#34;I don&#39;t want this either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elara&#39;s heart ached. Seeing the tears in Victoria&#39;s eyes, she hugged her tightly and sighed softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three days before the surgery, Victoria went to the hospital alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to be admitted with Nora for pre-surgery checks. She felt she could handle these procedures herself and didn&#39;t ask Elara to accompany her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nora had been released on bail. Occasionally, they ran into each other during the checks, but they acted like strangers, with no interaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when Victoria wasn&#39;t looking, Nora would glare at her with cold, venomous eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria treated her like a stranger, focused solely on repaying the debt of birth and then cutting ties forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smell of disinfectant stung her nose as Victoria slowly made her way back to her room after a blood draw, leaning against the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The needle marks on her pale skin were bruised. She pulled her sleeve down but froze when she opened the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tall figure stood by the window, back facing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man wore a sharp suit, broad shoulders, and a narrow waist, exuding a cold, unapproachable aura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands were in his pockets, and despite the comfortable room temperature, he seemed to bring a chill with him, making the air around him colder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His coat was casually draped over the sofa, and a black suitcase sat on the floor, making him look travel-worn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing the noise, he turned abruptly, the cold glint from his wristwatch flashing across her terrified face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was slightly taken aback. She hadn&#39;t expected to see him again so soon, at least not so suddenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked in slowly, discarding the cotton ball pressed against her arm and pulling down her sleeve to hide the needle marks and bruises.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing him turn but not speak, Victoria broke the silence first. &#34;What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re donating a kidney to Nora?&#34; William leaned against the window, crushing a cigarette between his fingers, the embers falling onto his handmade shoes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes, filled with suppressed anger, bore into her. &#34;Victoria, do you have a brain in that head of yours?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria pressed her lips together, not answering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt it was her decision and didn&#39;t need to explain it to anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William was infuriated by her silence, a cold, humorless smile flashing across his stern face, carrying a sharp edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you&#39;re being incredibly stupid!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a deep breath, but the coldness around him remained, as he stepped closer, his smile dangerous. &#34;What is Nora to you? How dare she ask for your kidney?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria lifted her chin slightly, watching him approach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was a side of William she had never seen. Even when angry, he had always been controlled and restrained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, he seemed to have lost all reason, driven by a need to vent his fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think you&#39;re some kind of savior? Or just a pawn to be trampled on?&#34; William sneered. &#34;What makes Nora worthy of your sacrifice? Does she deserve it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped in front of her, looking down, his eyes dark and menacing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria clenched her fists, her chest heaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words hit her deepest wounds, and she struggled to hold back her tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William let out a cold laugh, mocking her. &#34;You always have a sharp tongue with me, never taking any crap. But with Nora and Bobby, you just take it, letting them walk all over you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached out, roughly grabbing her chin, forcing her to look at him. &#34;If you want to be this foolish, you need my permission first!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria desperately tried to avoid his touch, struggling to break free. &#34;Let go! I don&#39;t need your permission!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William stared at her coldly, his deep eyes flashing with a terrifying intensity. &#34;I forbid it! If you donate that kidney, I&#39;ll make sure she dies first!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria trembled, biting her lip, her stubbornness evoking pity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s heart softened, and he wanted to pull her into his arms, to kiss away all her pain and sorrow until she gave in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he couldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria shouldn&#39;t have to endure this suffering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;William, I understand your concern,&#34; Victoria choked out, &#34;but she&#39;s my mom. No matter how bad she is, I can&#39;t just watch her die. If I did, I&#39;d be in agony for the rest of my life. Can you understand that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her still so determined, William felt a surge of frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grabbed her frail arm and pushed her away, his tone harsh. &#34;Victoria! If so, I&#39;ll make her disappear right now! Let&#39;s see how she can hurt you then!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William, in his rage, seemed like a wild beast out of control. Victoria, frightened by his intensity, instinctively hugged him from behind, her voice trembling. &#34;Don&#39;t go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let go!&#34;</p>
