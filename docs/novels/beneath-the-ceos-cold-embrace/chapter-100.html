                <p>He forced down the storm of emotions in his heart, suddenly sat up, and said coldly, &#34;No, you&#39;re overthinking it. To me, you&#39;re just a toy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Victoria heard this, it felt like a boulder had struck her heart, causing a dull pain. She blinked her wet eyelashes and forced a smile. &#34;Yeah, I&#39;m just a toy you bought. But I have feelings. If you don&#39;t care about me and can&#39;t give me a proper place in your life, then don&#39;t come looking for me anymore. I don&#39;t want to get hurt by your girlfriend because of you. I wish you both happiness in advance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, William&#39;s face turned frighteningly dark. He narrowed his long, deep eyes, staring at Victoria with a cold, piercing gaze, as if he wanted to devour her alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria met his gaze fearlessly, not blinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A surge of anger rose in William&#39;s heart. He stood up, looking down at her from above, his eyes shooting out a chilling light. &#34;Fine. Very well!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he slammed the door and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria pulled the blanket over her head, curling up, a tear slipping from the corner of her eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She craved the warmth he gave her so much, and she didn&#39;t want to say anything to ruin the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she couldn&#39;t let herself get lost in an illusion of happiness; she had to stay clear-headed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>None of this belonged to her in the first place!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a man like William, the more indifferent you acted towards him, the more he wanted to conquer you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the contrary, if you showedaffection first, he would only grow tired and annoyed with you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking of William&#39;s disgusted look just now, she felt her nose tingle, and tears streamed down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t love her, never had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria closed her eyes, her heart wrenching painfully as if being torn apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William slammed the car door shut, stepped on the gas, and sped away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the way, he floored the gas pedal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t understand why, when he heard Victoria&#39;s words, a feeling akin to panic surged in his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hated this uncontrollable feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, he knew why Victoria said she liked him. It was just to use reverse psychology to push him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, he had fallen for it and said so many hurtful things to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her bruised body and pained eyes haunted him, as if ants were gnawing at his heart, making it hard to endure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden screech of brakes echoed through the city. William&#39;s knuckles turned white as he gripped the steering wheel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Victoria, what am I supposed to do with you?&#39; he wondered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria barely slept all night and was woken by her phone ringing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened her tired eyes, groggily reaching for her phone, not even looking at the screen before putting it to her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel&#39;s anxious voice came through the line, &#34;Victoria, are you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s sleepiness vanished instantly. She sat up quickly, despite the soreness all over her body. &#34;I&#39;m fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard your brother accused you of stealing his work, and then you were bullied by a group of people,&#34; Samuel&#39;s voice was heavy with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria sniffed, trying to steady her emotions. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m fine now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing her choked-up voice, Samuel&#39;s heart ached even more. &#34;Victoria, don&#39;t be afraid. My studio has surveillance. Those two paintings were completed in my studio. I can testify for you. I won&#39;t let anyone falsely accuse you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warmth surged in Victoria&#39;s heart. Besides Alvin, Samuel was the one who cared about her the most in this world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she kept letting him down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Samuel, thank you...&#34; She bit her lip. &#34;I&#39;m sorry for always dragging you into my mess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel sighed. She still didn&#39;t understand that what he wanted to hear was never her thanks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victoria, if you really want to thank me, promise me that when you run into trouble, you&#39;ll call me first. I&#39;ll do everything I can to protect you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was stunned for a moment, her eyes suddenly turning red. She choked up, &#34;Okay, I promise you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hanging up, Victoria hugged her knees, leaning against the wall, slowly squatting down, burying her head in her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew Samuel was sincere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she did have feelings for Samuel. He was like a ray of sunshine shining into her dark heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t bear to reject him, but she didn&#39;t dare to get close, afraid of tainting this pure beauty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe one day, when she completely cut ties with William and freed herself from this mess, she wouldn&#39;t avoid him anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was lost in thought for a long time until a nurse came to change her bandages, bringing her back to reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the nurse finished, she nervously opened the trending topics online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the last online attack, she was terrified of being dragged into the spotlight again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was just an ordinary girl, not strong enough to face endless insults and abuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those clueless netizens were like poisonous wasps, stinging anyone they could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such public opinion would drown her, plunging her life back into darkness, never to see the light of day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this time, she didn&#39;t fall into the abyss as expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the huge commotion last night, there wasn&#39;t a single stir online today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria guessed it was William&#39;s doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what she didn&#39;t know was that to quell the situation, Harry had personally visited each person on the list from last night, deleting all recordings and videos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He also threatened all media outlets-anyone who dared to report anything negative about Victoria would be seen as against William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This move silenced all reporters and paparazzi teams, who chose to keep quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even posts from ordinary netizens disappeared instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria breathed a sigh of relief, no longer worried about her job being affected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But with her face bruised and swollen, she wasn&#39;t fit to go out for work. She applied for two days of remote work with Diana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though her pay was significantly lower and her body was in pain, she couldn&#39;t keep taking leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Diana readily agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the CEO&#39;s office at the Scott Group</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harry knocked and entered, respectfully reporting to William, who was reviewing documents. &#34;Mr. Scott, I&#39;ve taken care of everything you arranged. All news media have retracted and blocked the stories.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William didn&#39;t look up, continuing to review the documents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He asked coldly, &#34;What about the art association?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harry paused for a moment before cautiously speaking, &#34;Mr. Scott, the art association initially refused to suppress the matter, given it involved their gold and silver award winners. But they just called to say Ms. Carter&#39;s innocence has been proven, and her awards will be reinstated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Proven?&#34; William sneered, his eyes darkening.</p>
