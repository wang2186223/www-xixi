                <p>The studio had that familiar mix of paint and turpentine in the air, with sunlight pouring through the big windows, casting warm spots on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel carefully set the painting on the easel and took a few steps back, quietly studying it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria stood off to the side, nervously fidgeting with her hands, waiting for his feedback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel looked more serious than ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His profile was striking, with a high nose bridge and sharp, focused eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After what felt like forever, he finally turned to look at Victoria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria nervously licked her lips, holding her breath, waiting for his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not bad.&#34; He broke the silence, noticing her hands shaking with anxiety, and finally smiled, giving a simple nod of approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s eyes widened in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; she asked, her face lighting up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really,&#34; Samuel said, a smile tugging at his lips. &#34;It&#39;s definitely good enough for the competition, though there&#39;s always room for improvement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria let out a huge sigh of relief, collapsing into a chair like a deflated balloon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel chuckled at her reaction and continued, &#34;You&#39;ve captured the white deer beautifully. The hurt and confusion in its eyes are really striking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked up to the painting, pointing out details on the white deer. &#34;The texture of the feathers here and the layering of the forest in the background are really well done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing Samuel&#39;s praise, Victoria felt a rush of joy, but she knew there was still a lot to learn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped closer to her work and asked, &#34;Professor Brown, what do you think I should work on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel thought for a moment, then said, &#34;From a composition standpoint, you could adjust the position and size of the white deer to make it stand out more. Also, enhancing the color contrast would make the painting more impactful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria listened carefully, marking the changes with a pencil on the paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel stood beside her, offering tips now and then. When Victoria misunderstood something, he gently corrected her, his hand briefly covering hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s heart raced as she felt his long fingers around her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were so close their breaths mingled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria suddenly felt a strange sensation and instinctively pulled back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Samuel&#39;s grip tightened, his gaze intense as if he wanted to melt her defenses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria awkwardly tugged at the corners of her mouth and tentatively asked, &#34;Professor Brown, you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Call me Samuel,&#34; he said hoarsely, &#34;That title is too formal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s cheeks turned red at his words, and she stammered, &#34;Samuel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel looked at her gently, smiling. &#34;Good girl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had spent a lot of time together, but never like this. Victoria&#39;s heart was pounding, and she didn&#39;t dare get too close to Samuel, afraid she&#39;d lose her cool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I&#39;ll go get the drawing board,&#34; Victoria said quickly, then hurried to her desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel watched her retreat, unable to hide his smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After going over some more details, it was time for lunch, and Victoria offered to treat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was just about to call him Professor Brown, then quickly corrected herself, &#34;Samuel, I just got paid. Let me treat you to a meal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel had helped her so much, and she hadn&#39;t had a chance to thank him properly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had just been promoted at Starry Studio Gallery, and her performance this month was good, earning her a couple of thousand dollars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although it was nothing compared to Samuel&#39;s income, it was a token of her appreciation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Samuel readily agreed, &#34;Sure, I won&#39;t refuse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria smiled and said, &#34;I know a nearby restaurant that&#39;s pretty good. Let&#39;s go try it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; Samuel nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After tidying up, they left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel found a parking spot, and they took the elevator to the top floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The restaurant manager saw Victoria and warmly greeted her, &#34;Ms. Carter, it&#39;s been a while. What brings you here today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria used to be a regular at this restaurant, often coming here for their Escargot, which Alvin frequently brought her to enjoy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was beautiful and polite, so the manager naturally remembered her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m here for lunch with a friend,&#34; Victoria said with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manager nodded with a smile and led them into the restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The restaurant was simply and cleanly decorated, with several famous paintings on the walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel glanced around, his gaze finally settling on a table by the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Carter, this way please,&#34; the manager said, leading them to the window seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel pulled out a chair for Victoria with a gentlemanly gesture. She thanked him before taking her seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The waiter brought the menu, and Victoria handed it to Samuel. &#34;Samuel, order whatever you like. Don&#39;t be formal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel smiled and replied, &#34;Alright, I won&#39;t hold back then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then ordered a few signature dishes, including the Escargot that Victoria had mentioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the dishes were served, Victoria raised her juice glass and smiled at Samuel. &#34;Samuel, thank you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could finish, Samuel placed his hand on her glass and shook his head. &#34;If you keep thanking me like this, I&#39;ll get angry.&#34; His tone was so serious that Victoria was momentarily stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A weary sigh escaped Samuel&#39;s lips as he watched her. &#34;Victoria,&#34; he said, the helplessness evident in his voice, &#34;you know my feelings. Why do you insist on keeping your distance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words struck a chord deep within Victoria, and she lowered her eyelashes to hide the turmoil in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said, &#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disappointment flashed in Samuel&#39;s eyes, but he forced a smile and said lightly, &#34;There&#39;s no need for apologies between us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he placed Victoria&#39;s favorite Escargot on her plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria looked down at the glistening Escargot, her nose tingling with emotion. She tried to suppress her feelings and looked up at Samuel with a bright smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle smile touched Samuel&#39;s lips, and his eyes softened with warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thought, &#39;She&#39;s still young and shy, no rush!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing some sauce on the corner of Victoria&#39;s mouth, Samuel gently took a few napkins and wiped it away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His actions were natural and smooth, without any awkwardness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This tender moment was all witnessed by William, who had just walked in.</p>
