                <p>Elara stressed, &#34;Look, no matter how Mr. Scott and Ms. Garcia feel about each other, and no matter what promises Mr. Scott made to you, Ms. Garcia is his fiancée. If she comes over and yells at you, you just have to take it! You&#39;re young and naive, but you can&#39;t keep getting tangled up in this mess. It&#39;ll ruin you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria felt a tightness in her chest as she listened to Elara&#39;s heartfelt words, making it hard to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lowered her head and stayed quiet for a bit before slowly looking up. &#34;Elara, thanks for telling me this. I know you mean well. Don&#39;t worry, I know what to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that Victoria had taken her advice to heart, Elara sighed in relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good, as long as you understand. I just hope you can get out of this situation soon and not get deeper into it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elara truly cared for Victoria, so when Ella and Willow showed up, she did her best to defend her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elara, I&#39;m really sorry.&#34; Victoria lowered her head, seeing the bruises on Elara&#39;s hand, and gently rested her forehead on it, crying in distress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine, really! Stop crying!&#34; Elara reached out and gently stroked Victoria&#39;s hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, the door opened, and a tall, thin young man walked in with some medicine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked to be about twenty-seven, dressed in a black suit, looking very handsome and capable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Victoria, he just glanced at her briefly before looking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, I got your medicine. Take it first.&#34; Robert Davis handed the medicine to the bedside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elara&#39;s eyes reddened with grievance when Robert came in, but she stayed silent because Victoria was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria poured a cup of warm water and brought it over. &#34;Elara, take your medicine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elara nodded slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Elara take the medicine, Robert turned to Victoria and asked somewhat discontentedly, &#34;Are you Victoria? Is it because of you that my mom got hurt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I&#39;m sorry,&#34; Victoria said softly, feeling extremely guilty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert snorted coldly, &#34;What&#39;s the point of saying that now? Please handle your personal life properly and don&#39;t drag others into it. Also, please find another place to live and move out of our house. I won&#39;t rent it to you anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words were very rude, and Victoria&#39;s face instantly turned red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Robert, what nonsense are you talking about!&#34; Elara called out to Robert, signaling him to stop talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elara then turned to Victoria and said, &#34;Victoria, don&#39;t take it to heart. Robert just has a bad temper. You stay here and don&#39;t worry about him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Victoria shook her head and said. &#34;This is indeed my fault. I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it weren&#39;t for her attachment to Elara, she would have agreed to move out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she couldn&#39;t bear to leave her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just go already, and stop being a nuisance here,&#34; Robert said with a frown. &#34;My mom needs to rest!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t leave...&#34; Victoria bit her lip, hesitated for a long time, and then said, &#34;Elara got hurt because of me. I want to stay and take care of her for the next couple of days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Suit yourself,&#34; Robert said impatiently. &#34;Just make sure you don&#39;t disturb my mom&#39;s rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then turned to Elara and said, &#34;I&#39;ve already called the police. They&#39;ll come by later to ask you a few questions. Just tell them the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elara glanced at Victoria and then waved her hand to Robert, saying, &#34;It&#39;s not a big deal. Why call the police? I&#39;m fine. Tell them not to come.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria knew Elara didn&#39;t want to make things harder for her by blowing this up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it had been her getting hurt, Victoria would have endured it silently. But it was Elara lying there!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t let Elara suffer just to save her own reputation!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Robert could say anything, Victoria firmly said, &#34;If someone does something wrong, they have to pay the price. We must call the police!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert was taken aback, clearly not expecting her to say that. His gaze toward her started to shift slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elara, of course, was unwilling, but no matter what she said, Victoria was determined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Victoria&#39;s resolute expression, Robert tentatively asked, &#34;Ms. Carter, have you thought this through? Going through the legal process can be very troublesome, and we might not get the result we want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria shook her head, her eyes firm. &#34;I know it might be troublesome, but I can&#39;t just let it go. They can&#39;t bully Elara without facing any consequences,&#34; she responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elara hurriedly said, &#34;Victoria, let it go. Don&#39;t make such a big deal out of it because of me. It&#39;s not a big deal; I&#39;ll be fine after some rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria held Elara&#39;s hand, gentle but firm. &#34;They must be held accountable for their actions. You can&#39;t just suffer in vain. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll face this with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert looked at Victoria, his impression of her slightly changing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at Elara and said, &#34;Mom, did you forget I&#39;m a lawyer? I&#39;ll personally handle your case. What are you afraid of?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Elara remembered and said sheepishly, &#34;Look at me. I completely forgot about you. Robert, I&#39;ll rely on you then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert rolled his eyes helplessly. &#34;I got it. You rest well. I&#39;ll go prepare the documents.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elara was about to nod when she suddenly remembered Victoria and immediately said, &#34;Victoria hasn&#39;t had dinner yet. Take her to get something to eat!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom! I have work to do,&#34; Robert said, somewhat unwilling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria noticed Robert&#39;s displeasure and quickly said, &#34;Elara, don&#39;t worry about me. I&#39;m not hungry. You must be tired; I&#39;ll stay here with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need to eat. You need energy to take care of me!&#34; Elara felt a pang of distress seeing Victoria so thin and frail. She then turned to Robert and shouted, &#34;I told you to take her to get something to eat, so go! Are you ignoring me now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to argue with her, Robert finally agreed to take Victoria out to get something to eat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At a fast-food restaurant outside the hospital, they each ordered a simple plate of spaghetti.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria seemed to have little appetite, putting down her utensils after just a few bites.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at Robert, hesitated for a moment, and then said, &#34;Mr. Davis, I&#39;m really sorry about today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert glanced at Victoria, his tone cold. &#34;You don&#39;t need to apologize to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused for a moment and then added, &#34;There&#39;s nothing left to say between us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria froze, lowering her eyes, not daring to meet Robert&#39;s gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything else? If not, I&#39;m leaving,&#34; Robert said indifferently, preparing to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait,&#34; Victoria called out to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything else?&#34; Robert turned and asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria bit her lip and said, &#34;Can&#39;t I move out? I promise nothing like this will happen again! I swear!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Victoria&#39;s earnest expression, Robert found it amusing and sarcastically said, &#34;What do you have to promise? Your words?&#34;</p>
