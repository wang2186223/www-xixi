                <p>Alvin&#39;s company had been growing like crazy over the past few years. Thanks to his sharp eye for architectural trends, a bunch of landmark projects that mixed innovative ideas with human touches had created quite a buzz in the industry as soon as they hit the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On top of that, Victoria&#39;s incredible talent often brought fresh creative inspiration to the table, helping Alvin&#39;s company stand out from the competition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In just a few short years, Alvin&#39;s Dreamscape Construction had gone from a little-known firm to one of the top players in the architectural design world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was already a bona fide heiress, but the challenges and trials of the past few years had made her more composed and grounded. The external accolades and vanity that others chased were fleeting in her eyes, never truly capturing her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alvin had tried many times to persuade her to quit her job, but Victoria had her own considerations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First, she hadn&#39;t yet graduated from the University of Aesthetics Shine and didn&#39;t want to disrupt her current life plans. Second, she had deep emotional ties to Starry Studio Gallery, where she had worked for many years. The thought of leaving that job was something she couldn&#39;t bear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her stubborn attitude left Alvin with no choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was organizing materials for an out-of-town art exchange event at Starry Studio Gallery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her colleague Ember, arms crossed and leaning against the doorframe, frowned and asked, &#34;Marcella wants you to go with her to the industry exchange event to accept the design award?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34; Victoria carefully placed a catalog into a box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How shameless can she be!&#34; Ember fumed. &#34;The idea was yours, the design sketches were drawn by you, and even the presentation plan was meticulously prepared by you! What right does she have to take credit for it? And to make it worse, she wants you to accompany her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria remained calm. &#34;She&#39;s the manager of Starry Studio Gallery, and I&#39;m an employee. It&#39;s my job to do more work. For me, every project is a valuable growth opportunity. The experience I gain now will be useful in the future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ember shook her head in exasperation. &#34;You&#39;re too forgiving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria looked up at her and smiled, changing the subject. &#34;I&#39;m leaving now. Keep an eye on things at the gallery. If there&#39;s any problem, contact me right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria finished packing her luggage and took a cab to the airport.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Marcella saw Victoria, her face instantly darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you just getting here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcella looked only a few years older than Victoria, dressed stylishly and exuding the aura of a seasoned professional.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, there was traffic.&#34; Victoria didn&#39;t offer much explanation and headed straight to the VIP lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why didn&#39;t you leave earlier?&#34; Marcella pressed on. &#34;Victoria, you should know, I could take anyone. There are plenty of people at the gallery eager for this opportunity!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I get it.&#34; Victoria was used to her attitude and responded accordingly, then greeted the assistant manager, Terrence Wheeler, who was sitting on the other side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terrence was known for being easygoing and was leading the team to the industry exchange event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Marcella about to continue her tirade, Terrence smiled to ease the tension. &#34;Marcella, we&#39;re not at the office. Don&#39;t be too harsh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how much Marcella disliked Victoria, she had to show respect to Terrence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was Hugo&#39;s trusted aide, and only his age had led Hugo to assign him simpler tasks at the gallery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcella&#39;s lips curled into a cold smile. &#34;Since Terrence is speaking up for you, I&#39;ll let it go. But you need to be punctual. We can&#39;t be waiting for a mere sales assistant!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria nodded, acknowledging her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, the three of them boarded the plane. Terrence and Marcella sat in business class, while Victoria was in economy class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When booking the tickets, Alvin had offered to get her a first-class seat, but Victoria didn&#39;t want to draw attention and booked according to the company&#39;s travel policy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After boarding, Victoria helped Marcella with her luggage, took out her tablet, and settled her in before returning to her own seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terrence praised her, &#34;Victoria is great, diligent and reliable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcella, however, said slowly, &#34;But she&#39;s too meticulous, always scheming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terrence was taken aback, not understanding her meaning, but didn&#39;t ask further, clearly not wanting to get involved in their conflict.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Victoria sat down, she noticed the young girl next to her was engrossed in her phone, looking at unique and exquisite architectural designs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl sensed Victoria&#39;s gaze and turned to her enthusiastically. &#34;Do you like architectural design too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know a bit about it,&#34; Victoria replied, recognizing the designs from Dreamscape Construction, each one a testament to the company&#39;s glory and the designers&#39; hard work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl was clearly passionate about architectural design, eagerly sharing her insights on the designs throughout the flight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the ingenious spatial layouts to how the exterior harmonized with the surroundings, every detail sparked her deep analysis, and her words were filled with admiration for the buildings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was exhausted, having stayed up late the previous night preparing crucial presentation materials and an acceptance speech for Marcella. Marcella&#39;s demands were high; the materials had to be comprehensive and beautifully formatted to showcase the company&#39;s professionalism and high-end image perfectly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The acceptance speech had to be unique, making her shine in the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her fatigue, Victoria listened attentively to the girl&#39;s enthusiastic sharing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until they were about to disembark that the girl reluctantly said goodbye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three arrived in the destination city, where the Simpson Group had meticulously booked their hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the car stopped, Marcella got out and, looking back at Victoria, imperiously ordered, &#34;Victoria, carry my luggage inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then walked into the hotel lobby with an elegant yet haughty stride, immediately putting on a warm smile as she greeted familiar colleagues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria quietly took care of the luggage and then went to the front desk to check in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcella, having finished her chat, headed towards the elevator, still urging, &#34;Victoria, hurry up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it.&#34; Victoria quickly grabbed the room keys, picked up the luggage, and hurried to the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcella adjusted her hair, standing in the elevator, and gave Victoria a disdainful look. &#34;Can&#39;t you move any faster?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria didn&#39;t respond, pressing the button for their floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the elevator doors were about to close, a hand reached in, causing the doors to slowly reopen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hand was fair and delicate, with long, well-manicured fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s heart skipped a beat as she saw the hand, and she looked up slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man outside the elevator was dressed in a dark suit with a light blue shirt underneath, the top two buttons undone. He was tall and handsome, with features that seemed meticulously sculpted, exuding an irresistible charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Marcella, who was used to seeing attractive men, was momentarily stunned, staring at him for a long time.</p>
