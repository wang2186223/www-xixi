                <p>Victoria felt waves of pleasure radiating from her core, making her moan uncontrollably. Hearing her, William got even more excited, thrusting into her warm, soft body and moving in a steady rhythm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s body tensed up, sweat forming on her forehead, and she was in such intense pain that she almost fainted, biting her lip to keep from making a sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face turned pale, and sweat dripped down her temples, soaking the pillow. She felt like her body was being crushed, like she was in a burning furnace. The agony was so intense she nearly convulsed, like a flower about to wither, left to be ravaged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William kept moving, his thrusts making it hard for Victoria to breathe. Her mind went blank. Finally, William released himself, ejaculating before slowly pulling out and lying beside her, panting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you enjoy it?&#34; William asked with a cold smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s face was as pale as paper, her eyes unfocused. She didn&#39;t deny it because she didn&#39;t have the strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Slut! You&#39;re just like Avlin-really disgusting!&#34; William spat out fiercely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria felt like a bolt of lightning had struck her out of nowhere. Her entire being felt shattered. She went from the highest of highs to the lowest of lows in an instant, crashing straight into the depths of despair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared in disbelief at the man who had just been inside her. How could he humiliate her like this? He even insulted her most beloved father!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt so dirty, so low. In extreme pain and self-denial, Victoria felt a sharp pain in her chest, as if a fire was burning. Her body swayed, and her vision began to blur. She wanted to say something, but no sound came out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood, thick and salty, flooded her throat. She felt like she was burning from the inside out, her body shaking uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria coughed violently, blood pouring from her mouth and nose. It splattered on the white sheets, staining them with dark red blotches. Her vision blurred, and William&#39;s face swam out of focus. She collapsed backward, hitting the bed with a thud, and everything went black</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William, who had been lost in his twisted high, was suddenly struck by the sight. His mind went blank, his heart seized up, and a wave of fear he&#39;d never felt before washed over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at Victoria lying naked on the blood-stained sheets, her eyes closed and her face as pale as paper. She appeared lifeless, like a broken doll.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly reached out, gently touching Victoria&#39;s cheek. Her skin was so cold that his heart sank. He shouted, &#34;Victoria! Wake up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mind was in chaos, thoughts intertwining, his eyes filled with confusion as he looked at Victoria, unconscious on the bed. Hatred and disgust still surged within him, but there was also an inexplicable trace of worry. He didn&#39;t understand why he felt this way. He should hate her and want her to suffer as he had. But seeing Victoria in such a fragile state, fainting from his humiliation, he felt a twinge of guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After quickly dressing himself and Victoria, he pressed the call button. The doctor arrived quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smelling the scent in the room, the doctor felt a moment of awkwardness. But he quickly composed himself, walked to Victoria, and checked her condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is she?&#34; William asked urgently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a thorough examination, the doctor became very serious, advising earnestly, &#34;Sir, please be more restrained. The patient was seriously injured yesterday, and her body has been very weak. She seems to have been suffering from long-term insomnia and hasn&#39;t been eating properly. She&#39;s very thin, showing signs of anorexia and depression. The recent emotional upset has worsened her condition. She needs to rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing the doctor&#39;s words, William frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure she has anorexia and depression?&#34; William questioned, &#34;She always seemed so strong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These are just some early symptoms. Sir, please take good care of the patient&#39;s emotions,&#34; the doctor replied, then began emergency treatment for Victoria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William stood by the bed, staring at Victoria&#39;s pale face, feeling a whirlwind of emotions. After a moment, he called Harry. &#34;Get a caregiver for her,&#34; he said quietly, then left the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t sure why he was doing this-maybe a bit of guilt, or maybe he didn&#39;t want her to die just yet. She still had &#34;debts&#34; to repay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harry looked at Victoria&#39;s frail state on the bed, feeling a pang of sympathy. Her face was ghostly pale, tubes sticking out of her, making her look incredibly fragile and helpless. But Harry was just an employee and couldn&#39;t go against William&#39;s orders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly found an experienced caregiver and instructed, &#34;Take good care of her and report any changes to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The caregiver nodded, promising to look after Victoria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria lay in the hospital, drifting in and out of consciousness for two days. During this time, Nora came to see her. She glanced at Victoria&#39;s pale face, saw she wasn&#39;t awake, and frowned. &#34;Ugh, when is she gonna wake up already? We&#39;re waiting on her cash.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nora didn&#39;t even think about getting closer to the hospital bed. Instead, she crossed her arms, walked around the room, and looked at everything with cold eyes, like she was just examining some insignificant object. After a few minutes, she got bored, pulled out her phone, and then left with a huff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria spent two days unconscious in the hospital. As soon as she came to, William ordered her back to the company, saying there was an important event she had to attend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Scott Group had been working on this project for a long time and finally managed to get the two key executives to attend the dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If they could secure this deal, the Scott Group&#39;s influence would rise significantly. So William couldn&#39;t afford any mistakes at this dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since he had worked on this project with Victoria from the beginning, she had to attend the dinner. When Victoria received the notice, she felt a sense of helplessness and bitterness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her body was still very weak, with every movement feeling like knives cutting into her, but she knew she had no right to refuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Victoria arrived at the Scott Group, William happened to be coming down the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today, he was dressed in a dark custom suit, with a neat tie and a gemstone pin that gleamed coldly. His shoes were polished, and he stood tall and imposing, exuding a cold and noble aura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chiseled features bore a distant expression, and his stoic demeanor created an invisible barrier that made him difficult to approach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria hurriedly got out of the taxi, hastily tidying her clothes, and then walked quickly towards William in her high heels. Yet she stopped about three feet away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Scott,&#34; Victoria said respectfully, bowing her head slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William glanced at the limited-edition Rolex on his wrist. The dial was a deep, dark blue. He then gave Victoria a cold, indifferent look, his eyes devoid of any warmth. Without a word, he walked straight toward his black Maybach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria quickly walked a few steps ahead to open the car door for William. After he got in, she gently closed the door and then got into the passenger seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today&#39;s crucial business meeting was arranged at the city&#39;s top five-star hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William valued this project highly and had been personally involved from the start. The other party seemed to sense William&#39;s seriousness and had been trying to get the best deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they met in the reserved private room, they first exchanged handshakes and pleasantries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kirk Gutierrez, one of them, said, &#34;Hello, Mr. Scott. I&#39;ve heard so much about you. It&#39;s great to meet you in person finally. You truly live up to your reputation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William and Victoria were young and imposing, while the other party consisted of a group of shrewd men in their forties. They shook hands with William first, then turned their attention to Victoria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And this is...&#34; asked the other man, Rufus Chapman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria got up slowly. Her tailored suit hugged her slender, curvy figure. Her small, delicate face was perfectly made up. But even with all the makeup, you could still see how tired and worn-out she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled and introduced herself, &#34;Mr. Gutierrez, Mr. Chapman. I&#39;m Mr. Scott&#39;s assistant, Victoria.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After they sat down, William got straight to the point, discussing the project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the other party was cunning. Kirk waved his hand, his eyes fixed on the beautiful Victoria, and said, &#34;With such a beauty here, why talk about work? Let&#39;s eat first.&#34;</p>
