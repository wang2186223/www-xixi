                <p>Victoria was taken aback for a second and shot back, &#34;Who do you think I&#39;m hitting on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William grabbed her delicate neck with one hand, his voice icy, &#34;Besides Joshua, who else could it be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria struggled, pushing against his solid chest with both hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s grip tightened, making it harder for her to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasping, she managed to say, &#34;Mr. Thomas is just a teacher I met while auditing at the University of Aesthetics Shine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she finished speaking, she felt his fingers loosen around her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria coughed a few times, taking deep breaths to recover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She really thought she was going to die just now; the feeling of suffocation was unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William flicked the ash from his cigarette leisurely and said indifferently, &#34;I don&#39;t want to hear any nonsense. Tell me the truth. You know I hate being lied to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria steadied her breathing, slumping on the sofa like a dead fish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, she sat up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her pale face had a strange flush, her hair disheveled, looking somewhat pitiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering her eyes, Victoria said hoarsely, &#34;I&#39;m not lying to you. Mr. Thomas is really just a mentor I met while auditing. He took me in as a student out of pity because I was being cyberbullied, but he hasn&#39;t actually taught me anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria wasn&#39;t lying; even if William investigated, he would only find this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William raised an eyebrow and asked, &#34;That&#39;s all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, that&#39;s all,&#34; Victoria confirmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William stared at her for a while, then suddenly sneered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was startled, not knowing what his laugh meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine, remember what you said. If you dare to flirt with other men behind my back...&#34; William looked at Victoria coldly, a hint of ruthlessness flashing in his eyes before quickly disappearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing this, Victoria felt a pang of anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking of Samuel&#39;s confession, she felt a wave of bitterness surge in her heart. Her eyes moistened as she lowered her head without speaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, I&#39;ve finished my questions. Now for the real business,&#34; William said and patted the spot next to him, signaling her to sit over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria hesitated for a moment but eventually moved over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she sat down next to William, he wrapped his arms around her slender, soft waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His warm, broad hand rested on her buttocks, kneading through the thin fabric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s face immediately turned red, her waist twisting, but she didn&#39;t resist for once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William, satisfied, tightened his grip on her waist, his deep voice sounding in her ear. &#34;That&#39;s better. Although watching you resist is quite appetizing, it gets boring after a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he stood up and lifted her into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sudden feeling of being airborne made Victoria instinctively wrap her arms around his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William carried her to the edge of a bathtub the size of half a room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kissed her small earlobe tenderly and said, &#34;The bathtub at your place was too small. I couldn&#39;t even exert myself properly last time; I felt really frustrated. This bathtub is big enough. How about we take a bath together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s voice seemed tinged with the steamy mist. His scorching lips fell on her neck and continued downward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria felt a flush of heat from his shameless words, shyly turning her face away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing this, William chuckled lowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The water was already more than halfway full, emitting a steamy heat, and both of them felt increasingly hot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William lifted her again and placed her in the water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her top was completely soaked, the thin layer of fabric becoming transparent, revealing the outline of her black underwear underneath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s gaze grew even more intense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Help me undress, got it?&#34; William said flippantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Victoria bit her lip, not moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unwilling? You can choose to leave, but our two-month agreement will be void,&#34; William said, starting to unzip his pants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria quickly grabbed his hand, biting her lower lip. &#34;I&#39;ll help you undress,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William leaned back in the bathtub, crossing his legs, enjoying the feel of Victoria&#39;s soft hands moving over his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After saying that, she climbed off his lap, knelt down, and started unbuttoning his shirt, removing the wet garment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it came to his pants, she hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William urged, &#34;Hurry up. If you take any longer, we&#39;ll starve tonight!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria looked up, meeting his deep, dark eyes, her heart skipping a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bit her lip and reached for his zipper, slowly pulling down his pants. &#34;Now, is this okay?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William, barely able to contain himself, had been suppressing his urges. He replied, &#34;Keep going, there&#39;s still one more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Victoria heard this, her hand paused for a moment before continuing to remove his underwear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When their bodies were completely exposed to each other, his erection was already standing at attention for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s face suddenly burned, her head lowering even further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not your first time. Do I need to teach you what to do next?&#34; William teased deliberately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria looked up, her eyes misty, looking particularly enticing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William felt like he was about to explode from holding back, but he still restrained himself, urging, &#34;Hurry up, use your mouth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s face turned crimson. Although she had been with him many times, she had never given him a blowjob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now being forced, her heart raced, her legs stiffening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William continued, &#34;Hurry up. I&#39;m waiting for you to please me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria licked her dry lips, slowly bending down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She approached his firm waist, extending her pink tongue to gently lick his erection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each touch sent a tingling sensation through him, William squinting his eyes, his Adam&#39;s apple bobbing as he let out a low growl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt like all the blood in his body was rushing to one place, ready to burst out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He groaned, grabbed her shoulders, and began thrusting rapidly into her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria felt like her throat was being pierced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was extremely uncomfortable, unable to help but whimper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing this, William pulled his erection out of her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lifted her onto his lap, gripping her waist, and thrust into her forcefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria cried out, her body trembling from the impact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cheeks were flushed, looking beautiful and alluring, her eyes gazing at him with deep affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She originally had a pure and delicate appearance, but now, her brows and eyes had taken on a seductive charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s gaze deepened as he leaned forward to press against her. His voice was hoarse as he murmured, &#34;Baby, you&#39;re such a tempting enchantress!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s face turned even redder at his words, her body going limp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stammered, &#34;I&#39;m not...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, William rudely covered her lips, prying open her teeth, and entangling her tongue with his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips trailed down, gently nibbling on her nipples, while his lower body continued to thrust into her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria felt like her body was floating on clouds, as if she was about to leave the earth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their breathing grew heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s breathing became labored, sweat beads forming on his forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria felt like she was about to suffocate, her strength completely drained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, William was released.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria lay in his arms, panting heavily, her cheeks flushed, looking so beautiful that he couldn&#39;t get enough of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then carried her out of the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria, completely exhausted, let William carry her to the bed, cover her with a blanket, and then press down on her again, continuing to explore her with vigor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They tangled on the bed for a while until Victoria was so tired she was about to fall asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William held her in his arms, looking at her with an inexplicable expression. He said, &#34;There&#39;s a business dinner tomorrow. You&#39;re coming with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria, barely hearing him, responded perfunctorily before closing her eyes and drifting off to sleep.</p>
