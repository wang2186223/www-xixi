                <p>&#34;Get her to the hospital,&#34; William barked as he rushed Victoria to the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harry whipped out his phone and dialed the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car zoomed down the road, and William stayed quiet, eyes down. He looked at Victoria, pale and lifeless in his arms, her face white as a ghost, with dark red bloodstains still visible on her body. It was a shocking sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thin mist clouded William&#39;s brows, and his deep eyes seemed to gather the storm clouds of an impending tempest. Blood started seeping from Victoria&#39;s wounds again, soaking William&#39;s expensive, tailored suit jacket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they got to the hospital, Victoria was rushed into the emergency room. William stayed outside, his gaze fixed on the glowing sign above the operating room doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harry, seeing the situation, didn&#39;t say a word, just standing by William silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long while, William suddenly turned to Harry and said coldly, &#34;Ella&#39;s getting out of hand. Teach her a lesson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William thought to himself, &#39;I didn&#39;t want to punish Ella for Victoria&#39;s sake; I just thought she was too disobedient. If she becomes my wife, she&#39;ll be even more unruly! The Scott family&#39;s daughter-in-law doesn&#39;t need to be particularly clever, but she absolutely cannot defy me.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harry got the message and replied respectfully, &#34;Got it, Mr. Scott.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After nearly three hours of resuscitation, Victoria was moved to the ICU, still in a deep coma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William hurriedly asked the doctor about Victoria&#39;s condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The patient&#39;s internal injuries are severe. Although she&#39;s out of immediate danger, she won&#39;t wake up until tomorrow at the earliest. Plus, her back injury is quite serious. Whether there will be any long-term effects depends on her recovery. In severe cases, she might even be paralyzed,&#34; Dr. Parker, who had treated Victoria several times, said with a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s face instantly turned dark and terrifying. He said, &#34;I won&#39;t allow that to happen!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Scott, getting angry at me won&#39;t help!&#34; Dr. Parker adjusted his glasses, looking a bit helpless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thought, &#39;Has William Scott read too many novels and lost his mind? If he really cared so much, where was he earlier? Victoria had been to the hospital several times in the past few months, each time more serious than the last. Now he wants to act all affectionate?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William, hearing this, slightly furrowed his brows and then said, &#34;Treat her, no matter the cost!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dr. Parker rather liked this statement. After all, in this day and age, there were very few illnesses that money couldn&#39;t cure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So Dr. Parker agreed and immediately called to have a batch of special medicines airlifted from an affiliated hospital abroad to give Victoria the best treatment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendy and Diana, upon learning that Victoria had been found, rushed to the hospital even though it was already midnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as they entered the ward, Wendy rushed up and anxiously asked Dr. Parker, &#34;Where is Victoria? How is she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dr. Parker removed his mask and glanced at the two, saying, &#34;She&#39;s temporarily out of danger, but she still needs to be hospitalized for observation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Wendy and Diana breathed a sigh of relief, then noticed William, who was standing nearby with broad shoulders and a distinguished demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendy curiously looked him over, thinking that William was really handsome! Although Diana had never met William, she immediately guessed who he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped forward and introduced herself, &#34;Mr. Scott, hello, I&#39;m Diana from Starry Studio Gallery. We spoke on the phone today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, William responded indifferently, then fixed his deep gaze on Victoria lying in the hospital bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Diana ignored his indifference. As Victoria&#39;s boss, she felt it was her responsibility to inquire about her condition. &#34;I need to know how Victoria went missing and why she&#39;s so badly hurt,&#34; Diana said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William pressed his lips together, his handsome face showing no emotion. &#34;I&#39;ll explain it to her,&#34; he replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Diana smiled and said, &#34;Alright then, Mr. Scott. We&#39;ll be going now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William nodded and waved his hand, signaling they could leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the Garcia Villa, Harry, along with a bunch of bodyguards, found Zachary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He relayed William&#39;s message about taking Ella on a little trip down memory lane. Zachary, who was about to hit the sack, knew right away that Willow and Ella must have done something stupid again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glared at the two angrily. Ella, hiding in Willow&#39;s arms, didn&#39;t get why William was making such a big deal out of this. Wasn&#39;t it just locking Victoria up for a couple of days?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she heard from her bodyguard that Victoria had been taken away by William, Ella didn&#39;t care. She&#39;d done worse things before, and William had never stood up for any woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until she saw William&#39;s head bodyguard, Harry, a former special forces captain, leading a large team to the Garcia Villa to &#34;escort&#34; her, that she realized she might have really pissed William off this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terrified, she hid behind Willow and cried, &#34;Mom, William must be angry. What should I do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing Ella&#39;s cries, Willow panicked. She soothingly patted Ella&#39;s head and then looked up at Harry. &#34;Sir, what do you mean by this?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Scott just wants to take Ms. Garcia somewhere. She&#39;ll be back safe in two days,&#34; Harry calmly explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if I refuse?&#34; Willow snorted coldly, clearly not accepting it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Scott said that if Ms. Garcia doesn&#39;t go, the engagement between the Scott family and the Garcia family will be called off, and all joint projects will be terminated immediately,&#34; Harry said calmly, but with a hint of threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow&#39;s face turned livid with anger. &#34;You dare threaten me!&#34; she shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Garcia, you misunderstand. I&#39;m just doing my duty. Mr. Scott said that if you insist on not letting Ms. Garcia go, we will have to force our way in,&#34; Harry said expressionlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are too presumptuous!&#34; Willow pointed at Harry angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough!&#34; Zachary shouted coldly. He then stood up and walked towards Harry, saying, &#34;Since Mr. Scott has extended such a gracious invitation, I must show him this respect. However, I hope Mr. Scott keeps his promise and returns Ella safely in two days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harry nodded. &#34;Mr. Garcia, rest assured. Mr. Scott never breaks his promises.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing Zachary about to hand her over to Harry, Ella cried out, &#34;Dad, are you really going to let me suffer? I may not be as important as Alice in your heart, but I&#39;m still your daughter, right? How can you be so heartless!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Zachary stopped, turned around, and sternly scolded, &#34;Shut up! Haven&#39;t you caused enough trouble? If it weren&#39;t for your stupidity, how would things have come to this? Besides, William said he wouldn&#39;t harm you. Do you really want to break off the engagement and become the laughingstock of Silvermist City?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zachary didn&#39;t know what Ella and Willow had done this time, but seeing William&#39;s reaction, he knew William was truly angry. If they lost their connection with the Scott family through marriage, the Garcia family would suffer greatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In comparison, letting Ella take some punishment was nothing. Maybe she would learn to behave and cause less trouble in the future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Ella fell silent. She was afraid of suffering, but she was even more afraid of losing William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On one hand, she genuinely liked him; on the other, the title of William&#39;s fiancée brought her too much vanity and satisfaction. She couldn&#39;t bear to lose it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she soon regretted it when Harry took her to the basement where Victoria had been held, threw her inside, and locked the iron door.</p>
