                <p>She didn&#39;t dare to look up, keeping her head down as she brushed past them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William called out to her, &#34;Victoria, let me take you back!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria stopped in her tracks, slowly turned around, and calmly said, &#34;No need, Mr. Scott.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After speaking, she started walking towards the cable car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William frowned as he watched her frail figure, a hint of worry appearing between his brows. He pressed his thin lips together and finally decided to stride after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice stood there in a daze for a while, looking at his tall and upright figure, her lips curling into a mocking smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William grabbed Victoria&#39;s hand, &#34;Don&#39;t be stubborn. It&#39;s so early, there are no cars at the foot of the mountain to take you back to the city!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria shook off his hand and stubbornly said, &#34;Thank you, Mr. Scott, but there&#39;s no need to trouble you. I&#39;ll take the bus back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William furrowed his brows, seeing her attitude, he didn&#39;t bother to argue. He let go of her hand, but when he saw her stumble a few steps and almost fall, he quickly supported her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand was cold and weak, her whole body trembling slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victoria!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Scott, please leave me alone. I&#39;m really fine. All I ask is that you and your girlfriend stay away from me. I&#39;ve had enough,&#34; Victoria murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing her mention the word &#34;girlfriend,&#34; William&#39;s face darkened instantly, his voice low and tinged with anger, &#34;Victoria, do you have to be like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria closed her eyes, refusing to look at him, and coldly said, &#34;Please, Mr. Scott, show some respect. We have nothing to do with each other anymore!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After speaking, without waiting for William&#39;s reaction, she pushed him away and walked straight ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked faster and faster, just in time to catch a cable car that was about to depart, squeezing herself in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cable car seat held only her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria closed her eyes and leaned back in the seat, unable to tell if she felt more sadness or anger, or perhaps both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took out her phone and blocked all of William&#39;s contacts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William watched that lonely, slender figure, his heart inexplicably aching, as if someone had torn it apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze gradually darkened, a complex emotion flashing in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After returning from Snowflake Peak, Victoria fell ill, suffering from a severe fever and cough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took some medicine, insisted on going to work during the day, and went to the hospital for IV drips at night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendy felt extremely sorry for her seeing her like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took the initiative to accompany her to the hospital every day, taking care of her and making food for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under her care, Victoria quickly recovered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She put all the unpleasant things behind her and focused all her energy on work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was time to pick up a painting from Samuel&#39;s studio.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel had previously agreed to send a painting to Starry Studio Gallery for consignment every month.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Diana was urging her to go and get it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since the trip to Snowflake Peak, the two had not contacted each other, not even a single message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria took a few deep breaths, trying to suppress the strange feeling in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although she still felt very awkward, for the sake of work, she had to force herself to find Samuel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated for a moment outside the studio before ringing the doorbell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, the door opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person who opened the door was Ryan, whom Victoria had met once. He was wearing loose sportswear, revealing his strong, muscular waist and sexy abs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Ryan saw that it was Victoria at the door, his expression stiffened slightly, then returned to normal, asking, &#34;What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria opened her mouth, not knowing what to say for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in!&#34; he said, stepping aside to let Victoria in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m looking for Samuel. Is he not here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan&#39;s fingers twitched slightly, and he said nonchalantly, &#34;If you&#39;re his girlfriend, I&#39;ll call him out for you. If you&#39;re not, then don&#39;t waste each other&#39;s time!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Victoria&#39;s cheeks flushed, and she lowered her gaze, softly saying, &#34;Sorry to bother you!&#34; She then turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that she was really leaving, Ryan quickly called out to her. After hesitating for a moment, he finally relented, &#34;Fine, you&#39;re here to pick up a painting, right? He&#39;s prepared it for you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was stunned for a moment, then looked up at Ryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan crossed his arms and nodded slightly, &#34;Aren&#39;t you going? Do you want me to carry you there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s cheeks heated up, and she quickly walked a few steps forward, walking beside Ryan, heading to the third-floor storage room where the paintings were kept.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan handed her the painting Samuel had prepared, his tone flat, &#34;You can go now. Don&#39;t come looking for him again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Victoria suddenly looked up, her eyes instantly welling up with tears, &#34;Is he still mad at me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan sneered, looking at her coldly, &#34;How could he be mad at you? He&#39;s mad at himself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan sighed, &#34;I&#39;ve known him since we were kids. I&#39;ve never seen him care so much about any girl. I&#39;ve never seen him so heartbroken over anyone. You&#39;re the only one. He loves you very much, you should understand that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria bit her lip, &#34;I&#39;m not good enough for him! He deserves better!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing her say this, Ryan became even angrier, his tone becoming much more serious, &#34;Whether you&#39;re good enough or not isn&#39;t for you to decide. And I believe he cherishes you more than anyone else, doesn&#39;t he? Look, what are these?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan walked to the side and pulled back the curtain covering the paintings, revealing a large pile of paintings, all of different versions of Victoria-happy, sad, shy, and so on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of them were of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These were all painted by him,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria stared blankly at the paintings in front of her, a crystal tear sliding down her cheek. She raised her hand to wipe away the tear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan took a few steps closer, bent down, and took a tissue from his pocket, handing it to her, his voice gentle, &#34;He really likes you. He said you&#39;re the only girl in the world who can make him feel calm and peaceful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s eyes were moist, and she choked out, &#34;Where did he go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He went to the polar regions to see the aurora. He originally wanted to take you with him during your annual leave, but it seems you hurt him pretty badly this time. He said he wanted to give you time to think it over. If you ultimately choose not to be with him, he will still wish you happiness,&#34; Ryan said with a bitter smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Victoria&#39;s heart tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand. Thank you for telling me!&#34; she said, then turned and quickly ran away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan watched her back and sighed deeply, feeling sorry for Samuel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He really didn&#39;t understand what Victoria was thinking. Samuel was mature, handsome, and talented. How could he not compare to the fickle William?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did all women have a masochistic streak?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did they all like scoundrels and jerks?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After placing the painting back in the gallery, Victoria took the subway home in a daze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she was almost home, she saw a new barbecue restaurant had opened at the entrance of her community. She suddenly wanted to drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria ordered some skewers and a dozen beers, drinking, crying, and laughing, like a madwoman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria got completely drunk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took out her phone from her bag and dialed Samuel&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t get through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, he was watching the aurora now. How could he answer her call?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria hung up and asked the owner for another dozen beers, continuing to drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s mind was filled with images of Samuel and those paintings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the table next to her, a few middle-aged men were also drunk, and their eyes soon fell on Victoria.</p>
