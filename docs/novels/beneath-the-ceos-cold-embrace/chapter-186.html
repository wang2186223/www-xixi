                <p>Alvin trailed behind, lugging their bags as they slowly made their way out of the airport terminal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victoria!&#34; Samuel called out from the arrivals gate, holding a big bouquet of champagne roses, standing tall and confident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was dressed in a gray shirt and casual pants, with gold-rimmed glasses perched on his nose. His chiseled face wore a gentle smile, giving him a refined and handsome look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Women passing by couldn&#39;t help but glance over, their eyes filled with envy and jealousy, wishing they could trade places with Victoria and be the girl receiving such affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Samuel?&#34; Victoria was surprised, quickly walking up to him. &#34;What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel stepped forward, taking over the luggage cart with a gentlemanly smile. &#34;Of course, I&#39;m here to pick up my girlfriend and bring her home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then turned to Alvin. &#34;Mr. Carter, hello. I&#39;m Samuel. Victoria has mentioned you often, and it&#39;s a pleasure to finally meet you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a slight bow, polite and humble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alvin sized up Samuel, noting his well-mannered behavior, and a hint of approval flashed in his eyes. He nodded slightly. &#34;Hello, thank you for coming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear that Alvin had a favorable impression of Samuel, a stark contrast to his attitude towards William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Carter, this is what I should do,&#34; Samuel said, then looked at Victoria with a soft smile. &#34;You must be exhausted from the trip, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing his attentive demeanor, Victoria felt a pang of bitterness in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief hesitation, she reached out and linked her arm with Samuel&#39;s, resting her head lightly on his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To onlookers, they appeared to be a sweet couple reunited after a long separation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alvin looked on, satisfied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel&#39;s handsome face showed a moment of surprise, quickly replaced by joy. His gaze at Victoria was so intense it seemed to melt her, and he couldn&#39;t help but smile. Leaning close, he whispered in her ear, &#34;Did you miss me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s cheeks flushed, and she gave him a playful glare, signaling with her eyes that Alvin was still nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, alright, we&#39;ll talk later,&#34; Samuel said, his warm breath tickling her ear, making her blush even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel then turned to Alvin. &#34;Mr. Carter, I&#39;ve booked a restaurant to welcome you and Victoria. Would that be convenient for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alvin glanced at Victoria, seeing no objection in her eyes, and agreed. &#34;That sounds good. Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the drive, Samuel drove smoothly while Victoria sat in the passenger seat, gazing out the window, her thoughts wandering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She occasionally stole glances at Samuel and then at Alvin, her emotions a mix of confusion and unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the restaurant, Samuel had arranged a private room with an elegant and quiet ambiance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alvin looked around, clearly pleased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three of them sat down, and the waiter poured water and served appetizers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel handed the menu to Alvin. &#34;Mr. Carter, please choose something you like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alvin skimmed through the menu briefly and then handed it back. &#34;You can order. I&#39;m not picky.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel smiled and turned to Victoria. &#34;Victoria, why don&#39;t you pick a few of your favorites?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were full of affection, making Victoria&#39;s cheeks flush slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While waiting for the food, Alvin asked, &#34;Samuel, what do you do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel sat up straight and answered seriously, &#34;Mr. Carter, I&#39;m a professor at the University of Aesthetics Shine. My parents are businesspeople, and their ventures are doing quite well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria found Samuel&#39;s serious demeanor amusing, having never seen him so formal before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, thinking about the reason behind his behavior and her complicated history with William, her heart sank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering her eyes to hide her emotions, she felt guilt and a bit distressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing this, Samuel gently took her hand under the table and asked softly, &#34;What&#39;s wrong? Are you tired?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria, holding his hand, kept her head down, avoiding his gaze. &#34;Yeah, a bit tired, but I&#39;m fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Samuel immediately asked the waiter to hurry with the food and then comforted her. &#34;Hang in there. Have a little something to eat, and I&#39;ll take you home to rest soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria nodded slightly, obediently picking up some vegetables and eating slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Samuel&#39;s attentive care for Victoria, Alvin felt both relieved and a bit sad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was relieved that Victoria had found a man worthy of her, someone who seemed upright and wouldn&#39;t mistreat her, far better than William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just hoped Victoria could truly move on from William and start anew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the end of the meal, Alvin&#39;s impression of Samuel had improved even more. Despite being several years older than Victoria, Samuel was maturity, thoughtfulness, and attentiveness, which made Alvin believe that this young man might provide Victoria with a stable future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After listening to Daisy, William finally understood that Wayne&#39;s mother wasn&#39;t his grandmother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was Garth&#39;s secretary when he was young.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a party, the secretary drugged Garth, slept with him, and became pregnant with Wayne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She died from severe bleeding during childbirth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s grandmother, being kind-hearted, took in the innocent child and raised Wayne as her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because it involved the elders&#39; privacy, William had never known.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Daisy only found out from her mother before she passed away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did my parents know?&#34; William asked, frowning, his eyes deep and unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your parents probably didn&#39;t know. Your grandmother fell ill and passed away after they died,&#34; Daisy replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William pressed his lips together, silent for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t imagine that his grandmother and Garth, who had been in love for most of their lives, had such a betrayal and a secret child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy, seeing his conflicted expression, cautiously asked, &#34;William, why do you suspect Wayne?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William narrowed his eyes, his face cold and stern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll find out,&#34; he said indifferently, his deep eyes flashing with a chilling light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you going to do?&#34; Daisy pressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s expression hardened. &#34;I have my ways.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;William,&#34; Daisy hesitated, then sighed and shook her head. &#34;Wayne isn&#39;t easy to deal with. Be careful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as William was about to respond, his phone rang with a special ringtone. It was a message from Victoria-she had landed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, the bodyguard protecting her sent photos of Victoria and Samuel embracing at the airport.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze darkened instantly, his grip on the phone tightening, his knuckles turning white.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next moment, he threw the phone onto the table beside the hospital bed, standing up abruptly and growling in frustration, &#34;I&#39;m going back.&#34;</p>
