                <p>&#34;Victoria!&#34; Nora&#39;s voice rang out, filled with fury. &#34;Didn&#39;t you hear me talking to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria stopped in her tracks, her back still to Nora. &#34;I won&#39;t give you the money,&#34; she said calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You brat! How dare you defy me now?&#34; Nora leapt from the bed, grabbing Victoria&#39;s arm and delivering a stinging slap across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria endured the blow, her lips pressed tightly together, eyes full of defiance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, she spoke hoarsely, &#34;Mom, I&#39;m just a college dropout. I&#39;ve done everything I can to pay your medical bills. Ever since Dad&#39;s accident, you&#39;ve been in the hospital. I&#39;ve given up all my pride and taken those dead-end jobs just to cover your medical bills. We lost our house, and I&#39;ve slept under bridges and in basements. But did you ever care about me even once? In your heart, is it only Bobby who&#39;s your child, while I&#39;m just a stepping stone for him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nora was momentarily speechless, then reluctantly let go of Victoria. &#34;Why do you have to be so dramatic? I know you have money. Give Bobby the two hundred grand. If his education is delayed, you&#39;ll regret it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria felt a sharp pang in her heart, her mind flooded with a wave of sorrow. She clenched her lower lip tightly, biting down so hard that the taste of blood filled her mouth. She closed her eyes, struggling to suppress the churning emotions, and it took several deep breaths to push back the lump in her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, you knew all along,&#34; Victoria slowly opened her eyes, looking at Nora&#39;s startled face. &#34;You know where my money comes from...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was money earned at the cost of her dignity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes were brimming with pain and disbelief, but she couldn&#39;t get the rest of the words past the lump in her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria swallowed hard, her mouth filled with bitterness. &#34;If you know this, how can you expect me to pay for Bobby&#39;s training?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nora avoided Victoria&#39;s sharp gaze, her voice stubborn. &#34;What&#39;s the difference between selling your body once and selling it multiple times? Why are you pretending to be so pure now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria let out a bitter laugh. Was this something a mother should say to her daughter? Unable to stay in that suffocating room any longer, she pushed past Nora and stumbled out of the hospital room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Victoria&#39;s retreating back, Nora felt a surge of anger. She kicked the leg of the table hard, shouting, &#34;Victoria, you ungrateful wretch! Come back here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day, after finishing her shift at Scott Group, Victoria rushed to her part-time job at a clothing store. She worked until nearly ten o&#39;clock when the store owner called her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victoria,&#34; the owner said, sounding urgent. &#34;I need you to get these dresses to room 404 at the Starry Nights Hotel, right away. The customer&#39;s waiting, so don&#39;t mess around. If we nail this sale, I&#39;ll double your commission.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The store often had custom orders that needed delivery. Victoria picked up the dresses and hurried to the hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She easily found the room and knocked on the door. A woman in a business suit opened the door, smiling warmly. &#34;You&#39;re here with the dresses, right? Come in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; Victoria said, stepping inside with the bags.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she entered, a pungent mix of smoke and alcohol hit her like a wall. She sensed something was wrong and turned to leave, but the door clicked shut behind her. The woman had locked it from the outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the spacious bedroom, four lecherous men were seated, their eyes glinting with a repulsive, predatory lust as they roamed over her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s heart raced with fear. She instinctively took a step back, and the bags in her hand nearly slipped from her grasp. She clutched the bags tightly, glaring at them. &#34;Who are you?&#34; she stammered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the men stubbed out his cigarette, his gaze lingering on her. He licked his lips. &#34;What a beauty. Today is my lucky day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, he actually reached out to touch Victoria&#39;s face. His fingers, rough and greasy, were inches from her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria took a big step back and snapped, &#34;Let me leave. Now. Or I&#39;ll call the police!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Feisty, aren&#39;t you?&#34; the man chuckled, clicking his tongue in approval. &#34;What&#39;s your name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her fear, Victoria tried to remain calm. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, but I don&#39;t provide that kind of service,&#34; she said, grabbing the bags and heading for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the four men blocked her way. A burly man named Clifford warned, &#34;Don&#39;t make me use force.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The men closed in, cutting off her escape. Victoria&#39;s hands trembled as she discreetly reached into her pocket, pressing a random button, praying for a miracle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed her prayers were answered as she heard a man&#39;s voice on the other end of the line. Without waiting for him to speak, she quickly said, &#34;I&#39;m in room 404 at the Starry Nights Hotel. Please help...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could finish, one of the men snatched her phone and smashed it to pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34; Victoria screamed, her voice shaking with terror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think?&#34; Clifford sneered, advancing on her. &#34;I&#39;ve been waiting for you. Be a good girl and cooperate.&#34; Then he lunged at Victoria, eager and impatient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria tried to evade him, but it was useless. She struggled with all her might. Her fingernails dug into Clifford&#39;s forearm, leaving deep, bloody scratches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clifford winced in pain, but his anger only intensified. He pinned her to the ground, tearing at her thin blouse, leaving red marks on her skin with his rough hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Help!&#34; Victoria cried, her vision blurred by tears. She struggled, but Clifford was too strong. He held her down, a sick smile on his face as he unbuckled his belt. &#34;You&#39;ll enjoy this soon enough!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Clifford&#39;s hand reached for her, Victoria bit down hard on his arm. He screamed in pain, raising his hand to strike her. In desperation, Victoria grabbed his wrist and yanked, causing him to lose his balance and fall onto the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seizing the opportunity, Victoria crawled towards the balcony. &#34;If you come any closer, I&#39;ll jump!&#34; she shouted, her voice filled with desperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The men hesitated, not wanting to cause a scene. Clifford, clutching his bitten arm, cursed, &#34;Bitch, I&#39;ll kill you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t jump. I&#39;ll open the door and let you go, okay?&#34; a skinny man with a scar on his eyebrow, Dean, approached and slightly opened the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria glanced at the ground below, then at the slightly open door. Her heart raced, but her will to survive prevailed. &#34;You all go to the bathroom. I&#39;ll leave on my own!&#34; she demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clifford and the others exchanged glances, reluctantly heading to the bathroom. Victoria took a deep breath, feeling a glimmer of hope. She quickly ran towards the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was about to open it, the door slammed shut and locked from the outside. Victoria&#39;s heart sank. She pounded on the door, screaming, &#34;Why did you lock the door? Open it! Help!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman who had let her in was still guarding outside. Victoria collapsed to the floor in despair, staring at the closed door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind her, the four men emerged from the bathroom, evil smiles on their faces, slowly advancing towards her.</p>
