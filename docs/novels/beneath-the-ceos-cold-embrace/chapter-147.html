                <p>&#34;It doesn&#39;t matter. Victoria doesn&#39;t need it. Your family are too complicated. I&#39;ve been through enough, and I can&#39;t let Victoria be in danger again.&#34;</p>

                <p>When he got home, Victoria was sitting on the living room couch, hugging her knees and staring off into space. Hearing the door open, she turned her head towards the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing it was him, her previously dull expression instantly brightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad!&#34; she exclaimed, rushing over to hug Alvin&#39;s arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alvin affectionately ruffled her hair. &#34;What do you want to eat? I&#39;ll make it for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want your fried fish and fried chicken.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, I&#39;ll go get the groceries now,&#34; Alvin agreed with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though he used to be very busy with work, whenever he had free time, he would dive into the kitchen to cook for the family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alvin and Victoria chatted and laughed as they wandered through the supermarket, picking out the freshest ingredients.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back home, Victoria eagerly helped wash and chop the vegetables.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing how skilled she had become, Alvin realized that his once-cherished daughter must have endured a lot over the past two years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought made his heart ache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached out and gently touched Victoria&#39;s forehead, speaking softly, &#34;I promise, I won&#39;t let anyone hurt you again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s nose tingled, and she choked up, &#34;It&#39;s okay, Dad. I&#39;ve grown up. I can take care of myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alvin patted her shoulder lovingly. &#34;Silly girl, you&#39;ll always be my little girl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria sniffled and lowered her head to continue washing the vegetables.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only in front of Alvin could she be the carefree little princess she once was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time dinner was ready, it was dusk. The setting sun cast a golden glow inside the house, warm and peaceful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alvin and Victoria chatted as they ate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria excitedly shared stories about her job at Starry Studio Gallery and her upcoming entrance exam for the University of Aesthetics Shine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alvin listened quietly, occasionally chiming in, his eyes full of love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But soon, Alvin&#39;s expression turned serious as he remembered something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t want to spoil the moment with harsh words, but he had to remind her, &#34;Victoria, you need to stop seeing William.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria paused, looking up at Alvin. &#34;Why bring him up now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alvin frowned slightly, noticing her mood drop, and felt a pang of worry. &#34;Victoria, I&#39;m not trying to ruin your mood, but William&#39;s family is too complicated. We can&#39;t afford to get involved with them, do you understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s face fell, and she lowered her head, speaking softly, &#34;Dad, you don&#39;t need to worry. William is getting married soon. There&#39;s nothing between us. Besides, I have a boyfriend now. His name is Samuel. I&#39;ll bring him to meet you someday.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alvin sighed and patted her shoulder. &#34;Alright, I trust you. When you have time, bring him over so I can meet him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria nodded and started clearing the table. As she turned away from Alvin, a tear fell silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alvin had started his own business again. He was once the most renowned architect in Crystalia, but after two years in prison, his old connections were gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He needed to readjust to society after being away for over two years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he had built his career from scratch before and had real talent. He believed that with time, he could succeed again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his busy schedule, Alvin still made sure to cook three meals a day for Victoria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria felt sorry for Alvin but couldn&#39;t stop him. She knew that if he didn&#39;t get out there and try, he would be even more miserable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was very considerate and never disturbed Alvin unnecessarily. She returned to Starry Studio Gallery and quickly got back into the swing of things. She diligently organized artwork, greeted clients, and tried to keep her life busy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever she had time, she visited Samuel in the hospital. Samuel was happy for Victoria when he heard Alvin had been released on bail. Victoria occasionally talked to him about Alvin. Samuel always listened patiently and offered advice and encouragement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your dad&#39;s amazing. With his determination and courage, he&#39;ll definitely succeed. If he doesn&#39;t mind, I can introduce him to some resources.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel was a respected figure in the art world, and his connections could greatly help Alvin. Although Victoria was tempted, she shook her head and declined his offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks, but I think my dad would prefer to achieve his goals on his own. I believe in him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, Victoria didn&#39;t want to trouble Samuel too much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel was momentarily surprised but then smiled. &#34;Too bad, I won&#39;t get a chance to impress my future father-in-law.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria blushed and glared at him. &#34;Stop talking nonsense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, alright, my bad,&#34; Samuel surrendered with a smile. &#34;I&#39;ll be discharged in a few days. You should introduce me to your dad then, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria paused while cutting an apple for him. She hesitated for a moment but finally nodded. &#34;Okay, once my dad is less busy, I&#39;ll bring you home to meet him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel beamed. &#34;Great, I&#39;ll be waiting for your call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving the hospital, Victoria went back to her old apartment. She still had some things to pack up. Today, she had some free time to go and get them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she unlocked the familiar door, a strong smell of alcohol hit her. The room was dim, with the curtains tightly closed. Only a few slivers of light seeped through the gaps, casting shadows on the messy room. Empty bottles were scattered all over the floor, and there were many unopened ones too. The ashtray was overflowing with cigarette butts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William was passed out drunk on the cold tile floor, muttering &#34;Victoria&#34; in his sleep. His eyes were half-closed, his long lashes casting shadows on his cheeks. His flushed face made his handsome features even more striking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria stood at the door, staring for a long time, her heart aching. She slowly walked over, knelt down, and with trembling fingers, gently touched William&#39;s face. Her fingertips brushed his lips, feeling the warmth and moisture. She lightly touched his throat but quickly pulled back, as if scared, her breathing quickening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They hadn&#39;t seen each other for over two weeks since their last meeting on the hospital rooftop. But she knew he had been silently protecting her all along. Including Alvin&#39;s release on bail, which must have cost William a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s eyes reddened. She didn&#39;t want to hurt him. But she had no other choice but to push him away. There were too many obstacles between them, too deep to overcome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes suddenly stung, as if pricked by needles. She blinked rapidly to push back the tears. Then she bent down, trying to lift William onto the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was still early spring, and the floor was cold. Lying there all night would make him sick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as soon as she exerted force, William rolled over and pinned her down!</p>
