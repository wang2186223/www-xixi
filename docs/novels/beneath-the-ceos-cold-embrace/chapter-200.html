                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Samuel&#39;s eyes were firm, &#34;I need to give you a proper commitment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Samuel, I trust you. You don&#39;t have to go through all this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel looked out the window, lost in thought for a moment. Then he turned back to her, speaking earnestly, &#34;Victoria, we&#39;ve been through a lot to get here. I know you trust me, but some things need more than just feelings. I need to show you my commitment, to let everyone know you&#39;re the most important person to me. So, I have to do that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes, usually bright and gentle, were now serious and determined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was taken aback for a moment before she finally nodded. It felt like saying &#34;no&#34; would pull him into an abyss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You knew I met with someone else, and you didn&#39;t even ask about it! Victoria, do you really care about me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course I do...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then come meet my parents!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria bit her lip and nodded slightly, &#34;I understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew deep down whether Samuel&#39;s feelings had changed. Since she decided to be with him, she was willing to respect his decisions and stand by his side. That was her role as his girlfriend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bringing Victoria to meet his parents was a big deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Primrose was kind, at least on the surface, always polite to Victoria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Elmer wasn&#39;t one for pretense. Maybe because of work stress, he looked even more grim and tired, his face showing clear displeasure and annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After welcoming Victoria into the living room, Primrose smiled and said, &#34;Samuel, come help me in the kitchen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel frowned, &#34;I&#39;d rather stay here with Victoria for a bit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can chat later. Come help me first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel was about to refuse, but Victoria gently tugged at his sleeve, &#34;Go ahead, I&#39;ll be fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel frowned slightly, a hint of reluctance in his eyes. He knew it wasn&#39;t ideal to leave Victoria alone with Elmer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But seeing the hopeful look in Primrose&#39;s eyes, he thought maybe this was a chance to ease the tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief moment of thought, he gently patted Victoria&#39;s shoulder, &#34;Victoria, I&#39;ll be right back. If you feel uncomfortable, just let me know, and I&#39;ll take you home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria smiled softly, &#34;Go on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elmer heard everything and snorted heavily, &#34;Your mom is waiting for you. Stop dawdling and get in there!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel frowned slightly, taking a deep breath to calm himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped forward, standing in front of Victoria, and said calmly, &#34;Dad, I understand your concerns, but Victoria is the one I&#39;ve chosen. My feelings for her are not a passing whim.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood tall, his gaze unwavering as he looked Elmer in the eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elmer&#39;s face showed a flash of anger, but he held it back, saying in a low voice, &#34;Fine, I understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel frowned again before slowly walking into the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria looked up at Elmer, the awkward silence between them almost suffocating her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Carter, I don&#39;t mean to target you, but you and Samuel are not suitable for each other.&#34; Elmer&#39;s sharp gaze fell directly on her, &#34;Your past with William can be seen as youthful indiscretion. But our family is traditional; we won&#39;t accept a daughter-in-law with unclear relationships with another man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was low and cold, offering no quarter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she had anticipated this, hearing the blunt &#34;you&#39;re not suitable&#34; still felt like a punch to the gut for Victoria, leaving her heart aching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know Samuel likes you a lot. No matter how we try to dissuade him, he&#39;s determined to be with you. So, Ms. Carter, I hope you can understand our concerns as parents. We hope you will leave him voluntarily. You don&#39;t have to break up immediately; give him some time to accept it. After a while, you can say your feelings have faded or that you&#39;ve found someone else. That way, it will be easier for him to move on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria stared at him, stunned. Elmer&#39;s words showed no regard for her feelings or dignity, as if everything he said was perfectly justified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She understood that parents favored their own children, but did that mean she deserved to be treated so poorly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Carter, I know this request is excessive, but we&#39;ve made our stance clear before. If you insist on staying, you must bear the consequences. Frankly, we prefer Hannah. In terms of family background, ability, and manners, she is far more suitable for Samuel than you. A relationship without parental blessing is unlikely to end well. No matter how many promises Samuel makes now, who can guarantee he won&#39;t change in a few years? When that time comes, will he return to his family or stay with you, the one who caused the rift? Ms. Carter, you&#39;re a smart person. I&#39;m sure you understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria sat in the Brown family&#39;s living room, feeling utterly devalued, unable to utter a single word in rebuttal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elmer&#39;s words were harsh but realistic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want Samuel to be estranged from his family because of her. Even if it came to that, could she give him the same deep love in return?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could she?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Carter, I won&#39;t let you sacrifice in vain. I know your father&#39;s company is just starting to grow. I&#39;ll do my best to help his business, improving your lives significantly. Of course, you don&#39;t have to answer right away. Take your time to consider.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for her response, Elmer checked his watch, &#34;Today, Hannah and her parents are also coming over. If you want to stay for lunch, that&#39;s fine, but it might be awkward to introduce you. We don&#39;t mind; as long as you don&#39;t, it&#39;s fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Elmer had been deliberately difficult or verbally abusive, Victoria could have mustered the courage to fight back. But his cold, business-like demeanor, discussing pros and cons without considering her feelings, left her feeling insignificant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she still insisted on staying, it would only prove to the Wright family how desirable Samuel was and made her look like she was trying to climb a ladder she couldn&#39;t reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria felt the stark reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been too naive, thinking a boyfriend who made her feel comfortable and compatible was enough. Samuel&#39;s kindness had indeed moved her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Elmer&#39;s blunt reality check deflated her courage and made her want to retreat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t bear to make Samuel turn against his parents for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moreover, to win his parents&#39; favor, she would have to humble herself, which went against her nature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After talking with Elmer, she wanted to back out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elmer, having said his piece, got up and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, Samuel hurried out of the kitchen, looking anxious, worried that Elmer had been harsh with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly walked to her side, bending down to ask gently, &#34;What did my dad say to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing much, just some small talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria paused for a moment, then said softly, &#34;I suddenly don&#39;t feel like staying for the meal.&#34;</p>
