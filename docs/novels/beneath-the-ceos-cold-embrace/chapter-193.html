                <p>Victoria&#39;s eyes widened, and her heart clenched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because of this mess, he got banned from leaving the country, all his bank accounts were frozen, and he almost got kicked out of school. If his parents hadn&#39;t stepped in and if he wasn&#39;t innocent, who knows what would&#39;ve happened,&#34; Ryan said, taking a deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;His parents only asked him to agree to go on a date with the person they set him up with, or else they&#39;d bring the matter to your attention,&#34; he added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria stood there, stunned, unable to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her reaction, Ryan tried to comfort her. &#34;Even if I didn&#39;t tell you, you probably could&#39;ve guessed who was behind this. Samuel didn&#39;t want me to tell you, so just act like you don&#39;t know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I get it. Thanks, Ryan,&#34; Victoria said, forcing a bitter smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She understood Ryan&#39;s intentions, but the more she did, the more guilt and self-blame she felt towards Samuel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan looked at her, hesitating to say more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the workday was winding down, the light in the gallery softened. Victoria and Wendy were still busy wrapping things up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Diana walked in, dressed simply yet elegantly, her face beautiful and features delicate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the two still working, she smiled lightly. &#34;All done? Dinner&#39;s on me tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joshua&#39;s artwork had been a hit with buyers, earning the gallery a good profit. Diana was in a great mood and wanted to treat Victoria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This restaurant&#39;s food is amazing!&#34; Diana said with a slight smile. &#34;I often come here for business meetings and to entertain artist friends. The reputation is impeccable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendy, curious, her eyes sparkling, said, &#34;You run this gallery so effortlessly, with such a wide network and always discovering great food.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Diana glanced at her, a faint smile on her lips. &#34;Running a business is all about creating the right atmosphere and building relationships. For the gallery to thrive, you need to maintain good relations with everyone. Over time, business becomes easier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three of them sat down and were about to order when a group of people walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William and Alice were at the back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he entered, William&#39;s eyes immediately scanned the room and landed on Victoria, who was sitting in a corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice noticed too and asked considerately, &#34;Do you want to go say hi?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her demeanor was gracious and understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need,&#34; William replied, looking away as if he hadn&#39;t seen her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene, who had come along, sat next to William and quietly probed, &#34;Having a fight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was, of course, referring to William and Victoria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William took a sip of his tea, not responding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s odd. When you guys came back from Xandria, it seemed like there was hope for you two. Guess I was wrong,&#34; Eugene said, half-joking, with a hint of schadenfreude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he had to choose between Victoria and Alice, he would lean towards Alice. They had grown up together, and the bond was deep. Victoria seemed like an unexpected intruder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Plus, with all the complicated issues involving Alvin and the Scott family, the road ahead for those two was bound to be bumpy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene glanced at Alice, who was chatting and laughing with the investors, and said, &#34;Compared to Victoria, I think Alice suits you better. Look at her, despite everything, she still cares for you and helps you out. She used her connections to help you with X-STAR Solutions Inc. Without her, your new project wouldn&#39;t have progressed so smoothly. She supports you in both life and career. She&#39;s your best partner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at Victoria and shook his head. &#34;She can&#39;t compare to Alice. Besides, I heard she has a boyfriend now. Don&#39;t dwell on it too much. Appreciate the one in front of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If William didn&#39;t know Eugene&#39;s playful nature, he might have thought he was bribed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long silence, William spoke slowly, &#34;Maybe without her, I would marry Alice, but it would never be the same.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene understood the depth of his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marrying out of gratitude and marrying out of love are two different things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He might marry Alice, but the feelings of love and attachment had never been there for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There could be responsibility and care, but that wasn&#39;t love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the room, Wendy noticed William too and was surprised to see him here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly looked at Victoria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop staring and eat,&#34; Victoria said quietly, continuing to enjoy her meal as if William was just a stranger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eugene and the others were having a lively conversation. Alice, no longer the aloof and noble figure she once was, was enthusiastically toasting the investors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though it wasn&#39;t a formal business meeting, just a private dinner, she was doing everything to support William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Jerald McClellan, the head of the investors, suggested a drink with William, Alice quickly raised her glass, smiling, &#34;Mr. McClellan, I&#39;ll drink on his behalf. You see, he recently got injured in Xandria and should be resting, but he came here to meet you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jerald&#39;s impression of William improved significantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To be honest, I&#39;ve heard a lot about Mr. Scott in Harborview City,&#34; Jerald said, his words carefully chosen, but William knew they were likely negative rumors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been developing in Silvermist City for the past two years, not Harborview City, but the rumors had spread widely. Now, he knew who was behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William sincerely said, &#34;Mr. McClellan, I&#39;m looking forward to working with X-STAR Solutions Inc.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice raised her glass again, smiling, &#34;Mr. McClellan, another toast to you on William&#39;s behalf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Garcia, you are truly devoted to Mr. Scott. It&#39;s admirable! Mr. Scott, you should cherish Ms. Garcia,&#34; Jerald said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William glanced at Alice, her cheeks flushed. She had already had quite a bit to drink at lunch and was now just holding on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jerald loved to drink, and to discuss business with him, one had to drink a lot. Alice knew this and was drinking for William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her determination, even Eugene was moved and wanted to help, but she politely declined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. McClellan and I are enjoying our drinks. Don&#39;t interrupt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jerald laughed heartily, &#34;That&#39;s right, it&#39;s rare to find such a spirited drinking partner!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William frowned, placing his hand over hers as she reached for another glass. &#34;That&#39;s enough. Stop drinking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about it,&#34; she whispered, pouring another glass and toasting Jerald.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In no time, the bottle of red wine was empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Jerald&#39;s secretary hadn&#39;t come to remind him about his flight, they might have continued drinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William and Alice escorted Jerald out, who said cheerfully, &#34;Send the contract over tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Jerald left, Alice lost all her strength, her body leaning softly against William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling him support her, she struggled slightly, her voice slurred, &#34;I&#39;m fine, just a bit dizzy. I&#39;ll be okay after some water. Let go, Ms. Carter is watching. Don&#39;t let her misunderstand. I can walk on my own.&#34;</p>
