                <p>Hearing footsteps, he turned his head slightly and gave Victoria his signature warm smile, though it couldn&#39;t hide the deep exhaustion in his eyes.</p>

                <p>It wasn&#39;t until Elmer fell seriously ill that he realized it wasn&#39;t his own brilliance but Elmer&#39;s support that allowed him to pursue his passions without worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, with Elmer down, it was his turn to support his parents, and he finally understood how hard it had been for them all these years.</p>

                <p>She gazed at him, then suddenly raised her hand and gently hugged him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel closed his eyes tightly, wrapping his arms around her with force, his voice choked with emotion. &#34;Victoria, I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Victoria returned home, Alvin was sitting on the couch, smoking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s Samuel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alvin just sat there quietly, looking at her with a pained expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria walked over slowly, gently took Alvin&#39;s arm, and rested her head on his shoulder. After a long silence, she murmured softly, &#34;Why does it still hurt so much?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alvin&#39;s eyes narrowed sharply, but he just extended his arm and pulled Victoria into a tight embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria nestled in Alvin&#39;s arms, closing her eyes as tears rolled down her cheeks and soaked into her clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alvin&#39;s embrace was warm and broad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But her heart ached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She understood Samuel deeply, and she wasn&#39;t surprised they had reached this point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even without Elmer&#39;s sudden illness, there might have been other reasons forcing them to face separation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Victoria like this, Alvin&#39;s eyes flashed with determination. &#34;Do you want me to go talk to him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like any father who loves his daughter, Alvin was certain that Victoria had been wronged and that the fault lay with someone else!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria looked up, a hint of helplessness in her eyes, and a slightly bitter smile on her lips. &#34;Dad, it&#39;s not his fault. He&#39;s always tried so hard to be close to me. If anything, I owe him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile gradually faded, replaced by a look of loneliness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe people were like this: they only realized the value of something after it had gone, and then started to miss it deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this moment, memories of Samuel&#39;s kindness flooded her mind-their every interaction, his devoted care, selfless affection, unwavering support, and constant encouragement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shielding her from all harm and gossip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t realized that she had developed a special feeling for him, a feeling different from love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe even she couldn&#39;t be sure if it was romantic love, but it had quietly taken root in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more she thought about it, the stronger her guilt grew. Even though Samuel had been the one to suggest the breakup, she still felt she owed him too much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The news of Samuel and Hannah&#39;s engagement came on three days later, with the ceremony set for the weekend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It came suddenly, yet it made sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Wendy, who had been absent for a while, couldn&#39;t help but call Victoria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My uncle got an invitation from the Wright family. That&#39;s how I found out Samuel and Hannah are getting engaged.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I know.&#34; Victoria&#39;s tone was particularly calm. &#34;If you&#39;re free that day, you should go and have some fun. Don&#39;t stay cooped up at home all the time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victoria, are you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What could be wrong? We talked it out and broke up amicably. Besides, we didn&#39;t have much going on anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was in the library, studying for exams that were just a week away. She had been focusing most of her energy on her studies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard about Samuel&#39;s family situation too. He must be really upset. But he has no choice because of his father.&#34; Wendy instinctively defended Samuel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always supported Victoria and Samuel being together, but fate had other plans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victoria, can I ask you something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure, what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If Samuel came back to you, would you take him back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendy wasn&#39;t just asking casually. She believed that Samuel was so devoted to Victoria that he wouldn&#39;t give up easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria lowered her gaze slightly, looking out at the bustling street outside the window. She spoke softly, &#34;He won&#39;t, and neither will I.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendy could only sigh and say no more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Hannah walked in, she saw Victoria calmly gazing out the window, looking as beautiful as a delicate painting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood at the door for a moment before walking over and sitting down in front of Victoria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria looked up, surprised to see Hannah. After a pause, she said calmly, &#34;Ms. Wright, what can I do for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah got straight to the point. &#34;Ms. Carter, I hope you can make time this weekend to attend my and Samuel&#39;s engagement party.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she elegantly took an invitation from her bag and gently slid it across the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria looked at Hannah, feeling a bit strange. &#34;Ms. Wright, why are you inviting me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah smiled slightly, her tone generous. &#34;I know you and Samuel were once a couple, and I understand why he agreed to marry me. But that&#39;s all in the past. What&#39;s important is the future, and that&#39;s us being together. So, I hope you can attend our engagement party, to witness it and to formally say goodbye to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria understood her meaning and nodded. &#34;Ms. Wright, don&#39;t worry. Since we&#39;ve broken up, I won&#39;t interfere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then you should come and give your blessings in person!&#34; Hannah said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it weren&#39;t for Hannah&#39;s sincere expression, her words would have sounded like a deliberate provocation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria found the request a bit unreasonable. She had agreed to part ways amicably, so why insist she attend?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Victoria&#39;s displeasure, Hannah was silent for a moment before speaking slowly. &#34;Ms. Carter, can you understand how I feel? I just want to fully have him, without him lingering in the past. I know he liked you a lot, so can you help me make sure he lets go completely?&#34;</p>
