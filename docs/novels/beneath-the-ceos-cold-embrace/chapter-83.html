                <p>Before William could respond, Victoria quickly interjected, &#34;Mr. Scott is so busy, unlike us who are just idlers, it might not be convenient...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was just making up a lie, but Alice, in a bizarre move, insisted on joining her with William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could she be plotting something to harm her again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who said it&#39;s not convenient?&#34; Before Victoria could finish, William suddenly interrupted coldly, &#34;I have nothing to do this weekend, I can go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s eyes widened as she looked at William, a storm brewing in her heart. She opened her mouth, wanting to stop him. But just as she was about to speak, Alice beat her to it, &#34;Great, William, I&#39;m so happy you can come with me! Ms. Carter, you must introduce your boyfriend to us then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was stunned for a moment, and finally could only nod helplessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice smiled with satisfaction, looking very pleased, while William remained silent, looking increasingly gloomy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back home, Victoria received a call from Daisy, confirming that she had been sent home by William, which made her breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy told Victoria that there were some matters in Harborview City that needed her attention, and asked Victoria to take care of herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria agreed to everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hanging up the phone, Victoria lay on the bed, staring blankly at the ceiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last night&#39;s experience was as absurd as a nightmare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was really scared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice&#39;s methods were even more ruthless and vicious than Ella&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To frame her, she even went so far as to poison herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking about it, Victoria couldn&#39;t help but feel a chill in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could she make Alice give up her malice towards her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria thought of the skiing date she had made up and decided to go through with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took out her phone and called Samuel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone rang for a few seconds before it was answered, and Samuel&#39;s clear voice came through, &#34;Victoria.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria called out somewhat uneasily, &#34;Samuel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel heard the unusual tone in Victoria&#39;s voice and asked with concern, &#34;What&#39;s wrong? Did something happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria hesitated whether to tell him about last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But thinking carefully, she didn&#39;t want him to know about her feud with Alice, in case Samuel got involved, she would feel guilty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she decided not to tell him about it, and just asked nervously, &#34;Samuel, do you have time next weekend? My friend invited me to go skiing, do you want to come with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel immediately agreed cheerfully, &#34;Of course, Victoria, I&#39;m at your service.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing Samuel&#39;s response, Victoria finally felt half relieved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She exhaled a breath and said, &#34;Okay, see you next weekend then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the appointed time came, Samuel drove to pick up Victoria and arrived at the foot of the snow mountain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William and Alice were already there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William was wearing a pure black ski suit, with a hat and sunglasses, standing there straight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice was wearing a bright yellow down jacket today, with a brown knitted hat, a somewhat youthful outfit that looked particularly playful on her, especially highlighting her delicate skin and features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William was gently adjusting her clothes, his eyes full of affection, as if honey was about to overflow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing this, Victoria suddenly felt a bit dazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel parked the car and put the rabbit fur hat that Victoria had left in the car on her, and Victoria smiled embarrassedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing their intimate interaction, Alice&#39;s mouth curved into a smile, and she glanced at William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His handsome face showed no emotion, as if he hadn&#39;t noticed the interaction between Victoria and Samuel at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mocking smile flashed in Alice&#39;s eyes, but it quickly disappeared, and she returned to her usual self.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked up to William, took his arm, and said with a smile, &#34;William, let&#39;s go quickly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saying this, she pulled him to Victoria and Samuel, nodded slightly to Victoria, then turned to the mature and handsome Samuel, and said with a smile, &#34;Mr. Brown, right? We met once at Aroma Garden Eatery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel nodded politely to her and said with a smile, &#34;Yes, Ms. Garcia, hello.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William frowned at Samuel, a look of disgust flashing in his eyes, he put his arm around Alice&#39;s waist, nodded to Samuel, and said in a low voice, &#34;Let&#39;s go, it&#39;s time to go up the mountain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he walked towards the ski field first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing this, Alice&#39;s smile deepened, she glanced at Victoria, then shyly leaned into William&#39;s arms, &#34;William, slow down, be careful not to slip.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching their backs, Victoria also smiled sweetly at Samuel, &#34;Let&#39;s go too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ski field was located on Snowflake Peak in the western suburbs of Silvermist City, covering a large area, with not only large camping tents, ski slopes, and other facilities, but also many amusement devices around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group took the cable car up, moving slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice stayed close to William, occasionally chatting with him, looking very intimate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria pretended not to see, looking out at the snow through the window, occasionally chatting with Samuel and Alice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After about half an hour, the cable car slowly descended, stopping at the top of the ski field.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria opened the door and got off the cable car, immediately feeling a biting cold wind hit her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel stepped forward, took out a mask and goggles from his coat pocket, and handed them to Victoria, &#34;Victoria, put these on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria took the mask and goggles, gave Samuel a light smile, and then turned to put them on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing this, Alice smiled and said, &#34;Mr. Brown is really considerate and thoughtful, Ms. Carter is so lucky to have such a boyfriend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria looked at Samuel somewhat awkwardly, not denying it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel was open and honest, smiling, &#34;Ms. Garcia, you&#39;re too kind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William said impatiently, &#34;Are you done with the compliments? Are we skiing or not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice pouted, &#34;Alright, alright, you&#39;re the most impatient.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she took the initiative to hold his hand and went to the service desk to get their specially ordered ski equipment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The four of them got dressed, carrying their skis to the ski field.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice said as she walked, &#34;Ms. Carter, do you know how to ski?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had made up the skiing plan on the spot, she had seen an advertisement for the ski field while sitting in the car, so she came up with the idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay, Victoria, I&#39;ll teach you.&#34; Samuel chimed in at the right time, &#34;I used to be on the school ski team.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William snorted, giving Samuel a sidelong glance, and said in a hostile tone, &#34;Mr. Brown, you seem to be good at everything. How about a competition later?&#34;</p>
