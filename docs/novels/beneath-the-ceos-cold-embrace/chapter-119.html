                <p>Victoria was over the moon when she heard that William had agreed. She immediately threw herself into his arms, wrapping her arms around his neck and exclaiming excitedly, &#34;This is incredible! I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d help me! William, thank you, thank you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William gently patted her back and said calmly, &#34;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll have someone look into Lachlan&#39;s background.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria nodded eagerly, &#34;Okay!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood on her tiptoes and planted a kiss on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William was stunned for a second, then quickly took control, deepening the kiss until she was breathless and he reluctantly let her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s cheeks were flushed, and she lowered her head shyly, afraid to look at him, worried he might see through her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William gently stroked her soft, long hair, his voice seductive, &#34;I haven&#39;t had enough today. Are you sure you want to run away?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he pounced again, pressing Victoria onto the couch, his large hand covering her breast, gently kneading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ticklish,&#34; Victoria squirmed, trying to escape, but her efforts were futile against his strength. A soft moan escaped her lips, making the air around them sizzle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be good, I just want to kiss you,&#34; William murmured, lightly pecking her luscious red lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;William!&#34; Victoria&#39;s voice changed pitch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked down to see William&#39;s soft brown hair brushing against her chest. He first sucked hard, then gently licked, teasing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her nipples, wet with saliva, felt cold in the air, and the rough texture of William&#39;s tongue sent shivers down her spine, causing her to release a flood of arousal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William finally turned his attention back to Victoria, who now clearly sensed the &#39;trouble&#39; signal. She tried to roll away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William accurately grabbed her ankle, pulling her back into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s arousal left a clear mark on the leather couch as William dragged her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;William!&#34; Victoria screamed, feeling his fully erect member pressing against her through his suit, soaking the fabric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry,&#34; William whispered, kissing her neck gently, &#34;I lied. I don&#39;t just want to kiss you, I want...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William impatiently pulled down his pants, his hard member springing free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The head of his penis, wet and eager, rubbed against Victoria&#39;s entrance, teasing but not entering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was so aroused by his actions that she felt like she was about to climax even without him inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why aren&#39;t you struggling? Weren&#39;t you trying to run just now?&#34; William teased, kissing her cheek. As soon as she relaxed a bit, he suddenly thrust into her, his skill preventing any pain from registering in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cry of pain was replaced by pleasure, and William, seemingly annoyed by her earlier attempt to escape, moved with deliberate intensity, his member hitting her sensitive spots, making her unable to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just a few thrusts had Victoria&#39;s toes curling in pleasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Slower, please,&#34; Victoria gasped, her face flushed. She clung to William&#39;s neck, seeking support against his powerful movements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s arm muscles bulged with effort as he held her waist with one hand, the other kneading her breast. The pleasure shot through her nerves, and William bit her earlobe, &#34;Say my name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;When does he get so good at this?&#39; Victoria briefly wondered before she was overwhelmed by pleasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William lifted her from the couch, still joined, and carried her to the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With each step, his member rubbed inside her, driving her to tears. By the time he laid her on the bed, Victoria was ready to beg for mercy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William knelt on the bed, still inside her, and began undressing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He unbuttoned his shirt with one hand, then tossed it aside, leaning over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s breasts were roughly handled, and she had no time to think of anything else. She only felt his member pushing deeper, expanding inside her, while William&#39;s strong arms caged her in, his unique scent enveloping her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William was overwhelmed by the tight, slick feel of her, wanting to stay inside her forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Say my name,&#34; he demanded, his voice low and husky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria, having lost all dignity, immediately complied, &#34;William, please, slower.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was pinned to the bed by his powerful thrusts, his member repeatedly hitting her sensitive spots, the mix of pain and pleasure overwhelming her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William, too, was struggling to hold back, his breathing heavy as he tried to stave off his climax. He pulled out slightly, then thrust back in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria arched her back, sobbing uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clung to William&#39;s neck, biting down hard. William pulled out, almost clumsily, ejaculating in the air, a thick white line trailing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s chest heaved as he lay on Victoria, eyes closed, savoring the afterglow, muttering a curse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They tangled for a long time before William finally let her go, exhausted on the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William carried her to the shower, then to the bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lying on the soft bed, Victoria watched William&#39;s broad, muscular back, her mind racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slowly crawled closer, her delicate arms wrapping around his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria closed her eyes, pressing her cheek to William&#39;s firm chest, listening to his strong heartbeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In this place far from Alice, she would allow herself to have him for a short while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the month ended, she would draw the line with William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria rested her hand on William&#39;s arm, drifting to sleep, vaguely hearing him say, &#34;Sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fell into a deep, peaceful sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With William&#39;s promise, Victoria no longer worried about finding Lachlan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the exhibition date approached, her work became increasingly hectic, and she barely had time to eat, spinning like a top every day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William attended a family dinner with Lyanna and Wayne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wayne&#39;s eldest son, Dorian Scott, was only a few years younger than William, married and managing a branch in the Kalashea Empire. The younger son, Cassius Scott, had just turned 18 and was in his wild phase, frequenting nightclubs and bars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William had little interaction with Dorian and Cassius, hardly knowing them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyanna, however, often hung out with them in the Kalashea Empire. Now back home alone, her father asked Wayne to find her a reliable internship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wayne entrusted her to William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the dinner, Wayne, as the host, raised his glass first. Smiling at William, he said, &#34;William, I heard from your father that you&#39;re planning a big move in the new media field in Silvermist City. Do you need my support?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William smiled slightly, clinking glasses with Wayne, &#34;No need, Uncle Wayne. I want to build my career on my own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wayne raised an eyebrow, seemingly impressed, &#34;Good, you&#39;re truly the most capable of the Scott family&#39;s younger generation!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to his sons, &#34;Dorian, Cassius, learn from William and strive to stand on your own soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassius pouted, &#34;Dad, you favor William. I&#39;m your real son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wayne pretended to be angry, &#34;So what? My brother only has him left. Who else should I favor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassius immediately quieted down, shrinking back and drinking obediently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dorian held back a laugh at Cassius&#39;s sulking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyanna, sitting nearby, felt embarrassed by Cassius&#39;s behavior and pinched him hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassius yelped, looking at Lyanna with a pained expression, &#34;Lyanna, what did I do to deserve this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyanna glared at him, &#34;Keep talking, and I&#39;ll cut your tongue out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassius quickly covered his mouth, shaking his head to show he wouldn&#39;t speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone laughed, the atmosphere warm and friendly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even William, usually serious, couldn&#39;t hide his smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, his phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a message from Harry: [Mr. Scott, Lachlan is currently in Harborview City, and I discovered that Wayne met with him after returning.]</p>
