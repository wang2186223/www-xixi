                <p>At the hospital</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reporters swarmed the entrance, making it almost impossible to get through. Police officers were doing their best to disperse the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel held Victoria close, placing a hat on her head before they managed to squeeze inside and hurriedly make their way to the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nora had been taken out of danger and moved to a hospital room, but she was still extremely agitated and crying uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alvin sat across from her, head down, silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Victoria arrived, she saw Daisy sitting alone outside the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Scott?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I might have pushed her too far,&#34; Daisy said, looking a bit despondent. &#34;I didn&#39;t want Alvin to have anything to do with her, so I posted a picture of us together. I never thought she&#39;d gamble with her life over it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had asked the doctor, and the amount of sleeping pills Nora had taken was no joke. If they had been a few minutes later, she wouldn&#39;t have made it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nora had really risked her life, forcing Daisy to either back off or face her death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Daisy felt an overwhelming sense of exhaustion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fighting over a man with a woman like this, even if she came out on top, she would still be haunted by the emotional damage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should go in first.&#34; Daisy needed time to sort out her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria wanted to comfort her but didn&#39;t know where to start. She nodded silently and entered the room with Samuel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you want to get rid of me. Now that you&#39;re out of prison and your career is picking up, you must think I&#39;m old and sick, a burden. Daisy is younger and richer than me. I understand why you&#39;d choose her. That&#39;s why I decided to let you go. If I die, you and Victoria will be free. After all, you both hate me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nora cried, covering her face with her hands, sobbing uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing the door open, Alvin looked up at Victoria. Then he glanced at Daisy sitting outside before looking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria walked in and saw Nora crying her heart out. She frowned slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel whispered in her ear, &#34;I&#39;ll wait for you in the parking lot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel greeted Alvin before thoughtfully leaving the room and closing the door quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nora cried even harder when she saw Victoria. &#34;Victoria! Remember, I&#39;m your real mother! How could you side with outsiders against me? You just want to drive me to my death so no one will need your kidney. I didn&#39;t realize how cruel you could be at such a young age!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She struggled to get up, becoming more agitated. &#34;Fine, I&#39;ll die! I&#39;ll make it easy for you all!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alvin quickly stood up and held her down, his voice low and stern. &#34;Our issues have nothing to do with Victoria.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alvin, I can&#39;t live without you. If you leave me, what&#39;s the point of living? If you fall for someone else, it&#39;s like stabbing me with a knife! I&#39;d rather die than see you with another woman. I don&#39;t want to live anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cried and flailed, her nails scratching Alvin&#39;s arms, leaving red marks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria, feeling sorry for Alvin, was about to help when Nora suddenly pushed her away, screaming hysterically, &#34;Get away! You&#39;re not my daughter! I don&#39;t have a daughter who sides with her father&#39;s mistress! Victoria, you&#39;ll get your karma!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Nora was weak from her suicide attempt, she pushed with surprising strength. Victoria stumbled into the corner, her head buzzing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, the door burst open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pair of strong hands quickly helped her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria steadied herself and turned to see William&#39;s deep, cold eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was shocked, never expecting him to be here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His familiar presence inexplicably calmed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alvin also saw him, his expression darkening, especially seeing how close William was to Victoria. He frowned deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s cold gaze swept over Nora.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t even glance at Alvin, his eyes fixed on Nora with a hint of a smirk and a mocking tone. &#34;Nora, let&#39;s talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nora, fearing him, visibly calmed down the moment he entered the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every time she saw William, she instinctively covered her neck, as if it still ached, her chest tightening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She resisted, &#34;I have nothing to talk about with you! Whatever you and Victoria do is your business. I don&#39;t care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Alvin&#39;s face darkened further, and he pulled his hand away from her grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s cheeks flushed slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William, however, chuckled and tossed a lawsuit onto the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You bribed the media to spread rumors about my aunt being a mistress and staged a suicide drama to manipulate public opinion. Nora, it looks like you want to join Bobby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was stunned, looking at Nora in disbelief. &#34;Mom, did you do this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William raised an eyebrow. &#34;Who else could it be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t!&#34; Nora vehemently denied it, glaring at William with gritted teeth. &#34;I know the Scott family has power and influence. It&#39;s easy for you to crush someone like me! But I&#39;m telling you, I didn&#39;t do it! You just want to take revenge on me because of Victoria! If you have issues with her, deal with her, not me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t hesitate to shift the blame onto Victoria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s expression changed, and she slowly looked at Nora.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew Nora was stubborn and foolish, but she didn&#39;t expect her to still try to shift the blame at this point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alvin&#39;s face grew darker, frowning. &#34;Why drag Victoria into this? It has nothing to do with her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think I&#39;m stupid?&#34; Nora glared at Victoria, her eyes red and swollen. &#34;If she hadn&#39;t tipped off Daisy, how would she know we were at the hotel? She just sees Daisy as richer and William&#39;s aunt, so she sold me out to please William.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up!&#34; William snapped. &#34;Who do you think you are, daring to insult her in front of me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria looked at him and softly called, &#34;William.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t speak!&#34; William remained firm, not backing down even in front of Alvin when it came to defending Victoria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria hesitated, then instinctively closed her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she quickly realized it was inappropriate and glanced at Alvin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alvin frowned, staring at William, his voice cold. &#34;She&#39;s my daughter. Who gave you the right to talk to her like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria felt caught in the middle as the two men faced off again.</p>
