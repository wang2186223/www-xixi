                <p>Soon, the doctor and nurses rushed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor approached with a serious expression, carefully removing the bandage from William&#39;s wound to check the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria stood nearby, her eyes fixed on the doctor&#39;s every move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The wound&#39;s opened up a bit, but it&#39;s not too bad. We just need to clean it and rebandage,&#34; the doctor said, easing some of Victoria&#39;s worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nurses quickly prepared the necessary medical tools and supplies, and the doctor began to meticulously clean and stitch up William&#39;s wound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William remained silent, not even flinching, as if he couldn&#39;t feel the pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After finishing, the doctor advised, &#34;He needs to stay calm for the next few days. His body is still recovering, so he must rest and avoid any further injuries.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Victoria, the doctor added, &#34;You&#39;ve been taking good care of him, but make sure he doesn&#39;t have any more issues tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria nodded repeatedly. After the doctor and nurses left, she slowly sat by the bed, her head lowered, avoiding William&#39;s gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victoria,&#34; William called softly, reaching out to hold her hand, but she instinctively pulled away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t move. Just lie down and rest,&#34; Victoria&#39;s voice carried a hint of distance. She knew that all this chaos stemmed from their complicated and entangled feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t let go of her concern for William, yet she couldn&#39;t go against Alvin&#39;s wishes. She felt utterly exhausted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William felt a pang of sadness as she pulled away. He was about to say something when he saw Victoria stand up and walk to the window, turning her back to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victoria, I just don&#39;t want you to leave,&#34; William broke the silence, his voice low and hoarse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s shoulders trembled slightly. She took a deep breath, trying to calm her emotions. &#34;William, don&#39;t say anything more. Just focus on getting better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They fell into a long silence, the quiet room filled only with their breaths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria suddenly felt suffocated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long while, she spoke, &#34;William, you know that no matter how long we stay here, we eventually have to go back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they returned, their problems would once again loom between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unless Alvin wasn&#39;t the one responsible for his parents&#39; deaths, the rift between them would never change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s face darkened at her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They remained in a standoff for a long time. Just as Victoria was about to turn off the lights and go to bed, William&#39;s slightly hoarse voice came from behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I said...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria turned to look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William gazed deeply into her eyes, his lips parting slightly, but he swallowed the words that were on the tip of his tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew that once some things were said, it would be like opening Pandora&#39;s box, impossible to close again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He feared adding more pressure on Victoria and was even more afraid that the unresolved truth would shatter the remaining warmth between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long pause, he finally looked away, staring at the ceiling, his voice barely a whisper, &#34;Nothing, go to sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria sensed something was off, a wave of unease washing over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, though they were in the same room, it felt like an invisible chasm separated them, each lost in their own thoughts, unable to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, Victoria got up early, quickly freshened up, and began packing her things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William pretended to be asleep, secretly watching her busy figure, his heart a mix of emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Victoria zipped up her suitcase, he slowly sat up, his voice raspy, &#34;Are you really leaving?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria paused, not turning around, and replied softly, &#34;Yeah, my dad&#39;s waiting for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William forced a smile, hiding his sorrow, &#34;Have a safe trip.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria bit her lip, dragging her suitcase as she left the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daisy entered the room, William was standing by the window, his silhouette looking thin yet still proud, exuding a sense of aloofness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were cold, watching the figure below gradually disappear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop looking. For Alvin, having Victoria stay here for so many days was already pushing it,&#34; Daisy said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William frowned, turning to her with a hint of displeasure, &#34;What did he do to win you over?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy scoffed, her face full of disdain, &#34;If you weren&#39;t my nephew, I wouldn&#39;t have supported Victoria seeing you. I&#39;m ashamed of what you did to her before!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s face grew darker, gritting his teeth, &#34;I regret saving him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You saved Victoria&#39;s biological father. As long as that blood tie exists, you have no choice!&#34; Daisy&#39;s voice carried a hint of helplessness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William understood her point, his brow furrowed, feeling frustrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, he turned to Daisy, &#34;Aunt Daisy, what do you think of Uncle Wayne?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy raised an eyebrow, surprised by the question. &#34;Why are you asking about him all of a sudden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William didn&#39;t answer, pressing on, &#34;What do you think of Uncle Wayne?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy thought for a moment, then said, &#34;The head of Infinity Unity Group, highly capable, shrewd, and efficient.&#34; She paused, looking at William with a half-smile, &#34;Why are you asking? Are you planning to take over Infinity Unity Group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William hesitated, then said, &#34;Aunt Daisy, I suspect Uncle Wayne is connected to my parents&#39; deaths.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy&#39;s eyes widened in shock, &#34;You suspect Wayne?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William pressed his lips together, not responding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy sighed, &#34;Actually, there are some things I shouldn&#39;t tell you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alvin remained silent throughout the journey, walking a short distance ahead of Victoria as they left the airport.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria felt a sense of helplessness. She knew exactly why Alvin was upset.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alvin rarely got angry with Victoria, especially after his release from prison. He had been trying to make up for lost time, treating her with utmost care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But anything involving William seemed to hit a nerve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, are you still mad at me?&#34; Victoria asked cautiously, her delicate face falling, showing a mix of guilt and a desire to please.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alvin stopped, turning to look at her, his eyes filled with guilt and affection. He interrupted her, &#34;It&#39;s not your fault. It&#39;s all my fault.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, the root of the problem lay with him. How could Victoria be to blame?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, don&#39;t say that. There&#39;s really nothing between us anymore. We&#39;ve completely broken up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice grew softer towards the end. She really didn&#39;t want to discuss this in front of Alvin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good.&#34; Alvin felt a deep sense of guilt and didn&#39;t say more, just sighed quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before leaving the airport, Victoria mustered the courage to send William a message.</p>
