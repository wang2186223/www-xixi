                <p>Amaris&#39; POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a flick of my wrist I twisted the key grabbing the handle and with a soft click, the door creaked open and the bat fell from my hand as soon as I saw who stood at the other side of the door. Oh my God. I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes as I stared at the person standing in front of me. Kian? What was he doing here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My pulse quickened at the sight of him, standing tall and calm as ever despite the late hour. But the thing that surprised me the most was his eyes: focused and intense, like I&#39;d never seen before. My breath caught as I stood there in my night wear, the idea of him looking at me making me self-conscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kian?&#34; I repeated, struggling to compose myself. &#34;What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated for a moment before answering. His eyes lingered just a second too long on my attire before he shifted his gaze to my face clearing his throat. &#34;I...needed to talk with you about the project....&#34; He rubbed the back of his head when I furrowed my brow. &#34;The one with the new client.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I arched an eyebrow. &#34;At this time of the night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know it&#39;s late, but&#34; His voice trailed off, and I saw the wheels in his mind turning for a reason that made sense. &#34;Caleb called and...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what....&#34; I stepped aside cutting him off as I gestured for him to enter. &#34;...come in before someone sees you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated briefly, as if weighing the consequences, then walked in. As I shut the door with a soft click behind him, I got an adrenaline rush from realizing just how alone we were in my quiet apartment. And so my heart did a little dance as I showed him to the living room, ignoring how the satin of my nightwear clung to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I get you something to drink?&#34; I attempted to put in, my voice barely more than a wheeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Water&#39;s fine,&#34; he replied, his voice a bit gruff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help but feel his eyes on me as I made my way to the kitchen. I began pouring water into the glass, trying to distract myself from the burning sensation on my back. My throat bobbed with a hard swallow as my mind raced trying  to figure out why Kian really came here. Was it really about the project or was there something else? A cold chill crawled up my spine at the mere thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I mean Kian&#39;s hot and so freaking sexy. I think he&#39;ll make a good boyfriend plus judging by his looks he&#39;ll probably be good in bed so girl....you definitely can&#39;t miss out on this...at least for the sex.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*But look on the bright side we know he&#39;s interested for sure now.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had ended the call with Mia just before opening the door but that didn&#39;t stop her words from echoing in my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sucked in air trying to calm my racing heart before returning to the living room. I handed him the glass and in the process our fingers brushed gently against each other which sent a jolt if electricity through my entire body. Our eyes met again and I could see the same shock if awareness in them. This was dangerous territory and we both knew that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So...&#34; I pressed my lips together as I plopped on the chair opposite him. &#34;...you wanted to discuss about the project with the new client right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He locked eyes with me as he took a small sip from the glass in his hand. &#34;Yeah...&#34; He admitted finally looking away. &#34;I wasn&#39;t listening when you were talking about it a few days ago.&#34; A sheepish smile formed on his lips. &#34;I was...uh...distracted.&#34; He hesitated before saying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*He was distracted?* I blinked. What on earth would have gotten him so distracted that he completely forgot about everything I said concerning the project. An image of Kian staring at me while I talked flashed in my head. I mean he was listening....at least it looked like he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Why the hell are you staring at me like that?&#34; I frowned at Kian who stood in the corner of my office with his hands crossed over his chest. I had been trying to ignore the scorching hot sensation on my skin but it wasn&#39;t working. A smirk crept up his lips as he pushed himself off the wall before lifting his shoulders in a half shrug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34; He tilted his head. &#34;I guess it&#39;s because you&#39;re pretty.&#34; The burning sensation I felt on my skin seconds ago was nothing compared to heat on my cheeks. I felt another blush creeping up my neck as I tried to keep my composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mhmm.&#34; I closed my eyes trying my best to sound nonchalant as I raised my chin an inch higher. &#34;If you&#39;ll keep staring at me like that someone&#39;s going to think you&#39;re in love with me.&#34; A satisfied smile formed on my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then let them think.&#34; He said causing my brows to shoot up. I mean unless you have a problem with that?&#34; He asked moving towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean by that?&#34; My brows drew together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh I don&#39;t know...&#34; He wrapped his fingers around his chin as he glanced at the ceiling. &#34;...maybe you have a big crush on me and you don&#39;t want anyone to find out so if rumors about me being in love with you start spreading....&#34; He trailed off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re loosing it.&#34; I rolled my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay it&#39;s okay. A lot of women are in love with me because of my incredible charm and my amazing looks so I perfectly understand.&#34; He placed his hand in his chest as a sly smirk formed on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Asshole.&#34;***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be that he got distracted just by staring at me? The velvety wings of the butterflies in my stomach brushed against the walls of my tummy and I couldn&#39;t help but feel a bit self-conscious under his gaze. What were we talking about again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You get distracted a lot when I talk, Kian.&#34; I drawled peering at him. &#34;Maybe you should work on that.&#34; I said, trying to sound calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a small chuckle, the sound low and intimate in the quiet room. &#34;I guess I should.&#34; He said in a teasing tone, and also something else I couldn&#39;t quite put my finger on....something that made my pulse quicken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence fell between us, thick with unspoken words. I could see the conflict in his eyes, the way he seemed to be battling with himself. There we a part of me that wanted to push him to speak, push him to say whatever it was that was on his mind, whatever it was that was bugging him but another part of me was terrified of what he might say. So I took the coward&#39;s way out of it and broke the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Umm...okay.&#34; My eyes flickered around looking for anything I could use as a topic. That was when I realized that I hadn&#39;t even told him about the project with the new client....the reason he came here in the guest place. &#34;The new client huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; He blinked seeming startled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wanted me to tell you about the project we&#39;ve been working on with the new client...&#34; My eyelids dropped as I narrowed my eyes. &#34;...or are you distracted again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What makes you think I&#39;m distracted?&#34; His lips curled up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did I say you were distracted?&#34; I arched a brow lifting my feet before wrapping my arms around them as I curled up on the couch. &#34;I mean I only asked a question.&#34; He parted his lips about to say something when the lights went out leaving us alone in the dark room. *Oh shit. Not again.*</p>
