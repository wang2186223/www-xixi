                <p>Amaris&#39; POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched as his gaze dropped to my body and even though I was sitting he could see well enough to notice that I was wearing a pantsuit. I shifted uncomfortable under his piercing gaze....no matter how many times I denied it he was intimidating. &#34;Explain yourself.&#34; His eyes narrowed into thin slits. I already knew what he was talking about so there was no need to beat around the bush. His jaw clenched and unclenched before he spoke again. &#34;Don&#39;t make me repeat myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pressed my lips together trying to summon up courage before speaking. &#34;If I recall correctly, Sir....&#34; I drawled. &#34;...there were no restrictions against pant suits in the email you sent to me so technically I can wear them.&#34; I expected him to say something but he didn&#39;t so I just continued as I arranged the files on my desk, anything to not look into those dark orbs glaring at me. &#34;You wanted me to dress formally and here I am, dressing formally. Or....&#34; I raised my head meeting his gaze again. &#34;....this doesn&#39;t look formal to you?&#34; I lifted a brow, proud of myself that I somehow managed to pull it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes darkened with rage as the color drained out of his pupils. &#34;Miss Carter....are you...questioning me?&#34; He said in a surprisingly calm but cold tone. One that sent shivers down my spine. Come on girl, just breathe. You can keep this up for another five minutes. Don&#39;t let him walk all over you. Don&#39;t let him get to you.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not questioning you, Sir. I just wanted to know if you saw this look....&#34; I swept my hands down my body. &#34;....as dressing informal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked up expecting him to speak but he didn&#39;t say anything. Ugh! &#34;Besides we&#39;re having a meeting today....so I decided to look a little more....&#34; I paused looking for the exact word. &#34;Professional.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So.....&#34; He finally spoke. &#34;You decided to break my rules just because we&#39;re having a meeting today.&#34; He looked at me with an irritated look which was kind of almost normal now. &#34;I&#39;ll let you off the hook this time Carter,&#34; he turned on his heel, striding out of the office. He then paused in his tracks before saying. &#34;But try this again and I promise you.....you&#39;re losing your job on the spot.&#34; His icy tone sent another chill of shivers down my spine as the coldness of his words cut through me like a razor blade leaving a trail of goosebumps behind. Argh! Why did he always make me feel so uneasy!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t left yet so I decided to apologize even though it wasn&#39;t something I would normally do. &#34;I&#39;m.....&#34; I was about to apologize when it struck me. Wait a minute, I wanted to lose this job right....there ain&#39;t no way I&#39;m apologizing to this jerk, he could go jump off a building for all I care. He&#39;s the one who hired me in the first place so he should be the one to suffer, not me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What was that?&#34; He turned his head just a little inch to the right so I could see one of his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was about to utter the word &#34;nothing,&#34; then I realized that I was going to sound a bit scared. &#34;I just wanted to say I&#39;m perfectly fine with it.&#34; A smug smile crept up my lips. &#34;I think you should fire me.&#34; I crossed my hands over my chest. &#34;I&#39;m pretty sure I can get a better job somewhere.....at least I won&#39;t get to see your annoying face five times in a week.&#34; I muttered that last part to myself but I made it loud enough so he could hear me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see a vein pulsing in the side of his head as he clenched his fist but he didn&#39;t say anything, which would have surprised me if he wasn&#39;t weirdly quiet today. Well, I guess the gods are on my side today. I watched him leave and as expected he didn&#39;t shut the door but I was too happy to even care. I just pissed off the Caleb Thorne again. And it felt so fucking good. I let out a loud chuckle before getting up to close the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I walked back to my seat, I couldn&#39;t help but think about the things that Caleb would do to get back at me. My mind raced with possibilities but I pushed them all aside. I wasn&#39;t going to give him the satisfaction of infiltrating my thoughts. Not when I had work to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>~~~~~~~~~</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As expected the meeting went smoothly but what kept bugging me was why Caleb was so quiet. Don&#39;t get me wrong he was quiet most of the time but this time was just so different. He didn&#39;t even say anything at the meeting, he just sat there watching everyone blabbing about the changes they could make in the company and I had to write all that shit down....while standing!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the meeting was over I headed to my office so I could make a report on the notes I had taken down. I also had a lot of filing and paperwork to do and I was already tired, like really tired. But I didn&#39;t have a choice, I didn&#39;t want that jerk  barging into my office again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A couple of throbbing headaches, eye stings, keyboard burnouts and back pains later I was done with all the paperwork for the day. I glanced at my screen and I had to admit we were making really good profit this month. A small smile plastered on my face when I imagined Caleb thanking me for the good work I&#39;ve been doing. Yeah right. Caleb? Thank me? Apparently he was nothing but a huge thorn in my side, literally. Well he should be glad his name is really working out for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was still trying to wrap my head around the fact that someone as awesome and kind as Kian Beck was a friend of his. I mean he&#39;s nice, he has manners and he even smiles. An image of Kian smiling flashed in my head and I couldn&#39;t help but grin. If only Caleb was as nice as he was, my life wouldn&#39;t have been less miserable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard the faint sound of footsteps heading in my direction and I jerked my head up towards the door. Great. Just the right person I wanted to see. My friend deepened as I watched Caleb walk into my office for the second time today.  What did he want from me? I inwardly groaned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Make sure you finish on time today. His warning echoed in my head. Oh shoot. I shut my eyes tight before opening them again, how could I forget. Caleb had unexpectedly decided to review all the paperwork himself today, which was unusual since he normally doesn&#39;t bother himself with such petty things. But for some reasons best known to him, he chose to make an exception today and I couldn&#39;t help but wonder why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Carter,&#34; he greeted me with a small nod. &#34;I suppose you&#39;re finished with the film for the day?&#34; He said with his hands clasped behind him. Even though he didn&#39;t smile, his time was surprisingly cheerful and sparking my skepticism. There was something about him that didn&#39;t quite add up. I tried hiding my suspicion as I peered at him with a scrutinizing look. What the heck was he up to now</p>
