                <p>Amaris&#39; POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had made up my mind. I wasn&#39;t going to try to get on Caleb&#39;s bad side anymore. Whatever stupid task he wanted me to do for him, I would do it without any complaints as long as it meant he was going to go away. Even if he wanted me to climb mount Everest I&#39;d do it without complaining. If that&#39;s what I had to do to get him off my back then so be it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh that&#39;s fine. I already have a girlfriend so....&#34; He shrugged his shoulders. He had a girlfriend? No wonder Caleb was so silent when he saw us at the bakery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh...&#34; I raised my brows. &#34;You have a girlfriend.&#34; I repeated sizing him up as I tried to sink his words into my brain but there was one thing that didn&#39;t quite add up. If he had a girlfriend, why was he so bent up about another woman calling him by his name and what side of the story was he talking about earlier? &#34;Well that&#39;s surprising.&#34; My lips curled up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really.&#34; He cocked a brow. &#34;And why is it surprising?&#34; He asked quite eager to hear my reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well.....first of all you are kind of famous so if you had a girlfriend I&#39;m pretty sure many people would&#39;ve known but I&#39;ve never heard anyone mention anything about your girlfriend and secondly you&#39;re on the list of the most eligible bachelors in the country....doesn&#39;t that mean you&#39;re single?&#34; I sized him up. &#34;Don&#39;t get me wrong I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re lying or anything, it&#39;s just....&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No...I kind of get what you&#39;re saying but having a girlfriend doesn&#39;t make me married,&#34; he said. &#34;I&#39;m still a bachelor and also....my girlfriend is....&#34; He hesitated before saying. &#34;...Well shy and she doesn&#39;t like the whole fame thing I&#39;ve got going so she just wants to stay hidden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mhmmm.&#34; I stared at him with a scrutinizing look. I didn&#39;t know why but I had this nagging feeling that he was lying about this girlfriend of his but as usual I just shrugged it off. &#34;Ok then...what&#39;s her name?&#34; I raised my chin an inch higher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fiona...&#34; He answered. &#34;Would you like to meet her?&#34; He inched closer, narrowing his eyes into thin slits. Every ounce of doubt within me vanished when I heard his words. For him to ask that meant she was real...wait why did I even think his girlfriend was fake in the first place?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nah,&#34; I wrinkled my nose. &#34;Not really.&#34; I slowly shook my head before silence settled between us and that was when I remembered to ask him what he meant earlier. &#34;Umm....so what story were you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh...yeah. Caleb told me something about you lying to him about a family emergency so you could go clubbing with your best friend.&#34; A small gasp escaped my lips as they parted in surprise. No way Caleb actually told him that. What else does he tell him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know about that?&#34; I narrowed my eyes as a small smile crept up my lips although I wasn&#39;t exactly sure why I was smiling. He then dipped his head in a small nod and my smile widened when I realized he came here just because of that. &#34;That&#39;s why you came all the way here?!&#34; I glanced around before shifting my gaze back to his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess...&#34; He leaned back. &#34;I wasn&#39;t really doing anything at the office and my PA handles everything so I had time.&#34; He told me. Oh so he had a PA just like his friend. I thought to myself and a part of me couldn&#39;t stop from wishing I worked for Kian instead. He seemed like a very easy person to work with and honestly speaking we would&#39;ve made a really great team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So which part of my story exactly do you want to hear?&#34; I leaned back, relaxing in my chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everything.&#34; A smug smile spread across his face. &#34;Even the part about your grinding against a stranger&#39;s crotch.&#34; The smug look on his face turned into a mischievous one as he saw my jaw drop. Did Caleb really see all of that? What else did he see? What else did I do? I couldn&#39;t really recall the events that happened at the club that very night but just thinking about the possible things I would have said or done sent shivers down my spine. &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; He raised his brows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you came here to hear my side of the story and now you&#39;re just assuming I was.....dancing with some stranger.&#34; I frowned, avoiding the &#34;grinding against a stranger&#39;s crotch&#34; part.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay I&#39;m sorry,&#34; he let out a small chuckle. &#34;I just wanted to see if I could make you mad, looks like it worked.&#34; He grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No it didn&#39;t work.&#34; I shoved him in the knee. &#34;Cause I&#39;m not mad. I was just.....well....&#34; I paused searching for the right word to use as Kian arched one of his brows with a knowing look in his eyes as he patiently waited for me to speak, watching me make a fool of myself. &#34;You&#39;re annoying.&#34; I said as my eyelids dropped watching him as his chest rumbled with laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can be annoying sometimes but I can also be nice and sweet,&#34; he smiled, quoting me from the other day as I rolled my eyes looking away. &#34;But you know....&#34; I heard him say as I slowly turned my head to meet his gaze again. His expression was serious now compared to his playful demeanor he portrayed a few seconds ago. &#34;You shouldn&#39;t have lied to Caleb. He really hates it when people do that.&#34; He said. &#34;I&#39;m even surprised he hasn&#39;t hurt you or fired you.&#34; My throat bobbed with a hard swallow as I processed his words. He probably thought I hit my head when I was in the elevator and I was going to let him think that. It&#39;s not like there was any need to tell him about it, it wasn&#39;t like he was going to go confront Caleb for my sake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah....&#34; I played along. &#34;I&#39;m surprised too but who knows he might change his mind and come back to check if I&#39;m doing something wrong and end up punishing me.&#34; I said hoping he&#39;d take the bait. &#34;I guess I better get to work then.&#34; I pressed my lips together as I reached for the folders in my drawers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah....maybe we can talk later.&#34; He pushed himself off my desk. Talk later? &#34;Do you mind exchanging numbers?&#34; He asked waving his phone at me and I couldn&#39;t stop myself from smiling. To think that the man standing in front of me now was a fucking business man who earned millions or even billions daily. Who would have thought that he&#39;d be so free and easy to talk to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not at all,&#34; I shook my head, reaching for his phone as he held it over my head. I had completely forgotten about the excruciating pain in the back of my head but I was suddenly reminded when I tilted my head upwards trying to reach for his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oww,&#34; I hissed, grabbing the phone from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It still hurts?&#34; He raised his eyebrows before it relaxed into a disapproving expression. &#34;And you still don&#39;t want to go to the clinic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine.&#34; I typed my number before handing his phone over to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you even hurt yourself in the first place?&#34; My heart skipped a beat at the sudden question as I scoured through my mind searching for an answer. Gosh....what was I going to tell him now?</p>
