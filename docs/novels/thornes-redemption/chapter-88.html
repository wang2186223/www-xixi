                <p>I intended to stroke her with the belt on my neck, to ignite the pleasure in me but then, I tied her hands with it.</p>

                <p>Her body coiled to a corner of the bed as she was breathing fast, her body grew sore and her hair stood at its end.</p>

                <p>My dick fuss inside her as I stretched her pussy wall. Her pussy pushed me in and out. It was throbbing as she kicked her legs but I held her legs and placed on my hip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled out soon, trying to make her lay comfortably on the bed while curving her body slightly and then I slide slowly inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She vibrates rolling her head on the bed, her hands unable to move while I moved fast with her on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My testosterone was having a work out and she made him harden the more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Arghh! Bastard!&#34; She groan but i slapped her cheeks and said;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t talk until I say so bitch!&#34; I reminded devouring her pussy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I used one hand to clear off her long hair from her face just so I could look into her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sweat beads on her, her face was a mixture of sweat and the saliva she had poured out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tender body squirm in my hand as she picked up the rhythm of my movement on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was buried in her sweat heat as she grabbed a fistful of my shirt while we moved on the bed, moaning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body molded intimately on her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grabbed her breast, kneading them to my taste that she was forced to abandon her attempt of fighting against me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I haul in my breath as my agile fingers fondles her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hard thighs crowned her hips as I deliberately stretched her pussy wall, dazed by her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I draped her arms, engulfed in my emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was focused totally on her, our flesh fused as she rolled her head on the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her legs almost falling from my waist but I glared at her to keep them in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kissed the slender column of her throat, the lean muscle of my belly slammed against hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her low sultry incident mews invited me for more. I could perceive her every desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She radiates in her heat, as I rained kissed on her silk shoulder. I was reeled in a wicked delight, her rapid and shallow breath fanned me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grew hungrier and faster, her boneless thighs spread the more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please Caleb...argh! I can&#39;t&#34; she growl crying which made me nearly madden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a naughty smile and nibbles her ears, her eyes were pleading as she purr beneath my touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This bitch don&#39;t fucking listen! I pulled out my dick as the tip had gone red. Time to shut her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled her from the bed she fell on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kneel!&#34; I ordered but she refuses and all she did was sob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grabbed her neck, pressing it hard, almost choking her. Her eyes shoot out as she was shaking, her eyes lids sag as she poured out spit struggling to breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kneel whore!&#34; I barked again and she went on her knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heaved a sigh still holding her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now open that mouth&#34; I added as my gaze on her darkens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slightly open her and I slide two of my fingers to spread them open for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking them out, I forced my dick inside her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now do the needful bitch!&#34; I roared and she beg to suck my dick, lubricating it with her tongue and cleaning me dry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My lips kicked my dick and her tied hands did their best to knead my scrotum bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took my hand off her neck, groaning and going wild while placing them on her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My waist sways as I grabbed her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was fucking good. After 3 minutes of agonizing cry, I pumped inside her mouth and she swallowed my dick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even when I pulled out my dick, her tongue was still licking the tip, like she was hypnotized and I was amazed by that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My dick was still erect but she looked sick and her eyes consumed by lust. With a wicked grin, I spread my cum all over her face and she opened her mouth to have them in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I squat low to her position and rubbed the cum over her face, her breast jiggles and I let out my tongue to lick her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fingers pinched her nipples as I trail my tongue from my cheek to her mouth, kissing her intensively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dragged my mouth from her and said;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s time for another session&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amaris POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blaring sound of the alarm close by jerk me up. I could feel my body throbbing, my heart flips and my thoughts blurry of thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My pussy throbs and faint visions filled my head, one that made me freeze where I sat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something light and fluffy was on me and from the texture, it was more like a blanket which I flung away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I touched my body and realized I was wearing an outfit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I spur my eyes open, it took a while for me to catch a glimpse of an off white wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got to discover I was in a room that spoke of wealth, not until I saw his portrait that I knew he was the one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bite my lips and rake my hair. I was a mess. Last night was a night I couldn&#39;t tell I regret of not because Caleb made mincemeat of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He breached my every defense, fucking me everywhere like a whore that it left me wondering what he&#39;d do to me if we get married.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said his parents were coming over but that must be a lie. I would never get married to a man i&#39;d call a gigolo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flash of last night flooded my head when he pulled out his nice meaty cock and he took my hand and told me to feel it, his beautiful cock and it felt good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blamed myself as he had consumed me with his passion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started to slowly jack him off , I was getting excited, when he had forcely made me sick his dick, and pump it dip in my mouth, I was kind of loving his cock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kicked him and wanted to fill his cum filling my mouth and suddenly he groned and led out a big load like 4 times and I swallowed and licked him clean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His cum tasted good, a little salty and creamy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I could see him sucking my breasts with his hot tongue, my fingers digging into his skin as we stride on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a sexually violent rotation with my breasts barrel-rolled across Caleb&#39;s howling mouth and the pained frenzy of his bulbous salutation extenuating his excitement as it whacked and smacked its way into every muscle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a minutes, me make a grab of my hair, and glide inside my pussy, now angrily slapping against both our bellies, inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then pulled his dick and pushed himself down, his face staring at my pussy as I wriggled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held both my arms down, and puts his tongue to my core, like a cat lapping up a dish of cream so as not to miss a single drop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I find myself gripping his ears and tugging at the locks curling over them, begging him not to stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shut! I just screwed up. The aftermath made me regret my actions and I cover my mouth with my palm to suppress the silent scream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes scrolled around if I&#39;d find him and fortunately, he wasn&#39;t and I jumped out of the bed, almost taking a step away when I heard;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seems someone is thoughtful&#34;</p>
