                <p>Amaris&#39; POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The past few days have been the best days of my life. Caleb had been on a business trip to South Korea and as expected he didn&#39;t leave me in charge of his company. It wasn&#39;t surprising that he left his company in Kian&#39;s hands. If I were him which was incredibly impossible I would have done the same thing since he didn&#39;t trust his fucking secretary or in this case PA. Well it&#39;s not like I was losing anyway, a few weeks ago I had wished I worked for Kian instead of Caleb and now I actually got my wish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although he wasn&#39;t around every time since he had his own duties to attend to but whenever he was around he always ended up making me wish he stayed longer. He was always in my office....always telling me stories of how he got to his current position, he even brought me lunch when I was too busy to get it myself. To be honest I didn&#39;t see him as my boss or anything but a friend.....well I did call him by his name so yes we were friends. Too bad he had a girlfriend....then I wouldn&#39;t feel bad if I found myself flirting with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning Amaris.&#34; Kian walked into my office with a  box in his hand. I narrowed my eyes into slits before dropping the pen in my hand. He wasn&#39;t supposed to be here until tomorrow, so why was he here now? Unknown to Caleb he did leave me in charge of things whenever he couldn&#39;t come. I wonder how Caleb was going to react if he actually found out that I was the one running things and not Kian. I shifted my gaze to the box in his hand. It was wrapped with a beautiful ribbon and filled with colorful cupcakes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small smile formed on my lips before I leaned closer to my table, clasping my hands together. &#34;Doesn&#39;t it strike you as inappropriate and unprofessional for a girl&#39;s boss to greet his employee?&#34; I lifted a brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A simple good morning would have been nice but I&#39;ll take it.&#34; He said dropping the box of cupcakes on my desk as I let out a light chuckle. I enjoyed teasing him just as he enjoyed taunting me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s this?&#34; I asked, knowing perfectly well that they were cupcakes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Their cupcakes.&#34; He drawled, arching a brow. &#34;I saw them on my way here and thought you&#39;d like them.&#34; He pushed them closer to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what if I don&#39;t.&#34; My smirk widened as I pushed the box of cupcakes towards him. &#34;What if...&#34; I lifted a finger. &#34;I&#39;m allergic or what if I hate cupcakes?&#34; I leaned back in my seat. &#34;What will you do then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess I&#39;ll have them all to myself then.&#34; He shrugged his shoulders before grabbing the box and pulling off the ribbon. I then lazily rolled my eyes as he took out a cupcake from the box. &#34;But I doubt you&#39;d ever be allergic or hate stuff like this.&#34; He waved the cupcake in my face. &#34;Especially when you spend twenty minutes stuffing your face with pastries everyday.&#34; He took a bite out of the cupcake which was supposed to look completely normal but it was anything but that. If I was going to be honest it did look kind of sexy. The way he smiled before biting into the cupcake, the way he locked eyes with me as he licked the cream off his lips. So sexy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are insane.&#34; I said, earning a chuckle from him as I shook my head slowly before pulling the box of cupcakes towards me. &#34;You know it&#39;s rude to eat the same cupcakes you offered me without my permission right?&#34; I took out another cupcake from the box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you did give me permission.&#34; He circled around my table sitting on my desk before lifting the cupcake to his lips. &#34;Didn&#39;t you?&#34; He pointed the cupcake towards me. &#34;You said you didn&#39;t want them so why is a cupcake in your hand right now?&#34; He took another bite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never said I didn&#39;t want them.&#34; I ran my hands over the cupcake wrapping before dipping my finger in the fluffy, frosted topping. I then wrapped my lips around my finger spreading it across my tongue. The sweet, sugary flavor exploded in my mouth coating my taste buds and I had to admit it was pretty good. I closed my eyes, savoring the creamy flavor that lingered on my tongue. &#34;I said what if.&#34; I slowly withdrew my finger from my lips before pointing it at him. He narrowed his eyes into thin slits as his lips curled up before he hummed a reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So I&#39;m guessing you like it?&#34; He lifted his brows as an expectancy glint flashed in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t....it tastes horrible.&#34; I said with a bored expression. I wanted to tease him again, see how he was going to react but instead it backfired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not what your face said a few seconds ago.&#34; He leaned closer waggling his cupcake in my face as a mischievous grin crept up his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yeah and what did my face say?&#34; I lifted my chin an inch higher with a challenging look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your face saidThis is the best cupcake I&#39;ve ever had in the entire universe and I&#39;ve never ever tasted anything like it before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh really?&#34; I narrowed my eyes as I peered at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ofcourse.&#34; He dipped his head in a small nod. I glared at him for a while before finally dropping my gaze to the box of cupcakes. &#34;What are you doing here anyway?&#34; I brought the cupcake to my lips. &#34;You&#39;re not supposed to be here until tomorrow.&#34; I said before taking a bite. If the icing was enchantingly sweet, the cupcake was a heavenly treat. How on earth could something taste so fucking good. Kian probably noticed the change in my expression cause the next the thing he says was,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See...you like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You haven&#39;t answered my question.&#34; My lips twisted into a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? So I can&#39;t come and check on my brother&#39;s company anymore?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have other important things to do.&#34; I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My PA&#39;s handling it. I was free so I decided to come.&#34; He lifted his shoulders in a half shrug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you&#39;re still going to come tomorrow?&#34; I wrinkled my forehead before taking another bite of my cupcake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure. Why not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because you have other important places to be as the owner of Beck Luxury Homes.&#34; I drawled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like I said, my PA&#39;s handling it.&#34; He took another cupcake from the box. &#34;Are you.... chasing me away?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; I closed my eyes as I lifted my chin. &#34;I just think it&#39;s abnormal for a guy with a girlfriend to be working when he&#39;s free.&#34; I always made sure to remind myself that he had a girlfriend so I would cross the boundaries I set out for myself. His eyebrows shot up like he suddenly remembered something before a small smile formed on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh right. I have a girlfriend.&#34; He says almost sarcastically. Was he joking? Did he actually have a girlfriend or was he just lying to me?</p>
