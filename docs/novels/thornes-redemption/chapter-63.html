                <p>Amaris&#39; POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you know what personal space is?&#34; I wrinkled my nose as I left the file to fall on the desk. &#34;Why do you love being  inches away from my face?&#34; I crossed my arms over my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dunno.&#34; He pushed the file towards me. &#34;Maybe it&#39;s because I love the way you smell.&#34; He said, causing my eyebrows to shoot up as heat flared my cheeks. Did he just....say that to me? With a straight face? Is he crazy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the....you....&#34; I kept stuttering, not able to find the right words as the heat on my cheeks intensified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; He lifted a brow pretending he didn&#39;t just say something so....so inappropriate a few minutes ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing.&#34; I shook my head before dropping my gaze. Kian had always been like this yes...but he was never this direct about it. I buried my eyes in the work in front of me as I made it not a point to look up. I expected Kian to tease me or say something else but I didn&#39;t hear him speak for a whole twenty seconds, of course I had to look up. He was staring at me with an inscrutable look on his face. He then opened his mouth to speak but was interrupted by the loud blaring sound from the phone in his pocket. He then pressed his lips in a thin line before taking out the phone from his pocket. He then glanced at the screen before lifting his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah I need to take this. I&#39;ll be right back.&#34; He said before moving towards the door. I watched him in silence, my eyes not leaving his body until the door closed shut echoing in the silent room. My eyes lingered on the closed door for a while before glancing at the clock. 11:16. Almost time for a break which wasn&#39;t really necessary since Kian already brought me some cupcakes but I knew I was going to get hungry again so yeah....it was necessary. All I needed to...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My thoughts were interrupted by the vibrating sound coming from my phone which rested on the other side of my desk. I checked the caller ID to see who it was and I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes. Mia had gone to visit her dad, yeah they had their issues but he was still her father. She always made sure to visit him twice every year and it had been about seven months since she visited. Her father had a strict no phone policy whenever they were spending time together so we never really had time to chat. So her calling now meant she probably found a way out of the house or maybe her father had something urgent to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey girl.&#34; Mia screamed from the other side of the phone the second I tapped the green icon. &#34;I&#39;ve missed you so fucking much.&#34; She squealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a small giggle before placing my phone on my desk. &#34;I&#39;ve missed you too, boo.&#34; I said, picking up the pen from my desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long has it been huh?&#34; Her eyes glinted with excitement. &#34;A week?&#34; She tapped on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think so.&#34; I twirled the pen between my fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We so have a lot of catching up to do.&#34; She beamed at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know right.&#34; I grinned. &#34;How&#39;s California?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh you know...&#34; She waved her hand in the air. &#34;The weather&#39;s great, perfect even, the scenery is stunning. There&#39;s so much to do here. I&#39;ve been hitting yo beaches, exploring the nightlife and trying some great restaurants. Apart from the whole not talking to you thing I&#39;m actually having a great time.&#34; She held her chin as she nodded her head slowly. &#34;California is actually amazing. We should come here together sometime.&#34; She suggested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright if you say so.&#34; I let out a small laugh. &#34;So tell me...&#34; I leaned closer, resting my chin in my hands. &#34;...is there anything you need to tell me? Any guy perhaps?&#34; I wiggled my brows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are insane.&#34; She chuckled lightly. &#34;I came here to spend time with my dad, not find myself a boyfriend.&#34; Her lips twisted into a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you&#39;re telling me, you spent a whole week in California and you haven&#39;t seen one hot guy?&#34; I held up my finger before shaking my head frantically. &#34;Scratch that. You haven&#39;t hit on one single guy?&#34; I cocked my head. She opened her mouth to speak but closed it back. &#34;Mhmm?&#34; I leaned in closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well that&#39;s different.&#34; She looked away from her phone. &#34;Hitting on guys has nothing to do with finding myself a boyfriend.&#34; She said, causing my jaw to drop before a smile spread across my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you hear yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh you know what I mean.&#34; She waved off my comment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I don&#39;t know what you mean.&#34; I raised my brows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s forget about me...what&#39;s up with you?&#34; She asked, quickly switching gears and before I could say anything she spoke again. &#34;Your boss is in South Korea and he left Kian in charge.&#34; A sly grin curled up her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah so....&#34; I lifted my shoulders in a half shrug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So...&#34; She drawled as she sat up on what looked like her bed. &#34;Update me. Give me all the tea. I need to know what&#39;s happening.&#34; She hugged a pillow before tucking a loose strand behind her ear. She was still in her PJ&#39;s which meant it wasn&#39;t too long since she woke up. Well it was only normal since California was actually three hours behind and knowing Mia...she loved sleeping in. &#34;Why aren&#39;t you saying anything?&#34; She brought her face really close to her phone staring at me with a scrutinizing look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because there is nothing to talk about?&#34; I spread out my arms. It&#39;s not like I was lying to her. There was nothing to talk about Kian and I were just friends who liked teasing each other from time to time. What else was I supposed to tell her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That you secretly find him attractive? I ignored the little voice in my head as I focused on the girl in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean there&#39;s nothing to talk about?&#34; She asked, raising her voice slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut it.&#34; I placed my fingers on my lips, shutting her up. It was impossible for someone to over hear our conversation but still it was better to be safe than sorry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not shutting it. You mean you guys have been working together for two fucking weeks and you guys haven&#39;t done anything?&#34; She slowly shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you can spend a whole week in California without hitting on a guy...&#34; She said with air quotes. &#34;I guess I can do the same.&#34; I shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never said I didn&#39;t hit on a guy. I just...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aha...&#34; I pointed at the screen with a wide grin spread across my lips. &#34;Busted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh shut up, my case is different. You on the other hand have been spending time with a guy that&#39;s attracted to you and you guys haven&#39;t even kissed or had sex?&#34; I opened my mouth to answer her when I heard the door swing open. &#34;I mean Kian&#39;s hot and so freaking sexy. I think he&#39;ll make a good boyfriend plus judging by his looks he&#39;ll probably be good in bed so girl....you definitely can&#39;t miss out on this...at least for the sex.&#34; Standing at the door stood a surprised but kind of amused Kian and I couldn&#39;t help but wish the ground would open up and swallow me whole. Gosh I had always told Mia her mouth was going to get us into trouble someday...now look what she&#39;s done.</p>
