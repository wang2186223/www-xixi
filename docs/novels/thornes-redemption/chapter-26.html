                <p>Amaris&#39; POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed, staring at my reflection in the mirror before pressing my lips on a thin line. The past few days had been really terrifying. I mean if someone would have told me that all this was going to happen to me in a space of three days I would have assumed they lost their mind or something. I let out another sigh as I added the finishing touches on my make up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb. That asshole, I was kidnapped for crying out loud and now he expects me to show up at work the next day. I was supposed to be at home comforting my best friend but instead he wants me to come to work so he can boss me around and assign the most ridiculous tasks to me. I mean he did let me stay home yesterday and I had to admit I didn&#39;t expect him to do that. Caleb was a stickler for rules, he clearly said I was supposed to give him a two weeks notice before taking a day off but the way he spoke over the phone yesterday ruined every good thing he had ever done or said to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t care, I told you yesterday that I won&#39;t help next time. You could both die for all I care</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a jerk!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh Lord, give me strength. I pinched between my brows a bit frustrated. Maybe I should consider looking for another job. Anything&#39;s fine as long as I&#39;d get to be away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave myself a once-over in the mirror making sure nothing was wrong with my looks. Today I decided to wear a black pants suit which I thought looked pretty good on me which was surprising because if there was one thing I knew that I hated about myself was my low self esteem. I mean there were a lot of other things but they weren&#39;t as bad as my self esteem. The only person who knew about it was Mia....others assumed I had high self esteem because of how I acted around people but actually it was the complete opposite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I stared at the pants in the mirror admiring how it clung to my figure my mind wandered to the dress code that Caleb sent when I started working for him and I couldn&#39;t recall if pants weren&#39;t allowed. Oh well. I shrugged my shoulders. I don&#39;t remember seeing pants listed as not allowed in the list he sent and that&#39;s good enough for me. I flashed a smile at the young woman in my mirror before heading out the door. I just hope today doesn&#39;t suck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Later girl!&#34; I was already halfway out the door when Mia&#39;s urgent tone stopped me in my tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ammie come see!&#34; It took me a few seconds before I realized she was actually pointing towards the TV. I could tell she was watching a news channel but I couldn&#39;t see the headlines because I was too far away from the screen. I then moved towards where she sat, closing the distance between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; I asked with a confused expression on my face before following her gaze back to the TV. My eyes widened as I took in the breaking news headline scrolling through the screen. &#34;What in the world?&#34; I squinted my eyes before shaking my head in disbelief. Maybe I was imagining things. I read the headline again and again convincing myself that I wasn&#39;t seeing things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tragedy has struck the advertising world as the CEO of Millers, a globally renowned company, was discovered deceased in his office earlier today. Authorities have confirmed that the cause of death was suicide, resulting from an overdose of antidepressant medication. Our deepest sympathies go out to the family, colleagues, and staff affected by this heartbreaking loss.&#34; the announcer spoke from the other side of the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow.....I have to say I&#39;m impressed.&#34; I said my smile, a mix of shock and admiration. &#34;Your dad&#39;s men did a really good job.&#34; I let out a light chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think?&#34; She smiled, turning back to see me since I was standing directly behind the couch. &#34;I mean I know they did a great job but don&#39;t you feel guilty?&#34; She pursed her lips. &#34;Well you wouldn&#39;t obviously because you don&#39;t have anything to do with this...&#34; She spoke again, not even giving me a chance to reply. &#34;...it just feels kind of weird to know that he was actually murdered all because of me.&#34; Her lips curled into a sad smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey....&#34; I bent over, placing my hands on her shoulders. &#34;Don&#39;t get so worked up about it. None of this is your fault besides he&#39;s the one who decided to harm you in the first place. He just got what was coming to him.&#34; I gave her shoulders a little squeeze trying to reassure her. &#34;They did it to protect you so you don&#39;t have to blame yourself for anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I guess you&#39;re right.&#34; She said after taking a while to think about it. She sighed, slumping her shoulders as she sank into the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I gotta go.&#34; I pointed towards the door. &#34;It&#39;s gonna take me a bit more time to get there since we live farther away from the office now. I don&#39;t want to be late before Mr. Grumpy grumps fires me.&#34; I said with air quotes as we both burst out laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah see you later.&#34; She waved as I walked to the door still listening to her. &#34;In the meantime I&#39;ll see if I can find some job vacancies online and also tell my dad that I won&#39;t be needing his help to find a job.&#34; I heard her say. &#34;Don&#39;t forget to get a tub of ice cream on your way home.&#34; She added.  &#34;Love your pants suit by the way.&#34; I turned to see a mischievous smile on her face</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; I cupped my cheeks with a huge grin spread across my face. &#34;Later Mia.&#34; I waved again before closing the door behind me. I walked away with a smile plastered on my face as I thought about what she said. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m already looking forward to that I&#39;ve cream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning Sir.&#34; I greeted trying my best to sound professional even though I was still pissed about the things he said to us yesterday. I was still trying to get used to the way Caleb barged in and out of my office like he owned the place...well technically he did but couldn&#39;t he give a woman some space? Ugh!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at his outfit and he was putting on a suit as usual but it seemed like he had left his jacket in his office or something because he wasn&#39;t putting it on. Come to think of it, ever since I met him I&#39;ve only seen him put on his suit jacket only when we&#39;re at a meeting, important meetings. His black crisp shirt clung to his body, tight enough to show every ripple of muscle as he moved which I would have found attractive if I wasn&#39;t so pissed at the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched him stride across the room as I thought to myself. If only he had a good personality to match his stunning looks and impressive physique. Too bad wishes don&#39;t come true. &#34;Good morning, Miss Amaris.&#34; He spoke his tone laced with disapproval. His gaze dropped to my body and even though I was sitting he could see well enough to notice that I was wearing a pantsuit. Oh God.I sighed inwardly. Now the drama.</p>
