                <p>Caleb&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smile thinking back at today&#39;s car ride, when I was calling Kiara. The shock on Kiara&#39;s face was everything when she heard the words &#34;put on something sexy&#34;. Thinking about it, a chuckle escapes my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the fuck? I can&#39;t remember the last time I genuinely laughed but in just one day this lady enters my life, I&#39;m laughing without meaning to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What would have been her reaction when she heard me fucking Kiara? Crazy, I&#39;m sure. Another smile crawls onto my lips as I think about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning on my laptop, I go through the camera footage, having access to every single one of them. I see the way she rushes to come to Kiara&#39;s rescue when I began spanking her and her reaction when she realized what was going on and another chuckle escaped my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My purpose for bringing Kiara into the office today really and truly worked. I can&#39;t remember the last time I told Kiara to come over to my work place, but anything that&#39;s going to taunt Amaris, I&#39;m fine with it. I&#39;m very determined to break her before the month runs out. But what if she gets tired and decides to resign? No that won&#39;t happen, it won&#39;t get to that extent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My dislike for ladies is not something that&#39;s inherent or that came on its own, but rather,  something that experience pushed upon me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clearly recall my early years, when I just started Thorne enterprises - it wasn&#39;t even an enterprise then, but I hoped that it would soon become one - I met this beautiful lady, Abigail. We were good friends and slowly, I began falling in love with her. I told her how I felt and she insisted she felt the same way too, assuring me that the relationship was not one-sided, but then after eight months, on the day I planned to engage her, I caught her in bed with one of my partners. I wanted to kill the person she was involved with, just to realize that he too was being played. After then, I partly gave up on ladies, but then I realized that everyone I fell in love with was just there for the money or the sex. I abandoned women and focused on my work. That way, I gave them what they wanted and still got what I wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The longest I&#39;ve been with a lady since Abigail is Kiara Sanchez. I met her at a club I frequented. She served as a waitress, but being beautiful, sexy and in need of money, it wasn&#39;t difficult to lure her into my bed. She enjoyed the night and we exchanged numbers. Whenever she came and it was over, I&#39;ll pay her and she&#39;ll leave. Well, that was until she began requesting for other things like housing, allowance, maintenance and other crazy stuff which I had no problems providing. The only reason I stuck with her ever since is because she fucks like a pornstar, obeying my orders. I fucked rough but not bdsm type of shit. That&#39;s just outright crazy, I can look at you and you can look at me but you can&#39;t touch me kiss me or show any physical affection and that worked fine between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tucking those memories away into the box of bad memories at the back of my mind, I begin planning for tomorrow. I need to go see my brother, he is actually my second cousin, but circumstances and situations brought us closer than best friends, even closer than brothers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kian hasn&#39;t been in the country or even the continent for quite a long time and he came back two weeks ago. I&#39;ve wanted to go see him for a long time but I&#39;ve been postponing my visit because one thing or the other comes up but I&#39;ve made up my mind that nothing is going to stop me from going today. I put my brother first before everything and everyone so to think I&#39;ve left him for business for two weeks is something I&#39;m not comfortable with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I go into my bedroom to catch some sleep before morning. If I was lucky, I&#39;d get up to 5 hours sleep but with my insomnia, the odds are pretty low. I lay down to get my average 2 hours of sleep before getting up again to work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Here I am an hour later picturing Amaris with no clothes on. Her sexy hourglass figure spread on my bed with me spanking that sweet ass of hers and she screaming my name. Why the hell am I thinking of her in that way? I sit up rubbing my temples with my eyes shut to try to clear my mind. Something feels out of place. Shit! My erection is hard, and it&#39;s too damn late to start calling Kiara over. I guess I have to do this shit myself. Fuck!!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I stroke myself, I still have Amaris on my mind. That girl is seriously pulling my attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got out of bed with a yawn and had a good stretch. After my release earlier, I had a good rest. I guess luck was on my side seeing as I slept a little over five hours. Putting on my tank top and shorts, I head to the living room. I grab a bottle of water from the fridge and go throw on my sneakers ready for my daily run.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just ran all the way to the gym and it&#39;s currently 5:15 a.m. After doing my usuals, I go back home ready to shower and head to work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn, I&#39;m showering and I&#39;m still thinking about Amaris, but unlike yesterday, I&#39;m thinking about my task at hand which is to get her to lose her composure. I overheard her yesterday on the phone with her friend when she said she wasn&#39;t going to let me get to her and that pushed my determination up a notch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning sir&#34; she greeted me as I entered her little office that shares a door with my office. I created this little glass cubicle for her so that I could piss her off at ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprised that she&#39;s here before me, I head to my office so that I can assign her some jobs before I leave, but her surprise at my choice of outfit today did not go unnoticed. I had on a black button down shirt and black pants. The first two buttons of the shirt were open, exposing a little bit of my chest and the sleeves of the shirt were folded up. My hair is more disheveled than usual today because I need a haircut. My half Korean half American gene was not really obvious, but my hair screamed Korean. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s like that for other Koreans or other people in general, but my hair can&#39;t stay in a particular position without the use of gel and I hated that. Most I could go with is a hair cream. Kian complains a lot that my hair gives me a dangerous appearance but I think I like it that way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whoa! The people I have to meet today are pretty important. As I scroll up and down the list, I can&#39;t help but smile. Some of the people on this list have never been turned away or rejected before, so they&#39;ll be really pissed to find out that their appointments have been canceled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be out today and I&#39;m sure you know I have a bunch of appointments, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes sir&#34; she put her head down and said with a soft voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. So I need you to cancel every one of them&#34; she nods slightly &#34; and render my sincerest apologies, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes sir&#34; she looks up and I can see a slight smile on her face. I wonder why she&#39;s smiling, is there anything on my face?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood still admiring her beauty. She had on a white button down silk shirt tucked into a black fitted knee- length skirt, with some really cute black heels. But all I could imagine was ripping off the buttons of that shirt with my teeth and biting and sucking on her nipples.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;....you might need?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I was so lost in my head that I didn&#39;t hear what she asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; I asked if there was anything else you might need?&#34; she reiterated, her eyes gleaming and her brows creased in confusion and worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I need you under me, I need those lips of yours around my shaft, I need the feel of my cock buried in you, those were the thoughts running in my head and about to spill out of my mouth but I held them in before I started what I wouldn&#39;t be able to finish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Yes, I need you to send some mails after canceling those appointments&#34; I&#39;m saying this like I wasn&#39;t just imagining her under me. &#34; I&#39;m going to give you the details of the mails and I&#39;ll leave the rest to you, alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes sir&#34; she nods and sits back down. Look at that body, she&#39;s going to be sweet as pie. As I step into my office, I keep picturing things that I shouldn&#39;t be thinking of, of my secretary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Picking up my bag, I leave the office to go see Kian. I&#39;ve always had the best self control, but with Amaris around me, I can feel it crashing down. This isn&#39;t right but I have to think about it later. As of right now, I have somewhere to be.</p>
