                <p>Sparks fly when defiant Amaris dumps coffee on her new boss—ruthless CEO Caleb Thorne. Forced to become his secretary, their battle of wills ignites electric tension. But when her friend is kidnapped by his enemies, they must confront a shared danger... and their dangerously blurred lines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amaris&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a sigh of frustration as I slump into the bed, running my hand through my hair. This is the seventh rejection I&#39;ve gotten in just two weeks. A lot of people might have just given up, but I know better than to do that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moved here to Silicon Valley three weeks ago. After graduating from college, I tried getting a job, but nothing&#39;s worked......yet . It&#39;s already been four months since I graduated, so my best friend, Mia, insisted I moved here so I could look for a better job with higher earnings. It seemed like a good deal at the moment because I was already pretty hopeless, but now I&#39;m here and still unsuccessful. I feel like I might be cursed or something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Hey babe,&#34; Mia said, sitting beside me as I let out another sigh. &#34;Nothing yet??&#34; she asked, sporting a worry crease on her face, I nodded yes. &#34; Have you tried Thorne enterprises??&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What!! No. I&#39;m not doing that&#34; I calmly said and looked away trying to signify to her that I was done talking about this, but obviously she didn&#39;t get the message because before I could say another word she jumped off the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Why?&#34; she asked, placing her hands on her waist, &#34;it&#39;s not like you have any other choice anyways, or do you?&#34; she towered over me, oozing dominance. It was amazing how she could make someone feel scared even with her petite figure and childish features. I mean, if you didn&#39;t know her, you&#39;d probably think she&#39;s still in her teens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing the truth in her statement, I am left speechless. &#34; Mhmm, I thought so&#34; she said after a while, &#34;now get on that laptop and get that job&#34; she walked out slamming the door for dramatic effect. Sometimes, I wonder how we turned out to be best friends. A smile creeps onto my face as I think about our friendship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened my laptop and clicked on their site, massaging my temples while I waited for it to load. After a while, the bright logo lit up my face, immediately, I clicked on job vacancies crossing my fingers and hoping that I&#39;ll get the job this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scrolling through the list of vacancies, my excitement and anxiety washes away leaving behind a look of disappointment. The only jobs available are that of a secretary and cleaners. Flopping down, I bury my head in the pillow and let out a scream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laid there for over forty minutes, tossing and turning, thinking it over. After I decided that this was my last chance, I applied for the job of secretary. I read the requirements for the job. A photograph of me and my credentials. I think the idea of a photograph is ridiculous, I mean, what are they using my photo for. Anyways, if it&#39;s a photo they want, then I&#39;m gonna give them a photo. I went to my camera roll looking for any picture of mine that might be giving secretary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ve been scrolling through my phone for over seven minutes, still nothing. Annoyance filling me, I just clicked on a random picture of me and attached it to the documents in which I compiled my credentials.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A high pitched scream from Mia and I jolted awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia, it&#39;s Saturday. Can you let me sleep in..... peacefully?&#34; I said laying back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I can&#39;t,&#34; she jumped excitedly, &#34;because you just got mail from Thorne enterprises&#34; she yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess I didn&#39;t get it then&#34; I said with my eyes closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. Actually, they&#39;ve invited you in for an interview for next week&#34; she said in hushed tones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What!!&#34; Now I was fully awake &#34;Oh my goodness, I&#39;m getting up to interview stage&#34; I jumped around excitedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m so happy for the opportunity. It&#39;s not my dream job but at least it&#39;s a job and it&#39;ll put money into my pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You seem so excited now, but you sure weren&#39;t when I told you to apply there. Is there a reason for that??&#34; Mia asked with curiosity written all over her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Well, I thought, if I didn&#39;t have any luck with other smaller companies then I for sure won&#39;t have any luck with this. And I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard about the CEO of the company&#34; I say the last part, reducing my voice as if I was telling her some major secret, &#34;they say he behaves like the devil himself, that he&#39;s equally as merciless as he is powerful. The press even calls him &#39;the cold-hearted tycoon&#39; &#34; I said. As the drama queen she is, Mia shudders at the end of my statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That might not even be true. Anyways, you&#39;d find out for yourself by next week&#34; she winked at me. I rolled my eyes and headed towards the bathroom, sure that she was already spinning some silly romance in her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you roll your eyes so much, it&#39;s going to get stuck that way&#34; she folded her arms across her chest, &#34; besides, you might like him&#34; she whined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sadly enough, I&#39;m not that kind of girl. I love myself and I think the idea of being dependent is silly enough without bringing in the idea of being dependent on a guy. I believe in love but it&#39;s just not for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s finally the day for my interview. I woke up as early as 4:30 a.m. to ensure I wasn&#39;t going to be late. I put on the dress and heels that Mia got me. The dress was a black bodycon stopping directly above my knee, which I paired with silver pumps and a silver purse to match. I put my long brown hair into soft curls and did some light makeup. As I put final touches to my makeup, I can&#39;t help but think about how the interview would go. Looking into the mirror, I practice the lines I&#39;ve been rehearsing over the weekend and the smile I planned to win their hearts with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hurried into the car and checked the time. It was currently 6:27 a.m. and my interview was for 7:30, so I took my time as I went on, driving carefully. Stopping over at a little cafe, I got myself a bagel and a medium iced coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hurrying back into the car, I started up the engine, which made a little whirring sound and died. This car was fine minutes ago I said to myself stepping out to check out what was happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After trying to get it to work, which was a failure, I decided to call a Lyft. Turning on my phone, I realized there wasn&#39;t any service and there also weren&#39;t any cabs on the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, the elderly man that runs the little cafe got me a mechanic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I drove as fast as I could, I think I even skipped a traffic light. Driving into the company, I stare at the massive structure and I&#39;m dumbstruck. I can&#39;t believe it, this place is beautiful. I&#39;m really sure, I&#39;d love working here. Snapping myself out of my imagination realizing I&#39;m late, I hurried out of the car with my coffee and purse in my left hand and my files on my right. I carried every valid file I had because I didn&#39;t know the one they&#39;ll need.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lost in my thoughts and struggling to walk in these heels, I didn&#39;t notice the two guys coming right across from me, instantly I bumped into one of them spilling my ice coffee all over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh shoot, I&#39;m so sorry. I wasn&#39;t looking&#34; I said, trying to wipe him down with my hand.  &#34;I&#39;m already ruining things before I begin&#34; I think to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can&#39;t you watch where you&#39;re going?&#34; the man replied in a gruff tone, swatting my hand away and looking at me like I was trash. To think I was late, and I still took my time to apologize to this dick, and this is how he plans to treat me. I tried apologizing again seeing as I was at fault but he shoved me away this time I almost lost my footing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regaining my balance, I glared at him, &#34;I&#39;m trying to apologize to you, you know that right?&#34; I said angrily and he just shrugged nonchalantly. &#34;Well, you could as well fuck off&#34; I growled, push him and hurry into the building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have been waiting at the clerk&#39;s mini reception and I can&#39;t help but think about what a prick that guy was. Who is he in the first place? I mean, he was acting so entitled like he&#39;s better than me in some way. Why was he so rude?  I mean, I&#39;m a fellow human being. No, I won&#39;t let him cloud my mind or ruin my mood. I&#39;m getting this job and that&#39;s all that matters to me right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After about 30 minutes, I&#39;m called into the boss&#39; office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gosh, I&#39;m so late,&#34; I muttered to myself as I walked into the office. The boss is  on a swivel chair and looking out the penthouse floor to ceiling window probably admiring the skyline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ve already stood here for over two minutes and I&#39;m getting impatient. As I was considering clearing my throat to get his attention, he swiveled around. I looked up at him and flashed my perfectly rehearsed smile but the smile fell almost immediately as I looked at him. I gulped, my heart leaping into my throat as I realize  that the man I threw coffee on and told to fuck off, is the boss, the CEO of the company. The man in front of me is Caleb Thorne.</p>
