                <p>Amaris POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still find it very difficult to believe that Caleb Thorne did something selfless, as he always seems to have an ulterior motive. I shouldn&#39;t call it selfless anyways, because he said I owed him. Yup, can&#39;t say I didn&#39;t expect it. That man can&#39;t do something for someone without expecting something in return. At least Mia is safe and sound, and that&#39;s all that matters. When I asked her about the ordeal, she brushed me off, saying she needed some rest. We called her boss and he insisted Mia take some time off, that he heard about her kidnap, a kind and understanding man, and he&#39;s given her all the time she needs to recover from the trauma. She&#39;ll be taking some time off work to recharge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m determined to stay by Mia&#39;s side tomorrow, my concern for her safety overwhelming me. The thought of something happening to her again is unbearable, and I want to be there to offer what little support I can, even if it&#39;s just my presence. Admittedly, I&#39;m not equipped with any fighting skills, but I&#39;m willing to improvise and do whatever it takes to help her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s still hard to believe that those men were able to overpower her, given her impressive martial arts background. Mia&#39;s been practicing jiu jitsu since she was 8 years old and has mastered taekwondo, karate, and Kung Fu as well. She&#39;s a force to be reckoned with, and I know she wouldn&#39;t have gone down without a fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This experience has been a wake-up call for me, and I&#39;ve realized that I need to take my own self-defense seriously. Mia&#39;s been urging me to take up martial arts classes for ages, and now I&#39;m finally going to take the plunge. I&#39;ll have to research online to determine which style suits me best - perhaps something like Krav Maga or Brazilian jiu-jitsu. Whatever it is, I&#39;m ready to learn and become a stronger, more capable version of myself, for Mia&#39;s sake and my own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hate to admit that Caleb was right, but he was - we need to find a new place to stay. This apartment, chosen by Mia for its anonymity, no longer provides the safety and security we need. I&#39;m still puzzled about how they managed to locate her, given her father&#39;s efforts to erase her identity and keep her hidden after she decided to leave the criminal underworld and live a clean and decent life. It&#39;s chilling to think that they might have been tracking her family all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But for now, I&#39;ll put that thought aside and focus on my plan to convince Caleb to let me stay home. I&#39;ll use his own words to persuade him, but I&#39;ll wait until tomorrow, considering he must be exhausted from the ordeal of rescuing Mia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I drift off to sleep, I whisper a promise to myself: &#34;I won&#39;t let anything happen to you, Mia. I&#39;ll do whatever it takes to keep you safe.&#34; The weight of that responsibility settles in, but I&#39;m determined to honor that promise, no matter what it takes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Girl I am obsessed with your hair! It gets so big and frizzy when it&#39;s wet. It&#39;s like a whole different entity!&#34; Mia gushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed and rolled my eyes at her fan-girling, &#34;Yeah, and it&#39;s a real pain to deal with. If I don&#39;t figure out how to tame the frizz, I&#39;ll be walking around looking like I stuck my finger in a socket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your hair is like a wild child, unlike mine which always looks like a limp, lifeless rag. I mean, don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s pretty and all, but it&#39;s just so... straight.&#34; Mia chuckled and teased as I smiled and continued brushing my hair. &#34;You think you&#39;d trade your hair for mine, Ammie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way, Jose! I may not love the frizz, but I wouldn&#39;t give up my curly locks for anything. I love my hair, frizz and all. It&#39;s a part of who I am, and I wouldn&#39;t change it for the world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia grinned, &#34;I guess that&#39;s what makes your hair so special, it&#39;s got character. Mine&#39;s just... meh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, someone&#39;s got to represent the curly-haired squad, and it might as well be me!&#34; I playfully tossed my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This morning, everything feels back to normal, like yesterday&#39;s events never occurred. The atmosphere is cheerful, birds are singing their hearts out, the sky is a brilliant blue, and the usual hustle and bustle of the city is in full swing. It&#39;s almost as if the world has moved on, leaving yesterday&#39;s worries behind. But I know I can&#39;t avoid the topic forever. Eventually, I&#39;ll need to muster up the courage to ask Mia about what happened, even if it means disrupting this peaceful morning vibe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uhh, aren&#39;t you going to work today?&#34; Mia drawled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paused a bit before realization dawned on me. &#34;Shit. Shit shit shit. I&#39;m so dead&#34;. I hurriedly grabbed my phone off the bed. I can&#39;t believe I forgot to call Caleb and get his permission to stay off work. Well, not exactly stay off work, just stay with my best friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning sir&#34; I said putting the phone to my ear, a little shiver creeping into my tone at the last minute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it this time&#34; he drawled sounding bored and tired. I could even feel him roll his eyesthat&#39;s if he does such a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted to ask you if I could stay off today. You know, to go look for a new apartment&#34; I asked with all the sweetness I could muster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure, whatever. Whenever you return, you&#39;ll just have double work anyways&#34; he sounded so done talking to me. I wasn&#39;t surprised though, I hated him as much as he hated me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait a minutedid he actually let me stay off work? I&#39;m shocked. Are you sure he hasn&#39;t been kidnapped by aliens and been replaced with a clone that only had his bad attitude and not his evil soul? If that&#39;s the case, kudos aliens for a job well done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia, I have to ask, what really went down yesterday?&#34; I finally mustered the courage to inquire, knowing I wouldn&#39;t be able to bring it up later. Until now, she&#39;s been putting on a brave face for me and everyone else, but in this moment, I saw the vulnerable Mia who was traumatized by her ordeal. She began shaking and looked terrified, like she was expecting them to come get her again.</p>
