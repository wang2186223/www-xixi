                <p>Amaris&#39; POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled over in the courtyard staring at the familiar neatly trimmed boxwood hedges outlining the property and vibrant hydrangea bushes adding a burst of color to the walkway. I told myself that I was going to call my mum so we could catch up later but nothing was better than seeing her face to face and giving her a tight hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grab everything?&#34; I turned to Mia as I got down from the car. She also wanted to see my mum since it had been a while and decided to tag along. I had already given Caleb a two weeks notice before today and he surprisingly gave me a day off. He had been unusually generous lately in the most unexpected ways and it was beginning to be concerning but I&#39;d worry about that later. Right now....I just wanted to spend time with my mum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah..&#34; Mia nodded as she stepped down from the car. Mia had a car too but she didn&#39;t like driving so she just tagged along with me if I was going in the same direction with her or took a cab. I suggested selling her car but she blatantly refused saying that her dad was going to murder her if she sold her car. I also had other suggestions in mind like letting me drive her car but that&#39;d wait until we got back home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After we slammed the door shut and mounted the small flight of stairs we found ourselves on the porch standing in front of the door. We exchanged glances since none of us made the first move and decided to knock. I hadn&#39;t told my mum I was coming so she was probably in her room sleeping or in the kitchen making something or who knows....maybe she wasn&#39;t even at home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chances were slim though but I had to admit the house was eerily quiet, as though the very air itself was holding its breath. If I didn&#39;t grow up here, I would have sworn that we were at the wrong house. Mia nodded towards the door as she held her purse in her hands. &#34;It&#39;s your house.&#34; She was right. It was my house. It was only normal that I was the one to do the knocking. It&#39;s not like I had some stupid falling out with my mother anyway so there was nothing to be worried about and yet why did my heart skip two beats as the door inched open with a low creak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cassie!&#34; My jaw slightly dropped as I threw my arms around my little sister. She wasn&#39;t supposed to be home until next week so I hadn&#39;t expected to see her here. I could tell she was also shocked to see me because it took her a few seconds before she returned my hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ari?&#34; She lingered in the hug securing her arms around my waist before she slowly pulled away. &#34;What are you doing here?&#34; She asked with a confused smile. Her gaze then shifted to Mia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should be asking you that.&#34; A laugh rumbled in my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia!&#34; She threw her arms around her as Mia returned the hug. &#34;It&#39;s been so long.&#34; She let out a low giggle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cassie? What the hell is going on over....&#34; Mum stopped in her tracks when she saw Mia and I standing at the door. Her fingers were still wrapped around the stair rails when a smile slowly spread across my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey mum.&#34; I waved beaming at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mouth dropped open but it didn&#39;t stop her from smiling as she walked down the stairs. &#34;Ari? Is that you?&#34; She closed the distance between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Flesh and blood.&#34; I spread out my arms ready for a hug. A soft moan left my lips as I inhaled her familiar scent again. She smelt like jasmine and lavender, a delicate fragrance that was as gentle as her demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long has it been?&#34; She pulled away....her pretty smile still plastered on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Three months I think?&#34; Cassie&#39;s voice rang from behind me. I tapped my chin looking upwards. Was it up to three months? Or was it more than that? Whatever it was, it didn&#39;t matter right now because we were together again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pretty much I guess.&#34; I shrugged my shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia....&#34; Mum&#39;s smile widened when she spotted Mia behind Cassie. &#34;Oh my gosh, I didn&#39;t see you there.&#34; She moved towards her, enveloping her in a warm hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay, Mrs. Carter.&#34; She pulled away after letting the hug linger for a few moments. &#34;This....&#34; She gestured around us. &#34;....is not my moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean it&#39;s not your moment?&#34; Mum said, giving her a small shove on her shoulders. &#34;And you...&#34; she turned to Cassie. &#34;Why didn&#39;t you tell them to come in?&#34; She said opening the door wider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was going to.&#34; She whined, planting her hands on her waist. &#34;But we were so caught up in the hugging and the....&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuses, excuses.&#34; Mum let out an exasperated sigh as she rested her hands on the small of our backs pushing us inside gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not giving excuses.&#34; She spread out her arms as her brows dipped into a frown. I wasn&#39;t even home for up to ten minutes and I was already reminded of the old days. My lips twisted into a sad smile as I imagined how things would have been if our father would have been here. Mum was pregnant with Cassie when he passed away so Cassie didn&#39;t get to meet him. I wondered how she must have felt....never meeting your father...all because of some stupid thugs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey...what&#39;s wrong?&#34; Mia gently shoved my shoulders pulling me out of my thoughts. Mum had gone into the kitchen to get us something which I guessed was one of her signature recipes from the delicious aroma wafting around the house, a delicious reminder of the love and comfort I&#39;d been missing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing. What makes you think something&#39;s wrong?&#34; I asked, trying to play dumb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t act smart with me.&#34; She whispered pointing at me. Cassie had also followed mum into the kitchen so it was just the two of us in the living room but Mia still decided to speak in hushed tones. &#34;I know when you&#39;re hiding something.&#34; She was right, sometimes it helped and sometimes it didn&#39;t. No matter how hard I tried to cover up the truth she&#39;d always find out....I guess that was why she was a detective and being her best friend meant I had to suffer all of that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry,&#34; I batted her hand away. &#34;We&#39;ll talk about it later.&#34; She frowned. We were definitely not talking about it later. And she knew that but she just decided to let it go since mum and Cassie were already coming into the room with silver trays in their hands. The heat rose in waves wafting away from the freshly baked cookies. The aroma of the vanilla and chocolate chips was both soothing and appetizing. Memories of Mum, Cassie and I in the kitchen covered in floor while we laughed our hearts out flooded my mind and I couldn&#39;t stop the fuzzy feeling in my heart from spreading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here....have some.&#34; Mum dropped the tray on the coffee table in the center of the living room and Cassie followed. Mia and I both grabbed a cookie from the tray, taking a huge bite as we munched on it together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mmmm,&#34; a satisfied moan left our lips as we slumped into the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So good.&#34; Mia&#39;s voice came out in muffled tones as she spoke with the cookies still in her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re even better than before.&#34; I grinned, earning two bright smiles from both mum and Cassie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew you&#39;d like them.&#34; Mum said as Cassie reached for a cookie and mum batted her hand away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey....I helped in making them too.&#34; She whined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve had enough cookies for today.&#34; She frowned at her as she pouted. The room was silent for a while before we all bursted into laughter. I hadn&#39;t realized how much I had missed my mum until now. I was always so busy that I didn&#39;t have time to visit but now....I was going to enjoy every second of it.</p>
