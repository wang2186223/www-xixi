                <p>Amaris&#39; POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean you forgot something at the office?&#34; Mia frowned, finally lifting her gaze from her phone as my eyes still remained fixed on the road. We were just returning from mum&#39;s place after spending most of the day catching up. We literally talked about everything...well not everything, we definitely couldn&#39;t tell them that we were kidnapped a few weeks ago unless they&#39;ll start overreacting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Mia and I talked about work, Cassie talked about school and how she was trying her best to maintain her good grades since she was graduating really soon. Mum also told about how the family business had been doing well recently and we were all really glad to hear that. We were sad the day had to come to an end...we all had our own lives now. We were all adults with our own responsibilities, and we couldn&#39;t just do anything we liked without considering the possible consequences though we ended up coming up with an agreement. We decided that we should meet at least once every two months so we can catch up.....the day wasn&#39;t even over and I was already looking forward to our next visit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s my favorite lipgloss.&#34; I lifted my shoulders in a half shrug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you want to go back?!&#34; Mia&#39;s eyes bulged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia relax.....&#34; I let out an exasperated sigh. &#34;We literally have to pass that route before we head home so it&#39;s a win-win. I get my lipgloss back and we get home on time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just know you have to be quick about it.&#34; Mia grumbled as the car halted sharply and pulled into a space right in front of the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will be quick about it.&#34; A laugh rumbled in my chest as I closed the door shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Chloe,&#34; I waved at Chloe before stepping into the mirrored elevator, my reflection following me as I punched in the number for the floor which my office was on. The door slid shut and I felt the hum of the elevator as it smoothly lifted me upward. As I glanced at the window, I couldn&#39;t help but frown as I thought about the possible scenarios that could play out once I reached my floor. Caleb&#39;s office was also on my floor and the last thing I wanted was to bump into him but as usual the gate was always so cruel to me so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if I actually bumped into him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the elevator reached my floor I scrolled out approaching the door to my office with the key in my hands. I didn&#39;t want to bring my purse when I just needed my key...it&#39;s not like I was going to spend up to a minute here. I was about to place the key in the lock when I noticed something odd. The door.....wasn&#39;t locked. Why was the door not locked? I always remembered to lock it whenever I was leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wrapped my fingers around the door handle, still confused and was about to push it open when I heard hushed noises coming from inside the office. The fuck? I lifted a brow pushing the door open. My eyes wandered around before resting on two familiar bodies....on my freaking chair? I couldn&#39;t see their faces since the woman was facing away from me and she also blocked the man&#39;s face but her long brown curls gave away her identity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the freaking hell?!&#34; I wrinkled my nose in disgust as I moved forward, closing the distance between us. &#34;Are you two fucking kidding me?!&#34; I slashed my hand through the air. I opened my mouth to speak again but no words came out....everything was just so...so...I didn&#39;t even know what word to describe whatever was happening here. &#34;In my office...&#34; I raised my brows still trying to process the drama unfolding before me. &#34;There was no other place for you two to make out so you had to do it in my. Freaking. Office?!&#34; I squinted my eyes, shaking my head slowly. I was the one speaking but I was still the confused one....none of this was making any sense. I glanced at Kiara who scurried off Caleb&#39;s lap with an apologetic look on her face before shifting my gaze to the man who probably planned all of this to piss me off. He had a smug expression on his face as he sat on my chair with his legs spread out. What an asshole?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out an exasperated sigh as I glanced around. &#34;Look Mr. Thorne...&#34; I drawled planting one of my hands on my hips. I didn&#39;t care what I called him anymore....at this point he was just crossing boundaries and invading my privacy and it was so fucking annoying so yeah....if he didn&#39;t want me to call him Mr. Thorne...that was exactly what I was going to call him. &#34;I understand that you hate me...&#34; I began. &#34;...and I can assure you that the feeling is incredibly mutual.&#34; I said lifting my chin an inch higher. I could&#39;ve sworn I saw the corners of his mouth lift up, but he flattened them down so fast I wasn&#39;t sure anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But this....&#34; I gestured towards Kiara. &#34;....this is just wrong and...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What makes you think I care?&#34; He asked, lifting a brow as he crossed one of his legs over the other....on my freaking chair. God, someone give me a knife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gritted my teeth before exhaling. &#34;Well Mr. Thorne...&#34; I spoke in a rather cheery tone as I walked closer to my desk, resting my arms on them. &#34;I know you don&#39;t care about what I think...&#34; I said picking my lipgloss from my desk organizer. I twisted it between my fingers as I raised it to the light. I then dropped my arm to the table. &#34;...I mean if you did care about me I&#39;d be incredibly disgusted.&#34; A smile crept up my lips as his grimace deepened. I had to admit pissing him off did make me happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure you would.&#34; He said with a dull expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amaris...&#34; Kiara called and I shifted my gaze to her. &#34;I&#39;m really sorry about...all of this.&#34; She pressed her lips together. &#34;I mean...we were just caught up in the moment and...&#34; My attention began to drift away as I tuned out her words. Did she just say we? I spun my head around meeting Caleb&#39;s piercing gaze and for some reason I suddenly felt self conscious but I didn&#39;t show him that I just averted his gaze as casually as I could, just in time to hear the last part of Kiara&#39;s apology. &#34;...and for that I&#39;m really sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay... I&#39;m not mad that you two are making out,&#34; the words lingered in my tongue and I couldn&#39;t help but shudder at the thought of it. &#34;You just...you can do it anywhere else okay? This is my personal space.&#34; I told her. I was surprised that Caleb wasn&#39;t saying or doing anything to annoy me. I mean he just sat there staring at me with an inscrutable expression on his face. What the hell was he thinking about?</p>
