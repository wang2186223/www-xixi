                <p>Amaris&#39; POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you just....interrupt me?&#34; He asked, his voice strained with rage as my eyes darted between him and the open doors. He then moved towards the door, giving the door closed button a firm press causing the doors to slide shut. He then spun around, facing me. I&#39;m screwed. &#34;I asked you a question.&#34; I&#39;m definitely screwed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then closed the distance between us in two strides and my throat bobbed with a hard swallow. He fixed me with a stern gaze, his voice icy and controlled. The only reason I talked over him in the first place was clearly because I was certain I would&#39;ve been out of the elevator by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen here, doll. I&#39;m a man of respect. You do not toy with me and get away with it. Do you understand?&#34; *What the fuck did he just call me?* Doll?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I tried to protests, he grabbed my chin, his grip firm but not painful. He then pushed me back against the cold wall again, his body pressing against mine, a silent threat hanging in the air. &#34;Just because I haven&#39;t punished you yet doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m going to spare you.&#34; His grip around my chin tightened. My lips parted and my chest heaved as I tried to steady my breathing. His gaze then dropped to my lips and just when I thought he was about to kiss me he pushed me against the wall causing me to bang my head. Hard. I winced as I slid to the ground. &#34;Never interrupt me ever again or else....&#34; He paused before turning to the elevator doors. My head was lowered so all I could see was his feet but I did hear the door slide open. &#34;You&#39;ll regret it.&#34; I lifted my head just in time to see him leave but gosh my head was killing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I always assumed Caleb was the type of man who didn&#39;t hurt women unless they were in the bedroom so I thought I was safe which was why I had the courage to talk back all these times but now...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached for the back of my head tapping it gently as it throbbed from the impact. Thankfully there was no blood. I struggled to push myself up, it was useless waiting for someone to come help me....this was Caleb&#39;s floor. Yes my office was also here but apart from me no one else stayed on this floor so there was no need for me to wait. I stumbled as I moved out of the elevator but before I could fall I grabbed onto the doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now I understand why people call him a monster, he was a heartless asshole. A cowards ass jerk. Gosh I wish Mia were here. He won&#39;t let me quit and he won&#39;t fire me no matter what I do. I should just stop trying because the more I try the more reasons he&#39;ll have to punish and I can&#39;t keep going through this. Mia was right....maybe I should just ignore him, no matter how much he gets on my nerves or no matter how annoying he is. I was almost at my office when I tripped on my own foot and would&#39;ve fallen face flat if it wasn&#39;t for the hard body standing in front of me. I couldn&#39;t tell who he was since my head was clogged and my vision was blurred and for some reason I was hearing a whistling sound. Maybe it was probably because of my head injury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gosh I need to get myself checked and why does this person feel so familiar. Was it Caleb? No he&#39;ll never come back for me and this definitely didn&#39;t smell like him. But what if it is him. What if he&#39;s the one holding me and....</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without giving it any more thoughts I pushed the stranger away and turned to my office. I was hearing a faint voice calling out to me but I ignored it, since it wasn&#39;t loud I was probably imagining it. I was reaching my table when I stumbled and I was sure I was going to hit the ground but I felt someone wrap his arm around me. Then it clicked. No wonder that perfume smells so familiar. It was him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amaris, are you okay? Why aren&#39;t you saying anything?&#34; I heard a worried voice ring out, it was difficult to make out what he was saying because of the whistling sound in my ear and my blurry vision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine...&#34; I winced. &#34;I just hit my head...it&#39;s no biggie. I just need to take painkillers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You hit your head, stumbled on your own feet twice and you&#39;re telling me it&#39;s no biggie? What do you think I am? Ten? You need to go to the hospital.&#34; I felt his grip tighten around me as he guided me towards the door again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Beck. I don&#39;t need to go to any hospital....&#34; I pointed towards my desk. &#34;Just help me get the painkillers from my....&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously Amaris, painkillers. Just forget about that and I promise I&#39;ll take you to the clinic and they&#39;ll get you checked and you&#39;ll be fine in no time.&#34; I heard him say, reassuring me. But the thing was I didn&#39;t want to go to the clinic, especially now that Caleb was angry, he&#39;ll never permit to leave. I didn&#39;t even want to tell Kian that Caleb was the one who hurt me. He was talking about a good reputation right? Now that I think about it....how on earth did he get here right just when I needed him. There&#39;s no way it could&#39;ve been another meet up could it? I moved towards my table and when Kian saw that I was serious about staying in my office he helped me to my chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; I asked, breaking the silence after I sat on my swivel chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; He asked furrowing his brows as he sat on my desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean why are you here? Don&#39;t you have work,&#34; I spoke softly to reduce the throbbing in my head. &#34;And don&#39;t tell me you came here to see Caleb. It&#39;s the fucking first day of the week, if you wanted to see him you would have done that yesterday.&#34; I told him as I lifted my head up to meet his gaze and his eyes glinted with mirth as he chuckled outloud and I couldn&#39;t help but notice the dimples on his cheek. I had to admit he was good looking. Really good looking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re very funny, you know that right.&#34; He said, still smiling. &#34;But if you must know.....I came to see you.&#34; The throbbing in my head was nothing compared to how my heart skipped. Did he just say he came to see me?!</p>
