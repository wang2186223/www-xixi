                <p>Amaris&#39; POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on Ammie, you know I hate dancing alone.&#34; Mia pouted as she tugged on my wrist gesturing for us to head towards the dancefloor. I had promised her that I was going to go clubbing with her one of these days. I even had to talk to Caleb so I could lie about a family emergency. Even with hearing it was a family emergency he still hesitated before letting me go. What an asshole. &#34;Just come dance with me.&#34; Her lips twisted into a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia...&#34; I wailed. She knew perfectly well that I wasn&#39;t the dancing type....I only danced in our bedroom in front of the mirror and on top of that she wanted me to dance in the middle of a club where everyone could see me. No way. &#34;You already dragged me here with you. Isn&#39;t that enough?&#34; I pulled away from her grip before resting my hand on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh come on...so you&#39;re telling me you wanted to stay back home....&#34; She rolled her eyes. I pressed my lips in a thin line before raising my shoulders in a half shrug. &#34;Then what was the point of lying to your boss in the first place?&#34; Her frown deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw dropped instantly as her words reached my ears. &#34;Oh my God Mia. Shut up.&#34; My eyes darted around searching for any familiar face in the crowd. &#34;Someone could hear you,&#34; I spoke in hushed tones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh please.&#34; She waved off my comment like she would do to a fly before crossing her arms over her chest. &#34;So you&#39;re trying to tell me that your boss has superhuman hearing and can hear us from a million miles away.&#34; She said in a histrionic tone as I let out an exasperated sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop being dramatic.&#34; I said resting my chin in my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or wait....he could be a vampire.&#34; I narrowed my eyes into thin venomous slits as I glared at her. &#34;Okay I&#39;ll shut up now.&#34; She mirrored my position. Just then the waitress approached us with a bright smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry I&#39;m late....we have an important guest here tonight so we&#39;re doing everything we can to impress him.&#34; She said, a bit out of breath. Considering the fact that we&#39;d been here for almost ten minutes, it was completely normal for her to apologize.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry about that.&#34; I smiled back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We completely understand.&#34; Mia said, picking up the menu.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What would you like to have?&#34; She asked, clicking the top of her pen as she held out her little book. Mia glanced at the menu before lifting her head with her brows raised. She was probably waiting for me to say something before she picked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Champagne?&#34; I lifted my shoulders in a half shrug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then turned towards the waitress, &#34;A bottle of Veuve Clicquot please.&#34; She beamed at the waitress as she jotted it down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything else,&#34; she clicked her pen again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No thanks.&#34; We chorused before she turned on her heel heading towards the bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But seriously Ammie&#34; she began resting her chin on her hand. &#34;...I&#39;m bored and I don&#39;t wanna go out there alone.&#34; She pointed towards the dance floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then find a partner.&#34; I said in a rather cheery tone as her eyes lit up. She was about to speak when I held up my finger, silencing her. &#34;One that&#39;s not me.&#34; Her smile contorted into a scowl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So now you expect me to go around flirting with every guy in the club just because I&#39;m looking for a dance partner.&#34; She curled a brow as a small smile crept up my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t say that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you meant it.&#34; She countered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ugh.&#34; My lips parted as I was taken aback by her reply. &#34;There&#39;s no reason for you to be mad at me or anything.&#34; I showed her my palms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not mad at you....I&#39;m just....&#34; She paused searching for the right word to use. &#34;I&#39;m just disappointed that you&#39;d rather sit here and watch other people have fun than dance with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Awwwn,&#34; I purred. &#34;That&#39;s cute.&#34; I teased wiggling my eyebrows as she let out a low groan causing me to giggle. Her frown suddenly twisted into a huge smirk as she looked over my shoulders and I was about following her gaze when she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Ammie....&#34; Her smirk widened. &#34;Look behind you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34; I blinked rapidly before following her gaze to meet a pair of dark eyes staring at me. His lips curled up the second he noticed I was actually looking at him. I didn&#39;t stare for long though but it was enough to notice his features. Blonde hair, hazel eyes judging from the way he was slouching he was probably 6&#39;1.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That guy&#39;s checking you out.&#34; She batted her lashes with a smug look on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah so....&#34; I hadn&#39;t told Mia how Kian offered me a ride home a few days ago and said I could call him by his name which was probably why she wanted me to set me up with this blondie. She would probably freak if I told her and now was definitely not the right time. Maybe when we get back. &#34;...do you want me to go flirt with him now?&#34; I drawled with air quotes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take a chance on him.&#34; She leaned back in her seat. &#34;Who knows....things might actually work out.&#34; She pursed her lips. I hadn&#39;t had a boyfriend ever since Eric and Mia knew that. It took me almost two years to completely get over Eric, I couldn&#39;t bear losing another person I loved so I just gave up on dating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not ready to date.&#34; I rolled her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mhmmm.&#34; She crossed her arms over her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here&#39;s your drink...&#34; We were so busy talking about the guy checking me out that we didn&#39;t even notice the waitress approach us. We snapped our heads towards her at the same time flashing her weird smiles. &#34;...and here are your glasses.&#34; She dropped two goblets on the table pulling out the cork from the glass before pouring the wine into both glasses. She then gave us a slight nod before heading towards other tables to take their orders. It was a miracle that Mia and I were able to hear each other without yelling but we still had to speak over our regular tones though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; I yelled before she completely disappeared into the dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You haven&#39;t had a boyfriend since....him.&#34; she hesitated before speaking. She reached for the bottle of &#34;It&#39;s high time you move on.&#34; She wrapped her fingers around one of the glasses, lifting it to her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have moved on.&#34; I grabbed the second glass. &#34;I just don&#39;t want to be in another relationship yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been four years Ammie.&#34; She said, her tone laced with concern. I quickly grabbed the opportunity to shift gears, there was nothing I hated more than discussing my love life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re one to talk.&#34; I said before taking another sip from my glass. This was my first time tasting this brand and I had to admit it was good. &#34;All you do is go clubbing and flirt with every guy you meet. You&#39;ve never actually been serious about a guy before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a loud gasp as she placed her hand on her chest. &#34;That is not true.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a small laugh as my glass hovered over my lips. &#34;Okay then...tell me.&#34; I told her. &#34;When was the last time you went on a date with a guy and didn&#39;t have sex with him afterwards?&#34; A smirk formed on my lips as I waited for her answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened her mouth to speak but paused afterwards. She then closed them around her glass taking another sip. &#34;See...&#34; I raised my glass pointing them towards her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well if you&#39;re allowed to not be in a relationship then I won&#39;t be in a relationship either.&#34; This time I let out a loud chuckle. I would have attracted a lot of attention to myself if the music wasn&#39;t so loud that it drowned out my laughter. I then shook my head slowly as I wiped a tear out of my eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re hilarious.&#34; I leaned back. I was happy with myself that I succeeded in changing the topic. I wasn&#39;t ready to be in a relationship yet....the truth was....I had gotten over Eric a long time ago but I was too scared....scared that I&#39;ll get hurt again.</p>
