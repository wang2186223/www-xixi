                <p>Amaris&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking out of the doors of the building, I made my way towards my car. I couldn&#39;t help stomping a few times on the way just to let go of the rage that kept rising in me. Getting into my car, I put my hands on the steering wheel and take deep breaths to try calming myself down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I drive out of the building, but I can&#39;t drive what just happened in there out of my mind. &#34;Arrrgh&#34; I grunt out pounding my fist on the steering wheel. I can&#39;t believe I let him get to me like that, I just sat there and let him spew those maggoty words out of his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t yell at me or do anything remotely scary, but his aura was enough to shut me up, which is really strange. I&#39;m not the type of girl that crouches down and whimpers when being intimidated by a guy, that&#39;s such a Mia thing to do. Normally, that&#39;s when I act tougher, but things were really different in there with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I enter the apartment, Mia rushes to me. I sigh and roll my eyes throwing my bag onto the couch. Taking a seat, I fling those godforsaken shoes off my feet. Mia had paused when she saw my expression but now she was walking towards me with compassion written all over her face. She probably thinks I didn&#39;t get the job, honestly, I feel like it would have been better if I didn&#39;t get the job. I don&#39;t think I can work with that man as my boss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;d it go? I saw your text&#34; she said in a soft tone, referring to the text I sent to her when my car was getting fixed about how I&#39;m going to be late and probably lose the job.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing as I didn&#39;t reply, she concludes in her mind that I didn&#39;t get the job. &#34;It&#39;s fine, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll still find another job. You really...... we really thought this was the one, I&#39;m really sorry you didn&#39;t get it&#34; she said pulling me in for a hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not why I&#39;m this way&#34; I pulled out of her hug and gesture towards my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? Then why are you like this&#34; she said, emphasizing on the &#39;are&#39; with a confused expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m like this, because I got the job&#34; I say, flailing my arms, my voice rising an octave higher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You seemed genuinely excited for this job so......what exactly happened&#34; she squinted her eyes, something she was fond of doing whenever she was deep in thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could swear I heard the screws turning in her head, playing out every possible scenario of what might have happened to me in there. To satiate her curiosity, I begin narrating what happened; from the coffee incident, to finding out he was the boss and finally to how he put fear in me when he began giving me those silly rules.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, he got to you? That&#39;s crazy. No one ever gets to you, so how&#39;s that possible? He sounds like a nasty person&#34; she said in a hushed tone as if we were saying something forbidden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He is a nasty person&#34; I rebutted, adding emphasis on the &#39;is&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you never know what might come out of this office relationship. I mean, he said you&#39;d be working as his personal secretary, right? Well, what if this turns into something else&#34; she said softly, a dreamy faraway look in her eyes, like she was actually picturing it happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning around, she sees my nose all scrunched up in disgust and rolls her eyes. &#34;You&#39;ll still fall in love someday, you know, and when that time comes, you won&#39;t be able to keep yourself from falling. I promise you that.&#39;&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anyways, when are you starting?&#34; she asked, her eyes lingering on her phone a little while before she looks up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I thought I&#39;d already mentioned that,&#34; I say thinking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I don&#39;t think you mentioned it&#34; she shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I&#39;m resuming tomorrow&#34; I say calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What!! That&#39;s not right, you should be given time to prepare&#34; I watched her expression shift from shock to anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s exactly what I said &#34; I butt in, &#34;anyways, that reminds me. He&#39;s supposed to send me a letter containing his precious dress code.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You shouldn&#39;t think about that. Most companies do it, so it&#39;s not really a bad thing&#34; she followed behind me. &#34;By the way, how much is your pay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh shit. I didn&#39;t ask about that. I&#39;ll ask tomorrow or some other time, I just hope the pay is worth it&#34; I sat on the bed and opened my laptop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I refreshed my mail and as expected, the mail hopped in. &#34;They&#39;ve sent in the mail&#34; I notified Mia as she began scooting in. Basically, the dress code was midi skirts, midi dresses, all clothing must be formal and..... Oh, these fuckers. Heels are compulsory, and it must be covered toed heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess you have to get used to putting on heels now,&#34; Mia laughed as I scoffed and rolled my eyes. Almost immediately, another mail jumps in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh. My. God&#34; I said with my eyes wide open and a smile playing on my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Mia asked, her eyes wide as she moved towards the closet to help me sort out an outfit for tomorrow. &#34;Oh come on.  Say something&#34; she whined when I didn&#39;t answer her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, come see for yourself &#34; I squeal as she runs towards where I&#39;m seated on the bed. &#34;They sent me my work schedule, and it contains the amount I&#39;m to be paid monthly &#39;&#39; I said pointing to where it was written.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Five thousand dollars?&#34; she squealed in shock and excitement as we both started jumping and screaming in excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shhh. Let&#39;s keep it down, before our annoying neighbor comes knocking at our door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went to bed with a huge smile on my face, I think the only mistake I made was not reading the work schedule that was sent alongside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, we have to double up so we don&#39;t run late&#34; Mia yelled over at me seeing as I was still straightening my hair. I had really wavy hair, so usually I straighten it and put it in soft curls so it&#39;d look better. The process usually took about thirty minutes, but today I was trying to get it done in half the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I hurriedly squeezed myself into my dress, I thought about how the day would go and how good it would feel to actually be working.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia stood at the door hurrying me on as I put on my heels. She has her own car so she could as well leave me, but being the good friend she is, she made sure we were going to leave together. I didn&#39;t even get the chance to look at my reflection in the mirror, I was actually kind of worried that I didn&#39;t look good in the dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dress I had on was a navy blue long sleeved dress with a sweetheart neckline. I paired it with black stilettos and a black bag, accessorized with gold jewelry. The company insisted on light makeup, so, already having flawless skin, I just applied a little bit of powder, mascara, winged liner and a nude lipstick. I was never one for much makeup, so this wasn&#39;t a problem to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saying goodbye to my best friend, I get in the car and zoom off. I was late yesterday and I don&#39;t intend on being late again today so I didn&#39;t want to take any chances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thoughts of what I would do today ran through my mind. I didn&#39;t know what to expect but I was really excited, I had even forgotten about the incident that happened yesterday with Mr Thorne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Halfway through my journey, I check the time. I&#39;m supposed to be signed in at 7:00 sharp and it was presently 6:37. I guess I&#39;m going to be on time after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking out of my car, I make my way into the building. I press the call button on the elevator and wait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello&#34; I said to the lady in the elevator. She looked to be in her mid 30s and she had on a nice pantsuit. She looked so classy and beautiful, unconsciously, I straightened my back and changed my demeanor to match hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi&#34; she said with a smile, &#34;I haven&#39;t seen you here before. Are you new?&#34; she asked in a British accent, which just adds more class to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I&#39;m the new personal secretary to the boss. My name is Amaris, Amaris Carter&#34; I say bringing my palm out for a shake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, my name is Megan. If you need anything, you could ask for me. I&#39;m the operations manager for this unit&#34; she smiled, shaking my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the elevator comes to an abrupt stop. &#34;Good luck on your first day&#34; she says as she goes out of the elevator. I&#39;m now alone again as I continue up to the penthouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting into my assigned office, I put my bag on the table, I take a deep breath and heave a huge sigh of satisfaction. Looking around, I break out a huge smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The office was not big but it wasn&#39;t small either. It has a nice dark wooden table at one end with my own personal swivel chair. I bite back a scream as I sit and twirl around on the chair. On the table, there&#39;s a computer system and some file books. Spinning around again, I take in the snow white walls of the office, not noticing the man standing at the door, staring at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34; I hear a growl from the doorway. I almost dropped to the ground in fear at the intensity of the voice, breaking me out of my reverie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uhh, good morning Mr Thorne &#34; I say hurriedly getting up from the chair and putting my head down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll refer to me as &#39;sir&#39;&#34; he said in a manner that called for no objections. &#34;And get to work, there are some appointments I need you to reschedule for me. It&#39;s all in there&#34; he pointed to a file on the table I didn&#39;t notice was there before and left shutting the door behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh in realization of the fact that working with Mr Thorne isn&#39;t going to be easy. I met him only once before and I already detest him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Things don&#39;t seem so bad right now though. Or is it just the calm before the storm??</p>
