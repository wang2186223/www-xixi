                <p>Amaris&#39; POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried hiding my suspicion as I peered at him with a scrutinizing look. What the hell was he up to now? &#34;Yes I am,&#34; I answered in the most casual way that I could, locking eyes with him. If there was something I learnt after working for Caleb for the past few months, it was that he loved intimidating and making people inferior. Well unfortunately for him he hired me to be his secretary....personal secretary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright....&#34; He said approaching my desk. &#34;Let me see it.&#34; He walked behind me bending over as he fixed his eyes on my computer screen before shifting his gaze to me and our faces were inches apart but my calm demeanor didn&#39;t waiver, in stark contrast to the raging storm of emotions brewing inside of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you staring at me like that?&#34; I lifted a brow fighting the urge to swallow. I could literally feel the smell of his cologne and aftershave filling up my senses. An amused glint flickered in his eyes as his lips inched up into a fraction of a smirk before he squashed it immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t tell me you don&#39;t know what to do?&#34; He spoke, causing my gaze to drop to his lips. I didn&#39;t know if it was just me or they looked more plump and fuller today. Focus Ammie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell are you talking about?&#34; My brows dipped into a frown as I gave his face another once over. This was the first time I was actually this close to him and I couldn&#39;t help but wonder why I never noticed how pretty his eyes were. His eyes were a captivating mix of darkness and beauty with a depth that seemed to stretch on forever, just staring into them could make you.....</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you&#39;re just going to sit there and watch your boss stand,&#34; He said, interrupting my thoughts as he pulled away standing up straight, his gaze towering over me as his lips twisted into a scowl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got up from my chair stepping aside, giving him the chance to sit on my chair. &#34;I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll want the answer to that question,&#34; I scoffed with a smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As his eyes roamed through the screen I couldn&#39;t help sneaking a glance at his face and he actually looked....impressed? Hold up. Something definitely wasn&#39;t right, how could Caleb be impressed with my work? I expected him to be yelling and frowning at me right now but he wasn&#39;t, which was really weird. I felt a little smile creeping onto my face. It was a small win, but hey, it felt good to know that he appreciated my hard work. I still couldn&#39;t shake off the feeling that something was off though but since I couldn&#39;t see any other suspicious thing other than his odd behavior I decided to shrug it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood in front of my table so I could see what he was doing. The only things I could see and hear were the dim light reflecting from the computer screen and the faint sounds coming from the keyboard. Wait a second, faint sounds? Coming from the keyboard? Just then Caleb&#39;s eyebrows shot up, it was more of an amused expression than a shocked one. &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; I questioned but he didn&#39;t say a word, instead he just kept staring at the screen and I couldn&#39;t help but wonder what could have caused the sudden change in his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is everything okay?&#34; I spoke, my tone laced with a bit of concern as I craned my neck trying to look over the screen. I wanted to go behind him and see whatever he was looking at  but I didn&#39;t know if he considered that &#34;disrespectful.&#34; Nothing was ever normal when dealing with Caleb Thorne. My mind raced with countless possibilities, did I mess up his schedule? Did I mix up his appointments? Whatever happened, it was for the better, right? He&#39;d finally fire me and I&#39;d get to leave this place, right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t wait anymore, I quickly circled my desk so I stood behind him and my jaw dropped when I saw the empty files on the screen. &#34;What happened?&#34; I asked taking the mouse from him as I clicked on each and every file and they were all empty. &#34;What the fuck did you do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The amused look in his eye disappeared as the color drained out of his pupils, his eyes narrowing into venomous slits. &#34;Mind your language.&#34; *Did he just tell me to mind my language? After pulling off such a stunt?!*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took deep breaths trying to calm the raging fury inside of me but it wasn&#39;t working. &#34;What. Did. You do?&#34; I spoke through gritted teeth. I knew exactly what he did. I knew exactly why he did it. I just wanted him to admit it himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I might have accidentally deleted everything you did today,&#34; he said in a low tone as a smug smile crept up his lips. I allowed his words to sink into me for a few seconds as I relaxed them over and over in my head. Did he just say &#39;accidentally&#39;?*I clenched my fists as I suppressed the urge to wrap my hands around his neck. Not that I was actually going to succeed in choking him, I wasn&#39;t even sure if he was actually going to struggle but it was going to help me calm down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched him as he got up from the swivel chair before letting out another deep breath, &#34;There&#39;s no way you could have actually deleted everything with one click.&#34; I said my voice laced with disbelief as I turned to the laptop sitting on the empty chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who said I clicked once.&#34; His voice bounced off the glass walls. I threw my head back as I pinched the bridge of my nose trying to ease my frustration. I think it&#39;s safe to say that the only reason Caleb was sent to this world was to make my life a living nightmare. Then it hit me, I could recover everything from the cloud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nevermind, I&#39;ll just get it back from the cloud.&#34; I navigated through the computer with the mouse but my whole body froze the second I heard him speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I might have also deleted it from the cloud too.&#34; He said in a casual tone, like he had not just thrown four hours of work into the garbage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re kidding right?&#34; My eyes bulged as I stared at him leaning on my desk with his back to me. &#34;You didn&#39;t actually delete them from the cloud too?&#34; I asked, clicking on my mouse as I searched through the system. Nothing. All that time, all that effort I put into this, all of them just vanished in an instant and it was all his fault. I&#39;m pretty sure this was his payback for wearing pant suits to work. He really was a thorn in my flesh. As I thought going through all of that pain and stress all over again, I slumped in my chair placing my palm over my forehead. Just when I thought I was going to take a break.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re good at what you do. I meant to say that you&#39;re not bad, it&#39;s no big deal for you to start all over again....is it?&#34; Oh. My. God. He did not just say that to my face right now? How could someone be so mean and heartless?</p>
