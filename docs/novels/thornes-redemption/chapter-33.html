                <p>Caleb&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ended up arriving at Miranda&#39;s house in 30 minutes instead, all because of that excuse for a woman, Kiara. I don&#39;t know how she did it but she got into my car and before I realized it we were heading towards Miranda&#39;s place together. She kept insisting that we go home and spend time together...that woman is delusional. I can&#39;t believe she actually thinks I&#39;m in love with her. Me...love? Oh please.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to give her a bundle of cash before dropping her off at her place. She was still protesting when I drove off. A free ride home and free cash was more than enough from someone like me. The only reason I did all these things for her was because she came running whenever I called for her and as much as I knew that she only did that because she was freakin&#39; obsessed with me....she still earned herself a little bit of respect. But there was still a part of me...a huge part of me that would have enjoyed throwing her out of my car the second she stepped her foot inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caleb darling....you didn&#39;t have to come all the way here.&#34; She frowned, closing the door behind her as I walked in. &#34;You have work and...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay.&#34; I talked over her. &#34;I&#39;m not complaining.&#34; I spun around facing her. I sized her up...her skin was pale and she had dark circles under her eyes. Her hair which she usually tied in a neat bun was disheveled. &#34;What did the Doctor say?&#34; I clenched my fists before relaxing then again as I watched her walk towards one of the sofas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He didn&#39;t really say anything.&#34; She sat before she continued. &#34;He just took my blood pressure and pulse and did our normal routine.&#34; She leaned back into the chair, relaxing her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is your normal routine?&#34; I questioned. I wanted to know everything that happened at the hospital, I didn&#39;t want her leaving any detail out. She seemed startled by my question before letting out a light chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on Caleb, there&#39;s no need to worry about me...I&#39;ll be fine.&#34; I was about to protest but she put up her finger, silencing me. &#34;But since you want to know so badly I&#39;ll tell you. He also checked my weight and my height. Then he performed a physical exam....which as you know includes listening to my heart and lungs, examining my skin and eyes and checking for any more abnormalities. And there were none...&#34; She drawled. &#34;See like I&#39;ve been telling you. I&#39;m perfectly fine. There&#39;s no need for you to be here.&#34; She crossed her arms over her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small smile crept up my lips as I mirrored her gesture. &#34;So you&#39;re telling me there has to be a reason before I can come see my dear mother.&#34; I arched my brow playfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled getting up. &#34;Now I didn&#39;t say that, did I?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you meant it, didn&#39;t you?&#34; I narrowed my eyes into thin slits with a smile plastered on my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to go make something in the kitchen....you must be really hungry.&#34; She said switching gears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you dare change topics.&#34; I let out a mirthful laughter as I pointed at her. &#34;I asked you a question.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I&#39;m asking you one right now.&#34; She said walking into the kitchen as I followed. &#34;Are you hungry? Do you want me to make something for you?&#34; She asked putting on her apron before pulling out her hair tie, letting her long dark hair which was peppered with white strands fall to her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you keep staring at me like that I&#39;ll think you want to marry me Mr. Thorne.&#34; She drawled as the edge of my lips quirked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trust me if it was possible I would have married you a long time ago.&#34; I leaned against the door frame as I watched her tie her hair in a tighter bun. She let out a loud laugh when my words reached her ears. She probably thought I was joking...but there was nothing the truth was I was dead serious about what I had just said. Throughout my entire lifetime on this earth I had never seen anyone as kindhearted and selfless as she was....even my own mother didn&#39;t even care about me enough to spend time with me. All she did was dump me in Miranda&#39;s hands leaving her to raise her own child. Not that Miranda didn&#39;t do a good job...in fact she did an excellent job, she took care of me, made sure I got all the love I deserved and never ever treated me like I was someone else&#39;s child but I had to admit it would&#39;ve been nice if I got all that attention from my real mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh really.&#34; She said looking through the cupboards. Normally I wouldn&#39;t want to stress her in her condition but I was hungry and I did miss her cooking and it definitely wouldn&#39;t hurt if she just worked for a few minutes. &#34;But Honey, you know you&#39;re supposed to settle down very soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh no.&#34; I sighed pinching between my brows. &#34;Not this again.&#34; Miranda always kept pushing Kian and I to get married, telling us that she wasn&#39;t getting any younger. In order to please her and make her happy Kian started dating again even though the only thing he ever used women for was to satisfy sexual urges. On the contrary, I didn&#39;t even think of trying....yes I wanted to please her but I just couldn&#39;t. Especially when every woman in the world would only date you because of fame and money. How typical of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caleb....don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re planning to remain single forever.&#34; She peered at me with a scrutinizing look in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok then.&#34; I pushed myself off the wall walking towards her. &#34;I won&#39;t tell you then.&#34; I picked up one of the kitchen knives and began playing with it while leaning on the counter while Miranda just shook her head before rolling her eyes. I watched her as she made dinner and I knew I missed her cooking but I didn&#39;t realize how much I missed her cooking until I tasted it. The several minutes of waiting in the kitchen with the delicious aroma wafting around and clogging my senses were definitely worth it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We sat in companionable silence before Miranda said she wanted to go for a walk so she could get some fresh air. I disagreed since it would be really stressful for her but she insisted saying it calms her down. And after a couple of frowns and glares I finally agreed to let her go for a walk on the condition that I accompany her. She didn&#39;t bother to protest since she knew I&#39;d never let her go for a walk this late at night without protection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on Mother,&#34; I said, taking a turn as I walked into the light. I had to walk twice as slow and she still struggled to keep up with me. Guess I have to walk even slower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My favorite ice cream shop is just around the corner.&#34; Her face lit up as I chuckled. Sometimes she really did act like a nine year old.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ice cream? Aren&#39;t you too old to have ice cream?&#34; I lifted my brow with a smirk on my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave me a light push on my shoulder, &#34;No one&#39;s ever too old to have ice cream, Caleb.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mhmmm,&#34; I hummed, rolling my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey!! Watch where you&#39;re going you stupid woman!!&#34; I heard a man yell from ahead of us. I jerked my head towards the direction his voice came from just Incase there was trouble and I needed to protect Miranda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you know how to drive!&#34; He yelled again and that was when I noticed that his car had been hit by someone else who was trying to reverse. &#34;Now look what you&#39;ve done to my car!&#34; I shifted my gaze from the annoyed man to the frightened woman in the car but I couldn&#39;t quite see her face since the street lamp reflected on her windshield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry.&#34; My body stiffened at the sound of her voice. &#34;I didn&#39;t mean to.&#34; I found myself cocking my head as I looked over the man&#39;s shoulder. Was that actually her? What the hell was she doing here?</p>
