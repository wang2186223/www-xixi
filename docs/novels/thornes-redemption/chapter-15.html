                <p>Amaris POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia was prepared to abandon all our possessions, everything we had worked so hard to accumulate, and flee immediately, leaving everything behind without a second thought. The urgency in her eyes told me that she was ready to leave it all behind and never look back. I didn&#39;t blame her though, if it was me I think I&#39;d probably do the same, but we can&#39;t just leave all of our shit behind, can we?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia, slow down and breathe! I understand you&#39;re shaken, but we need to think this through. I&#39;m sure we have some time before they come back. I mean, you just got kidnapped yesterday, so I think we&#39;re safe for at least a week or so. We need to be strategic about this. We can&#39;t just leave everything behind, can we? We need to find a safe place to go, somewhere they won&#39;t think to look for us. Come on, let&#39;s think this through together.&#34; I said, trying to reassure her while focusing on gathering my belongings, also trying to hide the fear that was slowly sucking me in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know the way he operates, having grown up in this world. As soon as he discovered I was missing, he would have already hired new recruits to get me back. He won&#39;t waste any time, trust me. And they&#39;ll be here at noon at the latest, maybe even earlier if he&#39;s as desperate as I think he is. So we need to move fast, pack what we can, and get out of here before they arrive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia&#39;s panicked tone left me reeling, a rarity in our longstanding friendship that had weathered countless storms. Despite countless experiences together, including confrontations with intoxicated club-goers and even a harrowing accidental gunshot wound - it only grazed her shoulder, but still - Mia had always maintained a brave facade. I recalled the hospital visit, where she joked and laughed, refusing anesthesia before getting stitched up, leaving the nurses in shock at her resilience. Our appearances often led people to misjudge us, assuming I was the strong one, with my assertive demeanor and sharp tongue, and Mia the vulnerable one, with her petite frame and gentle features. But the truth was far from it - she was the tough and fearless one, with a heart of gold, and I was the emotional and sensitive one, often struggling to keep up with her unwavering courage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I approached the window to retrieve some items from the table, my attention was drawn to some unusual activity outside. At first, I thought it was just a minor commotion, but as I gazed out into the distance, my curiosity turned to disbelief. From our sixth-floor vantage point, I had to squint to get a better look, my eyes straining to make sense of the scene unfolding below. My eyes widened in shock, and I managed to stifle a scream just in time, my hand flying to my mouth to suppress the instinctive cry of alarm. Mia noticed my stunned expression and hurried to join me at the window, her face pale as she took in the sight of three black vans, their tinted windows reflecting the sunlight like dark mirrors, and over thirty armed men, their weapons and tactical gear a stark reminder of their sinister intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whispered to Mia, my voice shaking with fear, &#34;We gotta get outta here, pronto!&#34; My mind was racing, my legs felt like jelly, and I was struggling to keep it together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia whispered back, her voice barely audible, &#34;Unless we can get a helicopter to swoop in and lift us out of here, I don&#39;t see how we&#39;re getting out of this. It&#39;s like, what are we supposed to do, just magically levitate out of here?&#34; Her whisper was laced with frustration and fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about your dad? Isn&#39;t he going to do anything to help? He can&#39;t just sit back and watch you die. Waitcan he?&#34; I whispered urgently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia&#39;s eyes flashed with a mix of fear and exasperation as she shook her head, &#34;No, I don&#39;t know, okay? We just need to find a way to save ourselves.&#34; She began pacing the room with restless energy, her hand raking through her hair in a repetitive motion, like a nervous habit, her feet carrying her back and forth across the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My frustration and fear boiled over, &#34;What do you mean you don&#39;t know?! Your dad is always bragging about his power and influence, how can he not be able to help us now?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spoke with a mix of anger and despair, &#34;My dad didn&#39;t lift a finger yesterday when they sent him a video of me being held captive, and when I reached out to him last night, he had the audacity to say &#39;he knew I&#39;d be fine&#39;. It&#39;s like, I could be murdered right under his nose and he wouldn&#39;t bat an eye.&#34; She shook her head, her eyes welling up with tears, the sadness and betrayal evident in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed, &#34;I&#39;m so sorry, I didn&#39;t know that. I shouldn&#39;t have pushed&#34;. I knew I was not at fault but I felt a little guilty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes sparkled with a sudden inspiration, &#34;I&#39;ve got it!&#34; she exclaimed, her face lighting up like a light bulb had gone off in her mind. &#34;Why don&#39;t you call Caleb?&#34; She suggested, her smile tinged with a hint of mischief and hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave her a look, &#34;Really, that&#39;s the best you&#39;ve got? Calling Caleb?&#34; I shook my head, my eyes rolling in disbelief, &#34;Not exactly the most genius idea, if you ask me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why is that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I threw up my hands, &#34;What&#39;s the point? I could be murdered right in front of him and he&#39;d just stand there, unmoved. Yeah, he despises me that much, it&#39;s clear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia said with a lazy smile, &#34;Come on, he&#39;s not going to let someone as useful as you slip away. And I&#39;m pretty sure his feelings for you aren&#39;t as black and white as hate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He doesn&#39;t care that I&#39;m his worker, and he&#39;ll replace me in the twinkle of an eye&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shot me a look of exasperation, her arms crossing over her chest in a defiant gesture, &#34;You&#39;re so dense! If he truly despise you, wouldn&#39;t he have fired you already? But no, he&#39;s kept you around, which means there&#39;s more to it than you&#39;re willing to admit.&#34; Her expression was a picture of smug superiority, as if she&#39;d cornered me with her logic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind was suddenly racing with the implications of Mia&#39;s words, but my thoughts were abruptly derailed by a more pressing concern. Wait a minute... Why haven&#39;t those guys come for us yet? I turned my attention to the window, and my eyes widened as I saw them still lingering outside, seemingly in no hurry to come get us. A shiver ran down my spine as I wondered, what are they waiting for?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking my silence as agreement, Mia sighed. &#34;Mhmm. That&#39;s what I thought&#34; totally oblivious of what was going on in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to Mia, my voice laced with a growing sense of unease, &#34;Mia, why haven&#39;t they come for us yet?&#34; Her eyes snapped back into focus, and her expression transformed from smug to stunned, as if she had been so caught up in our conversation that she had forgotten about our precarious situation. The silence that followed was palpable, and I could almost see the wheels turning in her mind as she struggled to come up with an answer.</p>
