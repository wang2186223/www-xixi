                <p>Amaris POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shuddered, a sense a fear grip me. This job was more like my life. Why was he threatening me with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed my pay to clear up my debt and it turns out that he knew. My feet paused as I shamelessly suck my breath, exhausted and tired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body flinches as I heard his footsteps behind me, and I almost forgot how to breath when his hot breath fanned my neck, his soft groan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hate it when you act tough...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want from me?&#34; I whispered, my breath thickens as I clenched my fists, not daring to look back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you ignoring me amaris&#34; he furthers in a deep low tone that felt as though he was seducing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wish to get close to Kian, to explain to him that there&#39;s nothing between us but then this boss was freaking me out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seems as though he knew I needed this job and keeps using it against me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just wish someone would save me, someone would bump in on us. My lips shook as I felt his arms around my waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want you close to Kian, just me because I own you&#34; he declares, his husky voice cutting through me like a sharp knife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His closeness made me mousey and I felt like he&#39;d melt my flesh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body quivers in his hold. I couldn&#39;t, even when my thighs quiver with want. I just have to break out or this might get toxic on me and i&#39;d become the victim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I became speechless, sweat beads on my face as I couldn&#39;t tell what to reply, the pain in my eyes, yet his presence made me feel mousey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I felt his lips on my neck, so warm and fluffy as he was kissing me there, sucking my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one can own me. I brush him mildly with my elbow, just so he&#39;d move away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, he wasn&#39;t moving and fortunately, I could see that I was in front of an elevator and so I quickly haul myself from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He almost stuttered, his cold domineering face peering at me, his wet lips folded as he suddenly scoffed, I could sense he was cussing out me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re at the office sir&#34; I pointed out in a harsh tone and jumped inside the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching it slide close, I breath heavily, feeling as though i&#39;d achieved a lot. I could get to Kian without him knowing...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door suddenly spur open, Caleb had stopped it by placing his hand in between and it slides open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had that cocky smile on his face, as though he got me trapped with him. My breath ceased and I was quivering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elevator door slides behind him and a gripping sensation caught my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was blown apart by the heat he created between us. He took a calculative step closer, almost grabbing me but then I moved aside and accidentally, he banged his head on the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped that wasn&#39;t intentional. He growl at me, as he moved to grab my wrist and accidentally I used my fist to punch his nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh my God, what am I doing? He widened his eyes at me and I quickly bow, trying to apologize but then, shock stole the very air out of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood was drooling from his nose! How hard did I hit him. I just didn&#39;t want him close to me yet because I was panicking that Kian might run into us again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seems as though he was frozen where he stood. His hand gently rubbed his nose and his fingers shook when his eyes met his blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit! Amaris did you plan all this to kill me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gulp hard and drew closer to him, thinking of how to stop the bleeding. I just didn&#39;t know how to feel but I could tell I was grinning inside my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sometimes, he just needs to respect women. I gave him no response and when I intended to touch his face, he shoved my hand away, used his neck tie to wipe his blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re doing this on purpose right&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was still quiet pretending not to care but I was freaking out, wanting to see if he was injured anywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know my hit would be hard, he acts tough yet have a fragile face. The blood wouldn&#39;t stop which heights my fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to touch him but he wouldn&#39;t let me because I know he&#39;d be pissed off, didn&#39;t he want to hold me? Why was he acting this way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyingly, I held his shoulder and shoved his to face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You might die if you don&#39;t let me handle it&#34; I whispered, our eyes peering at each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His arms had gone around my waist and the way we were posed as though we&#39;d kiss each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this your way of seducing me?&#34; He questioned and my heart was flustered, like he was reading through me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perhaps, we should cover the bleeding first&#34; I responded as his come hither grin was compelling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hastily, I untied the tie on him and covered his nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold it up this way until we get to the office&#34; I mused pushing him back a bit as his bright face turned sore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seems as though he wasn&#39;t willing to do that, neither was the bleeding stopping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Does he have leukemia or something? It seems as though he wasn&#39;t even bothered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to cover his nose with my palm just so he wouldn&#39;t look stupid and I could see the shock in his eyes, my other hand was holding his neck just so his head would bend to my level.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amaris! I&#39;m your boss...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not now&#34; I quickly retort knowing I was doom. He can touch me but I can&#39;t. Was he some kind of god?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elevator halts and the door glides open. The first person I saw outside the elevator was Kian!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly took my hand from Caleb&#39;s nose, forgetting that his blood was on my palm, I rubbed it on my dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh no, what an unfortunate day. I moved my feet closer to Kian as I could sense that disappointment in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I almost muttered his name when I suddenly heard a loud thud. Kian and I shuddered as I rolled my eyes behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Caleb, he had collapsed!</p>
