                <p>Amaris&#39; POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was beginning to wonder if Caleb was actually human or if he was a demon sent from hell to ruin my life because how could someone be so cruel?! A sly grin spread across his face as he pushed himself off the table. &#34;I&#39;m pretty sure you can handle it.&#34; His tone dripped with sarcasm as I felt my blood pressure rising. He made his way towards the door, twisting the handle. &#34;Oh and don&#39;t even think about taking a break until you&#39;re done.&#34; He added before slamming the door behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Asshole,&#34; I muttered to myself watching him through the glass walls as he walked to his office. I wasn&#39;t going to give him the satisfaction of seeing me throw a fit. Never. A smile crept across my lips as I thought of the ways I could have my revenge. There was no way I was going to let myself get trampled on, I needed to get even with him, needed to make him pay. But definitely not today, there was no time for that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was such here, forced to redo every single thing I spent hours working on all because of my stupid boss. Just the thought of having to go through the same pain I had earlier today or probably twice as much made my skin crawl and my tummy turn inside out. And to make matters worse, I have other things that I was meant to do today. Deadlines to meet, projects to complete, and here I am wasting my precious all because of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He wants me to work my ass off until I probably collapse doesn&#39;t he?&#34; I muttered to myself as I wrapped my fingers around my mouse navigating through the screen. A mischievous grin spread across my face. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll give him what he wants.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>~~~~~~~~</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got up from my desk, reaching up to stretch. God I need a massage. I pouted at the thought. I made a mental note to talk with Mia about going to the spa this weekend. I then glanced at the clock, surprisingly I had finished with just five minutes to spare before my break was supposed to start. I headed towards the door, ready to treat myself to a well deserved break. As I walked down the corridors, I started thinking about what I was going to pick when I got to the break room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Should I have a soda or a latte? Or maybe a milkshake? I&#39;m really in the mood for scones....or maybe croissants? But their doughnuts are pretty good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was so worked up about what I was going to pick that I didn&#39;t look where I was going till I collided with a huge brick wall....that was warm? I held my head about to look up and apologize when I heard a familiar voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watch where you&#39;re going sweetheart.&#34; I froze as I felt the rough huge hands on my shoulders steadying me. I slowly lifted my head to meet his gaze and I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes. &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; He asked with a worried expression on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Beck?&#34; I asked my tone laced with surprise and shock. I didn&#39;t expect to see him here. As I rubbed my head, my mind drifted back to the rock hard walk I felt earlier and my eyes dropped to his chest. He was wearing a well tailored suit perfectly embracing his broad shoulders, muscular arms and narrow waist. He was basically towering over me even though there wasn&#39;t much of a difference in our heights thanks to my heels. I couldn&#39;t help but imagine how I&#39;d look standing next to him if I wasn&#39;t wearing heels. I watched his tall broad figure as our eyes met again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing...&#34; I paused looking around just in case anyone was watching. &#34;....here?&#34; It was as soon as the question left my lips that I realized how stupid I sounded. He was a friend of Caleb, of course it&#39;s perfectly normal for him to be around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just dropped by to see Caleb, sorry Mr. Thorne.&#34; He drawled earning chuckle from me. He smiled, lifting his arms off my arms and that was when I realized he had been holding me this whole time. I found myself mourning the warmth of his hands on my arms as he added, &#34;We had some....business we wanted to talk about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh,&#34; I blinked. &#34;Okay.&#34; I pursed my lips together not knowing how to reply to that. I just made this weird didn&#39;t I?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I think he noticed my uneasiness because the next thing he said was, &#34;I&#39;ll be on my way now. I&#39;ve got other important meetings I need to take care of.&#34; He adjusted his tie before sidestepping me. &#34;Oh and try walking with your head up, so you don&#39;t bump into someone next time.&#34; His tone was dripping with sarcasm but in a good way. He waved at me before disappearing into the corridors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought it was normal for billionaires to be harsh until I met Kian. He was the complete opposite of what I expected a friend of Caleb to be...nice, kind, charming. Okay, ignore the last part. I just pray some of his kindness runs off on Caleb, he really needs it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had initially considered eating at the cafeteria which was crowded with my co-workers. I wasn&#39;t surprised though, I mean it was only normal, after all I wasn&#39;t the only person on a break. I glanced at the empty tables on one side of the hall before glancing at the other side tables that were occupied. You could hear the hushed chattering even from the corridors, if I wasn&#39;t going to be honest we did act like kids sometimes. I quickly pushed the thought of eating in the café to the back of my head not because I was still angry at Caleb or anything but because I still had a long list of tasks waiting for me and I needed some alone time while I ate. I had to stay focused and keep the momentum going, who knows maybe I could finish one while eating. I picked up the snacks I had ordered and headed back to my office. I finally decided to have a strawberry milkshake accompanied by some steaming hot croissants and scones, I could have doughnuts tomorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat at my desk, savoring the sweet taste of my warm croissant and the refreshing zing of my drink. I noticed Caleb walk-in into my office causing everything in my mouth to lose its sweet taste. Great. I can&#39;t even have lunch in peace. I frowned dropping the half bitten croissant on the tray as I watched him scan the area as if he was looking for something....or rather someone. My instincts and self-consciousness kicked in, as I immediately wiped my mouth with the back of my hand, making sure my face was crumb and smudge free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I flashed a grin at him, my eyes sparkling with a glint of triumph, he was probably here because he&#39;d thought I&#39;d still be working on the files he deleted. &#34;Can I help you?&#34; My tone was sweet and innocent, but beneath the surface, I was daring him to try and get a rise out of me. Unfortunately for him his prank had failed but that didn&#39;t stop me from planning my revenge. He was going to pay for every head throb and eye sting. He narrowed his eyes into thin slits as he stated, &#34;I suppose you managed to find time for a break.&#34; His tone was neutral and impassive but I could tell he was fuming with rage and annoyance and it was all because of me. Weldone Ammie, you&#39;ve done a great job.</p>
