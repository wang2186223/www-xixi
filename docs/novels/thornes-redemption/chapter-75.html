                <p>Kian&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amaris....&#34; I took her chin in my hand gently lifting her face back up to mine again. &#34;I don&#39;t care about some....old shirt.&#34; I searched for the right word to use. &#34;It&#39;s you I care about. I don&#39;t want to see you crying over....some stupid people who don&#39;t even care if you exist or not.&#34; I wiped a wet side of her cheek. &#34;They don&#39;t deserve your tears...and trust me I don&#39;t think your father would like to see his baby girl crying over him.&#34; I pinched her nose playfully eliciting a smile out if her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess it&#39;s childish and stupid for me to cry over his death considering the fact that he died many years ago.&#34; She looked away from my gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey hey hey.&#34; I waved my finger in her face causing her to shift her gaze back to me.  &#34;I didn&#39;t say it was stupid or childish to cry....everyone cries, it&#39;s a part of life and take it from me you look extra cute when you&#39;re crying...&#34; I shifted my gaze to the TV. &#34;...not that you should do it every time....&#34; I turned back to her. &#34;...I&#39;m just saying...&#34; I lifted my shoulders in a half shrug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop talking.&#34; She playfully rolled her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure.&#34; I chuckled before pressing my lips together making a zipping motion across them gesturing that I had zipped them shut. Then I pressed a finger on my lips smiling at her as she jokingly shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re insane...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know....you&#39;ve told me a thousand times.&#34; I said, my voice barely a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She parted her lips to say something but closed it again causing my gaze to drift to her lips. &#34;You&#39;re supposed to be quiet dumbass.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Another pet name added to the list. Perfect.&#34; I spoke, my tone heavy with sarcasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a small laugh her eyes sparkling with amusement as hair fell in loose waves down her back. &#34;Can you ever act normal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m acting normal right now.&#34; A smile formed on my lips as I leaner closer causing my face to be inches away from hers. I could feel her warm breath against my skin as my heart fluttered in my chest, racing with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gazed into her eyes and for a second we just stared at each other. The world around us melting away leaving only the two of us. I felt another chill running down my spine for the nth time tonight and I knew I was drawn to her in a way I couldn&#39;t ignore...my gaze dropped to her lips which was less than inch away from his and I could feel the tension between us building. I wasn&#39;t sure what was going to happen next but I knew I didn&#39;t want to pull away. Not at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strand of hair dangled in front of her eye and before she could even lift her hand I had already tucked it behind her ear, my eyes never leaving hers. I admit I used to stare at her a lot but I had never taken time to notice her eyes. She had the most beautiful hazel eyes I had ever seen. A perfect blend of brown and green, with golden flecks that seemed to dance and shimmer in the light. Her eyes were framed by thick, dark lashes, which only seemed make them stand out even more. I should stop staring....I should move away from her before something happens but I couldn&#39;t...I was lost in the depths of her eyes and the only thing I could see, the only thing I could think about....was her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips parted again drawing my attention to them again and I couldn&#39;t help but wonder how sweet they tasted. *Just one kiss wouldn&#39;t hurt right?* And if she didn&#39;t want it to she would have pushed me away like ten seconds ago, right? &#34;Kian....&#34; The sound of my name on her lips sent another jolt of electricity through me as I clenched my fist which still hovered over her ear before I unclenched it again trailing it down her chin. &#34;I....we&#39;re not supposed to....&#34; The rest of her words were drowned out when I pulled her closer crashing my lips against hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew I shouldn&#39;t be taking advantage of her vulnerability right now....she was crying in my arms and here I was kissing her. This was supposed to be wrong...but then....then...why did this feel so fucking right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did her skin feel so supple and soft beneath my touch and why was her hand tugging on my hair? She let out a small moan which reverberated through me sending shivers down my spine as her body melted into mine and I felt my heart race with excitement. I tried to pull away....I really did but it wasn&#39;t working....nothing was working apart from my arms that roamed her body. &#34;Fuck....&#34; I pulled away for a split second to catch my breath before claiming her lips again. I didn&#39;t know when next she was going to let me kiss her like this so I better make the best of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt her hands move from my hair to my back, digging into my skin as our ragged breathing echoed in the room. Her lips were soft and warm and I felt white hot sparks running through me as I tasted her sweetness which tasted better than I could ever imagine. I couldn&#39;t get enough of her, I couldn&#39;t get close enough. I have to make her mine. I have to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I deepened the kiss, kissing her so desperately like a drowning man clinging to his last lifeline, my mouth grasping hers with a hunger that left her breathless as my hands roamed her body, my tongue exploring every corner, every curve, every damn part of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After kissing her till I couldn&#39;t breathe anymore, I pulled away gasping for air. My gaze shifted to her swollen lips and her disheveled hair and the way her chest moved slightly as she steadied her breathing and I couldn&#39;t help but yearn to kiss her again but I knew I had to control myself. I shouldn&#39;t even have come here in the first place....I needed to leave before I did something else....something more than a kiss. &#34;I....I should go.&#34; I pointed towards the door getting up but she immediately wrapped her fingers around my shirt tugging on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t go yet.&#34; She tightened her grip on my shirt. &#34;If you go now I&#39;ll have nightmares.&#34; She lowered her head. &#34;I know I&#39;m asking for too much but I just need someone to stay with me. I promise it&#39;ll only be for a few minutes.&#34; She finally lifted her gaze meeting mine. How could I say no to her when she&#39;s staring at me with those eyes?</p>
