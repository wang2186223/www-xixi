                <p>Amaris POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yeah?? Then what might that reason be?&#34; I fold my arms across my chest, &#34;I mean, you&#39;re his girlfriend right? So you definitely know&#34; I said, noticing how her expression fell at the last sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, there&#39;s something I really should tell you.&#34; She said, her expression sullen, giving rise to the anticipation in me, &#34;I&#39;ve never told anyone this before, not even my parents or my closest friends. But I trust you, so I&#39;m going to tell you&#34;. Now my anxiety and excitement were in full throttle as I waited for her to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; I asked in a low soothing voice in an attempt to mask my impatience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr Thorne isn&#39;tI&#39;m not&#34;. It was obvious that she was at a loss for words, but she finally said it, &#34;I&#39;m not his girlfriend&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait. If you&#39;re not his girlfriend then what are you to him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m hismistress, I guess?&#34; She said looking down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like you have sex with him and get paid?&#34; I asked, curiosity etched on my face, as she nodded a positive reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was that your original job? Orrrrrhow did it start?&#34; I wanted to know more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I worked as a waitress in one of those elite clubs. You know, the ones that cater for the rich and famous.&#34; I nod to show her I was listening. &#34;Well, one day as I was working, I met Caleb. I was stunned to meet him, I mean he&#39;s the Thorne, so when he told me to meet him at a hotel, I was more than enthralled to go.&#34; She narrated with a faraway look in her eyes, like she was watching it again. &#34;It started becoming a normal thing for me, and he paid me a huge sum anyways. I literally got my monthly salary in just one night with him, so I gladly took the job&#34; a sad look clouded her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, you could leave if you don&#39;t want to continue, right?&#34;, I said as a reassurance and also to know if he was hurting her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, no. Don&#39;t get me wrong though, I can leave. I just don&#39;t want to.&#34; She said, still looking sad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I became so confused. She seems sad, but she likes the relationship? Is she mentally alright, or is something wrong? So I asked, &#34;if you don&#39;t want to leave, then why do you seem sad about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I&#39;m lying to my mom. She wonders where I&#39;m getting all my money when I don&#39;t work at the club anymore, so I tell her that I now work as an accountant here&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just tell her that Caleb&#39;s your boyfriend and he&#39;s the one that gives you all the money.&#34; I suggested a better way. Besides, it will just be a half lie. Her head whipped towards me so fast that I felt like her head might fall off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you crazy?&#34; She chuckled, &#34;I can&#39;t tell my mom that. She&#39;ll then want to meet him, and you know how Mr Thorne can be. What am I saying &#39;can be&#39;, you know how Mr Thorne is. I can&#39;t beg him to go meet my mom, even if the life of every member of the state depends on it&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, you&#39;re right.&#34; I agreed, &#34;but do you intend on doing this for the rest of your life? Let&#39;s say he decides to let you go, what will you do then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, he&#39;s not letting me go anytime soon,&#34; she smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uhh. And how exactly do you know that?&#34; I drawled, a little suspicious of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s in love with me,&#34; she said, sounding extremely sure. &#34;What else do you think made him stick with me for so long?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could think of a lot of things that made him stick with her, one being that she probably fucked well, but I wasn&#39;t about to burst her bubble, so I said, &#34; okay, that sounds about right&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s already past 3pm. and I&#39;ve not even gotten a call or mail from Caleb. I&#39;m not going to lie, I&#39;m worried right now, not because I care about him but because if he&#39;s gone who&#39;ll pay me? Kiara have already left, so I went back to my work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know how many calls I&#39;ve received today, all asking why Caleb isn&#39;t there and where he&#39;s at. I don&#39;t know bro, am I his shadow? Why do they keep asking me that? Anyways, I finally got an email from Caleb, clarifying why he didn&#39;t make it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something came up, so I couldn&#39;t make it today. I&#39;ll be there tomorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s not really &#34;clarifying&#34;, but when it involves Caleb, that&#39;s more than enough clarifying. Now that I know he&#39;s fine, why do I still have that unsettling feeling in my gut? Maybe I&#39;m just overthinking it this time. Anyways, it&#39;s almost six, so I can go home and know that everything&#39;s fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did the rest of my job, and in no time it was already six o&#39;clock. I hurriedly packed up my stuff, the desire to go home to bed overwhelming me. As I got to my car, I tried my best but still couldn&#39;t shake the feeling of something going wrong. The closer I got towards the apartment, the worse I felt, so immediately I arrived at the building, I parked my car and jumped down in a hurry to get inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door was already open so I just went in. &#34;Mia?&#34; I called. &#34;Mia!&#34; I wasn&#39;t hearing her or getting any answers, so I decided to go check the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia?&#34; I opened the bathroom door peeking inside. She&#39;s got fighting skills so she&#39;s okay, right? Picking up my phone, I called her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isn&#39;t that her phone ringing over there? Where the hell did she go without her phone? It&#39;s not even like she&#39;s charging it, she just dropped it on the bed. Where could she have gone? I start pacing, something I do when I&#39;m confused and in deep thoughts. I looked down and my eyes almost fell out of their sockets. Is that blood?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why is there blood on the floor? Was she kidnapped? Did anyone see her? Gracie probably did see her, she&#39;s almost always outside her door looking for whom she&#39;ll use to gossip, I&#39;m going to ask her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Running out, I find Gracie rushing towards me, looking like she has something to tell me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gracie, please did you see Mia?&#34; I asked her, fighting back the tears that were about to fall from my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, that&#39;s what I was coming here to tell you&#34; she started, in her Yorkshire accent. &#34;I heard some noises coming from you guy&#39;s apartment, like fight sounds. And then before I knew what was happening, Mia came out sweating, followed by two huge guys at both sides. I wanted to call the cops, but..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what?&#34; I yelled,cutting her off, the tears pouring down now in streams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I didn&#39;t want to call and then it turned out to be a false alarm. I wasn&#39;t sure what was going on&#34; she said looking guilty and sad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry for the way I talked to you Gracie&#34; I apologized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay&#34; she smiled at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you see anything else?&#34; I asked trying to pick up on any lead I could. Mia&#39;s the one that&#39;s good at this detective work, I don&#39;t know what to do when it comes to things like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. They had a black tinted van. And one of the guys had a scar running diagonally from his right brow to the top of his lip&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks&#34; I said, running back into the room. What do I do now? I pace round the room, running my hand through my hair and crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I call the cops, they&#39;ll take a long time in searching for her. But I&#39;m trying to get her back as soon as possible. Who do I know that can help me with such? I crumple on the ground as I think, bathing my face in my tears and snot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only option I have now is Caleb, but will he help me? I guess I have to try my luck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stare at the caller id for over five minutes, before I get the audacity to call him. Please pick up.</p>
