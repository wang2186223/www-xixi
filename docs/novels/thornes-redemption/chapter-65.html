                <p>Amaris&#39; POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was about stepping away from my desk when the door swung open and the air was suddenly filled with the soft, rhythmic tapping of stiletto heels, and a familiar fragrance. I let out a small groan as a frown formed on my lips. Ugh! What did she want now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at Jessica as she walked into the room in her mini dress. Caleb wasn&#39;t around but that didn&#39;t stop him from wearing shirt dresses and parading all over the place. I had asked her why she didn&#39;t join Caleb on the trip just to see if she was actually going to lie to my face or tell me the truth. It was no surprise that she actually lied, little did she know that I had overheard her conversation with Caleb when she was begging him to let her go with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As expected, Caleb bluntly refused saying he didn&#39;t need any distractions in Korea. Maybe that&#39;s why he didn&#39;t want to take me too...if I went along with him he&#39;d be too busy trying to make my life a living hell that he won&#39;t even focus on the reason he was there in the first place. It was a good thing though, I didn&#39;t even want to go. Unlike Mia, traveling wasn&#39;t really my thing but I was still going to go with her to California someday.....someday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you keep staring at me like that you&#39;re gonna make it obvious that you dislike your face and wish you had mine...&#34; She planted one of her hands on her hip as she waved the other in the air. &#34;....but you&#39;re lucky no one&#39;s here to see you so you can admire all you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d rather have my face run over by a truck than look like you.&#34; I said in a cheery tone, smiling at her. &#34;What do you want?&#34; I relaxed my brows into a frown as I sidestepped her as I grabbed the bottle on my desk heading towards the water cooler in the corner. Jessica only came into my office when Caleb sent her, when she wanted something or wanted to tell me something or when she was bored and had nothing else to do so she&#39;d come and blab nonstop, about how pretty she was or how her modeling career would&#39;ve been more successful if she had been recognized for her talent and beauty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Translation: She wasn&#39;t recognized for her so-called talent and beauty so she resorted to whoring herself out for cash and luckily for her she became the mistress of one of the richest men in the city...scratch that, one of the richest men in the country. Like I said, lucky her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I unscrewed the cap, as I waited for her response. &#34;Isn&#39;t it obvious? I want to talk to you about something.&#34; I heard her say. With a flick of my wrist, I filled the bottle to brim as it glistened in the fluorescent lights of my office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already know you want to talk about something....&#34; I said as I watched the bubbles dance beneath the surface. Like she said, it was obvious....Caleb wasn&#39;t around so he definitely didn&#39;t send her which meant she was either bored or she had something to tell me. &#34;...so just go straight to the point.&#34; I said before tipping the bottle over my lips taking a long sip as I sacred the clean taste of the water sliding down my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s about Kian.&#34; The water went down the wrong pipe causing me to burst out in a fit of coughs. I then turned to face her as my brows drew together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you say?&#34; I asked, clearing my throat before taking another sip of water to quench the burning sensation in my throat and chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You heard me. I said I want to talk to you about Kian.&#34; She said in a serious tone. I then dropped my gaze to the bottle in my hands as I screwed the cap back on. Why on earth would she want to talk about Kian?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay?&#34; I said still trying to process the events playing out before me. I then made my way to my swivel chair. &#34;I&#39;m all ears then.&#34; She relaxed in her seat. I then rested my arms on my desk before placing my chin in my hands. I didn&#39;t understand why but I was so eager to hear what she had to say. Maybe she wanted to....</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you to stay away from him.&#34; She said, her expression impassive. I paused, wrinkling my forehead as I waited for the punchline. It never came. That was why she wanted to talk to me? Because she wanted me to stay away from Kian?! What is wrong with these people? First Caleb wants me to stay away from his mother and now Jessica wants me to stay away from Kian. It seemed Caleb&#39;s foolishness was rubbing off on her. Perhaps they are meant to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And why should I do that?&#34; I raised a brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because Caleb wouldn&#39;t like the idea of some stupid girl like you spending time with his brother. I mean look....&#34; she gestured around. &#34;....he didn&#39;t even leave you in charge of his company....&#34; She the planted one of her hands on her hip. &#34;...and you&#39;re his fucking secretary. If he can&#39;t trust you with company then he definitely won&#39;t trust you with his brother....&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why the hell would he want to trust me with his brother?&#34; I asked, cutting her off. It&#39;s not like anything she said was making any sense. Judging by what she said, the way she talked, her composure and everything, I could tell that she was only looking for what to do to keep herself busy now that Caleb wasn&#39;t around and she couldn&#39;t think of anything better than hitting on his brother...or rather cousin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t question me. Just do as I say and cut off ties with him.&#34; Jessica crossed her arms over her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not cutting off any ties with him. Kian is my boss.....for now.&#34; I added. &#34;How do you expect me to work with him if I don&#39;t speak with him?&#34; I furrowed my brows. &#34;I know you don&#39;t know anything about business or work but come on...&#34; I rolled my eyes as her whole face turned red. &#34;Seriously? That sounds ridiculous.&#34; I said ignoring the frown on her face. I then leaned back in my seat. &#34;Oh and just so you know....just because your baby boo is not here doesn&#39;t mean you should hit on his brother. I&#39;m sorry to be the one to break It to you but it doesn&#39;t work that way.&#34;</p>
