                <p>Amaris&#39; POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I watched Caleb lead the stranger to his car, I didn&#39;t even realize when I let out a sigh of relief. For a second there I actually thought Caleb was going to end someone&#39;s life in front of me. I mean I knew he was a killer....he was known as the Cold hearted Tycoon for crying out loud ofcourse he killed people but after what I had to go through after watching my father die right in front of me....I didn&#39;t want to go through it ever again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to stop myself from taking a peek but it was just not possible. What if Caleb was actually hurting him? Or worse....what if he locked him in his car to suffocate or what if he shot him and left him there to die. I looked out my window craning my neck but I almost fell out of my car when I heard an elderly woman&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be careful dearie....unless you&#39;re going to hurt yourself.&#34; I turned to find a woman, probably in her fifties standing with two cups of ice cream in her hands. Her dark hair which was peppered with white strands were tied in a neat tight bun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh there&#39;s no need for you to worry about me.&#34; I put my head back in, pulling the door handle before pushing it open. &#34;I&#39;m fine.&#34; I pushed myself out of the car as I smiled at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should be worried about yourself....it&#39;s cold out here....and you&#39;re having ice-cream?&#34; I let out a light chuckle. &#34;Isn&#39;t that bad for you?&#34; A confused smile spread across my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know my son said exactly the same thing....&#34; She grinned. &#34;But I never listen to him.&#34; She waved her ice cream in the air like she was shooing away her son&#39;s comment. &#34;Speaking of Caleb....where is he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb? Caleb was her son? I knew Caleb was with his mom but I couldn&#39;t see her face because of the light. She was actually Caleb&#39;s mother wow....how could a nice and caring woman raise.....that? I turned to where Caleb stood and he leaned against the stranger&#39;s car and it looked like he was....strangling him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh shit. I couldn&#39;t let his mother see that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh....Caleb? Who&#39;s Caleb?&#34; I chuckled weirdly running my hands through my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to pretend....I know you guys know each other.....&#34; I stiffened as my eyebrows shot up. Caleb actually told his mother that we knew each other? Come to think of it....why was he even helping me in the first place? I&#39;m already indebted to him and he&#39;s still helping me? I&#39;m not even sure I can pay back for last time and now he&#39;s helping me again? I frowned. I&#39;m sure this was his plan....he probably realized that he wasn&#39;t supposed to let such a golden opportunity slip away when Mia and I asked him to help us back at our old place so he jumped at the opportunity to help me again so I&#39;ll be even more indebted to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caleb told me...&#34; I took one of the ice cream cups from her since I noticed she was struggling to hold them both and eat her ice cream. &#34;...don&#39;t worry, he didn&#39;t tell me about you guys&#39; little secret.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Little secret?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whose little secret?&#34; A foreign voice interrupted our conversation. &#34;And what are you doing with my ice cream cup?&#34; He frowned, snatching the cup from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey! I was just holding it and I didn&#39;t know vicious creatures like you actually eat ice cream.&#34; I crossed my hands over my chest lifting my chin in defiance. I was planning on thanking him but after the way he acted he was definitely not getting a thank you from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you just call me vicious?&#34; He lifted his brow up before narrowing his eyes into venomous slits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh sorry....&#34; I added a rather cheery infection to my voice. &#34;....I meant to say I didn&#39;t know cold hearted tycoons eat ice cream.&#34; A smirk crept up my lips as his scowl deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that how you choose to speak to your boss?&#34; His brows furrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped looking around. &#34;I don&#39;t see my desk anywhere.&#34; I then planted my hands on my hip as I frowned at him. &#34;If you&#39;re planning to fire me I suggest you go ahead.&#34; I raised my chin higher. &#34;You&#39;ll be doing both of us a favor.&#34; I shifted my gaze to Caleb&#39;s mother who just stood there stuffing her face with ice cream as she watched the scene unfold. If I was actually going to be honest she did remind me of my own mother. I made a mental note to check on her later. It&#39;s been ages since we spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Thorne.&#34; I nodded towards her before getting into my car. She flashed me a huge smile before waving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that how you say thank you?&#34; Caleb growl pierced the silent night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few beats before I answered his question. &#34;Oh wow.&#34; I let out a small laugh as I relaxed my hand on my steering wheel. &#34;So you do have feelings....I thought you weren&#39;t going to give a fuck if I thanked you or not.&#34; The color drained out of his pupils as he glared at me. &#34;But....&#34; I trailed off tapping my chin as I looked upward. &#34;....you did go out of your way to get me out of that mess even though I didn&#39;t quite understand how that was going to benefit you....so I guess you deserve a thank you.&#34; I fired up my engine putting on my seat belt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t hear you say thank you.&#34; I turned to him, sizing him up. This was the first time I saw him doing something that was close to begging and I had to admit it was kind of amusing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I just did....and if you didn&#39;t hear me then you should probably get your ears checked.&#34; I smiled at him with my eyes closed before returning my gaze to the dark road, switching on my headlights. I hated driving at night....it wouldn&#39;t have been so dark if that stupid man didn&#39;t stop me earlier. Ugh! This was all his fault.....and Caleb&#39;s fault too. My throat bobbed with a nervous swallow as I tightened my grip on my steering wheel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re afraid of the dark.&#34; I heard him say, causing me to snap my head towards him. An amused glint flashed in his eyes. I thought I was the one annoying him tonight....why did he always have to be so.... infuriating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not afraid of the dark.&#34; I rolled my eyes, frowning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s written over your face. Don&#39;t worry I&#39;m not a *gentleman* so I won&#39;t offer to drive you home. You can enjoy the rest of the evening yourself.&#34; He said before turning to his mum. &#34;Come on mother....it&#39;s getting late...&#34; he looked up at the dark sky. &#34;....and cold.&#34; He added. &#34;You should be in bed right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb&#39;s mother looked like she was about to protest but she just walked behind him instead waving at me again and I didn&#39;t even realize when I smiled at her again. She really did act like a child. I watched them as they walked into a dark street....the narrow dark path enveloping them, making them vanish out of sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I then muttered a few prayers to myself shifting my car out of park and entering the road. I was sure Mia would have called me a thousand times by now but there was no need to text or call her neck right now since I was already going home. I glanced at the Ice cream in the passenger seat. The ice cream must have melted by now but that&#39;s okay. I smiled in my head as I pictured the expression on Mia&#39;s face when she heard about everything that happened tonight. I let out a light laugh. &#34;She&#39;s definitely going to freak out.&#34;</p>
