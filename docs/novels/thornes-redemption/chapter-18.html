                <p>Amaris POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was curious to know where we were headed, but I couldn&#39;t summon the courage to ask, so I kept my questions to myself, my mind racing with possibilities. But Mia&#39;s curiosity got the better of her, and she leaned in close, her voice barely above a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have any idea where</p>
                
                
                
                <p>they&#39;re taking us?&#34; She asked with her eyes wide with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head, my voice equally low. &#34;No idea. I&#39;m lost too.&#34; I glanced around, trying to get my bearings, but the unfamiliar surroundings offered no clues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia started to say something else, her words tumbling out in a nervous rush. &#34;At least I know we&#39;re going to be fine. I mean, how can it get any wo.?&#34;But I quickly covered her mouth, silencing her. I&#39;ve learned the hard way that it&#39;s never a good idea to tempt fate by asking how things could get worse. It&#39;s already bad enough as it is so sorry if I don&#39;t want to know how it could get worse. I shot her a warning look, and she nodded understandingly, her eyes apologetic. We both knew that sometimes it&#39;s better to just keep quiet and wait for the unknown to unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We finally arrived at... well, I had no clue where we were. But one thing was certain - this place was straight out of a luxury magazine. The building in front of us was like something out of a movie, all sleek and modern and totally intimidating. I mean, I&#39;d only seen places like this on TV, where celebrities and billionaires come to play. So, what on earth were we doing here? I wasn&#39;t familiar with anybody living around here, or did Mia know someone that stayed here and she didn&#39;t think to tell me? I squinted at her in suspicion but she looked just as lost as I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raised an eyebrow at her, trying to convey all my questions and doubts without actually saying them out loud. But she just shrugged, looking just as confused as I felt. I sighed, feeling a little frustrated. What was going on here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We climbed out of the fancy Range Rover and into the sunlight, trying to wrap our heads around where we were and what was going on. The car had been like a luxurious bubble, shielding us from the craziness of our situation. But now, back in the real world, my anxiety was spiking. I was determined to get some answers, no matter what. I mean, who were these guys? What did they want with us? And what were we doing in this fancy building?. But for now, I just followed the suited guy, my eyes fixed on his back as he led us towards the sleek building ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we stepped into the building, I saw a man heading towards us, a warm and enthusiastic smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia&#39;s eyes widened as she nudged me, her voice barely above a whisper. &#34;Wait, isn&#39;t that Kian Beck?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, Kian Beck, as in the Kian Beck? The owner of Beck Luxury Homes?&#34; I asked, my voice laced with disbelief. I&#39;d heard his name mentioned countless times, synonymous with wealth and luxury. He was a regular feature in the gossip blogs&#39; &#39;most eligible bachelors&#39; list, and his company was renowned for building opulent mansions and high-end condos that graced the covers of luxury real estate magazines. But despite his high profile, I&#39;d never really paid attention to what he looked like or delved into his personal life. I mean, why would I? I wasn&#39;t exactly mingling in the same social circles as the rich and famous. Now, standing face to face with him, I felt a mix of surprise and curiosity. The man in front of me was even more imposing and charismatic than I imagined, with piercing eyes and a chiseled jawline that seemed chiseled from granite. I couldn&#39;t help but wonder what his story was, what drove him to succeed, and what lay behind that charming smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes rolled upwards, as if I was supposed to know this already. &#34;Yes, the owner of Beck Luxury Homes!&#34; she almost yelled at me in frustration, her voice low but urgent. &#34;Only one of the most influential and successful businessmen in the country, and you&#39;re standing here like you&#39;ve never heard of him!&#34; She shook her head, her expression a mix of disbelief and amusement. &#34;Kian Beck is a legend in the real estate world. He&#39;s built an empire from scratch, and his properties are the stuff of dreams. And now, here we are, in one of his buildings, about to... well, that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to figure out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I muttered under my breath, feeling a bit defensive. &#34;It&#39;s not my fault I didn&#39;t recognize him - I never thought I&#39;d cross paths with him!&#34; I said, trying to justify my ignorance. I mean, Kian Beck was a celebrity in the business world, and our circles didn&#39;t exactly overlap. But before Mia could respond with what I assumed would be a witty remark or a playful tease, I noticed a warm smile spreading across her face, and my eyes followed hers to see Kian Beck approaching us, his presence commanding attention. He moved with a confident stride, his long legs eating up the distance, and his piercing eyes fixed on us with an intensity that made my heart skip a beat. I hastily attempted to compose myself, trying to manufacture a charming smile, though I suspected it came out looking more like a lopsided grimace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My cheeks flushed as I realized how awkward I must have looked, trying to conjure up a charming smile at a moment&#39;s notice. But to my surprise, Kian Beck didn&#39;t seem to notice my awkwardness. Instead, his eyes crinkled at the corners as he smiled back at me, his gaze warm and inviting. &#34;Hey ladies,&#34; he said, his deep voice smooth as silk. &#34;It&#39;s great to finally meet you in person.&#34;</p>
