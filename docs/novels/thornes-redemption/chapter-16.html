                <p>Amaris POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia&#39;s eyes darted from the window to me, her gaze filled with a newfound alarm, &#34;What if they want to destroy the entire building?&#34; Her words hung in the air like a dark cloud, and I could feel my heart racing at the sinister implications. The silence that followed was oppressive, as if the very walls were closing in on us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I exclaimed, my voice laced with desperation, &#34;Okay, I&#39;m calling Caleb. I&#39;ll bear the insult or whatever he plans to unleash on me and beg if it means getting out of here alive.&#34; The thought of being trapped in a potentially doomed building was too much to bear. I didn&#39;t know if they actually intended to bomb the place, but I sure as hell wasn&#39;t willing to stick around to find out. I quickly grabbed my phone and dialed Caleb&#39;s number, my fingers trembling with anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pleaded into the phone, my words tumbling out in a frantic rush, &#34;Sir, please help us! They&#39;ve got us surrounded, and we&#39;re trapped. They&#39;re going to kill us, I&#39;m sure of it!&#34; I paused, expecting some kind of response, but the silence on the other end of the line was deafening. I pulled the phone away from my ear to check if the call was still connected, and saw that it was. I looked at Mia, my eyes wide with fear and uncertainty, as I waited for what felt like an eternity for Caleb to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said again, my voice laced with urgency and a hint of desperation, &#34;Hello? Caleb, are you there? Can you hear me?&#34; The silence on the other end of the line was suffocating, and I could feel my anxiety spiking with each passing moment. I gripped the phone tightly, my knuckles white with tension, as I waited for some sign that he was still on the line and willing to help us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah?&#34; The single word was spoken in a low, rumbling tone that sent a shiver down my spine. The deep vibrations of his voice seemed to resonate through my entire body, making my heart race and my skin prickle with goosebumps. I felt a sudden surge of hope, knowing that Caleb was on the other end of the line, and I struggled to find my voice to continue the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was saying&#34; I began, my voice faltering as I tried to compose myself. But before I could continue, Caleb&#39;s deep voice cut in, his tone firm and commanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard what you said. I don&#39;t care, I told you yesterday that I won&#39;t help next time. You could both die for all I care&#34; The line went dead, and I stood there, frozen in shock, as the harsh reality of Caleb&#39;s words sunk in. He had hung up on me, leaving me feeling abandoned and desperate. The coldness in his voice, the finality of his words, it was as if he had slammed a door shut in my face, leaving me to face the danger alone. I felt a wave of panic wash over me, as I realized that I had been counting on his help, and now it was clear that I was on my own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He hung up&#34; I uttered the words, my voice barely above a whisper, as I gazed at Mia&#39;s horrified expression. Her eyes had widened in shock, her jaw hanging slack in disbelief. And in that moment, it hit me like a ton of bricks - we were truly on our own. No rescue, no escape. The weight of our situation crashed down on me like a crushing weight, and I felt my heart sink into my stomach. We were trapped, with no way out, and our only hope had just hung up on us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard what you said. I don&#39;t care, I told you yesterday that I won&#39;t help next time. You could both die for all I care&#34; I said before abruptly hanging up the phone unwilling to listen to further pleas or excuses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m still kicking myself for helping her out yesterday. I mean, don&#39;t get me wrong, it felt amazing to finally let out some of that pent-up anger and frustration by throwing a few punches. But the fact that I was fighting someone else&#39;s battle, and for someone I can&#39;t stand, really took the satisfaction out of it. I told her she could take the day off work today so she could focus on finding a new place to live, somewhere safer with her friend because I didn&#39;t want her calling me for help again, so I don&#39;t see why she&#39;s calling me now, or why I should help her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Here&#39;s an expanded version:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kian, who had been lounging in my office all day, taking advantage of the rare lull in my workload, noticed the scowl on my face and asked, &#34;Same folks from yesterday, huh?&#34; His casual tone was a stark contrast to the frustration brewing inside me. We had spent the day chatting, reminiscing, and generally enjoying each other&#39;s company, making the most of the unusual downtime. But my annoyance at the situation with her had clearly ruined my mood, and Kian&#39;s perceptive question only served to highlight my growing irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, they&#39;re at it again, asking for my help like I&#39;m their personal safety net.&#34; I replied, my tone laced with exasperation. My words came out with a hint of bitterness, my mood now thoroughly spoiled by the mere mention of those girls. I shook my head, feeling a sense of resentment wash over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kian&#39;s words were laced with a hint of reproach, his expression a mix of concern and disbelief. &#34;Come on, man, don&#39;t be like that. They&#39;re in a tight spot and they need your help. You could hear the desperation in their voices.&#34; He shook his head, his eyes locked on mine, as if trying to will me into reconsidering. &#34;You&#39;re not just going to leave them hanging, are you?&#34; His tone was calm, but I could sense the underlying judgment, like he was calling me out for my reluctance to get involved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I can&#39;t help them,&#34; I replied nonchalantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why can&#39;t you, man?&#34; Kian pressed, his voice laced with frustration, his eyes narrowing as he leaned in closer. He was the exact opposite of me - always eager to lend a hand, always ready to play the hero. I could see the disappointment in his eyes, like he couldn&#39;t fathom why I wouldn&#39;t want to help them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because, man,&#34; I said, my voice firm, &#34;I gave them my word last night that I wouldn&#39;t be helping them next time. And if anyone should understand the importance of keeping your word, it&#39;s you. You know I always follow through on my commitments, no matter how hard it gets. I can&#39;t just go back on that now, it&#39;d be a betrayal of my own integrity.&#34; I held Kian&#39;s gaze, my eyes locked on his, daring him to challenge me on this. I knew he valued loyalty and reliability above most things, and I was counting on that to make him see things from my perspective.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched as Kian stood up, his expression a mix of frustration and resolve, and walked out of the room, leaving me to my stubbornness. &#34;Fine,&#34; he had said, his sigh heavy with exasperation, &#34;I&#39;ll send some of my guys to go get them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I settled back into my chair, a sense of detachment washing over me. As long as Kian didn&#39;t drag me into his plans, I was content to sit on the sidelines and observe. I&#39;d made my decision, and I was sticking to it. Whatever Kian chose to do, it was on him, not me. I&#39;d washed my hands of the whole situation, and now I was just a spectator, waiting to see how it all played out. With a resigned sigh, I leaned back and prepared to watch the drama unfold, ready to remain aloof and uninvolved.</p>
