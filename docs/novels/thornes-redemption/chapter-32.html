                <p>Amelia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I watched Kiara follow Caleb to his car, I couldn&#39;t help but feel a bit sorry for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, he&#39;s not letting me go anytime soon, He&#39;s in love with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Poor girl thinks Caleb&#39;s in love with her meanwhile to him she&#39;s nothing more than a freaking sex toy...someone who can satisfy his needs whenever he wants. How disgusting. They were a few files and information I needed to get from the reception. That&#39;s why I got into the elevator....I was so busy going through the documents in my hands that I forgot to press the button. When I saw him walk in with his phone in his ear I was a bit surprised. When I passed by his office earlier he was chatting with someone on the phone and he looked rather jovial and kind of human.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You know that there&#39;s no way I can forget about you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of Course I&#39;m jealous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Are you hurt?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to eavesdrop but I couldn&#39;t do that when the glass walls could give away my location immediately. Whoever he was talking to must have been someone very close to him. Another woman perhaps.....he seemed to be in a hurry to meet her though. But there&#39;s one thing I don&#39;t quite understand.....why didn&#39;t he take his private elevator?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amaris....&#34; Chloe called out to me. Chloe and I didn&#39;t spend much time with each other but we were acquainted enough to know some specific things about each other. &#34;What brings you here?&#34; She beamed at me from behind the counter. Her hands were still on her keyboard. She was probably working on something...well at least I knew that was one thing we had in common. Our Boss worked us both to the bones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Chloe.&#34; I moved closer to the counter resting my hands on it. &#34;What&#39;s up?&#34; I sent a small smile her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh you know...&#34; She waved her hand in the air before tucking a loose strand behind her ear. &#34;....just work, work and...&#34; She tapped her chin looking up like she was trying to remember something. &#34;Oh how could I forget? Work.&#34; She said before we both burst out laughing but quickly covered our mouth to muffle our laughs as we looked around. No one was around except a few people who were just passing by.... everyone was in their office doing what they were supposed to do. If not, Caleb would probably murder them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just stopped by to get a few documents from you....that&#39;s all.&#34; I opened the file in my hands going through it again. &#34;The one I have isn&#39;t quite complete....I need the document containing the list of business men that have invested in our company&#39;s business for the past two months.&#34; I stated when the confused expression formed on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh....&#34; Chloe&#39;s eyebrows shot up before they relaxed again. &#34;That file.&#34; She opened a drawer below her searching through the stack of files. &#34;Gimme a second.&#34; She pushed the drawer back in when she couldn&#39;t find it there and pulled out another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take your time.&#34; I nodded towards her before resting half of my whole weight on the counter. As I watched her search for the file my thoughts trailed back to the two people I saw heading outside. I turned towards the door and they weren&#39;t there anymore and so was Caleb&#39;s car. Guess they went together? I lifted a brow. I didn&#39;t really understand what was happening because a few minutes ago, Caleb was on the phone telling another woman (well I&#39;m not quite sure) that he was jealous and asking her if she was hurt and now he let Kiara go with him to see her? Maybe they didn&#39;t know that Caleb was a two timer....too bad for them. They were probably one of those girls who didn&#39;t care how their boyfriends treated them as long as they were hot and paid for their bills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ewww. I found myself wrinkling my nose in disgust. I could never date someone like Caleb. I mean that&#39;ll be the last thing I&#39;ll ever think of doing....</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here it is.&#34; Chloe&#39;s cheerful voice pulled me out of my thoughts. &#34;Sorry for making you wait so long.&#34; She flashed an apologetic smile at me but I smiled back telling her that it was okay. We ended up having a little chat before I left for my office, it was almost 6 pm and I was nowhere done with printing out the files and Caleb was also nowhere to be found. Well it was a good thing he wasn&#39;t here to bug me and make my life miserable, God knows what he&#39;d have done if he was still in the office, maybe give me another demanding task. I wasn&#39;t able to finish printing them out so I decided to arrange them carefully in my drawers and start where I left off tomorrow morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept mumbling a few prayers to myself hoping I didn&#39;t bump into Caleb on my way home. I was definitely in no mood to talk to him, I was already incredibly stressed and Mia was probably waiting for me back at the penthouse. Oh shit. Mia. I completely forgot to call her back when Caleb left. I reached into my bag keeping my eyes on the road as I searched for my phone. But just then her voice rang out,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Don&#39;t forget to get a tub of ice cream on your way home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yeah....the tub of ice-cream she wanted me to get her.&#34; I muttered to myself before swerving around a turn. I made a stop at Mia&#39;s favorite ice cream shop, it was a miracle that they were still open. Normally they&#39;d be closed by now. I ordered her favorite flavor, a 1-pint carton of Häagen-Dazs Dulce de Leche Ice Cream. It was a  creamy blend of caramel and vanilla ice creams, with swirls of dulce de leche caramel throughout....just how she liked it and as for me...I decided to just go plain and simple like I always did and order a half gallon tub of vanilla and banana ice-cream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was about heading to my car with the polythene bag in my hand when I heard a familiar voice. The hairs on the back of my neck stood still and just then my protective instincts kicked in. I quickly moved into my car, locking myself inside just in case something bad was about to happen. I heard the voice again just before I was about to start my car but this time it was a lot fainter than it was the first time which was perfectly reasonable since I was inside my car with all the windows rolled up. I glanced around trying to see if I could recognize anyone since the voice sounded so familiar but it was a bit dark so I couldn&#39;t see anything. A face lingered in the back of my mind but I kept shoving it away. There&#39;s no way he&#39;d be in this side of town. He doesn&#39;t live around here. I thought. But somehow fate always came up with mysterious ways to play pranks on me and this time they chose to bring the last person I wanted to see into my neighborhood. Working with him for eleven hours straight wasn&#39;t enough right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on Mother.&#34; Caleb emerged from the shadows with his hands resting behind his back, standing like he was waiting for someone behind him to catch up. Wait a minute....did he just say mother?</p>
