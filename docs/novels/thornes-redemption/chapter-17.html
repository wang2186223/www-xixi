                <p>Amaris POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear that our situation was becoming increasingly desperate. We had been frantically racking our brains for a viable escape plan, but every idea seemed to lead to a dead end. The building was surrounded, and our only somewhat plausible option was to take a perilous leap from a sixth-story window. The mere thought sent a shiver down my spine - the uncertainty was terrifying. Would we clear the surrounding forces, or would we land straight into their waiting arms? The risk was too great, and we both knew that jumping from such great height was tantamount suicide so we already waved it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I sat down beside her on the bed, I asked, &#34;Mia, what&#39;s our next move?&#34; Her head was buried in her hands, obscuring her face, but her body language and tense posture betrayed her frustration and despair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia&#39;s voice was barely audible, her words laced with desperation and a hint of defeat. &#34;If I told you I had any idea what to do right now, I&#39;d be a bloody liar,&#34; she whispered, her tone cracking with emotion. It was as if she was struggling to hold back tears, her vulnerability palpable in the darkness. The raw honesty in her words struck a chord, and I felt my own frustration and fear reflected back at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We sat in silence for what felt like an eternity, the only sound being our own ragged breathing. Then, suddenly, I tensed, my head cocked to one side. &#34;Mia, do you hear that?&#34; I whispered, my voice barely audible over the pounding of my heart. I strained to listen, my ears perked up like a rabbit sensing a predator. At first, I thought it was just my imagination, but then I heard it again - a faint pounding noise, distant but getting closer. My eyes locked onto Mia&#39;s, and I saw my own fear and uncertainty reflected back at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia&#39;s words sent a chill down my spine as she rose from the bed, her eyes wide with fear. &#34;If I knew, I&#39;d say it sounds like a bunch of heavy footsteps charging up the stairs,&#34; she whispered, her voice trembling. The humming noise had grown louder, now unmistakable as the sound of multiple footsteps thundering up the stairs. The floor beneath us began to vibrate, and my heart raced with anticipation. Mia&#39;s eyes locked onto mine, and I saw my own dread reflected back at me. We exchanged a silent understanding - our time was running out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh shit&#34; I muttered as I sprang to my feet, my body trembling with fear. Mia and I stood there, frozen in terror, as the footsteps drew closer and closer. We stared at each other, our eyes welling up with tears as we brace ourselves for the worst. The sound of boots pounding the stairs grew deafening, and our sobs were drowned out by the chaos. We clung to each other, our bodies shaking with fear, as the door burst open and our world came crashing down around us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the intruder&#39;s smug voice cut through the air, his eyes locked onto Mia&#39;s with an unsettling intensity. &#34;Hello, Miss Stone!! We&#39;ll need you and your friend to come with us. And let&#39;s be clear, we&#39;re not asking nicely. If you want, we&#39;ll take you by force.&#34; His words dripped with arrogance, and yet, my mind wandered to the absurdity of it all - this man, with his chiseled features and piercing gaze, could have graced the covers of magazines or strutted down catwalks. Instead, he chose a life of crime, his rugged good looks now a mere facade for the danger lurking beneath. My thoughts raced as I stood frozen, my heart trapped in a vice of fear, unable to process the surreal moment unfolding before me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shot Mia a warning glance, my eyes pleading with her to stay calm and not resist. I knew she was itching to fight back, to lash out against our captors, but I also knew that would be a grave mistake. If we wanted to survive this ordeal, we had to bide our time, wait for the right moment to strike. So I subtly shook my head, my eyes locked onto hers, willing her to understand. Let them think they&#39;ve got the upper hand, I thought. Let them take us wherever they&#39;re going. We&#39;ll observe, we&#39;ll wait, and we&#39;ll plan our escape. The key was to stay alive, to avoid provoking them into violence. At least, that was the plan, until we knew what lay ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we were dragged out of the room, the man&#39;s voice echoed through the hallway, his words dripping with curiosity. &#34;I&#39;ve heard a lot about you, Mia - about how resisting you are. Were they lying, or ..?&#34; His eyes narrowed, studying her, as if searching for any sign of defiance or rebellion. Mia&#39;s gaze never wavered, her expression a mask of calm, but I knew her well enough to detect the hint of tension in her shoulders, the slight tightening of her jaw. She remained silent, refusing to confirm or deny the accusations, her eyes fixed on some point ahead, her mind likely racing with strategies and plans for escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I haven&#39;t recovered from yesterday,&#34; Mia said, her voice strained, the tension in her body palpable as she struggled to keep her anger in check. But before the man could respond, the sound of screeching tires filled the air, and two sleek Range Rovers came to a halt in front of us, their gleaming bodies seeming to shimmer in the dim light of the garage. The sudden arrival of the vehicles was like a punctuation mark, cutting off the conversation and leaving us all frozen in anticipation. The doors swung open, and a suited driver gestured for us to get in, his eyes hidden behind sunglasses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sudden arrival of the Range Rovers seemed to catch our captor off guard, his suave demeanor momentarily faltering as he eyed the vehicles with a mix of curiosity and wariness. &#34;Who are you?&#34; He asked gruffly, his hand instinctively reaching for his gun, his eyes darting between the drivers and us, as if assessing the situation and weighing his options. The tension in his voice was palpable, a hint of uncertainty creeping into his expression, and for a moment, I wondered if we were about to witness a power struggle between rival factions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The suited man&#39;s response was devoid of emotion, his voice as calm as a still pond, yet somehow, it sent a shiver down my spine. &#34;Someone you do not want to mess with,&#34; he said. Then, his gaze shifted to us, and a charming smile spread across his face. &#34;Hello, pretty ladies,&#34; he said, his voice dripping with sophistication as he removed his sunglasses, revealing piercing eyes that seemed to see right through us. &#34;I was sent by Mr. Kian Beck, a friend of Mr. Thorne.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Here&#39;s an expanded version:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As I gazed into the suited man&#39;s chiseled features, my mind raced with the implications of his words. Kian Beck, the real estate mogul, was a name synonymous with power and influence. His reputation preceded him, a trailblazer in the cutthroat world of high-stakes deals and lucrative transactions. And Mr. Thorne... my thoughts trailed off as I exchanged a knowing glance with Mia. We both understood the gravity of our situation, and the unexpected twist that had just unfolded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The men who had kidnapped us seemed to fear Mr. Thorne, their eyes widening in a mix of awe and terror as they hastily retreated, abandoning their plans. Yet, we knew the truth - he wouldn&#39;t lift a finger to save us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But for now, we played along with relief and gratitude as we slid into the luxurious Range Rover. The soft leather enveloped us, a stark contrast to the cold, harsh reality of our circumstances. As the doors closed behind us, I turned to Mia and whispered, &#34;luck is glowing on us&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I couldn&#39;t help but wonder. Why did the criminal underworld fear Mr. Thorne? What secrets lay hidden behind his tech companies and piercing gaze? The questions swirled in my mind like a vortex, as the Range Rover pulled away from the curb, carrying us further into the unknown.</p>
