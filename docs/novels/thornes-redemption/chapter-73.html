                <p>Kian&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean I don&#39;t even get why he hates me so much. I hate him cause he&#39;s a rude, selfish, an incredibly annoying and disgusting human being and also cause he hates me...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amaris calm down.&#34; I let out a small laugh. &#34;Like I told you Caleb is not as bad as you think he is.&#34; I leaned back resting on the counter. I understood that Caleb could be rude to people sometimes....ok most times but when you get to know him really well....he&#39;s actually not that bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah....to you that is.&#34; She said with a tone of understated obviousness before placing her hand on her chest. &#34;To me he&#39;s an arrogant, selfish, rude, obnoxious, egotistical, jerk. I mean he even told me to stay away from your mother....like who does that?&#34; She furrowed her brows. I replayed her last words in my head with scrupulous detail. *He even told me to stay away from your mother.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He did what?&#34; I arched a brow causing her to purse her lips before covering it with her hands. Caleb actually told her to stay away from our mother? Why on earth would he do that? And why didn&#39;t he tell me? I raised my brows higher gesturing for her to speak, that was when she dropped her arms to the side before parting her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed them in a thin line again before she actually spoke. &#34;Caleb told me to stay away from your mother.&#34; She leaned back avoiding my gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scoured through my mind thinking of a reason why Caleb wouldn&#39;t want Amaris around mum but I couldn&#39;t think of one...even after putting myself in his shoes. &#34;Why?&#34; I wrinkled my forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34; She lifted her shoulders in a half shrug. &#34;One day your mother came to the company to give him cookies and she couldn&#39;t find her way to his office so I helped her and she also gave me a few cookies which tasted great by the way but when we arrived at his office he looked.....mad...&#34; She hesitated before saying. &#34;...ok he always looks mad but this time it was obvious and it felt like he was mad because we were together. Like does that even make any sense?&#34; She waved her hand in mid air. *It made a lot of sense* when it came to Caleb that is. &#34;Then he was like he doesn&#39;t want to see me anywhere near his mother...at first I didn&#39;t care because she&#39;s *his* mother but after knowing how sweet she is....&#34; She trailed off shrugging her shoulders again. &#34;I&#39;ll still have to stay away from her though....I don&#39;t want to do anything that&#39;s going to make me have another conversation with him again.&#34; As I stared at her, I couldn&#39;t help but notice the way her arms crossed over her chest, drawing my attention to her breasts.  My gaze drifted downward subconsciously and I felt a sudden jolt of electricity run through me. I had tuned out on her words, I was no longer listening to her....not at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind went blank as I stared, my thoughts consumed by the curve of her body. Earlier when she bumped into me I was trying do hard to not do anything stupid, anything that I&#39;ll probably regret later so she wouldn&#39;t think I was a sleazeball or creeper even though her soft boobs were pressing hard against my chest and my hands ached to touch them as a matter of fact it took everything in me not to touch her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt like I was drowning in the depths of my own desire, unable to look away from her. It was like time had stopped and all that existed was the gentle swell of her breast that dipped beneath her crossed arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was lost, I couldn&#39;t even remember what we were talking about. All I could hear we the thrum of my own pulse, the rush of blood to my face and the overwhelming urge to keep gazing at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would never forget the feeling of her soft skin against my hand when I held her earlier. Yes I wanted to pull her away from the grill but I could have touched any other part of her body like her arm or shoulder but I didn&#39;t know when next I was going to get an opportunity like that. The way the subtle yet sweet aroma wafted from her skin, the way the soft and creamy scent of vanilla mingled with the fresh and clean smell of her shampoo drawing me in, the way she slowly leaned into my touch for a tiny second giving me the impression that our thoughts were aligned. If only she knew how long I&#39;ve wanted her.....if only she knew how I&#39;d do anything to....</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kian?&#34; Her voice pierced the haze of my distraction making me snap back to reality and I felt a flush rise to my cheek as I realized my mistake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I struggled to refocus, pretending nothing had ever happened. &#34;What?&#34; I raised my brows. But I knew I had already been caught and I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling of embarrassment that lingered long after I looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I asked you a question...&#34; She said and I could tell from the she rubbed her thumb against her arm, the way her eyes flickered from place to place and from her tone that she felt a bit self conscious....thanks to me and my stupid hormones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Umm...&#34; I looked away rubbing the back of my neck gently. &#34;...right. Can you repeat it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nevermind.&#34; She pressed her lips together forming a forced smile. The air thickened with tension as we faced each other. It was as if the atmosphere had grown heavy and was weighing on my shoulders and every muscle in my body seemed to vibrate with strain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh...ok.&#34; I finally broke the silence. &#34;Do you want me to talk to Caleb about it?&#34; I blurted out the first thing that dropped in my mind.</p>
