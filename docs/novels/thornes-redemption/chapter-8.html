                <p>Caleb&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;s sexy, no shit, but I&#39;ve met and been with a lot of sexy women and never dreamed of them. Hell, just thinking about it made my blood boil. Finally, I made it. Looking around, I notice Kian&#39;s black Tesla in the corner. Thank God he&#39;s here because if I had come here and left, he&#39;d have been really sorry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t bother heading to the locker room to change, as I was already dressed in my workout gear. This gym was exclusively for members, which I most definitely was not, but that&#39;s the only good thing about influence and fame, it granted me access to places I wouldn&#39;t have otherwise been able to enter and trust me to capitalize on that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I headed straight for the private boxing and MMA studio. If there was anything I and Kian had in common, it was our love for martial arts, basically fighting in general. We loved seeing the pain on people&#39;s faces but after getting out of our treacherous past, we decided to unleash all that pain in the gym, even though it&#39;s on a dummy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sup bruv&#34; I said, interrupting his boxing session.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked over, a little smirk on his face as we shook hands. &#34;You interrupted my boxing session. I hope it&#39;s worth it, because if it&#39;s not, I&#39;ll use you in place of that dummy&#34; a little smile creases his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like me, Kian doesn&#39;t smile much, but when he does it&#39;s sincere. &#34;You know, I&#39;d like to take you up on that offer, let&#39;s see who&#39;s stronger&#34; I challenge him. Knowing Kian, he loves a good challenge, so unsurprisingly, he accepted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whoo bro. Like how are you still so strong? You don&#39;t work out as much as I do with all your work and traveling and shit, but you still succeed in beating me. Every. Single. Time.&#34; Kian said, while wiping himself down with the towel. &#34;You&#39;ve gotta tell me your secret, man&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smiling, I run my hand through my hair. &#34;I&#39;m almost always working, but those times when I&#39;m not, I put it to good use&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The only workout I know you do when you&#39;re not working, is bending some girl over,&#34; he teased, earning himself a punch on the shoulder. &#34;Anyways, you&#39;re here to see me, so. what&#39;s up?&#34; he asked more seriously this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah man. I almost forgot&#34; I said and began narrating everything about the dream to him. &#34;Bro, I don&#39;t know why I&#39;ll be having such dreams. I&#39;m so confused, man&#34; I said after narrating it to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at me and was extremely quiet, and knowing him, I knew he was about to say something silly. Just as if proving my thoughts, he immediately burst into laughter, earning a glare that he didn&#39;t notice or maybe noticed and just didn&#39;t care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You see Caleb, this was what I was talking about. What other perspective do you want me to give other than the one already given you by your mind?&#34; He laughed again, looking at me like I was a fool. I even began feeling like one at that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay let me put it into words so that you can understand. You. Want. To. Fuck. Her&#34; he emphasized each word like I was a fucking kid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; I get that you think so man, but I genuinely don&#39;t want to fuck her&#34; I try to convince him, or am I trying to convince myself?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And why is that? Isn&#39;t she sexy and beautiful?&#34; He lifted an eyebrow, a habit he&#39;s fond of doing when trying to make a fool of somebody.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know that man, but I hate her. Like so much bruv&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you really hate her? Or you&#39;re making yourself believe you hate her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question lingered in my head as I got on my way. Am I making myself believe I hate her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew that there was something more to it, but what that thing was, I don&#39;t know.  If it was nothing it&#39;d go away, but if it&#39;s something, then I&#39;m going to figure out what that thing is. But for now, I&#39;m going to take it up a notch in my strive to make Amaris Carter lose her cool in that office of ours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting into my car, I drive away thinking whether I should still go to the office, or if I should just go straight home. I couldn&#39;t decide so I headed home first to at least get a shower, after that I&#39;ll figure out whether or not to go to the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amaris POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ve been having a very persistent bad feeling in my guts all day like a nagging sense of unease that something is amiss or about to go terribly wrong, so I&#39;m being very cautious and conscious. I always listen to my guts, because my gut is never wrong, well it has never been wrong so far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before heading to work, I confided in Mia about the bad feeling I was getting, but she insisted I went to work, that if I got to work safely, then it might be related to my boss&#39;s safety, which seems unlikely and even far-fetched. She&#39;s crazy, I thought to myself before heading to work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my utmost surprise and delight, getting to work, that prick of a man, Caleb wasn&#39;t there. Damn, I hope Mia was right. I really wish he got hit by a train, because that&#39;s going to be the best thing ever. But I&#39;m not going to get my hopes up, well till at least an hour from now, to see if he comes or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For real though, something might be wrong. I&#39;ve known him for almost a year now and he&#39;s a sucker for his job&#34; Kiara gushed, &#34;he rarely ever misses a day of work&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ve grown quite close to Kiara in the space of two months I&#39;ve been working here. She&#39;s as kind and endearing as she is beautiful, with her angelic looks. She comes around the office almost everyday to see Caleb, who&#39;s her boyfriend I think, and it always ends in ear-splitting, cringe-causing sex, I think that&#39;s what it even starts with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look, I know he&#39;s your boyfriend and all but he&#39;s not really a nice person&#34; I said, &#34;so don&#39;t blame me if I say he deserves whatever bad thing that has happened to him&#34; I muttered under my breath in hope that she doesn&#39;t hear me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, first off, I heard you&#34; she said in her smooth rich voice that reminded me of dark chocolate. &#34;I get your point though, but I think there&#39;s a reason he&#39;s like that&#34;.</p>
