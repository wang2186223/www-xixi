                <p>Amaris&#39; POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jessica crossed her arms over her chest before letting out a small sigh. &#34;I came here to talk to you about something.&#34; She says with a dull expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jessica? Wants to talk to me about something? And she kind of looked serious about it? I stared at her with a scrutinizing look as I tried to read her eyes. What on earth did she want to talk about?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m listening.&#34; I lifted a brow mirroring her position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you to resign.&#34; I batted my lashes as I replayed her words in my head again. Did she just say resign? Why the hell did she want me to resign?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out an exasperated sigh as I rolled my eyes. &#34;Honey, if I could resign, I would have done it a long time ago. Do you think I enjoy working for that.....Mr. Thorne.&#34; I quickly corrected myself. I wasn&#39;t ready for Jessica&#39;s drama right now. Who knows what tantrum she&#39;s going to throw if I actually called Caleb names in front of her. Don&#39;t call him names he&#39;s my baby? Or How dare you call my baby boo names? Have some respect. Ugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok then. What&#39;s stopping you?&#34; She asked, causing my brows to shoot up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s stopping me? What&#39;s stopping me? What&#39;s stopping me is anytime I try to resign your baby doesn&#39;t let me.&#34; My lips twisted into a frown. &#34;Why do you want me to resign anyway?&#34; I didn&#39;t understand why she would want me out of Caleb&#39;s company. It wasn&#39;t like she was working here and she wanted to take my position. Looking at Jessica, she doesn&#39;t even look like someone who&#39;d want to ruin her polished nails, let alone work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because....&#34; She drawled. &#34;...I don&#39;t want you around Caleb.&#34; She hesitated a bit before telling me. My brows drew together as I processed her words. She didn&#39;t want me around Caleb? What does that even mean?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I batted my lashes. &#34;I&#39;m sorry. What now? You don&#39;t want me around Mr. Thorne? I&#39;m confused. Please explain.&#34; I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And here I thought you were smart.&#34; She lifted a brow and I ignored her snide comment. &#34;I don&#39;t want you around Caleb because I don&#39;t want you around Caleb. Do you need an explanation to understand that?&#34; She said, Oh I get it now. She didn&#39;t want me to be around Caleb because she saw me as a threat. It took everything in me not to laugh out loud....she actually saw me as a threat. I let out a small scoff. Like I&#39;d ever have anything to do with Caleb....he was a jerk, nothing but a pain and a thorn in my flesh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen sweetheart....I&#39;m not the one who&#39;s going to snatch your bunny boo away from you.&#34; I said with air quotes. &#34;So relax.&#34; I leaned back in my chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows furrowed as she asked. &#34;What do you mean you&#39;re not the one who&#39;s going to snatch him away from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh Jessica.&#34; I lightly packed my forehead. &#34;Don&#39;t tell me you think he&#39;s in love with you too?&#34; A mocking smile crept up my lips. I waited for her to say something but she didn&#39;t, she just stared at me so I kept talking. &#34;Mr. Thorne&#39;s going to dispose of you when he&#39;s tired just like he did with Kiara so if I were you I&#39;d cherish your so called time with him since you all adore him so much.&#34; I said my voice, laced with sarcasm. I picked up the cup of latte I had dropped earlier, taking a small sip as I watched her stare at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I cocked a brow. &#34;Why are you staring at me like that? You think Mr. Thorne is going to be with you forever and then marry you because he&#39;s in love with you all of a sudden?&#34; I asked before letting out a loud laugh earning a scowl from her. &#34;Dream on girl.&#34; I lifted the cup to my lips before saying. &#34;There&#39;s a reason he&#39;s called the cold hearted tycoon. Do you want to know why?&#34; A smile crept up my lips and even though she just glared at me, I carried on. &#34;It&#39;s because he doesn&#39;t care about other people&#39;s feelings. So I&#39;m going to give you some advice now....&#34; I slowly tapped my finger on the cup in my hands. &#34;You can run away, leave....before you get too attached and be all miserable like Kiara.&#34; I didn&#39;t know why but I actually felt bad for Kiara....maybe it&#39;s because she was nice to me. Even though I&#39;m not sure if she was actually in love with him or not. He hurt her...and now what was she going to tell her mum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You took Mr. Thorne away from Kiara and someone else will take him away from you and it would probably be like that till he dies because the Mr. Thorne I know won&#39;t fall for anyone.&#34; I swayed my swivel chair from side to side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know what you&#39;re doing.&#34; She narrowed her eyes into thin slits as she pointed at me. I watched her with a bored expression as I sipped on my latte. &#34;You&#39;re trying to get rid of me so you&#39;ll have Caleb all to yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scoffed, dropping my cup on my desk. &#34;Think what you want to boo. We&#39;re not even friends or co workers and I&#39;m giving you advice....if you&#39;re smart enough you&#39;ll listen but if you&#39;re not....well we all know what&#39;s going to happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nice try. Well unlike you....I&#39;ve got a pretty face and a sexy body.&#34; She raised her chin an inch higher as she looked down on me. &#34;I can make any man fall for me.&#34; She spoke confidently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I choked on my laughter. &#34;And you think Kiara didn&#39;t have a pretty face and a sexy body too?&#34; I arched a brow as I pushed myself off my chair. &#34;Do what you want and don&#39;t hate me for laughing at you when Mr. Thorne sends you away.&#34; I said as something dark flashed in her eyes. &#34;Well....it certainly hasn&#39;t been nice speaking to you.&#34; I pushed my seat aside as I stood beside my table, gesturing towards the door. &#34;You can leave now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll show you.&#34; Her eyes narrowed into thin venomous slits as she walked to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh and I&#39;ll be watching.&#34; My lips curled up. I tailed behind her watching her leave before closing the door behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ugh!&#34; I let out a small groan. &#34;What a bitch.&#34; I let out a small sigh before heading to my table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You took Mr. Thorne away from Kiara and someone else will take him away from you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down, I couldn&#39;t help wishing that someone else was much nicer and not a pain in the ass or probably by then I won&#39;t work here anymore. I let out another loud sigh as I collapsed in my chair. Oh how amazing life would be if I didn&#39;t see him anymore. I leaned back in my chair with my head thrown back as I spun around. No more stress, no more ridiculous tasks, I could probably take days off if I wanted to and I won&#39;t have to give a two weeks notice. I shut my eyes thinking about all the advantages I&#39;d have if I didn&#39;t work here anymore but my thoughts were interrupted when I heard a familiar voice and the recognizable squeak of the door as it creaked open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caleb? Are you in here?&#34; I jerked my head towards the door. I half expected Jessica to be standing by the door with some other foolish thing to say but I was stunned when I saw the woman at the door. What was she doing here and why was she looking for Caleb?</p>
