                <p>Amaris&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He left me there naked and sent someone to bring me clothes. I walked myself home embarrassed.. unsure of my feelings of what was wrong or right. But I did know that what he had done was wrong but I loved the way he kissed me, called my name, claimed me as his and touched me. I shuddered and felt butterflies in my stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finally got home and I was cold..felt ridiculous. Got in and Mia started asking all kinds of questions and I behaved just like a scum back when I yelled at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Leave me alone Mia. It&#39;s not your business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She left me alone and I could hear the opening and closing then the echoing of my own shattered heart. I picked up the phone and I swore I called Kian like a hundred times but I heard the same thing over and over again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The number you have called is busy and unable to pick this call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cried myself to sleep, laid on the bed feeling hopeless while waiting for my boring cycle to continue, then it clicked to meI kissed my boss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was I one of his playthings now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sun finally got up and decided to burn me into crisps so I reluctantly got up and had my bath. I looked up my wardrobe today and I had a change of heart..maybe I could try something a little bit modern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I was done, I looked at myself in the mirror and I couldn&#39;t recognize that sexy sweet looking girl. Then I blew myself a kiss and walked out of the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprisingly, there was a limo outside but I pretended to ignore it and I walked the other way but I noticed the car was following me then I heard rapid footsteps behind me. I turned back and I saw a weird looking man looking at me strangely then he uttered emotionlessly, &#34; The boss wants you to get into the car.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell your boss to fuck off&#34;, I muttered then walked faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew exactly who it was and I didn&#39;t want to be in space with him. What exactly does Caleb want? He has been trying to punish me for a while so what&#39;s with all this now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before I could think further, I realized I was floating and I saw the cold face before me and I started fighting with my whole body but he refused to let me go before he stuffed me into the car. I tried to maintain the silence to keep him uncomfortable, then he said coldly, &#34; Agent 412 remembered to get some change of clothes for Ammie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse you. Only my friends call me Ammie and there&#39;s clearly nothing wrong with my clothes&#34;, I said annoyedly while looking at him sternly. &#34; Agent 412, don&#39;t forget.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I harrumphed and crossed my hands together deciding to ignore his existence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amaris, what&#39;s my schedule today?&#34;he asked coldly, regaining his disdainful personality that I scorned. I replied in the same manner,&#34; You have a meeting with the board members then with the Top executives then an outing with Kiara as a top model to showoff our new product&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shift everything.&#34;, he said while maintaining a cold expression. I was completely speechless but I didn&#39;t question it instead I nodded humbly. Then he said shockingly, &#34; Have lunch with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I coldly rejected it without thinking twice and we were already at the company so I stepped down only to see Kiara standing like a pet in front of the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face changed once she saw me coming down and she ignored my greetings. I shrugged my shoulders and walked right in but his cold voice stopped me again, &#34; Amaris, you should work besides me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to slow down until we were walking shoulder by shoulder and I could here the people whispering about me being the new one warming his bed and sucking his dickI sneered from the whisperings wishing one would say it to my face so they would take a smack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kiara stood frozen in her spot. I pitied her since the term used and dump was similar to her situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>_____</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help but stop by her house after the wonderful time yesterday and I knew I wanted more and I would get more. I loved the way she moaned my name and clenched to my clothes from the pleasure. I wanted her legs wrapped around my waist while I pounded her and make her never see my cousin ever again. Just while I was in deep thoughts, I saw her sexy self coming out of the door and my eyes popped out of the socket with my mouth wild open..I could feel my dick pulsating and getting harder as the clock tick- her cleavage was pouring out of her clothes, her skirt tightly gripped her waist area showing off her buttocks and I groaned from the pain of being unable to release.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched as she rejected my agent&#39;s offer to get into the car and my patience grew thin as I got down the car and carried her. It undeniably felt so good holding her thin waist in my hands and I felt like kissing her at that very moment but I held myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought then came to me, other men would see my girl this way so I ordered Agent 412 to get new clothes for her but she rejected it without thinking twice. I continued to taunt her because I loved the sound of her voice and it gave me peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted lunch with her but she denied and got out of the car without waiting for me then I saw Kiara waiting for me stupidly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahhhhh what&#39;s she doing here?&#34;, I thought then proceeded to move past her without casting her a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then i stopped Amaris and we walked side by side but all of a sudden, I wanted to hold her hands when I saw the side glances from the male workers so I grabbed her waist and pulled her to myself without a heartbeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could sense the envy but there was a smug look on my face knowing that she was just mine then I saw a face I didn&#39;t want to see and she said, &#34; Kian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked away without looking at her but she chased after him after she flung my wrist to the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood there enraged then I roared, &#34; Amaris!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She continued moving but then I said, &#34; if you take a single step then you are fired and blacklisted.&#34;</p>
