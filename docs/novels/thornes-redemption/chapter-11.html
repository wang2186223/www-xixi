                <p>&#34;How are you sure? What if something happens before they get to her?&#34; She asked in a snotty voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s not look at the negatives, okay? Let&#39;s just pray and hope that she&#39;ll be fine, alright?&#34; Gracie was succeeding in trying to console Amaris, and Amaris was really grateful for it.</p>

                <p>Mia looked up at the sound of the door opening, to see a lean guy, with thick black hair framing his face and slightly hiding his copper colored eyes. In normal circumstances, he&#39;s the kind of guy Mia would have found attractive, but right now, she saw him equally as disgusting as the scarred guy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello there,&#34; the guy said, licking his lips. Mia, realizing he was horny, decided to bank on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come here&#34;, she whispered with a sultry smile, trying to be seductive. As he came closer, she leaned in and planted a soft kiss on his lips. She felt like throwing up all over him, but she was not about to blow her plan by doing something so stupid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Untie me so we can get down to business&#34; she said in a seductive purr, with the intent of beating him up and escaping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes ma&#39;am&#34; he replied, entranced by her grace and charm. As he began untying her, the door barged open revealing the scarred guy that seemed to be their leader.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello scarface&#34;, she sneered getting up, already fully untied, totally oblivious of the guy behind her shaking like a leaf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marlos, were you asked to untie her?&#34; Scarface asked dangerously calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No sir,&#34; Marlos replied, still shaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go meet Ryan for your punishment&#34; he said again calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No sir, not the punishment, please sir&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go now. He&#39;s just going to chop off your index finger, but in the next minute it&#39;ll be your index and middle finger&#34; he glared at Marlos. Crying like a child, Marlos ran out of the room, to go get his punishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what do we do with you?&#34; He said stalking closer to where Mia was standing. &#34;Daddy sweet doesn&#39;t want to come claim what&#39;s his, so what do we do to speed him up?&#34; Mia let out a manic laughter, looking at him like he was some crazy person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you think my father is going to come here or send anyone to, then you must be crazy&#34; she said standing her ground. Scanning the room discreetly, she notices the screwdriver on the steel table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I can get to that table, I can stab him with that screw driver, she thought to herself, but as she took her first step back, he growled at her, &#34;what&#39;d you think you want to do&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dragging her to the table, he bent her over, yanked her skirt up and ripped off her underwear. She tried to fight back but he was too strong for her, and she was already too weak from all the beating she had gotten before they left her apartment and the ones she had also gotten in this wooden cabin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, let&#39;s see what daddy has to say about us enjoying his beautiful princess,&#34; he mocked. &#34;Don&#39;t forget to smile at the camera,&#34; he pointed to a spot near the ceiling. She didn&#39;t realize there was a camera until that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t do this&#34; she cried, feeling scared all of a sudden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, so now you know how to beg? Well, sorry, but I&#39;m not interested&#34; he said, pulling his pants down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please&#34; she whispered again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up&#34; he yelled at her, spanking her ass and shoving himself into her. &#34;Ooooh, so tight&#34; he taunted her, as she cried in pain and disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell is going on?&#34; He abruptly pulled out of her, just mere minutes after their encounter had begun. He listened very carefully at what sounded like gunshots.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello there&#34; a tall handsome guy stood in the doorway, staring down scarface who had his pants down and his dick hanging out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who the hell are you?&#34; scarface asked, his face red with embarrassment and anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caleb Thorne&#34; Mia whispered in awe, totally forgetting that her naked ass was hanging in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who the hell is Caleb Tho&#34; scarface was saying. Realizing who was standing in front of him, his mouth fell open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we entered the cabin, we were met with a staggering sight: 32 heavily armed men standing guard. It seemed absurd that such a large force would be dedicated to protecting Maya - or Mira, or whatever her name was. I couldn&#39;t fathom why she would warrant such extensive security. Was she an important person? Nah. She can&#39;t be, because the apartment I had seen earlier hardly suggested she was a person of significance. And this...structure, it was hardly a cabin. It was a grand, sprawling mansion made of wood, far more opulent than I had expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaving my team to handle the men outside, I head in search of the girl. Where the hell do I go first? This place is fucking huge. Looking around, I notice a guy running out the back door, his hand bandaged. I think he cut himself, or.lost his fingers? Going after him, I grab him by the scruff of his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please let me go. I promise, I&#39;ll do whatever you want&#34; he cried, shaking like a leaf. I&#39;ve met 13 year olds with more balls than this pussy ass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s the girl?&#34; I asked him, spite clearly staining my tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you go up the stairs, the third room to the right&#34; he said, &#34;now I&#39;ve told you, you have to promise that you and your guys won&#39;t hurt me&#34; he had balls now that it came to striking a deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you&#34; I smiled, glad that he made my job easier, &#34;but I can&#39;t promise you that&#34; I said disgusted at how easily he snitched on his own people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I headed towards the stairs, he made a run for it. He didn&#39;t get very far though.  He couldn&#39;t anyways, at least not with the bullet Viktor put in his leg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting to the door, I was surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their leader&#39;s recklessness was staggering. He was committing an act as heinous as rape with the door wide open, exposing his criminality to anyone who might walk in. It was clear that whoever had hired them had made a grave mistake, wasting their resources on incompetence. I mentally noted to investigate the motives behind her kidnapping once we had resolved the immediate situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello there&#34; I greeted with a mocking smile on my face, disgust filling me as I caught sight of his cock hanging out.</p>
