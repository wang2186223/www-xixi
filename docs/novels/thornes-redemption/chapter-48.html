                <p>&#34;Get away from me.&#34; Amaris pushed herself off my chest as she stumbled again but this time she was quick enough to grab the sofa before she fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my God.&#34; I let out a small sigh as I pinched between my brows. I had never met a woman as frustrating as she was. If she wasn&#39;t intoxicated right now she would have enjoyed seeing me this frustrated. &#34;Why did you lie to me?&#34; I dipped my hands into my pockets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t need to know that.&#34; Her lips twisted into a scowl as she crossed her arms over her chest averting my gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you hear yourself?&#34; I raised my eyebrows. &#34;You are drunk.&#34; I drawled. &#34;You are in the middle of a club partying with your friend who is also drunk.&#34; She let out a small huff as she rolled her eyes. &#34;What do you think other people are going to say when they find out that you work for me, huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And why am I supposed to care about your reputation?&#34; She sized me up. &#34;If you think I am not responsible enough to be an employee at your fucked up company then why don&#39;t you just fire me.&#34; She raised her shoulders in a half shrug. &#34;Fire me. Get a new secretary and then, poof. All your problems will go away.&#34; She rambled. &#34;Don&#39;t you want all your problems to go away, huh Mr. Thorne?&#34; She moved closer, close enough that I could feel her body heat as my gaze dropped to her exposed tummy that was only covered with thin strands of cloth. She then placed her finger on her lip. &#34;Or are you keeping me for another reason? Hmm?&#34; She then pressed her body against mine before lifting her gaze to meet mine and for a second there I almost forgot that she was drunk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm.&#34; I scoffed. &#34;You actually think that I&#39;d stoop that low to fuck my own secretary huh?&#34; I leaned in closer, close enough that our lips were almost touching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think....I know.&#34; She purred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what are you trying to do now?&#34; I lifted a brow. &#34;Seduce me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re drunk.&#34; My lips twisted into a scowl as I pulled away before I did something that we were both going to regret. &#34;We&#39;ll talk about this on Monday,&#34; I sidestepped her, moving away from the lounge area. It was a Saturday and Sundays were the only days she didn&#39;t come to work so we couldn&#39;t talk about this tomorrow and I couldn&#39;t sacrifice my weekend away from here just because I wanted us to talk. I didn&#39;t bother turning back....her friend was going to come help her anyway so that was none of my business. I was already far away from her but I could still smell her perfume wafting around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So then you asked her to have sex with you? I mean it&#39;s the only reasonable explanation....you were the one who was lusting after her after all....</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was a mistake....</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of these were probably happening to me because I drank too much. I thought to myself as I let out a small sigh. &#34;Now all I need to do is take out my frustration on the woman waiting for me upstairs.&#34; I said to myself as I walked into the elevator. &#34;I really hope she&#39;s worth the time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>~~~~~~~~~</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you&#39;re telling me she lied to you so she could go clubbing with her friend.&#34; Kian&#39;s brows shot up as he leaned back on his chair. It was the last Sunday in the month and we always had dinner together at Miranda&#39;s place....I was so worked up about work that it kind of slipped my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lightly shook my head before turning towards the kitchen. &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; Miranda asked, walking out from the kitchen with a tray of food in her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean what&#39;s wrong?&#34; I lifted a brow as I watched her place the dishes on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look.....&#34; She paused, sizing me up. &#34;...mad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then Kian let out a loud chuckle, his chest rumbling with laughter. &#34;Oh come on mother, he always looks like that.&#34; He said still laughing as I frowned at him. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, just ignore him. He&#39;s just mad at his PA for lying to him so she could go clubbing with her friend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it the sweet young lady I met the other day?&#34; Miranda&#39;s face lit up and deepened my frown even more. I didn&#39;t get why Miranda liked her so much when all she did was cause trouble for me. I mean she wouldn&#39;t stop talking about her ever since that night I helped her at the ice cream shop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold up...&#34; Kian&#39;s brows drew together as he sat up. &#34;You know her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well....if you guys are talking about the young lady we met at the ice cream store a few weeks ago who works at Caleb&#39;s company, then yes.&#34; She dipped her head in a small nod as she turned to head back into the kitchen since she wasn&#39;t done taking out the food. We wanted to help her but she insisted we sat at the table since we were her guests for the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kian then turned his head towards me the second Miranda disappeared into the kitchen. &#34;You didn&#39;t tell me she was there that night?&#34; A small smile crept up his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You never asked.&#34; I said in a casual tone. His jaw dropped as a faint gasp escaped his lips. He was always the dramatic one in our group and by our group I meant just me and him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And that doesn&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t tell me.&#34; He leaned back into his chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mhmmm.&#34; I blinked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay....Dinner is served.&#34; Miranda announced grabbing our attention as she walked in with another tray in her hand. The smell of mashed potatoes and gravy wafted in the air. &#34;Hope you like it.&#34; She beamed at us as she pulled out one of the chairs from underneath the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You cooked them mother. Of Course we&#39;ll love it.&#34; Kian smiled back, reaching for one of the serving dishes. &#34;Oh my goodness,&#34; Kian exclaimed as he drew in the intoxicating aroma of the food. &#34;How long has it been....a decade?&#34; He questioned dropping the lid by the side. We were having roasted chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy for dinner which was one of my favorite dishes and as much as i wanted to thank and shower Miranda with praises i didn&#39;t want Kian to see how vulnerable I could get when I was with Miranda if not he was going to use it to tease me for the rest of my life and I wouldn&#39;t have cared if it was anyone else but this was Kian we were talking about. The most annoying creature on earth, well apart from women in general.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fire me. Get a new secretary and then, poof. All your problems will go away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caleb?&#34; Miranda called out with a worried look on her face as she pulled me out of my thoughts. Great. I couldn&#39;t even have a normal dinner without thinking about that nasty woman. &#34;Aren&#39;t you hungry? I thought roasted chicken was your favorite....&#34; She reached for the knife beside her. I was about to speak when she said. &#34;I mean that&#39;s the only reason I made it in the first place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Umm hello. He&#39;s not your only son, you know. Why didn&#39;t you make my favorite meal?&#34; Kian&#39;s lips twisted into a scowl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s because she loves me better.&#34; A small smile crept up my lips as I reached for the plate in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh shut up.&#34; Kian rolled his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kian....there is no need to be mad.&#34; Miranda let out a light chuckle. &#34;You know I love you both and besides I made your favorite dish last time, it&#39;s only fair Caleb gets a turn.&#34; She grabbed the dishing spoon from Kian as she carefully dished out generous portions onto our plates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just wait till I tell your business partners about this.&#34; I said, earning a glare from Kian as my smile widened. No matter how much I hated to admit, the only time I really smiled was when I was around Kian and Miranda. A certain brunette with sparkly hazel eyes flashed in my head but I immediately shook off the thought. She didn&#39;t make me smile. All she did was cause trouble for me and I was going to make sure she regretted every single second of her day at work tomorrow. Every damn second.</p>
