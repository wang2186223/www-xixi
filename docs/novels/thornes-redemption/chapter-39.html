                <p>Caleb&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t quite understand what was happening to me. I&#39;d never been this bored in my whole life. Surely it had nothing to do with the fact that Amaris took a day off to go visit her mother....but I couldn&#39;t shake off the empty feeling inside of me. I had tried bossing other people around giving them useless demanding tasks but it wasn&#39;t as fun as getting Amaris riled up. They just nodded their head and complied immediately....none of them put up a fight like she did. None of them glared at me like they were going to empty a gun in my head if they had the chance. No. I can&#39;t be missing that brat. I&#39;d just gotten used to seeing her annoyed face everyday so that&#39;s why today felt kind of odd. Yes....that&#39;s exactly what happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes wandered around my office before resting on the wall clock. 4:17. I could leave if I wanted to, after all...I am the boss but I didn&#39;t feel like leaving. I felt like I hadn&#39;t accomplished anything today which was the complete opposite because I had closed deals with investors and other business partners that are major shareholders in my company and I had also attended a conference earlier today with the purpose of building my relationship with other companies and explored potential partnerships and I&#39;ll have to admit....it didn&#39;t go so bad. At least the people there weren&#39;t nosy business men and the most important one of all was we finally finished one of our new products that we were going to be launching next week which was going to be a big revenue generator for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So then....why did I feel so...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My thoughts screeched to a halt when an idea dropped in my head. A smug smile spread across my lips as I pushed myself off my leather chair. I picked up my phone heading towards the door as I straightened my suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Finally....&#34; I said wrapping my hands around the door handle before pushing it open. &#34;...a distraction. Something I can use to pass time.&#34; I said out loud walking into Amaris office. She usually locked her office but since I had the key to every room in this building it wasn&#39;t a problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I found myself inhaling her familiar vanilla scent as I closed the door behind me. Even while she was gone her scent lingered in her office. I shook my head rolling my eyes as I approached her desk. I wasn&#39;t looking for anything in particular though....I just wanted to go through her desk and see if I could find anything that would spark my interest. Some people might see this as an invasion of privacy but how could it be an invasion of privacy if you practically owned the place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I searched through her desk seeing if I could find anything but all I saw was lots of folders and different documents. I reached deeper into the drawer careful enough not to wreck anything so she wouldn&#39;t know that I was here and even if she did she won&#39;t be able to do a fucking thing about it. My fingers closed around a cold wooden substance and I pulled it out. There in my hands was a framed photo of Amaris and two other women, one older and one younger. The picture looked like it was taken a few months ago or probably a year since Amaris looked a little younger than she was now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The older woman standing by her right from the looks of it was probably her mother since Amaris looked a lot like her and the younger girl standing by her left was likely to be her little sister judging from the way Amaris wrapped her hand around her. It was surprising though, she looked nothing like them....she probably looked like her father. Come to think of it....where is her father? Is he dead?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dropped the photo back in the drawer and searched for something else. When I didn&#39;t find any I moved to the filing cabinets in the corner and I still couldn&#39;t find anything. I guess she was more boring than I expected. I moved back to her leather chair about to sit on it when I saw a photo on the floor....it wasn&#39;t framed this time. It must have fallen from one of the folders earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked it up, flipping it over revealing a beaming younger Amaris, her smile radiant and her eyes sparkling with mirth and behind her was a guy who looked a bit older but not old enough to be her father....probably her brother? No. If he was her brother he would have been in the other picture. Maybe he wasn&#39;t just around when they took it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes dropped to his arms that were wrapped around her. He stood behind Amaris and he was a bit taller so he had to bend over a little so he rested his chin on her shoulders. The position looked too intimate for him to be her brother, their bodies were too close and his lips were too close to her neck as a matter of fact he was basically giving her a peck on her neck. I couldn&#39;t really see his face since her hair got in the way but I could tell that his eyes were closed. I felt something rise in my chest as I stared at the picture. Why the hell was she keeping this in her office? I was about crumpling the photo when I heard the door swing open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There you are....&#34; Kiara tapered off as her gaze dropped to the photo in my hand, she then lifted her eyes again meeting mine. &#34;What are you doing?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s none of your business.&#34; I locked eyes with her as I reached for the drawer pulling it out before placing the photo back inside. I didn&#39;t care if Amaris knew I was here....what I wouldn&#39;t is Kiara knowing I was looking through her stuff. I couldn&#39;t bear to listen to her series of questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stiffened at my tone before a smug smile crept up her lips. She then moved forward, closing the distance between us. &#34;What do you want?&#34; My lips twisted into a scowl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She circled the table and stood less than an inch away from me before answering. &#34;You.&#34; She trailed get finger down my chest. I was getting sick of her....she wasn&#39;t as fun to play with as she was before. I needed a new mistress.....with a much tighter pussy. One who was going to do everything I say like she did. No questions asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t say or do anything other than lift my brow. She must have gotten used to that reaction because the next thing I knew, I was sitting on the chair. &#34;What are you doing?&#34; I asked with a bored expression. I knew exactly what she was doing or rather what she was about to do and I wasn&#39;t the type to protest in this type of situation unless I was angry or wasn&#39;t in the mood. Maybe I&#39;ll just give her one last chance before I dispose of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does it look like I&#39;m doing?&#34; She said in a sultry manner as she straddled my lap. She didn&#39;t excite me like she used to....another reason to dispose of her. She wrapped her hands around my neck as she buried her face in my neck peppering light kisses on my collarbone. I was waiting for my hormones to kick in but still nothing. She began moving her hips up and down as she rocked me and my body reacted almost instinctively as my arms encircled around her waist but my hormones hadn&#39;t kicked in yet. Her wet lips moved from my neck following my jaw line before finding my lips. She must have thought that I was enjoying this but the truth was.....</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the freaking hell?!&#34; A familiar voice rang out and Kiara&#39;s head snapped towards the door. I couldn&#39;t see who was at the door thanks to Kiara&#39;s flowing hair. I had to tilt my head to the left before I locked gazes with a pair of blazing hazel eyes glaring at me. What the fuck was she doing here?</p>
