                <p>I was tensed, jittery and perturbed, hoping he opens up. I left the hospital early just to come over to his apartment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was everything I needed but unfortunately, my boss was becoming a third wheel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rang his doorbell for a long time, tired of waiting but it seems he wouldn&#39;t answer. I&#39;d feel that way too if I were in his shoes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a soft sigh and intended to take my leave when the door chimes open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled sadly as I was staring at him now. He left the door open and I stepped inside, my heart scampering with excitement that he let me in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s too early to disturb my peace of mind?&#34; He whispers lazily dragging his feet to his couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see his dog, a Maltese, lagging out it&#39;s tongue and rolling on the ground with excitement written all over its face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wagged it&#39;s tail and ran to hide behind kian&#39;s leg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want amaris, it&#39;s the weekend not work days&#34; he mused drawing my attention back to him and I nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard he was ill and it was obvious judging from how he look, I guess he haven&#39;t eaten either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just well, stopped by to say hi as a colleague&#34; i responded in between my teeth and he ran his fingers through his hair, staring at me unbelievably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should be with him, besides, you&#39;re dating&#34; he mused while closing his eyes and growling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I folded my lips and exhaled softly. I didn&#39;t respond to his words again and paced towards the kitchen to prepare something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t stop me even if he wanted to and watch me prepare lunch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to engage him in talks but he was quiet and kept scrolling on his phone. It was obvious, he&#39;s trying to avoid me because he thinks Caleb and I are dating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are not dating Kian&#34; I pointed out but he let out a silent hiss and dragged his feet to the dining table which was close to the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was done cooking chicken chowder soup and placed the pot on the table with bowls that we could have the soup in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, before we could dig in, I heard the doorbell ring. We both glanced at ourselves and I gestured to Kian if perhaps he was having an guest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head, and I lowered my gaze back to the table but the doorbell came again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d check it out&#34; I responded slowly rising from my seat. Hastily, I stride towards the door and when I spur it open, I was shocked to find Caleb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze where I stood, too stunned to speak as I thought of perhaps I was staring at a ghost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I intended to slam the door but he placed his hand quickly on the door knob and opened the door widely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes blaze at me and I lost my breath. Why? Why does he keep showing up? Not when I&#39;m trying to make things up with Kian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bite my lower lips wanting to push him away just so Kian wouldn&#39;t find out. This is so embarrassing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor says he can be discharged in two days, why is he here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cleared my throat intending to address him but he pushed me from his way and got inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stuttered aside and widened my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s that?&#34; Kian asked and I could hear his footsteps behind me which halts immediately he sighted Caleb which I guess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my face at Kian who seems surprised too, finding the boss in his house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was so scared, what if they break into a fight?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kian gave Caleb a slight bow and I almost moved towards where he stood but Caleb grabbed my hand and pulled be back to stand beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He suddenly raised a package up with a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t I permitted to visit an employee?&#34; He asked and my heart thuds fast as sweat beads on my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kian and I locked eyes as he exhaled and said;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s the weekend and I don&#39;t like surprise guest&#34; he pointed out while I ducked my head, curious to know what&#39;s in the package bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb scoffed unbelievably, I doubt if he got any strength in him after driving a long distance here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is the calmest he can be. He sniffed his nose and pulled me with him towards the dinning table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t his house and he shouldn&#39;t be behaving this way. I drew my hand from him and pant heavily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I threw my gaze at Kian and I saw him drawing closer to the dining table. He was annoyed but has to keep up to Caleb&#39;s nuisance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I studied these two and they were glaring at themselves. Caleb brought out a bottle of whiskey from the package bag on placed it on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gestured to me to get some glass cups, I was hesitant for a while but then I quickly got three glass cups and returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you go on to prepare meals to anyone that calls you pretty?&#34; He muses staring at the mini pot of chowder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I eyed him as his aura was already ruining the mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She does it for special people, I presume you&#39;re not on the list&#34; Kian replied with a cold gaze at him that I gasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, this is bad. He barely tame Caleb&#39;s pride but it seems he was fed up already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb scoffed while I pretended not be in their midst. I placed the glass cup at everyone&#39;s end and intended to take my plate and serve myself but Caleb pulled it from my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But we&#39;ve fucked, at least I own her body&#34; Caleb bragged and my soul left me. My hands were trembling where I sat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt so embarrassed and returned a glare at Caleb who smirked at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And each time, she begs me not to stop...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop!&#34; I screamed hating this moment, how can he embarrass me in this manner? He always force himself on me.</p>
