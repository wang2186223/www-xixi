                <p>Amaris&#39; POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had been trying to get a taxi for the past few minutes and it&#39;s either they were occupied or simply ignoring my waving hand. I was about to give up when a car pulled up right in front of me, it didn&#39;t look like a taxi though, its brake lights flashing red like a beacon in the twilight. I peered through the open window and my jaw dropped as I recognized the figure seated inside, It was....Kian?  What the heck was he doing here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t look as surprised as I was though, obviously he was the one who stopped the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, what are you doing out here?&#34; he asked, leaning towards the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trying to get a ride home obviously,&#34; I rolled my eyes. &#34;My luck isn&#39;t exactly great at the moment.&#34; I pressed my lips together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you had a car?&#34; He questioned lifting his brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah....but I left it at the mechanic. They said it had some issues and it was going to take time to fix it and I couldn&#39;t wait since I was already late to work.&#34; I explained. And now I regret not waiting because I&#39;m stuck out here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay then....&#34; He said turning back to the road with his hands wrapped around the steering wheel. &#34;....hop in.&#34; He lifted his shoulders in a half shrug and when I didn&#39;t say anything for a few seconds he shifted his gaze back to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want to drive me home?&#34; I asked, just in case I was misunderstanding him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked a bit surprised and confused when he heard my question. &#34;Yeah....sure. Why not?&#34; He let out a small laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could think of many reasons why he shouldn&#39;t drop me off but I just went with the most obvious reason. &#34;You&#39;re my boss&#39; friend.&#34; I enveloped myself in a self-hug, seeking comfort in the warmth of my own arms as I rubbed my elbows with my thumb. It was getting a bit more chilly outside and I kind of forgot to take my coat with me. &#34;I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll like the idea of his friend dropping his employee off.&#34; I tilted my head slightly before lifting my shoulders in a half shrug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah....I&#39;ll worry about that.&#34; He placed his hands on his chest before gesturing to the empty spot beside him. &#34;Now get in, it&#39;s getting a bit cold outside. We wouldn&#39;t want you freezing to death now would we? After all, we basically live in the same building.&#34; He said and I had to admit, he was right. We did leave in the same building and he said he was going to take care of it if Caleb found out. Not that I was scared of him or anything, I just didn&#39;t know how he was going to react and I wasn&#39;t ready for his drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay....if you say so.&#34; I said in a singsong manner as I circled around his car, making my way to the passenger&#39;s seat in front. &#34;Thanks by the way. It means a lot.&#34; I smiled at him as I got into the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh no....I&#39;m just lending out a hand in any way I can.&#34; His lips curled up as he turned the key in the ignition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah....and that&#39;s something Mr. Thorne would never do because he&#39;s the cold hearted tycoon.&#34; I rolled my eyes turning to the window as he pulled out of the road side. &#34;It&#39;s like the only reason he was sent to this earth is to make my entire life miserable,&#34; my lips twisted into a scowl as I put on my seat belt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s Caleb for you....&#34; He let out a small chuckle as his eyes were still fixed on the road. &#34;I guess he just wants to live up to his name....being the thorn in people&#39;s flesh.&#34; He said his voice, laced with sarcasm. A smile crept up my lips when I remembered I had used that same phrase once when I was pissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m surprised you&#39;re even saying things like this Mr. Beck,&#34; I chortled. &#34;I mean I thought he&#39;s your friend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes....he is my friend.&#34; His grip tightened on the steering as he took a right turn down the road. &#34;That doesn&#39;t mean I won&#39;t tell the truth....besides I tell him everytime and from what I&#39;ve seen, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s changing anytime soon.&#34; He laughed and a few seconds later I joined him. &#34;Well....not until he falls in love that is...&#34; His expression turned serious as he kept his eyes fixed on the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fall in love?&#34; The word sounded foreign as it rolled off my tongue, not because I didn&#39;t believe in love or anything but because it was used with the one person who didn&#39;t know anything about love. &#34;Caleb Thorne....CEO of Throne Enterprise? In love? You must be joking.&#34; I let out a loud laugh. Caleb...In love. Then it&#39;s definitely the end of the world. &#34;I don&#39;t even think he&#39;s going to get married. He only sees women as sex toys... nothing more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chest rumbled with laughter, &#34;You&#39;ve only worked with him for a couple of months and you already know him so well.&#34; He said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a world weary sigh before looking out the window, watching the buildings roll past as the world got darker. I couldn&#39;t stop the images from flashing in my mind. Caleb going out of his way just to make a woman happy, buying her flowers, taking her on wonderful dates, I couldn&#39;t help but burst out laughing....I didn&#39;t know why but it looked so weird and funny. &#34;He&#39;s not that bad.&#34; I heard Kian say, breaking the little silence that had settled between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34; I snapped my head towards him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s not that bad.&#34; He glanced at me with a small smile. I batted my lashes as I replayed his words in my head. He&#39;s not that bad?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyebrows shot up. &#34;He literally enjoys watching me suffer....&#34; I said with hand gestures. &#34;...and gates it when I&#39;m having fun or when I&#39;m not working or when I&#39;m not stressed and you say he&#39;s not that bad?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a pent up sigh. &#34;I&#39;ve been friends with him for years...Amaris.&#34; I stiffened at the sound of my name on his lips. This was the first time I actually heard him call my name ever since the day we met and I had to admit I kind of liked it. &#34;We literally grew up together. I know he can be pretty mean sometimes but...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are you even a friend of Mr. Thorne?&#34; I asked the second the question dropped in my head. He paused for a moment and it took him a few seconds before he glanced at me with a confused smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean....he&#39;s a grumpy demon and you&#39;re...&#34; I gestured towards him looking for the right words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m what?&#34; His smile widened as he waited for me to finish my sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nice and sweet.....I mean Caleb would have never offered me a ride home even if we&#39;re living in the same freaking house.&#34; I winced at the mental image of seeing Caleb everyday and having to put up with him even at home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think I&#39;m nice and sweet.&#34; He suddenly pulled over and that was when I glanced around trying to make out my surroundings. It took me a while to realize we weren&#39;t home and we just stopped in front of a huge bakery? What were we doing in front of a bakery?</p>
