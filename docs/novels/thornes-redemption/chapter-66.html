                <p>Amaris&#39; POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said with my eyes closed. I didn&#39;t give a damn about how Jessica felt, last time I checked she didn&#39;t care about other people&#39;s feelings too so there was no need for me to sugarcoat my words when I talked to her. She finally got the message and stormed off. Stupid brat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>~~~~~~~~~</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And he was like he wasn&#39;t going to say anything.&#34; I rolled over still clutching my phone in my hand as I spoke. I had half expected Kian to return and ask about the progress we&#39;ve made just like he said earlier but he never showed up. Well...there was always tomorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my God. So you mean he actually heard every word I said?&#34; Mia&#39;s eyes widened. She had seen my text earlier and sneaked out of the house late at night just so we could talk. Knowing Mia she&#39;d do anything to hear a spicy story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh yeah. I&#39;m even surprised he didn&#39;t actually say anything about it. I mean he was standing right there.&#34; I placed my phone on the bed as I rested my head on a pillow.  &#34;Now thanks to you I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to talk to him or even see him without recalling that one moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry.&#34; She winced. &#34;My bad....but look on the bright side we know he&#39;s interested for sure now.&#34; A smirk crept up her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34; I scrunched my brows. &#34;Are we still talking about this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Obviously.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What makes you think he&#39;s interested in me this time.&#34; I said with a dull expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He didn&#39;t say anything about it.&#34; I stared at her for a while before palming my forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you freaking kidding me? Just because he....&#34; I was interrupting by the faint chiming sound I heard from downstairs. The doorbell? I thought I had imagined it until it rang out again. It was almost 9pm, who on earth could be at the door by this time...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; Mia asked, jolting me out of my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh it&#39;s just the doorbell.&#34; I said getting up from the bed. &#34;No worries I&#39;ll get it.&#34; I waved off her question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not like you have a choice.&#34; She said as the doorbell rang out again. When I finally got to the door I looked through the peephole to see who it was but I couldn&#39;t see anyone. I moved to the closest window to see if I could see anyone at the door. I shifted the curtains aside, pressing my body against the wall but still no one was at the door. The doorbell rang out again and my lips twisted into a frown as I dropped my phone on the closest table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is it?&#34; Mia asked after being quiet for so long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34; I said grabbing the closest thing I could find. A bat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you want to open it?&#34; Her eyebrows shot up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Chill, I&#39;ll be okay.&#34; I picked up the bat. I didn&#39;t know what it was doing in our living room but I was glad it was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh...&#34; She let out a small laugh. &#34;I bought that some weeks ago just in case there were any ribbers around who needed a good beating.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right.&#34; I smiled as I moved closer to the door with the bathroom in my hand. *Another ring.* With a flick of my wrist, I twisted the key, grabbing the handle as I pulled the door open and the bat fell from my hand as I saw who stood at the other side of the door. Oh my God.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kian&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand mother...&#34; I heaved a sigh as I held the phone to my ear. This was the third time she had called me today, the first time when I was on my way here and then the second was when I excused myself while I was talking with Amaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I mean Kian&#39;s hot and so freaking sexy. I think he&#39;ll make a good boyfriend plus judging by his looks he&#39;ll probably be good in bed so girl....you definitely can&#39;t miss out on this...at least for the sex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I found it hard to concentrate on mum&#39;s words as I replayed the whole scene in my head. I had lied to her, I didn&#39;t hear everything....I just walked in at the last part but I could definitely guess what had been going on from what I heard. I knew Amaris found me attractive...I mean I did catch her staring and checking me out countless times even if she always denied it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;...and also when are you going to bring that girl to dinner?&#34; Mother had been nagging me for days now. Ever since she found out that Amaris and I were actually friends she kept bugging me and asking me to bring her to dinner. It&#39;s not that I didn&#39;t like Amaris...or not that I didn&#39;t find her attractive. Believe me when I say I was absolutely smitten with her. Her warm hazel eyes, her chestnut brown hair, her infectious laughter....all of it was spellbinding. I couldn&#39;t even get enough of her but I didn&#39;t want to rush things. When I told her that she smelt nice today she acted like I had just committed an unforgivable sin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Working on it mum.&#34; I let out a small sigh. &#34;She&#39;s not going to agree to come to dinner if I just randomly ask her.&#34; Initially mother wanted Caleb to bring Amaris to dinner. Since she worked for him she&#39;d assumed that would be a lot easier but when she saw how much they hated each other....she turned to me which was kind of disappointing since she saw me as a second option but I was cool with it. At least I wasn&#39;t second to Caleb when it came to our relationship with Amaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s nonsense.&#34; I could practically see her waving off my comment. &#34;Amaris&#39; a nice girl....of course she&#39;d say yes if you ask her out.&#34;</p>
