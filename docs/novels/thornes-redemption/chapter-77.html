                <p>&#34;Oh.....&#34; I dropped my hand to my side before looking up at him. &#34;Okay then....&#34; I stared up at him all ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ummm....thanks again for the delicious snacks.&#34; He smiled nervously eliciting a small smile out of me. &#34;Would you like to try this again?&#34; My eyes widened when I heard his question. I had felt a spark between us yes, but I didn&#39;t actually think he was going to ask me out. &#34;....I&#39;m not talking about the kiss...I&#39;m talking about the snacks and the movie....like a real date.&#34; He then looked away rubbing the back of his neck as he mumbled to himself but it was loud enough for me to hear. &#34;Not that I don&#39;t want the kiss, I mean I would really love to kiss you again but that&#39;s not important right now.&#34; He cleared his throat. &#34;I just....well....thought we should go on a real date...&#34; He kept on babbling as I stared at him before my whole body vibrated with a giggle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kian....&#34; I held his hand causing him to stop talking. &#34;....I would love to go out with you.&#34; I smiled at him causing his features to light up with a beam.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For real?&#34; He asked squeezing my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For real.&#34; I nodded and his smile grew even wider, I was even afraid that his face might split in half. I felt awkward for a while since I didn&#39;t know what to do. Should we hug? Kiss again? The way Kian&#39;s gaze darted between my lips and my eyes told me he wanted to again but let&#39;s just save that for the end of our first date.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should get some sleep....we have work tomorrow....I mean today.&#34; I corrected myself as I glanced at the clock again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah....&#34; He pulled away from my grasp. &#34;....but you can sleep in. Caleb doesn&#39;t have to know.&#34; A smirk crept up his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh wow....and you&#39;re supposed to be responsible.&#34; I drawled planting my hand on my hips as my tone dripped with sarcasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you won&#39;t even thank me for letting you off the hook this time?&#34; He arched a brow. &#34;And I am responsible. If I wasn&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t be the owner of Beck Luxury homes.&#34; He lifted his chin an inch higher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There you go again bragging about your position.&#34; I playfully rolled my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not bragging....&#34; His brows furrowed. &#34;....trust me you&#39;d do the same if you were in my shoes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mhmm.&#34; I sized him up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not sure you&#39;re supposed to be up by now....&#34; He gestured towards his wrist with a smug look on his face. &#34;....isn&#39;t it already passed your bedtime, Princess?&#34; He drawled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Princess?* Why the hell was he calling me that? &#34;Don&#39;t call me that.&#34; I glared at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay....Princess.&#34; a challenging glint flashed in his eyes as I let out an exasperated huff. I reached for the door handle pulling it open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s also passed your bedtime dumbass...so do both of us a favor and leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good night Princess.&#34; He leaned closer giving me a light kiss on my forehead causing all the thoughts to vanish from my head. Heat crept up my cheeks as our eyes met again. &#34;Good night.&#34; I looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a small laugh. &#34;What happened to sending me out of your house?&#34; A satisfied grin formed on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get lost.&#34; I pushed him outside slamming the door in his face. A relieved breath left my lips as I slid down the door till I sat on the floor with my knees to my chest. A small smile formed on my lips as his laughter echoed outside my doorstep. *Oh Ammie. What happened to staying away from Caleb&#39;s cousin?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And it happened? Just like that?&#34; Mia&#39;s eyes lit up as she shifted closer hugging one of her legs to her chest while the other dangled from the chair. The last time we talked on the phone I had told her about the kiss Kian and I shared that night and she insisted I wait till she gets back before I tell her everything. I was not even surprised when she showed up at my...our doorstep the next day. Typical Mia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well....not just like that.&#34; I said before sending a potato chip down my throat. As expected she had brought souvenirs and tasty treats for me to try out. There was no way she&#39;d go all the way to California and not bring back something for her best friend. &#34;He asked if I had a brother....then father....and then I got....well emotional and all.&#34; I averted my eyes from hers as my face flushed with embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh...&#34; An awkward silence settled between us for a few seconds but if there was someone who made awkwardness impossible it was Mia. &#34;So tell me....&#34; She leaned closer resting her chin on her arms while she looked up to see me. &#34;Is he a good kisser?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories of Kian&#39;s tongue thrusting inside my mouth and his arms wrapped around my waist while the other tipped my chin an inch higher flashed in my head and I couldn&#39;t stop the colours from rising up to my cheeks. &#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34; I tried my best to sound as normal as I could as I chewed on the potato chip as the faint salty tang flavor lingered in my mouth after swallowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s nonsense.&#34; She pulled back, her lips twisting into a frown. &#34;Is he a good kisser or not?&#34; She planted he hands on her hips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; I&#39;d kissed my fair share of men over the years, and I could confidently say that Kian *was* a good kisser. The way my heart skipped a beat, the flutter in my core, the way my senses came alive that night, that was all the proof I needed. If the way my body responded...the thrill of excitement and the ache of desire wasn&#39;t enough to convince me, then I&#39;m not sure what would. Kian&#39;s kiss was unmistakably exceptional. &#34;He is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia&#39;s jaw dropped before contorting into a sly smirk. &#34;Oh really?&#34; She wiggled her brows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop it.&#34; I pushed her away. &#34;If you&#39;re acting like this just because I told you that we kissed, I wonder how you&#39;re going to act if I tell you about the date.&#34; I muttered to myself with a lazy eye roll.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What date?&#34; Her brows dipped in a frown as my eyes widened. I stiffened for a few seconds before slowly turning to find her gaping at me. I didn&#39;t actually expect her to hear me...if I did I wouldn&#39;t have said it out loud. &#34;He asked you out?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shhh....you&#39;re yelling.&#34; I shushed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course I&#39;m yelling. Kyle asked you out and you didn&#39;t tell me.&#34; She shoved my shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just did...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No you didn&#39;t.&#34; She said before snatching the potato chips away from me. &#34;You don&#39;t deserve those.&#34; She pouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wha....&#34; I spread out my arms watching her as she got up from the couch. &#34;What do you mean I don&#39;t deserve those?&#34; A small laugh left my lips as I followed her. &#34;Please give it back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please....&#34; I begged as we took a turn heading towards our bedroom.</p>
