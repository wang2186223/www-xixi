                <p>Amaris&#39; POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to scream so Dad could hear me but before he could realize what was happening, the two guys grabbed him. Dad would have overpowered them if they were only one of them since they looked way younger but since they were two he was powerless against them. One of them whispered something into dad&#39;s ear before reaching into his pockets. Oh no! Was that a gun?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to scream as loud as I could but I knew there was no use. No one lived around here, no one was going to save us. &#34;You thought you could escape huh?&#34; I heard one of the guys behind dad say while the other placed a gun to his head. Escape? Escape from who? Did dad actually know these people?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t harm my daughter. Spare her please.&#34; Dad pleaded with them. I struggled shaking my head from side to side so I could speak but he did want to let go. I then clamped down on his hand with my teeth, causing him to let out a sharp cry and release his hold on my mouth. &#34;You can kill me but please don&#39;t harm my daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daddy what are you saying?!&#34; I cried out. &#34;Do you want these people to kill you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay sweetheart.&#34; He yelled back since he was a bit far away. &#34;Everything is going to be fine.&#34; Immediately the guy with the gun kicked him in his hip causing dad to let out a loud groan. I couldn&#39;t hear what they were saying but they pointed a gun at him and Dad walked closer and closer to the edge of the bridge with his hands up in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad?! Daddy?!! What are you doing?&#34; I sobbed screaming so loud that my throat hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up.&#34; The guy behind me twisted my arm so hard that a sharp pain shot through my shoulder and I let out a piercing scream. He tightened his grip, forcing me to drop to my knees as he continued to wrench my arm behind my back. The pain was so intense that my vision blurred and I struggled to stay conscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t get her.&#34; I heard Dad scream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up, you old man.&#34; I blinked rapidly trying to regain my clear vision as my chest heaved. I didn&#39;t understand why but I started feeling dizzy and lightheaded all of a sudden. I felt a tingling sensation in my ribs and everything else sounded faint and distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. Daddy.&#34; I tried to scream but it only came out in hushed tones. Immediately a gunshot echoed through the air, it sounded distant like it was shot miles away and I wish it was but deep down, I knew it wasn&#39;t. I tried to open my eyes...I really did but I just couldn&#39;t. They must have done something to me...but what?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is he dead?&#34; I heard someone ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you asking me, go check.&#34; Another voice rang out. A few beats passed before I heard another voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Throw him over the bridge.&#34; And that was the last thing I heard before I passed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I woke up, I found myself lying in a hospital bed with my mother by my side. She looked like she had been crying for hours. I asked her where Dad was but she said he was gone. I had hoped everything that happened was a dream when I woke up, the pain, the gunshot, the screaming, but they weren&#39;t. It was all real. Every damn thing was real. My dad was gone and I was never going to see him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throw him over the bridge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those cowards. If they thought they were so tough then why did they have their faces covered. If only I knew who they were. I&#39;d make sure they regret every fucking thing they did to us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>~~~~~~~~~~</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since I decided to do everything Caleb asked me to do, life has been so so easy for me. He had stopped coming to my office which was kind of a big deal to me since I loved my privacy but he was still a big thorn in my side. He never missed an opportunity to annoy the crap out of me and he kept giving me ridiculous tasks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like one time he wanted me to visit every stationary store in the city and bring back a sample of every pen I found just because he was looking for a new pen. And he was like &#34;I&#39;ll let you know which one I want after I&#39;ve tested them all.&#34; Like what the freaking fudge?! Of Course I didn&#39;t complain, I promised myself I wouldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even when he told me to sharpen all the office pencils by hand because he wanted them to be perfectly pointy and aligned by height or the time he made me spend two freaking hours sorting all of the paperclips by color since he only wanted to use the black ones. Like I said if it meant I didn&#39;t get to talk to him for more than five minutes I was cool with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only thing I wasn&#39;t cool with was this new mistress of his, Jessica. Kiara was.....well a bit delusional and kind of a pain but at least she was nice to me and didn&#39;t give me throbbing headaches and unlike Kiara she didn&#39;t work here which made everything far much worse. One time we got into a huge argument just because she thought I started wearing short skirts so I could seduce Caleb. Like who even does that? I thought Kiara was dumb but Jessica? She was crazy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat at my desk with a cup of latte in my hand enjoying the little time I had to myself when the door swung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Speak of the devil and she appears.&#34; I muttered to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What was that?&#34; She lifted a brow like she was going to hit me any second. She wishes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said...didn&#39;t your mother ever teach you how to knock?&#34; I sized her up with a piercing gaze, my eyes burning with irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And give me one reason why I should knock on your door?&#34; She moved towards me with her hand on her hip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm?&#34; I stroked my chin. &#34;Let me think....&#34; I looked upward pretending to think about something. &#34;Oh oh.&#34; I said like a hyperactive child trying to get the teacher&#39;s attention so he&#39;d pick him to answer a question. &#34;Because you don&#39;t work here.&#34; My fake smile twisted into a scowl as I glared at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then rolled her eyes before saying. &#34;I think you should save whatever this is...&#34; She gestured around me. &#34;....for someone else.&#34; She crossed her arms over her chest before letting out a small sigh. &#34;I came here to talk to you about something.&#34; She says with a dull expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jessica? Wants to talk to me about something? And she kind of looked serious about it? I stared at her with a scrutinizing look as I tried to read her eyes. What on earth did she want to talk about?</p>
