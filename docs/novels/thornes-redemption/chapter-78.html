                <p>Amaris&#39; POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nope....&#34; She shook her head attempting to slam the door in my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey....&#34; I rushed inside turning to find her frowning at me. &#34;Okay what do I need to do for you to forgive me huh?&#34; I plopped on the bed with a heavy thud, my body sinking into the mattress like a stone as I watched her features brightened and a small smile formed on my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm....&#34; She looked up wrapping her fingers around her chin. &#34;....I have to pick your outfit and your hairstyle for your date.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hell no.&#34; I held my palm up. &#34;The last time you picked a dress for me you got me in trouble.&#34; I fell back onto the bed with a deep exhausted sigh, my body sprawling across the mattress like a ragdoll.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t get into trouble because of the dress Ammie....you got into trouble because your boss is a dick.&#34; She settled beside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;True....&#34; I acknowledged. &#34;....but doesn&#39;t change the fact that you got me into trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah but your boss isn&#39;t around now.&#34; She lifted her shoulders in a small shrug. &#34;Plus you&#39;re going on a date with Kian.....there&#39;s no way you can get in trouble if I pick your outfit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine.&#34; I let out a small huff as I grabbed a pillow before crawling deeper into the bed. I had a long day at work and Mia had a long trip. We were both tired and we needed to rest but she wouldn&#39;t stop blabbing about Kian. If I was excited about our date then Mia was electrified. I knew I needed to ask her about the guys in California but I was too tired to speak so I&#39;ll probably do that tomorrow.....I wanted to hear about every fucking hot guy she met but right now I needed to recharge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>~~~~~~~~~</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kian&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And she agreed to come for dinner?&#34; Mum asked her voice dripping with excitement as her hands glided over my shoulders with gentle soothing strokes. She had always insisted on giving me a massage whenever I visited. She said it was the only thing she could do to help me relax. I was against it at first but with time I started looking forward to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well not yet....but she agreed to go on a date with me. As for the family dinner....that might take a while.&#34; I told her causing her to let out a small sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But it&#39;s almost the end of the month?&#34; She whined as she kneaded my skin and I felt myself melting like wax under warmth of her touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know mum....&#34; A relaxed sigh left my lips. &#34;...it&#39;s not my fault Caleb told her to stay away from you. She&#39;s gonna need a lot of convincing before she actually comes near you since she doesn&#39;t want to do anything that&#39;ll make Caleb.....&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caleb told her to stay away from me?&#34; She asked cutting me off as her hands froze on my arms and I couldn&#39;t stop a disapproving groan from leaving my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So it seems.&#34; I threw my head back when she continued. &#34;Why won&#39;t you come live with me? So you can give me massages like this whenever I return from work.&#34; I bent my head so far back that I could see her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s your girlfriend&#39;s job you knuckle head, not mine.&#34; She smacked my forehead causing me to let out a small wince.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t have to hit me so hard.&#34; I rubbed my forehead gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No more massages for you....&#34; She dropped her arms to the side and I jerked my head towards her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?! But why?&#34; I sniveled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because....&#34; She began, sitting on the chair opposite me. &#34;....I&#39;ve been telling you and your cousin to get a girlfriend but no....you guys don&#39;t want to listen....especially Caleb. All you guys do is sleep with countless women. Caleb even got a new mistress.&#34; Her lips twisted into a scowl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re men it&#39;s what we do.....and I haven&#39;t even slept with anyone in months.&#34; *I haven&#39;t slept with anyone since Amaris and I became friends but mum didn&#39;t need to know that.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mhmm.&#34; She rolled her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m serious....and about the girlfriend thing....I&#39;m working on it.&#34; I told her before throwing my head back again. I tried my best to control my excitement when Amaris agreed to go out with me....I mean I even managed to walk all the way back to my apartment like a normal person without skipping or jumping like an eight year old. I was too pumped to sleep that night....I kept thinking about the kiss, how she had leaned in close, how her tiny hands tugged on my hair, how she moaned when my hands roamed her perfect skin and how sweet she tasted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t shake off the memory of the way my heart had skipped a beat, the way my pulse had quickened, and the way every nerve in my body had come alive at that moment. And now, that I had finally asked her out, I couldn&#39;t help but wonder if there would be more of those kisses to come. I really have to make her mine. There is no other option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are thinking about you numbskull?&#34; A knowing glint flashed in mum&#39;s eyes as a sly grin crept up her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Her....&#34; The word left my lips before my brain could even register it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh really?&#34; She lifted a brow. &#34;You know you haven&#39;t told me how you asked her out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not going to.&#34; I looked away from her gaze with a small smile. &#34;I&#39;m not even supposed to.....&#34; My sentence was cut short by the vibrating sound from the table beside me. It was my phone. I narrowed my eyes into thin slits as I stared at my phone with a scrutinizing look. Why the hell was he calling by this time of the day?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is that?&#34; Mum watched as I picked up the phone from the table before tapping on the green icon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s your son.&#34; I turned my phone showing her the screen before lifting it to my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell him I&#39;m here...&#34; Mum whispered as I dipped my head in a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey there my incredibly amazing older brother.&#34; I smiled as my voice dripped with sarcasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh stop it with sugary sweet talk. You&#39;re making my teeth ache.&#34; His deep gruff voice grumbled through the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not even a hello to you too....as usual.&#34; I added leaning back in my chair. &#34;And you&#39;re the one who called me, so don&#39;t complain.&#34; My grin grew wider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever.....I just called to inform you that something unexpected came up and I&#39;ll be staying longer in South Korea.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; My brows furrowed and so did mum&#39;s. She had been watching me with a smile the whole time but since the call wasn&#39;t on speaker she just settled for hearing only my side of the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was supposed to be back tomorrow but now.....I don&#39;t even know when I&#39;ll be able to come back.&#34; Caleb was supposed to be back tomorrow? And I didn&#39;t even know? Thank God something came up otherwise my date with Amaris would have been cut short.</p>
