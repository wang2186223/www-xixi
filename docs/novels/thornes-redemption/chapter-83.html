                <p>Caleb&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The holster machine beeps in my ears, the florescent light poured on my face as I squint my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My breath was hassle and I felt something fluffy pressed against my back but then all this feeling became superfluous but one, a soft touch, someone was holding my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, I opened my eyes and she was the first it met. I had a doleful gaze at her, her worried eyes drinking every features on me as though memorizing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amaris...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was weak, having no idea how I came over here but I knew I was having an argument with her in the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I locked my fingers with her, heaving softly. Does she know?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My ears heard her sniff, like she cried. It took a while until I got a lucid picture of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh thank goodness Caleb, you&#39;re alive&#34; she muttered, tears brewed up in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sigh, scanning my face if there was any injury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, time stopped, I went breathless with her touch on my face, like she was the doctor. Doesn&#39;t she hate me? Why was she acting all nice? Is she scared just so I wouldn&#39;t fire her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A lot of thoughts rang in my head as I could hear a doctor close by exchanging words with his nurse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if it were an act, I couldn&#39;t help but I think that she&#39;s all I need now. The doctor examine me to see if there was an complications.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I locked eyes with him, just a reminder that no one should know what&#39;s wrong with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He understood that and only told amaris that it was nothing serious and prescribed some medications.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was so relieved, definitely perturbed that she caused me to faint in the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he had left with his nurse, I was left with amaris, she was holding me firm, not wanting to let go and I was feeling so emotional about the whole scenario.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry for earlier, I never meant it&#34; she apologized, her tears almost choking her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, I intended to rise, to cuddle her but she beckoned on me to lay down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will if you lay with me...&#34; I requested, weak and exhausted. She folded her lips, her eyes staring into mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wouldn&#39;t, I know. Suddenly, I saw her standing up and then climb the bed to lay beside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I flung my hand to her back, pulling her closer, to feel her heat, to feel her breath, her fragrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our face lean against each other as we exchange breath. She was tensed, her eyes proves it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heavy breath and her body vibrates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Were you scared?&#34; I whispered, to make her feel relaxed in my arms. Her silence pricks my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only I&#39;d just keep hearing her voice and her nagging like she was the boss and I am the employee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You passed out Caleb&#34; she responded and I could hear her serene voice and that was pleasing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was worried and I felt my heart thud. My face had gone pale, I licked my lips which felt dried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden sadness engulfed me as I was just staring at her with a lot of thoughts lurking in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only I&#39;ve got more time to live, it would be with her. It wasn&#39;t her fault, she was only trying to stay away from me but I just want to be with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sure do have some nice kicks! I can proudly say you&#39;d be safe in the midst of thugs&#34; I mused with a frown on my face and she let out a silent, then it was replaced by a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, it faded when she noticed I was staring. I placed her hand on my head, just so she&#39;d rub it and she did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face straightened up as she seems calm than ever. I felt this might be my last moment being treated nicely by her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps, I should be falling sick everyday to see nice side of hers but it might be too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s just stay this way&#34; I requested trying to shut my eyes when she said;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you acting as though you&#39;re about to die...this is the kindest way you&#39;ve spoken to me&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes, feeling heavy at heart because of her question. A smirk escaped my lips as I scanned her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her bright eyes probes for an answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if today was my last day to breath&#34; i questioned, my eyes fixed on her. I was tensed about the reply she&#39;d give me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It shouldn&#39;t be heartbreaking, the news about my health was depressing as it is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scoffed and rolled her eyes with an expression of contempt. That alone proves she wouldn&#39;t be troubled if I was kicked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Possibly, I was the third wheel between her and Kian. Maybe I should just fire him, frame him and get him arrested just so all her attention would be on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d be happy, I don&#39;t have to listen to a narcissist as a boss!&#34; She affirmed and then quickly closed her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amaris was blunt and I suck my breath as she was pertrified by what i&#39;d do next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes lowered at her but I just didn&#39;t want to appear sad to her and only eyed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heaved softly and just buried my head on her breast, squeezing her closer to me. There was no strength left in me for an argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was just weak and I couldn&#39;t speak properly. I suddenly felt her hand stroking my back, mildly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only she&#39;d be this nice to me genuinely and not seeming as though she&#39;s been forced to do it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You won&#39;t die, not yet, until you pay me my salaries&#34; she whispers and a sad smile left my lips as I felt comfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My ears could hear her hum as if was pleasant, the way she wrapped me also like I was a child made me miss my mom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a short while I fell asleep, having no nightmares and just her hum. I didn&#39;t know how long I slumb but when I opened my eyes, she was gone.</p>
