                <p>Okay, this is going to be easy. Caleb just left like that ? I guess luck is on my side today. I have some mails to send and some appointments to cancel, where do I begin? I think I&#39;m going to cancel appointments first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello&#34; I almost laugh at myself because of how hard I&#39;m trying to use my air hostess voice. &#34;This is the office of Mr. Caleb Thorne of Thorne Enterprises&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, let me hand this to my boss quickly &#34; came the smooth baritone of his secretary, I think . I overhear him informing his boss of who it is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How may I help you?&#34; I felt a little jump in my spine and my heart just skipped like eleven beats. The man&#39;s gruff voice sends a thrill through me, hinting at secrets so intense they could be deadly.I can&#39;t help the slight tremble and shiver that crawled up my spine in fear and fascination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m very sorry sir, but your appointment has been canceled&#34; I couldn&#39;t help the jilt that slipped into my voice</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you mean postponed?&#34; I feel like he&#39;s being too calm about this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No sir, I mean canceled&#34; I added emphasis on the &#39;canceled&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean by that? My appointment can&#39;t be canceled, do you know who I am?&#34; he yelled over the phone and directly into my ear, as I pushed the phone far back like it was on fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, I&#39;m very sorry&#34; I&#39;m trying my absolute best here to keep calm and talk politely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give me an explanation, young lady. Sorry isn&#39;t an explanation, or is it?&#34; he yells again. I&#39;m pretty sure my eardrums are damaged right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, it&#39;s not in my place to give you explanations. I&#39;m just doing the job I&#39;m being paid to do, any other inquiries you might have, you could call Mr Thorne directly and ask him. Besides I......&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up, you loud mouthed bitch&#34;. Now that is the last straw. I can&#39;t take it anymore, I&#39;m giving this ass a piece of my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, you&#39;re right. I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m saying sorry and trying to calm you down. If you want to get more clearance on why your appointment has been canceled, then do well to call Mr Thorne&#34; the air hostess sweetness in my voice was long gone by now. &#34;But as for now, your appointment  has been canceled, period. You can deal with it&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hear him saying something about talking to my boss and making sure I get fired before I hang up on the piece of shit. To think I have to go through fifteen more of this is weakening. I just hope the rest are more mentally mature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, I&#39;m done canceling the appointments, and like I suspected, most of them were still equally annoying, some more annoying than the first. Could you imagine? One of the idiots even said that he can&#39;t be rejected or canceled no matter the cause and that he was going to call my boss, and that if I don&#39;t get fired he&#39;ll sue me. Very funny. It was just one of the guys that took it well. He sounded pretty young and immediately I gave him the information, all he said was &#34;that&#39;s fine&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today has been pretty good. Apart from the cancellation of appointments and sending of mails, I haven&#39;t done any work today. Just from time to time answering calls. It&#39;s currently 3:45 p.m. and Caleb isn&#39;t yet back. I just hope he doesn&#39;t come back to work today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put my head on the table to rest a bit. I don&#39;t know why I feel so tired, it&#39;s not like I&#39;ve been working all day. As I put my head on the table, I fall asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amaris??&#34; Why is Caleb smiling at me in that way?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amaris&#34; he says again, his voice slightly louder. I&#39;m staring at him, but I don&#39;t answer. I just stay still, soaking in his godly appearance. He&#39;s shirtless, and he is hot, with a broad chest and huge biceps. And that six pack is everything and more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amaris&#34;, this time it&#39;s a firm voice jolting me awake. Shit, all that had been a dream. And right now, the real Caleb is standing in front of me and staring me down like he&#39;s about to fire me right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do I pay you to sleep?&#39;&#39; His voice is low and growly, his eyes lingering on my lips a little too long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I want to say, you&#39;ve not paid me yet, but I stop myself before it&#39;s too late. &#34;No sir, I&#39;m very sorry sir&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard from people about the war you were raving when I wasn&#39;t here,&#34; he smiled. I&#39;m confused, what war is he talking about? Wait, he smiled at me. Strange. &#34;The appointments I asked you to cancel, almost all of them called, asking me to fire you&#34; he folded his arms across his chest and leaned to rest on the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did they say I did?&#34; I whispered look down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, they told me everything you said. Now what do you have to say for yourself?&#34; he stared me down, a little glint in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, not sorry &#34; I whisper again to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Is he pretending or did he really not hear me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said sorry, not sorry.&#34; I repeat for clarity sake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you&#39;re apologizing for not being apologetic?&#34; He raises an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is the most effortless and engaging conversation we&#39;ve had since I began this job. Despite the risk of getting fired, I&#39;m reveling in the stress-free pleasure of having an exchange with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes&#34; I reply, unremorseful of what I did, &#34;I mean, they had it coming. They were talking to me like I was some piece of trash. And I&#39;m not about to stand around and listen to an old fool talk me down like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, I forgot who I was talking to. I&#39;ve lost this job for sure now, because no one&#39;s going to stand around and watch you talk about their friends the way I just did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Atta girl&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, what?&#34; I&#39;m shocked and confused, probably even disoriented, all at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, like you said, they&#39;re just a bunch of old fools. Well, except Austin who&#39;s young and is also my friend. And I&#39;m pretty sure he didn&#39;t even mind. Am I right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. He didn&#39;t mind it at all&#34; I smile, excited at the forming camaraderie between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mhmm, I know. I&#39;m glad you didn&#39;t just let them walk all over you. You stood up for yourself, you deserve a thumbs up&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you sir&#34; I grin excitedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh no. Don&#39;t think I care about you. The only reason I care is that if they&#39;re walking all over you because of what happens at my company, then they&#39;re indirectly walking all over me. And I won&#39;t like that&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How quickly he switched gears left me stunned. Honestly, it&#39;s unnerving and kind of freaky. One moment, you&#39;re beaming with pride and praise, and the next, your expression turns cold as ice, making it seem like I was hallucinating before. He&#39;s just like a chameleon, constantly changing colors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I drove home, my mind insistently replayed the vivid dream I had in the office like a stuck record. I couldn&#39;t fathom why subconscious was fixated on someone&#39;s I despised. It was absurd. I rationalized it away, attributing the dream to sheer exhaustion, and refocused on the road to ensure a safe journey home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey midget&#34; I greet Mia by the nickname I gave her, because of her childish features and considerably small stature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey armadillo&#34; she greets me back. She gave me the nickname &#39;armadillo&#39; because she insists I&#39;m a really soft person but I only act tough because I&#39;m scared of getting hurt. I hate to admit it, but she&#39;s right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are beaming girl. Let me guess, today was better than yesterday, wasn&#39;t it?&#34; she smiles, folding up the laundry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As a matter of fact, yes it was&#34; I smile back and take a seat on the cushion before narrating all the happenings of today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit, he is really hot. And what&#39;s that weird dream you were having about him, oooooh&#34; she bit her lips and let out a little growl as a smile spread across her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So out of everything I told you, including the part where I told you about those rude ass CEOs, that&#39;s all you caught&#34; my mouth hangs open in surprise at how someone could act so dim and be so smart both at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I was getting to that&#34; a guilty expression marked her face, &#34;you know you have to take things one at a time right?&#34; She quickly defends herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mhmm&#34; I said sarcastically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quick question though, how much of his chest was exposed in that shirt of his&#34;. Scooting closer, she anticipates my reply, unaware of the glare I&#39;m shooting her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bitch, you thirsty&#34; I get up as we both laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anyways, when I&#39;m done showering, you&#39;re going to have to come give me a massage. You know I&#39;m working hard and the stress is getting to me, you know. I&#39;m feeling all tensed up&#34;, I let out a sigh as I sashay to the bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All these for a job you started yesterday.&#34; I was surprised at the loud laughter she gave before that sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So if you&#39;re asking for a massage now, what would you ask for in a month&#39;s time?&#34; she scoffed and went back to her folding.</p>
