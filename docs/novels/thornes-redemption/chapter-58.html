                <p>Amaris&#39; POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a small sigh. I didn&#39;t want to argue with Miranda....Caleb might have been sweet to her but he was horrible to me. Completely horrible....but I wasn&#39;t going to say that to her. I just hope she never finds out the things her son did behind her back. &#34;I know.&#34; I sighed again. &#34;I&#39;ve tried working with him. I really have but he always finds one way or another to get on my nerves.&#34; She dropped her hand to her side as she listened. &#34;And it&#39;s so freaking annoying. I&#39;ve even tried resigning but he won&#39;t let me. Maybe one of these days I&#39;ll probably lose it.&#34; I pinched my nose bridge. &#34;That is if I haven&#39;t lost it already.&#34; I didn&#39;t know why but I couldn&#39;t help but feel like a woman who was complaining to her mother-in-law about her husband which was really weird.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry dear. I wish there&#39;s something I can do to help.&#34; The light in her eyes dimmed and I felt a pang of guilt in my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine. Like you said he&#39;s not that bad...&#34; I said, trying to cheer her up. &#34;Besides, it&#39;s not like I&#39;m with him 24/7.&#34; I shrugged. I probably would have died if I was with him 24/7. She flashed me a weak smile before lifting her basket from the table. I didn&#39;t understand why she was so sad. She already knew how Caleb was so there was no reason for her to look so gloomy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wanted to see Caleb?&#34; I asked, trying to switch gears. Well I wasn&#39;t exactly changing the topic but I at least wanted her to talk to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; She dipped her head in a small nod. &#34;I was told his office was on the top floor but I wasn&#39;t told which one it was.&#34; She said and I immediately moved around my desk so I could lead her to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry.&#34; I told her. &#34;I can show you his office.&#34; I moved towards the door. &#34;I&#39;m guessing the cookies are for him?&#34; I twisted the door knob pulling the door open before turning to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; She answered. &#34;I already stopped by Kian&#39;s company. If not , I would&#39;ve been here earlier.&#34; I waited for her to move out before closing the door. She let out a small chuckle before saying, &#34;If I didn&#39;t stop him, I don&#39;t think there&#39;ll be any more cookies left for Caleb.&#34; A mental image of Miranda batting Kian&#39;s hand away from the basket flashed in my head and I couldn&#39;t help but smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kian can be stupid at times but he is very sweet.&#34; I said as we walked towards Caleb&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re friends with him aren&#39;t you?&#34; She asked with an eager look in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well...I wouldn&#39;t say friends...yet.&#34; I let out a small laugh. &#34;More of....acquaintances, I guess.&#34; I said, earning a smile from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh that&#39;s lovely. It would be nice if you could stop by some time...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34; I jerked towards her. What on earth did she mean by stop by some time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh you know....visit. Or maybe you can join us for our monthly dinner. Oh watch out...&#34; She pulled me out of the way just in time before I crashed into a flower pot. I was so engrossed in our conversation that I didn&#39;t even pay attention to where I was walking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh...&#34; I froze, batting my lashes. It took me a few seconds to realize that she just saved me from hurting myself. I guess my brain actually worked slower than I thought....it wasn&#39;t any surprise what was causing it though. I thought to myself as I glanced at Caleb&#39;s door. I so need a break from all of this. &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing. I was the one who distracted you so it was only fair I helped you out of the way.&#34; We walked closer to the door. &#34;So what do you say?&#34; She raised her eyebrows and that was when I realized I didn&#39;t say anything about her request earlier which was even the reason I almost bumped into the flower pot in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh....&#34; I shifted my gaze to the path in front of me. &#34;Family dinner? Are you sure you want me there? After all it&#39;s your family dinner....is there any need for me to be there?&#34; I lifted a brow. &#34;I can come some other time right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed her lips into a thin line as we arrived at Caleb&#39;s door. &#34;You&#39;re right. I guess you can visit some other time.&#34; She tried to hide her disappointment with a smile and I couldn&#39;t help but feel guilty for the second time today but what could I do? It wasn&#39;t like I was one of her son&#39;s girlfriends that I could join them at their family house for dinner. A mental image of Caleb in a somewhat casual attire and me wrapping my arms around him as we walked into the house flashed in my head and I couldn&#39;t help but shudder at the thought. Kian on the other hand....he wasn&#39;t so bad but he already had a girlfriend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I promise I&#39;ll visit when I can.&#34; I placed my hands on hers reassuring her. &#34;Then maybe we can bake cookies together.&#34; I told her and her eyes suddenly lit up as she smiled at me. A satisfied smile formed on my lips as I dropped my hands to my side before turning to the door. At least I got her to smile before we got to his office. Oh right. My lips twisted into a frown. His office. I sucked in air before letting it out. I then muttered a little prayer to myself before knocking on his door. I leaned in, pressing my ear against the cold wood. No answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes annoyed before hitting my knuckles against the door again. &#34;What is it?&#34; I heard from the other side of the door. A simple come in would have been much nicer but I guess I&#39;ll go with that. I let out another exhale before saying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Thorne you have a visitor.&#34; I spoke loud enough for him to hear. I leaned in again waiting for a response but it never came. &#34;It&#39;s your mother.&#34; I said impatiently. I couldn&#39;t wait any longer. I was wearing heels for fucks sake and I definitely didn&#39;t want to spend more than a minute here with his royal jerkiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry...&#34; I turned to Miranda. &#34;He&#39;s always like this.&#34; I shifted my gaze back to the door before letting out a small groan. I was about to knock again when the door swung open with surprising force, causing a sudden shift in balance that sent me stumbling forward. I tried to regain my footing, but my heels only added to my instability. Before I knew it, I had tripped and fallen into his arms, barely catching myself before hitting his hard chest. I lifted my head slowly meeting a pair of dark orbs staring back at me and I couldn&#39;t stop the cold chill from running down my spine. I definitely should have stayed in my office today.</p>
