                <p>Caleb&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you like to go somewhere else?&#34; Jessica pulled away from me, her lip disappearing between her teeth as she moved her hips, rocking me as I grabbed her ass. &#34;Somewhere much more comfortable and a lot more quiet...&#34; She leaned closer speaking in hushed tones as she nibbled on my ear. &#34;....somewhere there&#39;ll be no distractions.&#34; Her fruity breath grazed my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We had been making out for what felt like five minutes but I was certain it was longer than that, way longer than that. I hummed in approval as she slowly got off my lap. She wasn&#39;t ready to go to my house yet so I decided to take her to one of the rooms upstairs. Mr. McCall, the owner of the club, was one of my very close friends or should I say important business associates so I didn&#39;t need to bother myself with things like reservations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I halted in my steps when I spotted two familiar faces on the dancefloor. I then turned to meet Jessica&#39;s questioning gaze. &#34;Here....&#34; I took out a key card from my pocket. Since I was one of his important business associates he lended one of his rooms in the hotels upstairs to me which is one of the reasons why I didn&#39;t need a reservation. &#34;...I&#39;ll meet you there in five minutes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In five minutes.&#34; I repeated. The first thing she needed to learn about being my mistress is that we only have sex whenever and wherever I want. No questions asked. Her gaze then dropped to the key card before returning to my face. I lifted my brow as I stared at her with a scrutinizing look in my eyes. She then dipped her head in a small nod before grabbing the key card. I watched her as she disappeared into the dark corridors before returning my gaze to the two women gyrating on the dance floor. I thought she didn&#39;t want to dance earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Judging from the way she was letting the men around her touch her and from the way she was grinding against them, I could tell she was drunk. I rolled my eyes letting out an exasperated sigh as I walked towards them watching her as she swayed her hips from side to side before wrapping her hands around the blondie behind her. I always knew she was a slut. I thought to myself observing her as she gazed intently at the stranger behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was wearing a black cut out drawstring side bodycon mini dress and as much as I hated to admit it calling her sexy was an understatement. She tied her hair in a low slick ponytail which made her slender neck more visible to the eyes of desperate and horny men. The blondie behind her then wrapped his arms around her as she writhed against his crotch. It&#39;s a family emergency. Her words echoed in my head again and I didn&#39;t even realize when I had closed the distance between us and yanked her out of the stranger&#39;s grasp. &#34;Oww....who are you...&#34; Her words died on her lips as they parted in surprise when she realised the person standing in front of her was no other person than her boss but ofcourse she didn&#39;t give a fuck about that. Especially now that she was drunk. &#34;What are you doing here? Let me go.&#34; She attempted to pull her arm out of my grip but she was too weak, she ended up hurting herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So this is your family emergency, huh?&#34; I questioned tightening my grip around her arm as my temples pulsed with rage. I glanced around and thankfully no one had noticed the scene unfolding before them because of the music blasting in the hall. I glanced at her friend who was smart enough not to interfere before shifting my gaze to the raging blondie standing behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t you hear her? Let go of her!&#34; He shoved me but thanks to my strong stamina I only moved an inch away. He was a lot weaker than he looked and probably a lot dumber but I couldn&#39;t blame him since he was thinking with his other head. I decided to ignore him and concentrate on the reason I walked up to them in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s your problem? Can&#39;t you see I&#39;m busy.&#34; She tried to push me away but I immediately wrenched her arm behind her back in a forceful and painful grip. She kept struggling and resisting but it was of no use since I was larger and stronger than her. &#34;Stop it. It hurts.&#34; She wailed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I asked you a question...&#34; I spoke into her ear in hushed tones as I tightened my grip. She then sank her teeth into her lower lip suppressing her screams. A smile crept up my lips as I realized she too didn&#39;t want to attract attention. &#34;...what are you doing in a club, Miss Carter?&#34; I hated it when people lied to me. This was nothing compared to how I punished people who lied to me....I literally ended people&#39;s lives just because they decided to be dishonest to me. I noticed the blondie reaching for my arm with the corner of my eye and I immediately snapped my head towards him. &#34;I decided to spare you the first time but I promise you if you touch me again you&#39;ll either leave this club without one of your arms or you won&#39;t leave at all.&#34; I growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir please...&#34; Her friend moved towards me with her hands pressed together. &#34;...I was the one who begged her to come with me. Please let her go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saved your life once and I promise you I can end it right now if you don&#39;t stay out of this and mind your fucking business.&#34; My jaw clenched. &#34;Now you....&#34; I spun her around as she glared at me, her chest heaving from all the struggling, strands of hair clung to her face, dampened by the heat of the struggle, her lips slightly parted as she panted and I felt cock twitch in my pants. Dammit. Not again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why can&#39;t you just let me live my life like I want to huh?&#34; She raised her voice. My eyes swept through the crowd and that was when I realized we were starting to create a ruckus. &#34;So what if I lied to you? It...&#34; She petered out when I yanked her arm pulling her into the lounge area. &#34;Let go...&#34; She pulled away since I didn&#39;t tighten my grip this time. There was no one in the lounge area...well there was no one in this lounge area since it was reserved for me so we could talk without attracting any unwanted attention. &#34;...What is your problem?&#34; She held her head in her arms. &#34;Every single damn thing I choose to do something fun you always ruin it.&#34; She stumbled almost tripping on her heels and I instinctively wrapped my hands around her to stop her from falling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips were still slightly parted as she panted with her hands pressed to my chest. She stared at my chest for a few seconds before lifting her head to meet my gaze. My hands itched to move the damp strands away from her face but I clenched them immediately, dropping them to my side. I had already promised myself that I would never make the mistake of touching her and I was going to keep to it.</p>
