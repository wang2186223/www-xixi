                <p>&#34;Yeah she might say yes....&#34; I threw my head back as I relaxed in my chair. &#34;...but she&#39;s going to day it because she&#39;s nice not because she wants to go out with me.&#34; I explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah....and what&#39;s wrong with that?&#34; She asked, pulling another sigh out of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want her to go out with me because she wants to....not because she doesn&#39;t want to hurt my feelings.&#34; I waited for her to say something but she never did. I slid the phone away from my ear, my arm dropping to my side as I swiveled my body to inspect the device, ensuring that the call was still connected. &#34;Mum....are you still there?&#34; I lifted it to my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes sweetie I am.&#34; Her voice danced across the phone line, filled with the lightness of her smile. It was as if she were beaming through the phone, her smile evident even though I couldn&#39;t see it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why weren&#39;t you saying anything?&#34; I found myself smiling as I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You like her don&#39;t you?&#34; There was a playfulness in her tone, a gentle teasing that made my grin widen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you already knew that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah I did....I didn&#39;t just know that you like her this much.&#34; She told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t need to know if I like her or not mum. All you need to do is wait until I bring her to dinner then you can talk with her all night long.&#34; I wrapped my fingers around the paperweight on my desk as I spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope so.&#34; Just then I heard a light knock on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly placed my hand over the speaker. &#34;Come in.&#34; I watched the door open slowly as I dropped my hand. &#34;Mum, we&#39;ll talk later okay. I&#39;ve got some important things to do.&#34; I whispered as Sofia, my PA walked in even though she wasn&#39;t going to say anything about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay darling. Talk to you later.&#34; She said blowing me an invisible kiss and I let out a small laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Love you too.&#34; I said before ending the call. I then dropped my phone on my desk before turning to Sofia who had been watching silently. I raised my eyebrows gesturing for her to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good day Mr. Beck. I just wanted to tell you that I just received a call from the contractor.&#34; She gestured towards the door before wrapping her arms around what looked like plans. &#34;They need your approval on the renovation plans.&#34; She said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good day Sofia.&#34; I greeted with a lazy drawl as I leaned back in my seat. &#34;What exactly do they need from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They sent over the final plans and are asking for your signature to proceed. They need to start the work by next week, so they&#39;re hoping to get your approval as soon as possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright then.&#34; I gently rubbed the back of my neck. &#34;Can you show me the plans?&#34; I gestured towards the papers in her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure.&#34; She placed them on my table. &#34;Here they are. I printed them out for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you...I&#39;ll review these and get back to you shortly.&#34; I dipped my head in a small nod as I blinked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great.&#34; She beamed at me. &#34;I&#39;ll let the contractor know you&#39;re looking at the plans.&#34; She turned to leave but paused like she had remembered something before facing me again. &#34;Let me know if you need any further details.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will do.&#34; I nodded again. &#34;Thanks for the update.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re welcome.&#34; She flashed me another smile before heading towards the door. I watched her as she closed the door behind her before my gaze dropped to the plans in front of me. I let out a small sigh before dragging my hands down my face. God I needed to rest. I had lied to Amaris earlier when I told her I was free...I had a lot on my plate but I just couldn&#39;t concentrate since I hadn&#39;t seen her for days and there was no fucking way I could convince her to do a video call so I just had to go see her. And now this.....</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked up the plans on my table about looking through them when my phone vibrated, grabbing my attention. A small smile crept up my face as I picked up my phone tapping the green icon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey buddy.&#34; I grinned, placing the phone on my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t call me buddy.&#34; A stern voice echoed from the other end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s up?&#34; I asked, completely ignoring him. &#34;Haven&#39;t heard from you in a long time.....pal.&#34; I drawled as my smirk widened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been busy.&#34; I could tell that he was seconds away from ending the call but he just controlled himself. *Let&#39;s see how long he can last until I eventually drive him crazy.* &#34;How&#39;s everything going back at the office?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re fine. I&#39;ve been handling things as best as I can, running two companies isn&#39;t easy you know.&#34; Which is why I let Amaris handle his company. I knew he didn&#39;t exactly like her and didn&#39;t want her in charge of his company but she was his fucking secretary and from the time that we&#39;ve worked together I could tell she was really good at what she did. So why not? Besides it&#39;s not like he was going to find out and even if he did it&#39;d be after everything and maybe for once he&#39;ll actually see that she&#39;s not a bad person and that he&#39;s just being cruel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good to hear. Anything happened since the last time I called?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well the new software update rolled out without any issues. The team&#39;s been handling it so smoothly that I didn&#39;t even have to say anything...especially when Amaris is around. She is good. Oh and also the user feedback has been positive so far.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you say?&#34; I blinked at the sudden change in his tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The user feedback has been positive so far?&#34; I lifted a brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No before that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That Amaris is good at handling the.....&#34; I trailed off when I realized what I was about to say. Shit! I was so engrossed in telling him about our progress that I forgot to leave out the fact that Amaris was behind everything. Oh God.</p>
