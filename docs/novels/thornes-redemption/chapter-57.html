                <p>Amaris&#39; POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shut my eyes thinking about all the advantages I&#39;d have if I didn&#39;t work here anymore but my thoughts were interrupted when I heard a familiar voice and the recognizable squeak of the door as it creaked open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caleb? Are you in here?&#34; I jerked my head towards the door. I half expected Jessica to be standing by the door with some other foolish thing to say but I was stunned when I saw the woman at the door. What was she doing here and why was she looking for Caleb?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh....&#34; Her brows shut up when she realized the person sitting at the table wasn&#39;t Caleb. &#34;...my apologies I...&#34; She paused. She probably didn&#39;t notice we met before, well until now that is. &#34;It&#39;s you...&#34; Her face lit up as she pushed the door open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs.....&#34; I was about calling her Mrs. Thorne but I immediately remembered that she was also Kian&#39;s mother so I didn&#39;t know if she liked being called Mrs. Thorne or Mrs. Beck. Then again she wasn&#39;t their real mother so...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my goodness it&#39;s actually you.&#34; A grin spread across her face as she closed the door behind her before walking towards me. Since I didn&#39;t know what to say to her I just flashed her an awkward smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good....&#34; I paused, glancing at the clock. I wasn&#39;t sure what the time was so I needed to confirm if it was still morning. It wasn&#39;t. &#34;...Good afternoon Mam.&#34; I was certain I looked so weird at that moment but what could I do? I didn&#39;t know what to call her and I didn&#39;t know why she was so happy to see me. &#34;It&#39;s nice to meet you again.&#34; I got up from my seat gesturing towards the empty seat in front of my desk. &#34;Would you like to sit down?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh come on.&#34; She waved off my offer like she would do to a fly. &#34;I didn&#39;t come here for a meeting.&#34; She said and that was when I noticed the basket in her hand. The lid was firmly secured, keeping its content a secret from prying eyes. I could also hear the faint rustling of cellophane and the crinkling of paper as she moved. My nose twitched as a sweet aroma wafted towards me, I didn&#39;t have to look into the basket to know it was filled with freshly baked cookies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I inhaled deeply, taking another sniff. Red velvet to be precise. They almost smelt as good as mum&#39;s. Almost. A small smile crept up my lips as the delicious scent swirled through the air. I wasn&#39;t sure yet but the scent was tantalizing enough to make my mouth water. Well I wasn&#39;t surprised though....she did remind me of mum when we first met so it was only normal if she was good at baking. &#34;Ok then...I&#39;m guessing you came to see your son?&#34; I lifted a brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I did....&#34; She said dropping the basket on my table. &#34;...but then I bumped into you.&#34; She let go of the handle. &#34;Ever since that day we met at the ice cream shop I&#39;ve always wanted to see you again...&#34; Her cheery tone suddenly switched to a sad one. &#34;...but Caleb always said no.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of Course he did.&#34; I muttered to myself as I rolled my eyes. &#34;Well.....&#34; I smiled at her. &#34;I don&#39;t understand why you wanted to see me so badly but....here I am.&#34; I spread out my arms earning a low chuckle from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I baked cookies.&#34; She lifted the lid covering the basket. &#34;Would you like some?&#34; I looked into the basket and the vibrant crimson cookies stared back at me from their nestled position in the basket and a grin spread out on my lips when I saw that I was right. The cookies were adorned with a delicate swirl of cream cheese frosting which caused my tummy to grumble, urging me to have a taste. I could practically almost taste the crumbly, velvet soft texture of the cookies. &#34;I promise I didn&#39;t poison them.&#34; She says her tone laced with sarcasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My chest rumbled with laughter. &#34;I would love to.&#34; I smiled, grabbing a cookie from the basket as she grinned back at me. &#34;Thank you so much Mrs....Beck.&#34; I went with the first name that dropped in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can call me Miranda.&#34; Her eyes glinted with a warm affection as she closed the basket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh no.&#34; I said after taking a small bite of the cookie. &#34;I certainly can&#39;t do that.&#34; I politely rejected her offer. I couldn&#39;t picture calling Caleb and Kian&#39;s mother by her actual name. That was just wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok then...call me mother.&#34; A somewhat mischievous glint flashed in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mother?&#34; My brows drew together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes?&#34; She raised her brows and I couldn&#39;t help but smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened my mouth to protest but I couldn&#39;t find the exact words to say to her. &#34;You&#39;ve already called me mother...I don&#39;t see why you should stop.&#34; She lifted her shoulders in a half shrug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright then....mother.&#34; I drawled. &#34;As you might have already heard...I&#39;m Amaris.&#34; I placed my hand on my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh I have heard. Kian won&#39;t stop talking about you everytime he comes to visit.&#34; She said but then she quickly placed one of her hands on her lips like she had just said something she wasn&#39;t supposed to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kian?&#34; I batted my lashes. &#34;He talks about me?&#34; I cocked my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well....yeah.&#34; She hesitated before saying. &#34;He does. At our last family dinner, he mentioned something about you lying to Caleb so you could go clubbing with your friend.&#34; She narrowed her eyes into thin slits as a small smile formed on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know about that too.&#34; I winced, finishing the cookie in my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t actually see it as a bad thing though. Everyone deserves to have fun right?&#34; She shrugged her shoulders. Unlike Caleb, she actually got me. Just because I worked for him didn&#39;t mean I couldn&#39;t have fun but no...he didn&#39;t even want to see me smile. It was like he had a sixth sense for when I was happy because that was always when he came with his ridiculous tasks. Whether it was stupid or not, he didn&#39;t care as long as it took away my joy. Like who does that? I knew he couldn&#39;t stand seeing me happy but he could just walk away. Did he have to go out of his way to ruin it every single time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda must have noticed the change in my mood because she suddenly placed her free hand on my shoulder. &#34;Sweetheart I know working for Caleb can be a pain sometimes...&#34; Most times. &#34;....and I also know he can be incredibly annoying most of the time...&#34; I pressed my lips together forcing myself to not say anything as she spoke. Caleb? Annoying? Most of the time? I can&#39;t even think of a time I greeted him and he actually answered. &#34;....but trust me he means well and look on the bright side. You work for one of the biggest companies in the city and you get paid handsomely.&#34; I let out a small sigh. I didn&#39;t want to argue with Miranda....Caleb might have been sweet to her but he was horrible to me. Completely horrible....but I wasn&#39;t going to say that to her. I just hope she never finds out the things her son did behind her back.</p>
