                <p>Caleb&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re fired.&#34; I said in a blunt tone as I leaned back into my chair. It had been exactly three days since Jessica started working for me and still Kiara didn&#39;t get the message. Well if she wanted to play dumb I might as well say it to her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;F...fired?&#34; She stuttered. &#34;What do you me...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m in no need of your services anymore.&#34; I talked over her. &#34;So you&#39;re basically useless to me. You know the reason I let you work here and since someone else will be taking over your duties, I don&#39;t see any reason for you to stick around anymore.&#34; I clasped my hands together as I watched her eyes bulge out. Wow....and I thought she was smart enough to figure it out herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone else?&#34; She gaped at me. Just then, Jessica walked in. She had been standing at the door ever since she noticed Kiara in my office but she didn&#39;t want to interrupt. But after seeing Kiara was still in disbelief I guess she decided to make her presence known.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey sweetheart.&#34; She blew her kiss winking at her. The moment Kiara set eyes on Jessica her eyes grew even wider before her brows drew together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jessica? What the heck are you doing here?&#34; I picked Kiara up from the same club where I met Jessica a few days ago so the fact that they knew each other wasn&#39;t surprising.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t it obvious boo. I&#39;m taking your man...&#34; She closed the distance between them as she planted her hands on her hip. She was wearing a midi dress with a long slit that ran up all the way to her mid thigh. &#34;...and there&#39;s nothing you can do about it.&#34; She said, causing Kiara to glare at her before glancing at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Both of you should leave.&#34; I ordered. I wasn&#39;t ready for any of their nonsense. I was supposed to inspect every department in my company today and it was already 9am. I had no time to waste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caleb please....you can tell me what I did wrong. I promise I&#39;ll change.&#34; She clasped her hands together. &#34;Whatever you want just please don&#39;t send me away.&#34; She stared at me with a pleading look in her eyes and I just stared back, my eyes narrowing with annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t make me repeat myself.&#34; I got up straightening my suit jacket. &#34;I don&#39;t want to see you around my company again, is that clear?&#34; I asked, walking past them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Caleb...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that clear?!&#34; I growled with my back towards them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; she lowered her head. I didn&#39;t even know why and when I allowed her to call me by my first name but I just shrugged it off. After all this was the last time we were going to see each other. I glanced at Jessica who just stood a few feet away from Amaris with a blank expression on her face as she stared at me. She probably didn&#39;t know what she was getting herself into. A sly grin crept up my face before I immediately squashed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good.&#34; I dipped my head in a small nod before walking out the door. I was about to get into the elevator when I glanced around the slightly open door a few feet away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just because I work for you doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t live my life anymore</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every single damn time I choose to do something fun you always ruin it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Don&#39;t you want all your problems to go away, huh Mr. Thorne? Or are you keeping me for another reason? Hmm?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fire me. Get a new secretary and then, poof. All your problems will go away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw clenched as I watched the elevators closed. I had promised myself that I was going to make today miserable for her but all I did was yell at her in the elevator. I had been waiting for her to come apologize earlier but I didn&#39;t see her. I had assumed she was too scared to come to work today but when I bumped into her in my private elevator I was even more furious. I might have gone a bit overboard when I hit her against the metal wall. I let out a small sigh as I pinched between my brows and I didn&#39;t even realize when I was walking towards her office. On reaching the door I couldn&#39;t help but sneak a peek just in case she was doing something else other than working and decided to quickly change positions the second I walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched her as she typed into her system before glancing at a few files on her table. She then let out a small groan as she reached for the back of her head. &#34;Gosh it hurts.&#34; I heard her whisper to herself before staring at her hand. I had hurt many women and killed even innocent children but I couldn&#39;t stop the pang of guilt from searing through my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling guilty over a woman, Thorne? Never thought I&#39;d see the day</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up,&#34; I muttered, my lips twisting into a scowl before I pushed the door open causing her to jerk her head towards me. The second she set her eyes on me, her eyes darkened as she pressed her lips in a thin line before dropping her gaze to her screen again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want me to do for you this time?&#34; Her voice rang out as her eyelids dropped. Normally she would have queried me for just walking into her office but instead she just asked me what I wanted her to do. I scoured through my memory thinking of what to say to her since I just walked in on instinct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m supposed to be inspecting all the departments today....&#34; I paused and for the first time I couldn&#39;t read her facial expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And?&#34; She pressed on, her eyes still glued to her screen as she typed away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have an important meeting with one of my business partners. I would have canceled or rescheduled but it&#39;s already been postponed twice.&#34; I clasped my hands behind my back as I closed the distance between us in small strides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So do you need me to represent you at the meeting or do you want me to conduct the inspection for you?&#34; She finally met my gaze. I didn&#39;t understand why but she was surprisingly calm about this. No frowns, no complaints, no reaction, no facial expressions.....just plain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need you to conduct the inspection while I&#39;m away. Make sure that all departments are making progress and...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Make sure they are working efficiently and meeting their goals and deadlines.&#34; She finished. &#34;I&#39;ll also have to make sure the products created by each department are of high quality and meet the standards of the company. And of course I shouldn&#39;t forget to ensure the departments are communicating and collaborating effectively and sharing the information and resources they all need. Noted.&#34; She dipped her head in a small nod before grabbing a folder from her desk. &#34;Anything else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at her, my mind blank and numb before I finally said. &#34;No, that&#39;s everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great,&#34; she glanced at me, nodding again. I stood there glued to the floor as I watched her look through some documents as she furrowed her brows, pressing her lips together. I knew she was in pain but I didn&#39;t want to say anything so I just turned to the door taking one last look before walking out. Oh Thorne, what have you done?</p>
