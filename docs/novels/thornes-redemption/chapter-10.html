                <p>Amaris POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After three rings, he finally picked up the call. I thought I wanted him to take the call, but after he took the call I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s what I wanted. You have no choice, Amaris. Mia&#39;s in danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m very sure I&#39;ve been quiet for over three minutes. I just don&#39;t know what to say to him, I don&#39;t want to say anything that will infuriate him or cause him to hang up. But can anything I say right now possibly make things any worse?  I mean, my friend is in danger and I&#39;m calling to ask for hi</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to say something? Or am I wasting my very treasured time?!&#34; His harsh tone snapped me back to reality, interrupting my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good evening, sir&#34; my voice was so low, it could be mistaken for a whisper. &#34;Sir, I need your help. I think my friend&#39;s been kidnapped&#34;. I began crying at this point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you dialed the wrong number&#34; he said gruffly, &#34;let me call the right number for you okay? Now dial 911. Goodbye.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No sir, please don&#39;t hang up&#34; I cried out. &#34;Sir, please. Before the police get to her, she might have been raped or beaten. Or even worse, she might be dead&#34; I couldn&#39;t think about losing my best friend, but the realization hit me at that moment, and I knew I was ready to do anything to get her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you think I can find her? He asked, his voice dripping with amusement bordering on mockery. &#34;If you think I can find her, then you must be crazy&#34; he ridiculed, his voice heavy with disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How the hell did I encounter myself in this situation? I didn&#39;t want to get involved at first, but now here I am. Hell, she&#39;s going to pay me back for this. I have other more pressing matters to attend to other than finding some girl that I don&#39;t even know, but somehow, this has taken priority. I can still choose not to help, but I&#39;ve already given her my word and I don&#39;t go back on my word. How Is she even sure that she was kidnapped? She might have just gone out without her phone. I need to call her back, to know what I&#39;m walking into.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need information on this girl. What&#39;s her name?&#34; I asked, taking notes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia, sir. Mia Stone. She has strawberry blonde hair and blue eyes&#34; I sighed in annoyance at what I was about to do. I&#39;ll rather be eating rocks right now than be in this position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are you sure she&#39;s been kidnapped?&#34; I ask, my blood boiling more with each passing second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She left her phone behind, which is something she never does.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that a good enough reason?&#34; It takes everything in me not to yell at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No sir, there&#39;s also blood on the floor, and there&#39;s a witness&#34; she said and began to describe what the person said they saw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only reason I decided to help is because I can&#39;t stand to see people, especially ladies, treated unjustly. If she was really kidnapped, there&#39;s a huge possibility that she&#39;ll get raped, and there&#39;s nothing that disgusts me more than that. That&#39;s one of the reasons I make sure everyone I get in with sexually know my rules, because I don&#39;t want it to seem like they&#39;re being raped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yo, Jason. It&#39;s time for you to hold up your end of the bargain&#34; I said into the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason, a notorious drug lord with a $50,000 bounty on his head, was double-crossed by his own associates for the reward money. I was the one who helped him evade capture and made the problem disappear. He offered to pay me the $50,000, but I declined, telling him that he&#39;d repay me in another way, at another time. That time has now come. While I have my own team at my disposal, I&#39;m reluctant to involve them in a situation that doesn&#39;t concern them directly. I guess this is how I&#39;m going to collect on Jason&#39;s debt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somewhere in a secluded wooded area</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tall, muscular guy with a huge scar lining his face, dressed in an all-black outfit loomed over Mia who was bound to a chair. He poured a bucket of icy water over her, shocking her awake. &#34;Wake up&#34; he bellowed, his voice gruff and menacing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she suddenly regained consciousness, she was met with a piercing brightness that sent her eyes scrambling to adjust. The intense light overhead illuminated her surroundings, revealing an unfamiliar space that heightened her sense of disorientation and fear. Every detail of her surroundings seemed to be amplified, from the damp, musty smell that filled her nostrils to the eerie silence that surrounded her. She strained her eyes to focus, desperate to understand where she was and how she got there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello princess&#34; he sneered, looming over her. His face inches from her, his condescending gaze piercing down at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you, where am I and what do you want from me?&#34; she scowled, bringing her face closer to his, without any hint of fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tutting, he turned towards his men, &#34;what bravado&#34; he said as they all laughed mockingly. Turning back to her, he said, &#34;oh princess, well, as a warm welcome, I&#39;ll answer your questions to the best of my ability. Who am I? Your worst nightmare. Where are you? The last place you want to be. And for your final question, what do I want from you?&#34; He beamed a jeering smile at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well princess, the only thing we want is precious daddy&#39;s attention. You know, so we can get his money&#34; he drawled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What money?&#34; She snarled, leaning slightly forward, her eyes squinting and her eyebrows creasing in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t try that shit with me&#34; he growled. &#34;You think we&#39;re all those bunches of fools out there you&#39;ve been deceiving to think you grew up &#39;comfortably&#39;? We know who your father is, and you&#39;re going to bring him to us&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck you&#34; she yelled and spat on his face. But her momentary satisfaction was short-lived as he retaliated with a stinging slap that struck her with such force it knocked out a tooth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the Thorne Residence</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, we&#39;ve found the girl,&#34; Viktor, one of the men assigned by Jason to Caleb, said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And where are they?&#34; Caleb asked, cleaning his gun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re in a cabin in the woods, beside Constantine&#39;s Creamery&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s get going,&#34; Caleb hollered at the other guys who were busy with their weapons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With eagerness, they all pile into the van, their excitement hinting at a disturbing love for violence and harm.</p>
