                <p>Caleb&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who the hell are you?&#34; He growled. It was really funny to see the scar-faced guy acting so tough with his dick exposed in that way. His face became red all of a sudden. Was it embarrassment? Or exhaustion? Or fear? Or .. maybe anger?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caleb Thorne,&#34; I heard a soft whisper. That&#39;s when I noticed the girl behind him, and my eyes widened in shock. She was bent over, her bare backside exposed, and her skirt was still hiked up. It looked like a horrific scene had just unfolded. I thought to myself, &#34;Is this a party for naked people?&#34; I get that she was just being raped a few moments ago but in the brief moments the scar-faced man was speaking to me, she would have straightened up and pulled down her skirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who the hell is Caleb Th-...&#34; His voice trailed off, his mouth agape, as his eyes widened in stunned recognition of my identity. The sudden realization seemed to leave him speechless, his gaze frozen on me in a mix of shock and terror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This day just kept getting funnier and funnier. Starting with the weird dream I had this morning, and now this. I almost laughed at this day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, do you need any help?&#34; Viktor walked in, his face contorting in disgust at the sight of the naked man standing in front of us. At least I know I&#39;m not the only one that thinks this is weird and disgusting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I&#39;m fine,&#34; I said, &#34; just get the girl out of here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Viktor went towards her to give her support just in case she was too weak to walk on her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?!&#34; she exclaimed, her voice rising in defiance. &#34;I&#39;m not going anywhere!&#34; Her outburst left both Viktor and me stunned, but what followed was even more astonishing. &#34;I want to see you take him down,&#34; she said, her eyes gleaming with a fierce intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forgive me, miss, but I must insist,&#34; Viktor said, his tone apologetic, before sweeping her up and slinging her over his shoulder. I couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of admiration for his chivalrous nature, and indeed, his overall character. In the short time we&#39;d worked together, he had proven himself to be a formidable ally. I made a mental note to speak with Jason about borrowing Viktor&#39;s expertise for future missions like this one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, how do you plan to proceed?&#34; I asked the scar-faced man, once Viktor had escorted the girl out of the room. &#34;Do you want to engage in hand-to-hand combat or use a weapon?&#34; I asked with a smile, relieved that he had finally put his dick back in his pants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as I was about to glance up, he charged towards me with a screwdriver, poised to strike. &#34;Not a good move, friend,&#34; I said, swiftly grabbing his hand and restraining it. I swiftly wrestled the screwdriver from his grasp and flung it far out of reach. &#34;How about a fair fight, without weapons? What do you say?&#34; I asked, my tone dripping with sarcasm and a hint of challenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want a fair fight, do you?&#34; he sneered, throwing a wild punch my way. I effortlessly sidestepped it and countered with a quick jab to his face, causing his nose to burst open and blood to gush out. The sight of his bloody nose filled me with a sense of gratification. Enraged, he charged at me again, his eyes blazing with fury. He swung another punch, which I blocked this time, and I retaliated with a powerful kick aimed at his face. He managed to dodge it, but I could see the fear creeping into his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had attempted to strike me with the same move four times already, consistently leading with his right hand, making it clear that it was his dominant hand. Anticipating his next move, I prepared myself for the fifth attack. As he lunged at me again, I swiftly grasped his arm and twisted it with a quick, precise motion, applying enough pressure to snap the bone and leave his right hand broken and useless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was left lying on the ground, his body crumpled and contorted in agony, his face a grotesque mask of blood and bruises. I stooped down and delivered a few more blows, just for the pleasure and satisfaction it brought.&#34; I would have killed you,&#34; I said, standing up and adjusting my clothes, &#34;but I have more pressing matters to attend to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With one final kick, I opened the door and strode out of the room, my eyes widening in awe at the sight before me. The floor was littered with the motionless bodies of our adversaries, a testament to my team&#39;s skill and restraint. Following my explicit instructions, they had subdued every last one of them without taking a single life, leaving a trail of incapacitated foes in their wake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good job y&#39;all!&#34; I exclaimed, climbing into the van. As I glanced around, I noticed that the girl had succumbed to exhaustion and fallen asleep. It seems we&#39;ll need to get her back to her apartment before I can finally ask her the question that&#39;s been on my mind all this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the van came to a stop in front of the apartment building, Viktor gently roused the girl from her slumber, announcing our arrival. Given the late hour - well past 10pm - I instructed the rest of the team to remain in the van, while Viktor and I accompanied her to her apartment. Upon reaching the door, we pushed it open, and Amaris&#39;s eyes widened in joy at the sight of her best friend. She rushed forward, embracing her tearfully, as relief and happiness washed over her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34; She asked, scanning her best friend over, her voice hoarse, probably from all the crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah I&#39;m fine&#34; she said and hugged her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did they kidnap you?&#34; I already wanted to go home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My father is a powerful crime lord, one of the most prominent in the world. I desired a life free from the criminal underworld, and he agreed and sent me to school, and also got me this advertising job after I graduated, so that I could have a fresh start. To protect me, my father kept my true identity hidden, ensuring no one knew I was his daughter. I&#39;m still unsure how they discovered my connection to him. Apparently, all they wanted was a ransom, anyway,&#34; she said with a nonchalant shrug, as if the threat to her life was merely an inconvenience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen, I&#39;ve got some advice for you both: get out of this apartment as soon as possible. We didn&#39;t take down the ones who sent those thugs, and it&#39;s only a matter of time before they realize you&#39;re gone and come back with a vengeance. Next time, it won&#39;t be a cakewalk, and trust that I won&#39;t come to your aid then. You&#39;d do well to take my warning seriously,&#34; I said, my tone firm and urgent, as they nodded in understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And as for you, Amaris,&#34; I said, my gaze fixed intently on hers, &#34;you&#39;re indebted to me now.&#34; With that, I turned and exited the apartment, Viktor falling in step behind me as we left the two women to ponder their next move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exhaustion washed over me, the adrenaline-fueled encounter leaving me drained. All I craved now was the solace of my own space, a soft bed, and a rejuvenating nap to shake off the lingering fatigue.</p>
