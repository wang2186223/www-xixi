                <p>Amaris&#39; POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All this has been happening and you didn&#39;t think to tell me?&#34; Mia gaped at me as she pressed the back of feet together. I finally told her about Kian and how we bumped into each other at work a few weeks ago and he also picked me up the other day when my car was still at the mechanic. I hadn&#39;t told her about today yet. I was getting to that part.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was waiting for the right time.&#34; I lifted my shoulders in a half shrug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh and so now&#39;s the right time?&#34; She frowned at me before rolling her eyes. &#34;What happened to last night? And the night before that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay okay I&#39;m sorry.&#34; I groaned with a dull expression. &#34;I promise it won&#39;t happen again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It better not.&#34; She smiled with her eyes closed as she raised her chin an inch higher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are insane,&#34; I let out an exasperated huff as I rolled my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So...&#34; She playfully shoved my shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oww.&#34; I pouted rubbing it gently to relieve the pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you guys talk about?&#34; She wiggled her brows playfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing.&#34; I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you&#39;re telling me you bumped into him at work and he drove you home and stopped at a flipping bakery and you guys didn&#39;t talk about anything?!&#34; Her eyebrows shot up before they relaxed again. &#34;You should really leave lying to the experts, Ammie.&#34; She nodded gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not lying....&#34; My brows drew together. &#34;We just didn&#39;t necessarily have a conversation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well whatever it was I wanna hear it.&#34; She shifted closer, staring at me with an eager look in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Umm....well we didn&#39;t say anything to each other when I bumped into him he was just like Watch where you&#39;re going sweetheart and I was like...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whoa whoa whoa.&#34; She waved her palm in the air, cutting me off and that was when I realized I forgot to leave out the sweetheart part. Oh no. &#34;He called you sweetheart?&#34; She gaped at me. To me, Kian calling me sweetheart wasn&#39;t such a big deal instead what bothered me was....well him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Listen here, doll. I&#39;m a man of respect. You do not toy with me and get away with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was just a slip of the tongue or maybe doll was just something he called women who annoyed him. Well one thing was for sure, I wasn&#39;t telling Mia about it cause she was definitely going to freak out and tell me Caleb was in love with me. I wrinkled my nose in disgust, even the thought of it made me shudder. What he did today....I was never going to forget.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not a big ideal. Kian&#39;s nice to everyone.&#34; I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh wow. You&#39;re even calling him by his name.&#34; She stared at me with a knowing look in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s the one who wanted me to call him by his name. I insisted on calling him Mr. Beck.&#34; I said placing my hand on my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mhmmm,&#34; a smug smile crept up her face. &#34;What else happened when you bumped into him?&#34; She crawled closer lying on her tummy beside me with her hands cupping her chin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing really.&#34; I pressed my lips together. &#34;We only gossipped about Mr. Thorne when he was driving me home the other day. Turns out he knows how annoying he can be too.&#34; A small smile spread out on my lips as his words echoed in my ears again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s Caleb for you....I guess he just wants to live up to his name....being the thorn in people&#39;s flesh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ve been friends with him for years...Amaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You think I&#39;m nice and sweet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He even helped when we bumped into Mr. Thorne in the bakery.&#34; I added just so she wouldn&#39;t notice that I had been replaying his words in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut. Up.&#34; Her jaw dropped as she sat up immediately. &#34;You&#39;re telling me that you guys bumped into your boss at the bakery?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yup.&#34; I dipped my head in a small nod pursing my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34; She blinked rapidly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing really.&#34; I lifted my shoulders in a casual shrug. &#34;His emotions weren&#39;t directed at me...and Kian convinced him that there was nothing going on between us and that he just found me outside the company waiting for a taxi and decided to give me a lift.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But is there really nothing going on between you two?&#34; A sly grin spread across her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of Course there&#39;s nothing going on between us....he even mentioned his girlfriend today.&#34; I blurted out, causing her lips to part in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You guys met today?&#34; Her eyebrows shot up before relaxing into a frown as I looked away from her gaze. &#34;And you didn&#39;t tell me?&#34; She slapped my exposed thighs. I loved wearing big shirts and shorts whenever I was going to bed but now I regretted it cause it only gave Mia more room to hit me. I flinched at the sting on my thigh as I frowned at her. Her slaps were always so painful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It slipped my mind.&#34; I lied wailing as I secretly cursed myself for being so relaxed around Mia. Well she was my best friend after all. I ended up narrating the whole story to Mia from accidentally using his personal elevator to the pinning to the wall and then meeting Kian. Well...I might have left out the doll part. There was no way I was telling her that. The conversation Kian and I had was more than enough to fill up her inquisitive side. Speaking of my conversation with Kian....if I had to be honest with myself he did keep me company and made me laugh....even though my head hurt even more. I can&#39;t believe he was still insisting on taking me to the hospital. My lips curled up in a small smile. Stupid Kian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You? Came to see me?&#34; I furrowed my brows a bit confused. A part of me thought everything was just more hard to understand due to my excruciating headache while the other part was just....well blank. &#34;W...why?&#34; I batted my lashes still trying to process his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know...&#34; He lifted his broad shoulders in a small shrug. &#34;Maybe I just wanted to hear your side of the story.&#34; He said, staring at me, his eyes brimming with an emotion I couldn&#39;t quite put my finger on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My side of the story?&#34; I cocked my head. &#34;Sorry Mr. Beck but you&#39;re not making any sense.&#34; I let out a small laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought I told you to call me Kian.&#34; He narrowed his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh...&#34; I blinked. I was still getting used to calling one of Caleb&#39;s business partner or should I say *friend* by his name and it was not going well. &#34;...I&#39;m still trying to get used to it.&#34; I looked away from his piercing gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay...&#34; He leaned back. &#34;I understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t even know how Mr. Thorne is gonna react if he hears me calling you by your name.&#34; I told him. I had made up my mind. I wasn&#39;t going to try to get on Caleb&#39;s bad side anymore. Whatever stupid task he wanted me to do for him, I would do it without any complaints as long as it meant he was going to go away. Even if he wanted me to climb mount Everest I&#39;d do it without complaining. If that&#39;s what I had to do to get him off my back then so be it.</p>
