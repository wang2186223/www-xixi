                <p>Caleb&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ve never been so frustrated before in my entire life. How the fuck did that stupid finance manager lose our money like that?! Hell I don&#39;t need to think about it, because that piece of shit is definitely fired.  And where the hell is that woman?! This was the third time she had been late this month and I&#39;ve been letting her off the hook. I&#39;m not going to spare her this time. I looked out the window and it was still raining cats and dogs outside. This wasn&#39;t a reason to be late, she had a car for fucks sake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then I heard the door swing open revealing Amaris standing at the other side drenched in water. She walked into my office, the rainwater from her dress, clinging to her dress accentuating the shape of her body in a mesmerizing way. The wet fabric molded against her skin leaving very little to the imagination. Her hair, soaking wet from the rain, fell in wild messy locks around her pale skin, making her look sexy as hell. I didn&#39;t understand why I was so drawn to her all of a sudden and for some reason I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the fuck Amaris?!&#34; I yelled getting up from my desk as I stormed towards her. &#34;Why are you late?!&#34; I growled trying to convince myself that there was a reasonable explanation for what was happening inside of me right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you blind?! Can&#39;t you see I&#39;m soaking wet.&#34; She pushed her hair to the side revealing her slender neck as she squeezed water out of her hair. My throat bobbed a hard swallow. I looked away pinching between my brows, getting even more frustrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have got to be kidding me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I&#39;m sorry if I don&#39;t meet up to your standards, Sir.&#34; She drawled. &#34;....you asked for this.&#34; She said, handing me a file that was surprisingly not soaked. It was the same file I had asked for yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now if you&#39;ll excuse me I&#39;ll be in my office if you need me.&#34; She said turning to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The hell you won&#39;t,&#34; she was already at the door when I slammed it shut with my arm. I don&#39;t know what came over me but there was no way I was going to let her leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the....&#34; Her voice died when she spun around and found faces inches apart. I could hear her breathing and feel her warm breath against my skin as it sent shivers down my spine. What was happening to me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I narrowed my eyes into venomous slits. &#34;You haven&#39;t told me why you&#39;re late.&#34; My gaze flitting back and forth between her hypnotic eyes before settling on the lushness of her slightly parted lips,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My car broke down....&#34; She began, snapping my eyes back to hers. &#34;....and I couldn&#39;t get a taxi.&#34; Her chest heaved up and down as her cheeks reddened, whatever was happening to me was also happening to her. That was a good thing right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you walked all the way here even though it&#39;s still raining,&#34; her sweet scent intoxicated me, filling my senses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small smile crept up her face as she whispered. &#34;Careful Mr. Thorne unless I might think you actually care about me,&#34; she narrowed her eyes into thin slits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh fuck it,&#34; I said before crashing my lips on hers, claiming them with a fierce, desperate passion. The tension that had been simmering between us erupted. Heat courses through my veins as my body surged with desire as I sank into the kiss, drowning in the sweetness of her mouth. I cupped her chin pulling her closer as her hands found my hair. I didn&#39;t know how long I&#39;ve been wanting to do this but damn it felt good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips molded perfectly against mine as her hands roamed my chest. &#34;I know you want me Mr. Thorne....just say it.&#34; She said between the kisses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck you.&#34; I fisted her hair as her hands found my belt unfastening them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should be more specific sir,&#34; Her lips trailed down my neck before she dropped to my waist, her hands slipping beneath the waistband of my pants, freeing my throbbing cock. &#34;Do you want me to fuck you or suck you,&#34; she looked at me parting her lips slightly and rendering me useless with her stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;s not fucking leading this. That&#39;s what I do best. &#34;Get to my desk&#34; I growled and she swiftly obeyed. &#34;Now bend over&#34; my heart was racing, my cock throbbing and all I want right now is to shove myself into that slick pussy of hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grrrrrrrrng grrrrrrrrng.  What the hell?! Isn&#39;t that my alarm? And what&#39;s it doing in my office? Another ring and I jolted awake sitting up stark straight in bed. Damn! That was all a dream?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s been two months since Amaris began working with me and I haven&#39;t gotten her to lose composure, not even once. And the more I see her, the more I find myself despising her. I haven&#39;t met a lady so intriguing and annoying too. But why on fucking earth, am I having such a dream, though?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up really late, getting washed over by a wave of emotions, because of the dream I had of me and Amaris. I&#39;m not going to the office, because I can&#39;t, hell I don&#39;t want to see her. Her soft annoying voice and shit</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ve been having these kinds of dreams for a while now and I still can&#39;t figure out why. The strange thing is that whenever I think about it, I catch myself smiling, smiling. I never smile, except when I&#39;m with Kian. Man, I&#39;ve got to tell Kian about this because I don&#39;t get what&#39;s going on. He&#39;s usually the more perceptive one, so I believe he&#39;ll have an idea of what&#39;s going on. But knowing him, he&#39;ll most definitely make fun of me because of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got into my car and started a drive down to fit zone, a gym that I knew he frequented very well and is sure to be at by this time. As I sped past I noticed the people, the trees, the cars but then they all began blurring together in my eyes as I began to think about the dream. But why on earth would I be dreaming of someone I hate so much?</p>
