                <p>Amaris&#39; POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I....I should go.&#34; Kian gestured towards the door before getting up. I didn&#39;t want him to leave.....at least not now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t go yet.&#34; I wrapped my fingers around his shirt averting his gaze. &#34;If you go now I&#39;ll have nightmares.&#34; I waited for him to speak but he didn&#39;t say anything which made my heart beat even faster. &#34;I know I&#39;m asking for too much but I just need someone to stay with me. I promise it&#39;ll only be for a few minutes.&#34; I raised my head so I could look into his eyes again. He probably thought I was crazy and desperate....begging a guy to stay at my house because I was scared I was going to get a nightmare. How ridiculous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I loosened my grip on his shirt before dropping my hand to my thigh. I should have thought about this before asking him to stay....hell I should thought about this before letting him into my house. Tonight has been a whole rollercoaster....from the falling on the couch to the little moments in the kitchen and the kiss....oh the kiss. I should have pushed him away when I had the chance. Now look...he kissed me, yes but I was the one who deepened it. I was the one who pulled him closer.....what if it was a mistake? What if he didn&#39;t mean to kiss me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dropped my gaze, lowering my head as I tried to calm the thudding heart in my chest. &#34;N...nevermind. I&#39;m fi...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would love to stay.&#34; He sank beside me. &#34;I mean.....so you won&#39;t get nightmares. Yeah we definitely don&#39;t want that.&#34; He stuttered causing a small smile to curl up my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.....&#34; I averted his gaze turning back to the TV. I picked up the remote and began scrolling through netflix before finally clicking on a random rom com. *When Harry met Sally.* I didn&#39;t know why I picked it though when I had already seen it before and I could bet Kian had. I loved romance movies....at least I loved watching them alone....or with Mia. Not with my boss&#39;s friend and cousin that I was sexually attracted to! But it was fine.....definitely fine. Nothing weird was going to happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The movie began and slowly I found the small distance Kian and I had kept between ourselves disappearing. I blamed it on the cold night. It was freezing in here and I was too lazy to go get a blanket and the only way we could get a bit of warmth was our body heat and before I realize I was already resting my head on Kian&#39;s shoulder. We watched in comfortable silence, occasionally exchanging hushed comments and giggles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meg Ryan&#39;s iconic &#34;I&#39;ll have what she&#39;s having&#34; line made us both burst out laughing, and I couldn&#39;t help but notice how relaxed and free he loved sitting here by my side. I mean don&#39;t get me wrong Kian was always relaxed but I don&#39;t know.....tonight he just looked so....different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The movie finally came to an end and as the credits rolled, I flashed a smile at Kian, feeling my heart full. &#34;Thanks....I think that&#39;s exactly what I needed.&#34; My eyes flickered between his and it took everything in me not to stare at his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kian then let out a small laugh before saying, &#34;My pleasure.&#34; He placed a hand to his chest. I had told him that it&#39;ll just be a few minutes but it&#39;d been more than an hour. I gazed into his eyes for a while before my gaze drifted to the clock on the wall. Kian probably followed my gaze because the next thing I heard was, &#34;Oh my God...how the fuck did it get so late?&#34; He asked getting up from the couch. It was almost 1 am in the morning and we hadn&#39;t even realized because we were up kissing and watching movies.....like couples would! A hint of pink color crept up my cheeks as I pushed the thought to the back of my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Time flies when you&#39;re having fun I guess.&#34; I lifted my shoulders in a small shrug as I followed him to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah....I guess.&#34; A gentle smile twitched at the corner of his lips as I held the door open for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good night...&#34; I waved as he walked out. He pressed his lips together in a thin line and I couldn&#39;t help but assume there was something he wanted to say but for some reason he couldn&#39;t say it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good night.&#34; He smiled awkwardly before he slowly turned to leave and the air between us grew thick with an uncomfortable silence. We stood at the door for a little while, hesitating, I waited cause I thought he had something to say and he? Not so sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I realized he wasn&#39;t going to say anything, I turned to head inside but then for some unknown reason I decided to take one last look and there I saw Kian&#39;s hand frozen in mid air as he tried to reach for my shoulder. He then clenched his fist before dropping it to his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our eyes met again and for a moment we just stared at each other, the tension between us palpable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I decided to break the silence since he didn&#39;t want to say anything. &#34;Thanks again....&#34; I spoke, my voice barely above a whisper as I played with my fingers. &#34;...for tonight.&#34; I added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kian dipped his head in a small nod, his smile weak. &#34;No problem.&#34; He gave a tiny salute, his fingers barely brushing his forehead. Kian turned to leave again and I gently pushed the door still hoping to hear whatever it was that was running through his mind. Sadly he didn&#39;t. *Oh well....I guess it&#39;s just my imagination then.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door was about closing when It suddenly stopped. That was when I looked down to see that Kian had wedged in the gap with his leg halting the door&#39;s progress. Seconds later, Kian&#39;s face appeared through the opening, his eyes locked on mine with a determined glint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait!&#34; He rushed in before I could even say anything or even react. My brows dipped as I stared at him. *So he did have something to say.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; I asked a I felt a surge of emotion rush through me as possible scenarios flashed in my head. As he opened his mouth to say something, I relaxed my grip on the door handle about shutting it but then he stopped by placing his hand on mine. &#34;There&#39;s no need to shut the door again. It&#39;ll only take a few seconds.&#34;</p>
