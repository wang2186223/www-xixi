                <p>Amaris&#39; POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I always made sure to remind myself that he had a girlfriend so I would cross the boundaries I set out for myself. His eyebrows shot up like he suddenly remembered something before a small smile formed on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh right. I have a girlfriend.&#34; He says almost sarcastically. Was he joking? Did he actually have a girlfriend or was he just lying to me? Or maybe he just didn&#39;t like her very much. But if he did he could just break up with her right? &#34;You know I&#39;m starting to think you don&#39;t have a girlfriend.&#34; I tilted my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;re starting to think that that means you must be very gullible.&#34; He let out a small laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t just starting to think it. I had my doubts from the very moment Kian mentioned his girlfriend but I just wanted to mind my business and not say anything and he knew that but there was also something that was very confusing....why did he lie? &#34;I am not gullible Kian.&#34; I drawled. &#34;I just didn&#39;t want to say anything.&#34; I shrugged my shoulders. &#34;It&#39;s your life....you lying about having a girlfriend is none of my business.&#34; I said nonchalantly hoping that he was going to tell me why he lied about having a girlfriend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh so you don&#39;t want to know why I lied?&#34; He scrunched his forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like I said....none of my business.&#34; I sank my teeth into the cupcake as I locked eyes with him. Of Course I wanted to know why he lied but I was never going to tell him that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He mirrored my actions as he narrowed his eyes. &#34;You&#39;re lying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What makes you think I&#39;m lying?&#34; I lifted my brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh I don&#39;t think...I know.&#34; He lowered his voice at that last part as he leaned closer. &#34;I know that if not for your pride you would have been on your knees right now begging me to tell you why I lied about having a girlfriend.&#34; He spoke in hushed tones. &#34;Isn&#39;t that right Amaris?&#34; He said when our faces were inches away giving me a chance to gaze into his stunning green eyes, vibrant green hues that danced and swirled like a meadow of new spring grass, swaying in the breeze. They were framed by thick, dark lashes, which only seemed to highlight their beauty. Why was he looking at me like that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wrong.&#34; I said with a bored expression before pushing him away. &#34;So wrong.&#34; A small smile crept up his face as his lips twisted into a frown. &#34;I have no business with your personal friends.&#34; A self-assured glint flashed in my eyes as my smile broadened, my chin lifting slightly in a display of confident pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ouch.&#34; He moved back before getting up from the desk. &#34;And here I thought that we were friends.&#34; He finished the cupcake in his hand before dusting his palms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are friends.&#34; I corrected him. &#34;We&#39;re just not close friends.&#34; I told him. &#34;And technically speaking whenever we are in this....vicinity.&#34; I gestured around. &#34;You are my boss&#39; friend and not mine.&#34; I tilted my head to the side. I knew we were friends. I was just doing all of this to see if I could get another emotion out of him other than happiness. Come to think of it I haven&#39;t even seen when he was ever serious. Even when he was doing his weekly check-ups he smiled with everyone. I wondered what it&#39;d be like if he actually got mad or lost his temper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well it just means I have to make you my friend all over again.&#34; A small smile crawled up his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you ever do anything except smile?&#34; I let out a small laugh. His forehead wrinkled as he lifted a brow. &#34;I mean I&#39;m trying to make you sad....or mad....it&#39;s not working.&#34; I giggled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh so you think saying you won&#39;t be friends with me will make me sad.&#34; He adjusted his sleeves. Unlike Caleb, he wasn&#39;t wearing a suit. Instead he wore a crisped shirt and a pair of dress pants and I couldn&#39;t help but notice the way his dress shirt clung to the muscles of his torso, hinting at the powerful physique beneath the thin fabric .His white sleeves were rolled up, exposing sinewy forearms that flexed as he moved. Even though I was never going to say it outloud he did exude a confidence and masculinity that drew my gaze, making me imagine the ripple of his abs and the broad expanse of his chest beneath the crisp cotton. He was attractive, yes but...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amaris Carter....are you checking me out?&#34; A sly grin formed on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; My brows drew together. &#34;Why on earth would I do that?&#34; I picked up a random file from my desk to avoid looking into his eyes. I wasn&#39;t checking him out....I just got distracted for a few seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips parted in surprise as he gasped. &#34;You did.&#34; He pointed at me, closing the distance between us. &#34;You were checking me out just now.&#34; He lifted a brow as his smirk widened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was not.&#34; I denied flipping through the file. Like I said earlier there was no way I was going to let him know that he was attractive. His ego was already over-inflated and it would have been pointless to feed his already voracious appetite for praise and adulation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes you were.&#34; He dropped his arms on my desk leaning closer. &#34;I saw you.&#34; He narrowed his eyes into thin slits. &#34;Why won&#39;t you just admit it?&#34; He pushed himself off the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Simple.&#34; I closed the file. &#34;Because I wasn&#39;t.&#34; I slammed it on the desk. &#34;You were about to leave a few seconds ago? Why are you still here?&#34; I asked, trying to divert his attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop trying to change the topic.&#34; His eyes darkened with an emotion I couldn&#39;t exactly put my finger on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not trying to change the topic.&#34; I picked up the file pressing it against his face as I pushed him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh really.&#34; His voice came out in a muffled tone since his whole face was covered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you know what personal space is?&#34; I wrinkled my nose as I left the file to fall on the desk. &#34;Why do you love being  inches away from my face?&#34; I crossed my arms over my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dunno.&#34; He pushed the file towards me. &#34;Maybe it&#39;s because I love the way you smell.&#34; He said, causing my eyebrows to shoot up as heat flared my cheeks. Did he just....say that to me?</p>
