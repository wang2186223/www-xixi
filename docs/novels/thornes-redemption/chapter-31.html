                <p>Caleb&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything in this world that pleases me the way the annoyed look on Amaris&#39; face does. I was surprised when she told me that she had completed the task that I assigned to her, I mean I knew she was good but I didn&#39;t know she was that good and fast. I guess I did a good job employing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thank God I was able to come up with another grueling task to keep her busy. Printing out every file in the company&#39;s database, I let out a light chuckle. *What a joke*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I pictured her inner turmoil and frustration when she heard my request, I couldn&#39;t help but smile to myself. That&#39;s what you get for talking back, Miss Carter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I truly did enjoy getting a rise out of her but what fascinated me even more was the look on her face when she heard me say ass. The way her cheeks heated up, the rosy tint spreading across her cheeks,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aren&#39;t you going to leave? You&#39;re distracting me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who would have thought that she would actually admit that she was distracted by me. I mean she always did put on that stupid act of hers like she was some tough woman...unfortunately for her I found out her little secret. Let&#39;s just see how long she can keep up the tough girl act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thoughts were interrupted by the loud blaring sound coming from my phone. I stared down at the phone as it shook on the table. I always kept it on do not disturb. I didn&#39;t want my phone to start ringing in the middle of an important meeting, not that my subordinates would say anything about it but it wasn&#39;t quite....professional.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was my mum, well she wasn&#39;t actually my real mother. She took Kian and I in when our parents died. She used to be our nanny back then when we were children but after the incident she decided to take us in and ever since then Kian and I had seen her like a mother to us. We always did everything in our power to make her happy but we knew deep down that we could never pay her for the things she had done for us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good day, mother.&#34; I greeted in a rather cheerful tone. When I was with Miranda, I let go of all the stoic expressions and icy tones and was just the normal cheerful boy she raised. &#34;How are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caleb darling....oh I&#39;ve missed you so much.&#34; I wasn&#39;t seeing her but I could practically picture her bright smile as she spoke. &#34;You and Kian have completely forgotten about me, you boys don&#39;t care about me anymore.&#34; She huffed. Sometimes I used to forget how old she was because of the way she talked. Anyone listening to her right now would assume she was a 9 year old talking, reminding her uncle about the unfulfilled promises he made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on mother....you know that there&#39;s no way I can forget about you.&#34; I grinned as I held the phone to my ear, relaxing in my leather chair. &#34;I don&#39;t know about Kian though, these days all he does is work out at the gym.&#34; I said before we both burst out laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kian will never forget me.&#34; I could literally hear her rolling her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh....so Kian can&#39;t forget you but I can?&#34; I spoke, raising my brows like she could see the expression on my face. It was more of a statement than a question. &#34;Is that so?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone sounds jealous.&#34; She let out a mirthful chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of Course I&#39;m jealous.&#34; I picked up the heavy ornate paper weight, my fingers tracing the rough uneven surface. Even till now I hadn&#39;t figured out what it was but that was what I loved about it. It was unlike any other one I&#39;d seen with jagged edges and feel pits that looked like they&#39;d been formed naturally over time. &#34;You&#39;re picking sides now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh honey, I&#39;m not picking anyone&#39;s side. I&#39;m just saying that Kian is the nicer one, that&#39;s all. Don&#39;t worry you&#39;re also better than him in other aspects.&#34; She reassured me. Just then I heard the sound of pots and pans clattering together as if someone had dropped them on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you?&#34; I sat up as my senses went into high alert, I knew that there&#39;d be a chance that she was just I&#39;m the kitchen but it&#39;s better to be safe than sorry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m at home, dear. I know you love me, there&#39;s no reason for you to worry about me. I was trying to make something and the pots just slipped from my hands. It&#39;s no big deal.&#34; I heard her say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I exhaled letting out a breath I didn&#39;t know I was holding. &#34;Are you hurt?&#34; I asked as I leaned back into my chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not at all my dear....I&#39;m perfectly fine.&#34; She says before hacking into a fit of coughs causing me to sit up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did the doctor say anything that you were supposed to tell me?&#34; I didn&#39;t have to beat around the bush asking her whether she went to the hospital or whether she&#39;s on medications. I already knew she was sick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Relax Caleb.....it&#39;s just....&#34; Her sentence was cut short by another fit of coughs. I immediately got up from my desk, dropping the paperweight back on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, we don&#39;t have to talk on the phone. I&#39;m coming to see you.&#34; I picked up the necessary things from my table like my car keys and a few bundles of cash before heading out of my office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No Caleb....you don&#39;t need to worry about me. I&#39;m....&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are not fine.&#34; I cut her off. &#34;And you know perfectly well that there&#39;s no stopping me when I&#39;ve already made up my mind.&#34; I walked into the elevator but before the door closed, someone else rushed inside. Oh God. Why did she have to be here? I was so busy being annoyed about the woman that came in  that I didn&#39;t notice the one behind me. Christ. If I ever make it to heaven I&#39;m going to have a long talk with God about wrong timing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goodbye I&#39;ll talk to you later.&#34; I felt guilty for hanging up on her and not giving her a chance to speak but I didn&#39;t have a choice not when this two women were in the same fucking place with me. I knew I should have taken my private elevator. The one standing behind me didn&#39;t even acknowledge my presence. She kept her gaze buried in the file she was holding. She was so engrossed in what she was looking at, I suspected she was making it a point not to look at me or even spare me a glance. A small smile crept up my lips before I turned back to the woman in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was no brainer that she jumped in when she saw me and now she&#39;s expecting us to talk, she probably noticed someone else in the elevator and that&#39;s why she was quiet right now. If any other person would have been in my shoes they would be definitely uncomfortable and disturbed by the deafening silence but that was none of my business. In fact I loved silence, I hated talking with people unless it had anything to do with business. Other than that, it was just a waste of time. Speaking of time I glanced at my wrist as the elevator opened....maybe if I hurry I&#39;ll be able to get there in 20 min. I thought to myself as I walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel Amaris&#39; questioning glare burning my skin as Kiara tailed behind me. Oh no. Don&#39;t tell me she was actually going to follow me now?</p>
