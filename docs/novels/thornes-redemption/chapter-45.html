                <p>Caleb&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes swept around the club as I sat in the corner watching the women on the dance floor. Unfortunately I hadn&#39;t seen anyone that caught my eye....yet. As I lifted my glass to my lips again, I couldn&#39;t help but recall that very day I found Amaris in the bakery with Kian. I wasn&#39;t surprised that they were together...I was just surprised that Kian brought her to the bakery....it was his mum&#39;s favorite bakery and he had never brought any woman there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Guess I&#39;ll just have to wait longer then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the fuck are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Till you fall in love with some random girl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small smile crept up my lips. It was funny that he actually thought I&#39;d be the one falling in love. I didn&#39;t give a fuck if Amaris had already been in his bed. A mental image of Amaris in Kian&#39;s sitting on his lap with his hands wrapped around her waist while they made out flashed in my head and I shut my eyes before taking another sip of my drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All I wanted was for them to keep me out of their stupid relationship. &#34;Hey Handsome...&#34; I lifted my gaze with my glass still in my hand finding a woman in a black dress standing a few feet away from me, her eyes darkened with lust. She was wearing a bodycon mini dress which clung to her body like a second skin revealing her curves. My gaze dropped to her long sexy legs as she planted her hand on one of her hips before returning back to her face. She was slightly taller than Kiara which made her look even more sexy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was actually surprised that I found her attractive, which was kind of rare these days since most women pissed me off. I decided to come to the club tonight so I could find a replacement for Kiara although I hadn&#39;t told her yet....not that I was planning to anyway. From the little time I&#39;ve spent with her, I could testify that she wasn&#39;t a really smart woman considering the fact that she was under the impression that I was in love with her but she&#39;ll definitely figure it out herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Need someone to fill in that empty seat beside you?&#34; She spoke in a sultry manner. My eyebrows dropped as I sized her up again. She had blonde wavy hair with piercing blue siren eyes, a pointed nose and heart shaped lips. There was no doubt about it...she was pretty but I had to make sure she was the type of woman I allowed in my bed. &#34;Or why don&#39;t I fill up your thoughts instead?&#34; She purred straddling my lap, wrapping her arms around my neck as she bit on her lower lip. I inhaled her scent, an amazing blend of amber and musk, with hints of jasmine and sandalwood. The type that lingered in the air minutes after the person was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dropped my glass of wine on the table beside me before resting my arms on her waist. &#34;You are one feisty young woman.&#34; My gaze dropped to her breast that was literally inches away from my face. A knowing smirk crept up my face as I lifted my head, &#34;What&#39;s your name darling?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jessica...&#34; She answered after a few beats as she ran her fingers down my chin. &#34;What&#39;s yours?&#34; Her fruity breath grazed my face as she inched closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was taken aback by her question but I didn&#39;t show it. It was surprising that she didn&#39;t know who I was....I mean that would explain why she had the guts to walk up to me in the first place, most women were scared of me and I loved it. Unlike most men that demanded respect from women, I preferred being feared. Maybe she wasn&#39;t the type who bothered herself with the things happening around her or maybe she had only heard about me and didn&#39;t know what I looked like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think you would actually want an answer to that question....&#34; I moved my hands lower cupping them around her ass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh....&#34; She arched her brow. &#34;...and what makes you think that?&#34; She ran one of her arms down my chest while the other played with my hair. I never allowed any woman to touch my hair unless I was eating her out or making out. I was about to tell her to take her hands off when she crashed her lips on mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated a bit giving all of this a second thought. She was pretty and sexy too and on to top it all off I was kind of attracted to her....she was lacking in the other aspects like knowing exactly how I liked being touched, kissed, fucked. &#34;Mmm,&#34; she moaned into the kiss running her hands through my hair. I hated giving women second chances of teaching them things they were supposed to know but....</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on Ammie, you know I hate dancing alone.&#34; Music blasted in the hall but I was sure of what I heard. &#34;Just come dance with me.&#34; The voice rang out from beside me. There was a huge board which divided the hall into different sections so I couldn&#39;t see them even if I wanted to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia...&#34; She whined. &#34;You already dragged me here with you. Isn&#39;t that enough?&#34; She huffed. What the fuck was she doing in a club by this time of the night? Was this why she asked to leave work early today? She finally decided to end her foolishness and talk to me only because she wanted my permission to leave work early.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s a family emergency. Her voice echoed in my ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if reading my thoughts, I heard her friend say, &#34;Oh come on...so you&#39;re telling me you wanted to stay back home....&#34; She paused for a few seconds before she spoke again. &#34;Then what was the point of lying to your boss in the first place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then Jessica pulled away as she stared at me with a scrutinizing look in her eyes. &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; Her lips twisted into a scowl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; I asked in a neutral tone. She then turned to look around, not knowing exactly what she was looking for, I glanced around too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You seem....&#34; She pouted as her gaze dropped to my chest before returning to my face. &#34;....distracted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My frown deepened. I didn&#39;t like it when women questioned me and she was asking way too many questions for someone I met just a few minutes ago. &#34;Do you want me to fuck you or not?&#34; I growled as the color drained out of my eyes and I could tell that she was a bit frightened from the way her eyebrows shot up and the way  she stiffened on my thighs. I expected her to chicken out and make up a stupid excuse so she could leave. Most women did but she didn&#39;t, instead her surprised expression contorted to an intrigued one as she leaned in closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mmmm,&#34; she hummed as her lips hovered over mine. &#34;Sexy and dominant.&#34; She purred, eliciting a sly grin from me. I liked the fact that she wanted to be the submissive one....maybe, just maybe....</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Ammie....look behind you.&#34; A voice interrupted my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That guy&#39;s checking you out.&#34; For a second there I almost forgot that there was someone else in the club with me....and that someone else was my employee who fucking lied to me so she could go clubbing. I&#39;ll definitely make her regret this.</p>
