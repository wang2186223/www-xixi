                <p>Kian&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh no.&#34; Her eyebrows shot up. &#34;Its okay....if he doesn&#39;t want me to talk to your mother then I won&#39;t talk to her. My life has been incredible ever since he left and I don&#39;t want to ruin that.&#34; She pushed herself off the counter before heading towards the living room and I followed forcing myself not to stare at her ass. Maybe coming to her house this late at night was a terrible idea....especially now that my hormones were all over the place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay...if you say so.&#34; I glanced around the living room again. &#34;So...when is your friend coming back?&#34; I asked as a certain strawberry blonde with blue eyes flashed in my head. Maybe if she was around I wouldn&#39;t be this distracted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I mean Kian&#39;s hot and so freaking sexy. I think he&#39;ll make a good boyfriend plus judging by his looks he&#39;ll probably be good in bed so girl....you definitely can&#39;t miss out on this...at least for the sex.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Next week I think.&#34; She said before plopping down on the couch causing her soft and rounded breasts to quiver with a gentle motion. My throat bobbed with a hard swallow. I really shouldn&#39;t have come here tonight.  &#34;Why are you asking?&#34; *Come on Kian. Whatever you do don&#39;t picture her naked.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh...I just noticed how quiet the place was and I just thought it wouldn&#39;t be this quiet if she was around.&#34; I settled beside her causing the couch to dip beneath my weight. Her silky night dress shifted and my gaze dropped to her exposed thigh. *I should have sat on the other couch.* I placed my hand over the chair&#39;s back rest as casually as I could as I sucked in breath to calm myself.....not obvious for her to notice though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah....I guess. She&#39;s not exactly the quiet type.&#34; She looked towards the ceiling like she was remembering something before nodding her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trust me I know.&#34; I raised my brows. She looked confused for a while and it took her another few seconds to actually understand what I meant by that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right.&#34; She drawled looking away from my gaze before reaching for the remote on the small table beside her. I searched through my mind for a casual topic that we could talk about without weird things like *this* going on but unfortunately I was blank. Luckily for me she came up with something. &#34;So you have a sister?&#34; She asked pressing the buttons of the remote in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No....do you?&#34; I shifted my gaze from the colourful screen to her eyes. &#34;A brother perhaps?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah....a sister though. I don&#39;t have any brothers....or any male relative for that matter.&#34; My brows dipped in a frown as I noticed the sad glint in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about your father?&#34; I asked not sure if my suspicions were correct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dead and gone.&#34; She said announcing her father&#39;s death like it was just some commenting on the weather or mentioning what she had for breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh....&#34; My lips tightened. &#34;...sorry about that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was young when it happened so it&#39;s cool.&#34; She said her gaze fixed on the TV as she moved from one chanel to another. Judging from her demeanor I could tell she was still hurt by her father&#39;s death even though she was young.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did he die?&#34; I knew I shouldn&#39;t be asking things like this but my curiosity got the best of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shot in cold blood. Right in front of my eyes.&#34; She said in a flat robotic tone, her voice devoid of emotion and I couldn&#39;t help but feel sorry for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like I said it&#39;s cool. I still have my mother and my baby sister. My dad had no siblings and his parents died a long time ago while my mum&#39;s family rejected her because she got married to a man who wasn&#39;t as rich as they were so.....&#34; She tapered off. *Jesus Christ.* How could someone be so cruel?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;....but that&#39;s not right.&#34; I moved closer to her taking the remote from her so she&#39;d turn to face me but she never did. She just lowered her gaze while she played with her fingers. &#34;Your mum is free to make her own choices.&#34; *No reply.* &#34;She&#39;s free to get married to who ever she wants to get married to.&#34; *Still no reply.* Which gave me no other choice. I slowly reached out gently grasping her chin, my fingers wrapping around it with a firm but tender touch. I felt a spark of electricity as my skin made contacts with hers and I couldn&#39;t help but notice how soft her chin was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gently guilded her chin upwards, bringing her face to mine. Her eyes, dull and glossy...too glossy. I could tell she was about to cry the second our eyes met but she held it in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She resisted for a split second when I held her chin but she didn&#39;t pull away. And then in an instant, I released her chin letting her face drop back down. I rubbed my fingers together as the memory of her touch, lingered on my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I parted my lips about to say something but when I spotted the tear rolling down her cheek I didn&#39;t know what to do or say to her anymore. I just spread out my arms....I wasn&#39;t sure if she was comfortable hugging a guy but right now it was the only think I could think of. &#34;If you need someone to...&#34; I wasn&#39;t able to finish the rest of my sentence because before I could process what was happening she rushed into my my arms, throwing her own arms around me. Her body shook slightly as she buried her face in my chest sobbing and I could feel her warm tears soaking through my shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I instinctively began to pat her back, trying to soothe her. &#34;It&#39;s okay.&#34; I whispered, but she just clung to me tighter, her sobs growing more intense. I wrapped my arms around her, holding her close and letting her cry on my shoulder. I felt a small smile form as her warm breath brushed against my skin. Gently rubbing her back, I noticed how small and fragile she seemed in my arms. I wished I could take away her pain, make everything better. &#34;It&#39;s okay.&#34; I repeated as I continued patting her as I felt her tense muscles begin to relax and slowly her sobs began to subside. Eventually she pulled back looking up at me with red, puffy eyes. I could sense her insecurity. She probably thought she looked ugly with her wet cheeks and puffy eyes. To me, though, it felt completely different. Her trembling lips, tear-streaked cheeks, and swollen eyelids only made her seem even more endearing. She was so cute and vulnerable that I couldn&#39;t help but smile as I wiped her tears away. I looked into her eyes, and for a moment, she met my gaze before looking down. &#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; She said quietly wiping her tears away before turning to the wet spot on my shirt. &#34;I ruined your shirt and....&#34;</p>
