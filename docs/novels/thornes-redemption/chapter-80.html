                <p>Caleb&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was supposed to come back home tonight from South Korea. I missed my girl: her cute giggling, the wiggling of her waist, her bounce whenever she moved. I haven&#39;t been around for weeks, I&#39;m sure she was happy from our bickerings and the continuous moaning that came out from my officehow I wish it was hers. I wished to hold her slender waist and put her right on my laps then fuck the hell out of her. I want her mouth to spill profanities from the pleasure that I show her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My cold demeanor shattered into different pieces when the information got to me that I&#39;m going back home tonight. I immediately rushed back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Butonce, I got back, I called her phone and it showed the user was busy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Busy doing what? Where is Amaris?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were only two places that she could be- at home or at work. I immediately got to her home and It was dark..indicating no one was there but I saw Mia coming home with groceries but Amaris was no where knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Agent 42, check where Amaris is. Right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the clock clicked, my patience decreased and my annoyance increased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; She&#39;s at a restaurant with Kian boss&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I flew up in rage. What was he doing with her? And why was she with him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I directed the driver to immediately move to that place and as soon as we got there I ran out of the car without minding my image and I got there right on time to hear Kian say something ridiculous but something I feared she wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; I want to call you mine. Will be mine?&#34;, he said cheekily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t give her any space to answer before I said &#34; No&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to leave with me but she walked out and walked straight to the resting room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed behind thinking of the various ways I could punish her and show her that she was actually mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as we both walked into the toilet, I closed the door with a bang and looked at her fiercely like a lion about to devour its prey but she returned it without fear. This increased the fire burning within me as I took a ferocious step to her and push her against the wall with my face besides her neck. Her scent swifted right into my nose and she gasped slightly before closing her eyes. I smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands grabbed her waist as she moved closer with her body pushing right on my groinI grounded sexily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at her passionately enjoying every single moment. Her rapid intake of breath, the flush of red on her face, her indecisive between grabbing me and pushing me as my nose rubbed against her nose and I gave her a small peck before I leaned down and kissed her cherry lips, nibbling it softly then sucking it and she tried to resist but I held her tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled away as I used my fingertips to rub those red lips then I looked right in her eyes and carried her up the washbasin quickly then I pressed her back against the mirror looking right at myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smirked and she said softly but intoxicating, &#34; Caleb.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something within me stared and my eyes darkened as I pulled in for more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>______</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amaris POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door shut with a bang and I looked back amazed only to see him looking right at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at me and then started walking to me slowly and I moved back until my back was pressed against the wall and his face on my neck..my body was totally stiff as his muscular hands gripped my waist tightly as if  he wished to break them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kissed me softly and passionately tasting every inch of my mouth whilst biting it slowly as I closed my eyes and pulled him closer then he pulled away and I opened my eyes only to see him staring at me seductively. I got up and looked at him in rage then I yelled, &#34; What&#39;s your problem? I&#39;m not your property.&#34; It didn&#39;t seem like he heard a single word of mine instead he shut me up with a kiss. His tongue sucked my tongue digging deeper into my mouth looking for something then it licked every corner of my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moaned softly in bliss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahah ah Caleb.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped then looked right at my eyes then he went down to my neck, shifting my hair to the side as he sniffed in my scent and let out a soft mumble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; You smell so sweet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My stomach rumbled in excitement and my core wet from waiting. I was about to burst from pleasure when I felt his hands going under my gown and I gasped then held him tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rubbed against me softly and gently letting out a gentle laughter something I haven&#39;t ever heard as he said, &#34; You are so wet&#34;. I nodded unconsciously and I became embarrassed right at that moment as I immediately closed my legs with his hands in there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Open up. Be a good girl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He patted my legs naughtily then shifted the fabric and his hands went to my clit playing it like a button and I moaned to his touch and moved closer for more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Ah fuck.. Caleb what are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t say anything as he put a finger right into me and I yelled, &#34; Ahh fuck that hurts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thrusted it in gently but wildly breaking every barrier as my mouth went wild open and I gasped for air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled his finger out then put it into his mouth and sucked it while maintaining eye contact then lunged in for another kiss and I held him by his neck..fully accepting it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was tasting my own juice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the door opened and I saw a face looking at me disappointed, &#34; Kyan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb turned towards him and smirked and I realized the posture we were in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled away and tried to run after his disappearing figure but Caleb pulled me by my wrist and pressed my figure against the wall with passion lit in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Let&#39;s continue what we started? Mhmm?&#34;, he said with a crazy smile as his hands lifted my chin and he returned to my lips, kissing it fervently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a ripping sound, he tore my clothes into shreds and stood in front of him bare as he looked at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I used my hands to cover myself but he pulled my hands away then whispered gently into my ear lobe that he softly but</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; You are beautiful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His body right on mine as I could feel his hard dick pressing right against my pussy and I moaned</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Caleb.. please.&#34;</p>
