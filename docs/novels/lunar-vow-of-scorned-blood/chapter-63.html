                <p>The next day we went straight to where her brother is. He was locked up in a cell. When he notice us coming he just move further away his cell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How many times do I have to tell you that I have nothing to do with Rion&#39;s betrayal!&#34; He shouted, he had so many bruises all over his body. And he have a collar just to make sure he wouldn&#39;t dare to shift into his wolf. Because once he did that he will automatically die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not one of them!&#34; He badge to the iron surroundings his cell. Making us see his face clearly. He look younger than us. Strawberry blonde hair with a pair of blue eyes. He look exactly like his twin, except for his eyes are lighter shade of blue than his sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you know them.&#34; This made him quiet, when he just realized what he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I don&#39;t...&#34; He stammer, I just stared at him. I ordered Zion to open the cell and Arren pulled him outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look here, I am not the enemy. If you will choose among us, you better stick with me.&#34; I muttered, he look hesitant and weary about us. His eyes shifted from me and the others then back to me. Then something caught his attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are one of us.&#34; He muttered, I frowned at him unsure what he was talking about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re from the Island.&#34; He muttered, this time he caught my attention. I pulled him arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you know about the Island?&#34; He didn&#39;t look surprised at my reaction. His face change to a calmer one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t talk about that here. They have eyes everywhere.&#34; He whispered. Acting all weird again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure his not a crackhead?&#34; Arren uttered. Darren told him to shut up. &#34;Just saying.&#34; He mumbled then turn his attention somewhere else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you are one of us. But I never saw you there.&#34; He said, I let go his arms and he then took off his collar. If he could do that then he should have escape before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I always want to take that off, but I was waiting for the right moment. Looks like my patience is not wasted just like what she said.&#34; He mumbled, I just stand there feeling confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you are a pure blood werewolf before. You are just like me, you are made to be one.&#34; He continue. Now I know what he was talking about. This time I pinned him on his hell, leaving a loud thug as he hits the metal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you to tell me everything you know right now.&#34; I gritted my teeth, Zion tap my shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need to calm down Dwayne. We wouldn&#39;t want to catch to much attention.&#34; He whispered reminding me of the reason why we are here. This isn&#39;t just about the reason why Rion betrayed the Faction. But what is their connection with the rogues and that Island. Because I know Klaire wouldn&#39;t turn her back without any reason. Or am I making excuses on her behalf?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fck!&#34; Then I let him fall on the ground. He started coughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are much stronger than us. No wonder they wanted you all back.&#34; He mumbled, I just let him seat there catching his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dwayne what is really happening? I know this isn&#39;t about the faction. It was about her right?&#34; I remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fck! I was right the whole time. Are you really going to put everything behind for her?!&#34; Zion said angrily. He had no idea what he was talking about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hahahahaha!&#34; We all look at him, he was laughing so hard that he even had tears in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What a pity, the little beta doesn&#39;t even know what he was getting into.&#34; Zion pulled him, choking his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would shut up is I were you. You traitor!&#34; He growled at him. But Dieter just laugh again even though he was having a hard time breathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Y-you had no idea what will happen to all of you soon. Yet you are wasting your time on me.&#34; He bark back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zion let him go, I will explain everything later. But right now I need you to trust your Alpha.&#34; He didn&#39;t say anything and let him fall to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They are coming, quick put him back to his cell.&#34; Darren said, he was the one waiting outside to make sure no werewolf will know what we are talking about. Werewolves have a very sensitive ears so hearing us from a distance is not an issue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will return later, and this time you have to tell me what you know.&#34; I muttered, then put his collar back. This time I made sure he wouldn&#39;t be able to take it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we are done. Cameron and Harid came. Cameron had this smile on his faces. And just from his distance to mine, I can smell the metallic scent of blood coming from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like someone had his fun.&#34; Cameron said, while staring at Dieter who look much worst because of what happened. His neck was bleeding because I tightened the collar around his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; I ask, ignoring his statement. He cleared his throat and gave me a huge smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well we are here to tell you a news. Looks like your friends are probably dead by now. &#34; I narrow my brow, not liking where he was heading to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Central Kingdom was attacked by Rogues, and it was destroyed. No one survived. Looks like no matter how strong the Royalties are they still couldn&#39;t handle them alone.&#34; He added, my heart started pounding at his words. The Central Kingdom?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That can&#39;t be real right? They are one of the most powerful werewolves.&#34; Arren uttered, he always wanted to be part of the Central Kingdom. I always heard him muttering about it when we are all still together on our trainings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remained silent and didn&#39;t say a word. They are both waiting for my response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That doesn&#39;t matter anymore. What is important is our Pack.&#34; I mumbled, turning my back at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why can&#39;t you shut up?&#34; I heard Darren scolding his brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay then, I heard it was her doing.&#34; This made me stop my track. &#34;She really need to die you know? &#34; I clench my fist, my wolf was in rage. I can feel him imaging his head right in his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know...&#34; I uttered, then continue to walk away from them. The others followed me from behind. No one dare to talk until we reach the pack house. Tonight we will make our way towards Devon&#39;s whereabouts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night after Cameron and Harid left, I know they will start looking for her so we have to move faster than them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have to go.&#34; I muttered once they all arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about Dieter?&#34; Lindon ask, I know they are going to him and force him for information. So I wouldn&#39;t be able to take him with us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to find her first. I&#39;m not even sure if he was still alive by now.&#34; I uttered, he didn&#39;t say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go!&#34; I shifted to my wolf, letting him loose feel so much better. He was wanting to crawl out of my skin since the day we arrived here. He was relentless this past few days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lindon lead the way, he took us outside the border. To the deep mountain ranges.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you taking us?&#34; Zion voice whispered in our heads, right now we can hear everyone&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To the top of the mountain, where we always go whenever&#39;s we wanted to hide from everyone.&#34; He explain. When I glance at the mountain that he was pointing. It looks so dark, like no one would even dare to come near it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait that mountain is to dangerous, the rocks around it are to sharp and it was too stiff, so no one dare to climb it after it took to many lives.&#34; Claus said, I almost forgot that he once came here during his trainings. That&#39;s why he somehow knew the territory. &#34;I never imagine myself returning to this place after he died.&#34; He added, Zion&#39;s pace became slow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So this is where his brother died, he returned again here to complete his training as a Beta that was also the time where Claus turned his back to the pack. He should be the Beta but he was to broken to fullfil his duty which pushed Zion&#39;s brother to take the responsibility which lead for a tragic end. I heard it was an accident that cause him to fell into the cliff of the mountain as he was saving someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was her.&#34; Zion mumbled. I can feel his anger from where I&#39;m standing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was her, I wouldn&#39;t forget that face when we take my brother&#39;s ash.&#34; He added. We all remained silent after that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lindon took us somewhere along the mountain, we entered a cave and he told us that it was a secret passage to the top. The trek itself is not even easy even though this is the easiest and fastest way to reach the top according to him. I can&#39;t even imagine 3 kids climbing this way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we almost see the top, Lindon stop for a minute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be careful around here. We put some traps here just in case some tried to come here.&#34; We all look at him with disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you for real? Just seeing this place make me even don&#39;t want to be near especially climb it.&#34; Arren uttered, we all just ignored him and followed Lindon&#39;s steps. We shifted back to our human form because it would be easier to avoid the traps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we successfully got out, we were welcome with a place full of blooming flowers. Now I know why they kept coming back here. The top is filled with flowers and trees, it was dark yet the light coming from the moon makes the place look so magical. And right below the biggest tree was a woman standing with her back on us. Her strawberry blonde hair was flowing at the direction of the wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you will come.&#34; She turned around and her eyes widen. She was staring at me? No, she was staring at the person behind me. When I turn to look at who he was looking at it was Zion. Who had the same expression as her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We both know that you knew why Rion betrayed the pack.&#34; Lindon&#39;s voice broke the silence. And she shifted her gaze towards Lindon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been a while Lindon and I am happy to see you too.&#34; She muttered, not even a coldness in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Devon, the former Alpha took you into the South pack and you are the last person with Rion when his father died. What happened then?&#34; I ask, now her gaze was focus on me. She had this look on her face that I cannot explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are one of us.&#34; She mumbled, just like what her brother said. I didn&#39;t say anything. &#34;Looks like they weren&#39;t aware yet.&#34; She uttered, pertaining to the 4 people behind me. I didn&#39;t have time to tell them anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well just like you, Dieter and I where taken. They took us to the Island when we were still human.&#34; Someone gasp when they heard that. I was sure it was Zion. &#34;They killed both our parents and took us in. They started experimenting on us like we are some kind of lab rats. Giving us bloods from who knows where they got it from. I even heard them saying something about Lycans that time.&#34; She mumbled then stared at me but didn&#39;t say anything about it and just continue her story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Faction didn&#39;t care even if other kids die because they cannot take the shift. I remember the first time we shifted, we were 10 that time. And a normal werewolf won&#39;t be able to shift unless they were 16 but to us it was earlier than that. Because we are partly human our body is not ready to shift which cause the life of the others. Dieter and I were one of the successful one who passed the shifting. We were taken by Rion&#39;s father then. Unlike the other Alpha&#39;s he was kind enough to let us somehow experience a normal life. He let us be adopted by this lovely family. But everything change when he arrived once more. I don&#39;t know his name but that night when Rion&#39;s father died, that was the first time I saw him.&#34; She stops then hugged herself. Like she was recalling an event that she wanted to forget.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw him killed Rion&#39;s father with his own bare hands and left before the hunters arrived but what shocked me that time is Rion&#39;s uncle was only watching from a distance. He just watch his brother get stabbed by the Hunters to make sure that he was dead. Then Rion soon arrived but he was already too late. That was the time when I saw his uncle again, I cannot forget his face because he was always with Rion&#39;s father every time he went to the Island. And ynlike his father, his uncle was scarier. He threatened both me and Dieter that he will kill our new family if I will say a word to Rion about his father&#39;s death. I didn&#39;t dare to say anything to him after that.&#34; She stops then gaze at us. Her eyes were full of sorrow and sadness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The my sister died the same day she shifted. I was the first one who found her dead body. She died because someone strangle her to death.&#34; I can see the shift in her body as it tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But then I saw something in her body that no one dare to investigate. Her private part is bleeding, and I confirmed my suspicion when I saw a bite mark in her inner thighs. Some was to eager to claim her. And the only person who have that urge is non other tha-&#34; she didn&#39;t finish her sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rion.&#34; Lindon mumbled, she cannot contain her tears anymore and she started weeping. Her cry was showing how angry she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because we are from a low ranks, they turned blind with what he did and let it slide. They didn&#39;t even let anyone know that she was the next rightful Luna.&#34; She wipe her tears harshly and look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rion betrayed the Factions because I told him everything. I told him what happened to his father. I saw how his whole world crumbled when he found out everything.
