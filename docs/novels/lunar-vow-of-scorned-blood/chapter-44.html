                <p>Dwayne&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Aiden keeps moving, what is wrong with you today? You&#39;ve been here for about a month now and still, you were acting weird.&amp;quot; Aris mutters then started moving faster, I followed from his behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So the time frame this time is about a month now. I glance at Afreo I need to ask him something, knowing that he was the first one who arrives here among the other kids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly made my way to his side not letting the guard hear me as we continue our walk to who knows where.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Afreo you told me she was different why did you say that?&amp;quot; He stared at me with the are your serious kind of look. I nodded my head at him, he let out a sigh. He was still too young to do that but I won&#39;t be surprised by him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;When I arrived here the first night I started having nightmares, and those aren&#39;t normal nightmares. It was like darkness was eating me alive.&amp;quot; He whispered back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Hey, both of you!&amp;quot; We turn our heads to the guard on our back &amp;quot;No talking!&amp;quot; He ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;ll talk to you later,&amp;quot; I whispered to him he looked hesitant at the moment but end up nodding his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I step away from him and continue walking, this time they took us into the same white-walled room, but this time the woman earlier was waiting for us, she was sitting next to the hospital bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Go inside!&amp;quot; One of the guards push my back and I started moving inside, the others followed from my behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scan the whole room as I entered, there are 4 hospital beds and 4 Doctors with her. It looks like a typical clinic that you will see around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Aiden come here.&amp;quot; I hesitated but the guard nudge my shoulder and motioned me to start moving. I slowly made my way to her. There is something within me? Or this body that is telling me not to go to her, but I have no choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Now lay down on the bed.&amp;quot; I followed her instructions quietly. I have no idea what she was doing but she started rubbing something in my arms then she pulled a syringe. It has some red liquid on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;This won&#39;t hurt, so don&#39;t be afraid.&amp;quot; I wasn&#39;t afraid because of the syringe; I was afraid of what possible things I might discover in this place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I flinch when I felt the needle start poking my skin, my heart started beating fast when the liquid in the syringe was all gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Now take a deep breath.&amp;quot; I followed her instructions and slowly took a deep breath until I felt my whole body relaxes as my heartbeat started to come slow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turn my head to the side and saw Afreo, Mulac, Calixto, and Aris also laying in the bed. The four other Doctors also took out some syringes with the same red liquid on them and started injecting them with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly feel dizzy as time goes by, I tried to get up but she stops me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Don&#39;t move.&amp;quot; It was the last thing I remember before everything went black.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I woke up we are back in the same dark cell where we are locked up. The guards were just about to get out when I heard them talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Why would they need these human children for this?&amp;quot; That familiar voice of the guard said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I have no idea, but I heard last time that they tried it on some werewolves then they all end up dying.&amp;quot; The other one answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;This person is really scary; I can feel my whole body shiver when I first saw him.&amp;quot; The other one said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You&#39;re just a coward.&amp;quot; The other one said then he started laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;As if you aren&#39;t one, I even saw you trembled when he asked you about something.&amp;quot; I didn&#39;t hear anything else after that as they started to walk outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I&#39;m sure they aren&#39;t around I open my eyes, the others are still unconscious. I look down my hands and found the chains locked up again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard the sound of chains from the other corner of the dungeon, she was here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Amara?&amp;quot; I ask unsure if it was. I have no idea what happened to her after the last time I woke up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Y-yeah?&amp;quot; Her voice cracked, she sounded weak. What did they do to her this time? I notice my eyesight became clearer and clearer. This time I can see her silhouette in the dark place, it wasn&#39;t that clear but it was better than the last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can see that she was sitting and leaning on the bars of the cell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What happened to you?&amp;quot; I ask, I can&#39;t help but as what happened to her. Something inside me is feeling restless by just seeing her like this. And I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t just an ordinary pity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;They take me into this room, I don&#39;t know why but they started injecting me this black liquid. The same thing that I told you about the other day.&amp;quot; She mumbled, I have no idea what happened before I came back here but I can tell it wasn&#39;t that good. She sounded weaker than before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Did they do anything weird to you?&amp;quot; I ask again, I saw some flicker of light around her eyes but I can&#39;t picture it properly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;No... But I feel weird, sometimes it feels like someone was controlling me? It was like I wasn&#39;t myself but the I was also aware at the same time.&amp;quot; She said, unsure of what she was saying does make sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Don&#39;t worry everything will be okay.&amp;quot; I tried to assure her but I wasn&#39;t even sure what is happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know if everything that I am feeling and seeing right now was even true or just some sort of unrealistic happenings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both started talking to each other again, I told her something about the human world this time, based on what I know as Dwayne of course. She started to relax as we talk, she was amazed as I tell her about the food that humans have. We continue talking like that until she fell asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to face the now awake Afreo, I know that he was awake before she fell asleep and he was listening to our conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I know you&#39;re awake,&amp;quot; I said, he slowly gets up and look at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;How did you know all that? Just who are you Aiden?&amp;quot; I was right, this child was exactly like Clint. The way they think is the same. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he punches me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I wasn&#39;t sure myself. &amp;quot; I answered the truth. After everything that is happening lately, I wasn&#39;t even sure who is the real me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t say anything and remained silent, this is my cue to continue the conversation we left earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I need to ask you to continue what you were telling me earlier.&amp;quot; He frowned then started talking, the childlike Clint was much easier to talk to than the old one I know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;As I was saying, I always had nightmares like darkness was eating me up. It continues for 3 days; I wasn&#39;t aware of her during those times than by the 4th day when I woke up from the same nightmare she was standing right in front of me. Her eyes were staring at me blankly, and for the first time in my life, I never felt the same fear ever. The guards took her with them after that. I was left dumbfounded during that time. That was the first time I saw her face, she had this unusual silver-white hair and her eyes were Gold and Red but what is bothering me is the way her eyes look blank like nothing is written in them.&amp;quot; He explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance in her direction. I can feel the fear of Afreo in his voice as he retells what he just experience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;After that, the nightmares continue but this time it wasn&#39;t the darkness eating me. It was her, she was standing in the same spot where I saw her but this time she was covered with blood and she was holding my heart.&amp;quot; His eyes stared at me, he looked serious and afraid at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It only stops when Aris arrived&amp;quot; he added, we both remain silent after that. No one is sure what to say, I have no idea how to even react after what I just heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance in her direction; she was the same girl before when the lady took me somewhere. She was sleeping soundly, Afreo was also staring in her direction his eyes were full of wary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Just who on earth are you?&amp;quot; I whispered, unsure if I wanted that question to be answered at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look around once more and found a pair of red eyes staring back at me.</p>
