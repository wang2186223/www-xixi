                <p>Klaire&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped as I felt my power run in my veins, it was overwhelming and suffocating at the same time. I started screaming when my body is starting to accept the power surging inside me it was painful. My body temperature continued to rise and it was making my heart beat faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Stop fighting it Klaire, you know this is the real you.&amp;quot; He mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body was starting to feel weird. And it hurts, I clench my fist to stop myself from screaming but it was useless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Voices started whispering in my head, I tried to ignore them but their whispers became louder. This time shadows started pulling me. I struggle from their grasp but as I pull harder the shadows was growing stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to scream but no sound came out of my throat. I glanced up at him he was staring at me with satisfaction in his eyes. My eyes were starting to tear up as it became harder and harder to breathe. I felt like I&#39;m being buried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Don&#39;t fight it.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That voice again, I could feel my power growing inside me. I need to clear my head, everything is so sudden... My memories were back it was fighting everything that I believe of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Stop shutting me down, Amara... You know that I am you and you are me.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, I felt my whole body become lighter as I was consumed with complete darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I open my eyes and found myself floating in the air. My whole body feels so light like I weigh nothing at all. All my senses became more sensitive and precise; I can see my surroundings. Even the small dust in the air like it was zooming itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly landed myself, Kariz was waiting for me with a smile on his face as he stared at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel all my power running in my every vein. And it was refreshing and I felt fearless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I continued to walk in silence I began to observe my surroundings more. Kariz just followed from my behind. I just noticed this now but he didn&#39;t age at all. He looks exactly like how I picture him when he captured me except that the scars on his face are all gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something is different right now there is a presence of color swirling around me as I stared at my hands it was like a colorful blizzard, but the dominating one is the black one. It was glowing, getting stronger than the other auras. I feel different...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What I see is something like energy? Or what they called auras, right now all my surroundings are emanating one. I can feel the bloodthirst in me like I wanted to see blood. The feelings of wanting to see death with my bare hands should send chills down my spine but instead, it was making me smile at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk to where Kariz is, I stop when I was just a few inches away from him. He was smiling but I can see unknown emotions that he soon hides as he notices my staring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Is this what you want me to see?&amp;quot; My voice sounded a bit different, it sounded dead and dull. My smile widens at that thought, I don&#39;t feel anything except for hatred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yes, this is exactly what I expected. Seeing you fully like this only means we are near to attaining our goal. I was the only one you could trust.&amp;quot; I tilted my head at him. he was staring dead serious in my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You know I want to kill you right now right? And I could just do it like this.&amp;quot; I crashed the head of the first person who just entered. His body automatically fell on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t look shocked at what I have done. Feeling satisfied, I know I shouldn&#39;t but why not? I can now have my freedom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Calm yourself, my Queen, you aren&#39;t even fully awake yet.&amp;quot; He mumbled, then turn his attention to the Rogues who just entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I step away from him, leaving him with his own business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes snap at Vicky who has her eyes wide open when she notices me staring and started trembling. I slowly walk towards her, she swallowed her saliva as I get closer and closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Oh C&#39;mon Vicky, don&#39;t be afraid. This is what you wanted to witness in the first place right?&amp;quot; I started playing with her hair, just like how her mother used to do to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Now that I look at you properly, you aren&#39;t dead and your resemblance with your mother was starting to come back to me.&amp;quot; I move to her other side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Remember when I went to your house one day? No one knew about what I did that day, even myself but then thanks to you. I started remembering everything.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stiffens at that thought, she clenches her fist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Remember? Or did you forget? Well, let me retell it to you just in case you forgot about it. You were still young that time, maybe around 12 if I&#39;m not mistaken. I came looking for your mother and I succeeded. I found where she was hiding and didn&#39;t know she had a daughter. But you know what? I remembered everything she did to me that time. How she could start experimenting on a little child who doesn&#39;t even know how to walk yet. Every injects every trial and error, all those tortures that I had to endure at a very very young age I remembered all those things too well. And yet she dared to have a child?&amp;quot; I circled her, touching the long flocks of her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;When I saw her smiling at you like she has done nothing wrong in the past that made me angry. I was so mad that I can&#39;t care less if her daughter saw her mother dies in front of her. On the contrary, I was even more satisfied at that thought. As I saw the horror in her eyes as soon as she saw me. &amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stop for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Then she started thinking about you. She was begging me not to hurt you. What if I wanted to kill her? I could but not in front of her beloved daughter. You are probably not aware of this. She was crying her eyes out at that moment. But it was too late for her to start begging.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tightened my fist when I remember how I begged her every time she left me with uncontrollable rogues. How they played with me, with their dirty hands all over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Funny right? How could she leave a young child with those savages and yet she was begging for the life of her daughter? I wanted her to feel the pain I suffered before.&amp;quot; I lean closer to her and whispered...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Well, I thought I did kill you before Vicky because I do remember how your mother cried that time when she saw me tearing your arms out, you didn&#39;t even have your first shift that time so I was sure you will go to die if I left you like that. But I was wrong.&amp;quot; I glance at Kariz who was now looking at us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I already knew whose fault it that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Anyway after that, she cried her eyes out, I thought I will be satisfied by just seeing that but I wasn&#39;t. It was far more than that, I didn&#39;t feel anything. Then I decided that if I killed her I might feel satisfied. So, I did... I pulled her heart out but I still feel nothing so I snap her head off but still feel nothing, then I started pulling every limb of her body but I felt nothing. It was an empty feeling, I thought after I killed the person who is also behind my sufferings I will be satisfied and happy. But instead, I felt nothing but emptiness, my hatred didn&#39;t even submerge.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was crying hardly after I was finished, I didn&#39;t notice that her hand was artificial, Klaire is stupid anyway, no wonder she was easily manipulated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;All this time I was clueless who killed my mother! IT WAS YOU ALL ALONG!&amp;quot; She shouted angrily then turns to look in Kariz&#39;s direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she believe every word he said?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;AND YOU! YOU LIED TO ME! I EVEN HELP YOU TO AWAKEN HER! AND ALL THIS TIME IT WAS HER WHO KILLED MY MOTHER IT WASN&#39;T EVEN THE FACTIONS DOING!&amp;quot; She rushed towards Kariz but she was no match to him he easily pinned her down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Oh, I wouldn&#39;t do that if I were you. I was really glad for your help but if you will start acting like this then... You gave me no choice.&amp;quot; He broke her right arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She started screaming as blood came rushing her arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You were heartless,&amp;quot; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled at me then shrugged his shoulders. We both stood there staring at her. She looked hopeless. We turned our back at her and started heading out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Oh, I forgot to tell you something.&amp;quot; Kariz stops for a minute then stared at me in the eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;They have arrived.&amp;quot;</p>
