                <p>I was looking for Galaz right now, because he wasn&#39;t been around me for a while. And I don&#39;t know but he was acting weird after our talk in the fountain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ali was the one always with me lately. And Yustef was also acting weird after I saw him with Ria. My trainings was still on the progress and I did a sparring with Ali like what we have agreed before. And I could say that he was really not an easy opponent. He was precise with his movement. His playful personality was still there but you can still sense how serious he was. We ended up calling it a draw because no one wants to give up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How come you aren&#39;t with Ria?&#34; I ask, those two are always together. So it&#39;s kinda weird not seeing them together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was busy trying to figure out the wolfsbane they used before during the attack in the Central Kingdom.&#34; Now that he mentioned it, Kariz did tell me about a new drug that they created which neutralize us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about you and Galaz? Did you two fight? Because he keep on pestering me to keep an eye on you.&#34; I thought Kariz perhaps given him a task or something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not that I remember. So he was just really trying to avoid me?&#34; I somehow feel pissed. He was the one trying to always pester me and now he just tossed me aside?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oops, looks like you two need to talk.&#34; He said, I didn&#39;t say anything to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And grabbed a glass of water, we were just done training before I thought of Galaz. I wanted to ask him something about his last mission which is to go to the North to at least see what they are up to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And looks like Galaz just finally find another way to get himself killed.&#34; He uttered then I glance at the direction where Galaz is. He was completely covered with blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit what happened?&#34; When Ali finally realized that Galaz was full of bruises he came running towards him. I followed him from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Galaz soon collapse on the ground. He was covered with claw marks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34; Ali and I said in unison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We were attacked.&#34; He uttered, while his left eyes is closed. He was bleeding heavily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s get him inside first. Ali take him and I will get Ria.&#34; He nodded his head and I run inside towards Ria&#39;s laboratory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One thing I know about Ria is that she wasn&#39;t just into creating poison or toxins but she was actually a Doctor. She did work before as a Doctor in the human territory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got there, I notice that he wasn&#39;t alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you here?&#34; It was Ria&#39;s voice and he was talking to someone. I stayed in the door, hesitant to get inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know why I am here Ria.&#34; My eyes went wide upon realization of who it was. It was Yustef.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have nothing else to talk about Yustef, last night was a mistake.&#34; She mumbled. I really don&#39;t want to bump into their conversation but right now Galaz needs help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could try to heal him but after seeing his bruises I know he needed someone who is more knowledgeable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to intrude but Ria, Galaz needs your help.&#34; They both look surprised to see me but Ria recover first and started grabbing her things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lead the way.&#34; She didn&#39;t even glance at Yustef who is staring at her with that unknown look on his face. It was the same look Dwayne had when I turn my back on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34; I uttered before leaving Yustef there. And for the second time I knew exactly why he was acting like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at Ria who was avoiding my gaze. Just like Yustef she had a painful look on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t say anything and led her to where Galaz was. He was in his room, Ali was standing beside him when we arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit Galaz who did this to you?!&#34; Ria started pulling something out of her bag and started treating Galaz.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ali and I just stood there as Ria does her thing. When she was finally finished she put Galaz to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That should do the thing for now. His bruises doesn&#39;t look like from a normal werewolf. It was deep and it wasn&#39;t healing at all.&#34; She mumbled as we stared at the sleeping Galaz.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean by that?&#34; Ali ask, Ria look at us with a serious look on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did this to him was far more than a normal werewolf. The way its claw mark is longer than a werewolf. And look at this.&#34; She pointed at the large cut he had from his abdomen right across his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was like that thing who attack Galaz left this mark on purpose. And werewolves leaves a mark using all their claws but this one it was only one.&#34; I don&#39;t know what she was talking about but it still look like claws to us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t get it.&#34; Ali blurted out which made him received a death glare from Ria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nevermind that. I have to talk to Kariz about this.&#34; She mumbled, then taking her things back to her bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will come with you. I still have something to talk about with Kariz.&#34; Ali uttered, they both left and I stood there with the sleeping Galaz.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He almost died if he wasn&#39;t treated in a hurry. I was about pull the chair on the side and used it but something caught my eyes. It was a sketch book. I don&#39;t want to actually touch someone else things but I was a bit intrigued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly lifted it up, it was right under a pile of books. It was the books that I recommended to him. I didn&#39;t actually thought that he would really read them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I flip the book open, showing a drawing of a little girl. She was smiling warmly in his drawing, black hair and a pair of black eyes. She looks exactly like how Galaz described her. In his drawings she really do look alive. I flip another page and this time it was an older couple, probably in their 50&#39;s? The woman had a black hair, and the other one is blonde, he somehow looks familiar. As I stared at it longer it looks like Ben? Or was I mistaken? I scanned it once more but the similarities are really something that I couldn&#39;t just ignore. Did Ben had a brother perhaps? I reminded myself to ask Galaz about it later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I flip the other page of the book, it was a lake and there was a woman standing at it. It has the same silver-white hair as I. The moon was shining in his drawing like the picture was actually alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t picture the woman&#39;s face that much because he didn&#39;t finished drawing her face. Then I flip another page of the book this time I was surprised to see who it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was me, smiling so warmly. Blue-gray eyes was gleaming. My hair was black like before and the wind was blowing it. And I was actually putting some hair strands on the back of my hair. The scene looks familiar yet unfamiliar at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I really look like I was alive and happy, I smiled bitterly at myself. Happiness? Am I even worthy of having that after everything I&#39;ve done?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I flip the other page and this time it was still me, but this time I was sleeping so peaceful. The scenery looks familiar. I touch the drawing, it was the room I had in the East Mansion. I glance at Galaz and he was nowhere in his bed. Then when I turned around there he was staring at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So it was you?&#34; I remember that someone was actually watching us during our stay in the East.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slowly nodded his head, feeling embarrassed that I caught him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You shouldn&#39;t have seen those. Now I&#39;m even more embarrassed to face you.&#34; He uttered while scratching the back of his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You shouldn&#39;t be standing right now.&#34; I uttered, narrowing my eyebrow at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I panicked when I saw you looking at my drawings.&#34; He answered. Put the sketch book down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Happy?&#34; I ask sarcastically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now get back to your bed.&#34; I uttered then push him towards his bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay... okay!&#34; He said then slip into his bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should rest for now. I&#39;ll ask you about what happened when you feel much better.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know if I was relieved that I wasn&#39;t dead yet or wish that I should die before answering any of your questions.&#34; He said while smiling. I pulled the cover to him. It was still cold and when I touch him earlier he was burning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just sleep. I will stay here until you fall asleep.&#34;</p>
