                <p>Dwayne&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In the human territory.&#34; This is the first time that I heard about this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did that happened?&#34; She continue to water her plants and remove some weeds growing around them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was raised there until I shifted and was taken here. The elders took me in.&#34; She mumbled, I want to continue asking her but she turns her back on me and continue what she was doing earlier. The Elders took her in, I met them once. They are just bunch of old werewolves, the memory of the second war. They are part of it that is what I&#39;m sure of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know that my mother is still quite young compare to my father but she was really matured. And for us werewolves once you found your mate age won&#39;t matter. And we age slower than humans does.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know son, I&#39;m from a human descent.&#34; I was taken aback by her sudden revelation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My descendants are originally humans. But then they married a werewolf that passes through generation until werewolves became the only off spring.&#34; She explained. I wasn&#39;t sure what to say after hearing this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the way son, the Elders will arrive tomorrow.&#34; I look at her with disbelief. I am still the Alpha yet I was the one who knew nothing about the things that is happening lately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should have told me first.&#34; I answered with annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Son, even us didn&#39;t know until now.&#34; She explained, I turn around and head back to my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have to gain my authority back, my pack trust my father more than me. And I cannot blame them for it but still their respect for their new Alpha is questionable. At this rate I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they end up betraying me. I need to gather my pack back especially after the Elders are now getting involved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Elders are the founder of the Factions, they created it to stablish their power especially after the second war happened. This Elders are highly respected among the Factions. They are the first line of Alpha&#39;s after the King died. The Royalties are mostly respected the same as the Elders. I met them once during my past life but that memory is kind of blurry to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know the Elders would be here any minute tomorrow and if I want to know something I need to gain my authority back. And the only way to do that is to turn my back on the Royalties and start joining the Factions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day I went straight to Sarah&#39;s room, she was getting ready. There are still bruises on her arms but she covered them with bandage. When she notice my presence her face turns red, not because she was happy to see me but because she was mad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want now?&#34; She ask, her tone of voice is cold. Just like how it was whenever I did something that she doesn&#39;t like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came here to apologize.&#34; I mumbled, she look surprised at my words but she still didn&#39;t budge. This is harder than I expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look Sarah I&#39;m sorry for what I&#39;ve said yesterday. I didn&#39;t mean all those words. I was just confused about everything lately.&#34; I muttered, I lower my gaze feeling embarrassed about everything that I&#39;m saying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes soften at my words then I slowly walk towards her. She welcome me with a tight hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew you will come back. My Dwayne is back.&#34; She uttered, I stroke her hair and let her rest in my arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, I&#39;m sorry it took me this long to realize everything.&#34; I whispered. My wolf rolled his eyes at my words. He feel disgusted that I was holding another woman instead of our mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Elders would be happy to know that you finally made up your mind to fullfil your duty as the Alpha.&#34; She said, I let her go feeling a slight irritation but I dismissed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to go now. They will be here any minute.&#34; I mumbled, I just want her out of my grip before I couldn&#39;t stop myself from doing something that I might regret later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I carried her down the stairs and when we reach the ground floor, my father and mother look pleased at us. They always want me to marked Sarah and my mother keeps on bugging me about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I put her down my mother greeted her with a hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my you two look adorable together.&#34; They both giggled. My dad tap my shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you would turn your back on your pack.&#34; He mumbled. We were both staring at the two woman in front of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t do that. You know how important this pack is to me.&#34; I answered back. He nodded his head then pulled my mom&#39;s waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honey, we need to go and Sarah is still fragile. We don&#39;t want her to end up getting sick again before the marking.&#34; Marking, shit! Why did I forget about that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance at Sarah who is staring at me with excitement. She was really expecting this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yeah, I&#39;m sorry about that Sarah. Anyway Dwayne I will leave her in your care.&#34; She then wink at me before they both made their way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah came to me still giggling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your mom is really adorable, I didn&#39;t met mine but because of her I feel like I have one.&#34; She mutters, I place my arms around her waste and pulled her closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, but you are also adorable.&#34; I whispered in her ears making her blush. I feel horrible for doing to this but I have no choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t help but imagine that Klaire was the one that I am holding right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dwayne your words of flattery.&#34; She said while giggling. Then she pulled my face into a kiss. I almost push her away but I stop myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This should be done Dwayne. I whispered to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we head out the pack members are already gathered around. Their eyes turn to us when they saw us walking. They all bow their heads as I pass them but I know that their loyalty is still not mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stop next to my Father, Cameron and Harid is also standing next to their father. Only Rion&#39;s adopted father is here. The representatives of each Factions are all gathered here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some of the crowd are from the South, East and West packs. Looks like some of them arrived while we were gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head snap at the presence coming our way. It was an strange presence. This is the third time that I will meet them. The first was during the second war and second time was when I was still the young Dwayne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Four old werewolves are matching our way. Some of their followers are walking behind them. Everyone was surprised by their presence and they cannot keep their eyes up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them had a long hair that rest right on his waist with his long black coat. One had some visible white hair showing his hair was tied into a ponytail. and the other one is bald with tattoos all over his body. And the last one is the only Elder that is related to me. His blond hair was somehow turning white among the other 3 he was the one who look approachable but in the real deal he was quite the opposite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled as soon as our eyes meet. My father greeted him with a hug and the others with a handshake. The other former Alpha&#39;s did the same. When it was my time to greet them he pulled me into a hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You grow up to fast my great great grandson.&#34; He whispered, I joined him with his laugh but I know he want to say something different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I haven&#39;t seen you in awhile Hunter.&#34; I answered back. He let me go, for an old man I could say he was really strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well at least now we are all together.&#34; He uttered while looking pleased. Then he turned his attention to the other Alpha&#39;s. I gave my greeting to the other Elders and made my way towards the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The welcoming ceremony started, some of the pack perform the dancing rituals while some are doing a friendly match and the other are busy drinking and gossiping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bottle of beer was offered to me by Cameron, I took it and take a sip. We just stood there on the corner watching the crowd dance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you wouldn&#39;t agree on leaving your mate.&#34; I was stunned by his words but I recover immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I still have a duty for my pack.&#34; I answered, taking a long sip on my beer. I think I will need another one to continue talking like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know how it felt.&#34; I stop at his words then glance at him. His eyes remains in the dancing fire of the huge bonfire. A flicker of sadness in them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I also have to leave her for my pack. She was too weak to be the Luna and I have to fullfil my duty as the next Alpha.&#34; He continue, I didn&#39;t say anything and just remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Elders wouldn&#39;t accept her even if I tried but I wouldn&#39;t know anyway she was already gone..&#34; His last words was a whisper but it was loud enough for me to hear it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anyway we will mark another shewolf in no time and that bond will soon be weaken.&#34; He said trying to conceal what he just said earlier. I didn&#39;t like the idea of marking another woman other than my mate. But I know in my gut the Elders will force us into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if it didn&#39;t?&#34; I suddenly blurted it out. He turn to glance at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A bond will get weaken because a new bond will be created, it just that it wouldn&#39;t be as strong as your original mate.&#34; He said. I know that but still the missing piece inside won&#39;t be fill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t answer and we remained silent the whole time until Sarah came running towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cameron nudge my shoulders pointing at Sarah&#39;s direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your mate is here.&#34; He mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was not my mate.&#34; I uttered then left to meet Sarah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was looking for you. If I know you are here I would have come sooner.&#34; She wrapped her arms around mine and pulled to the dance floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Common let&#39;s dance.&#34; Before I could even answer we are already in the center.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd started staring at us and some stop dancing just to watch us. The music soon started and I had no choice but to agree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We dance under the moonlight, a slow dance. As I glance at her I cannot stop myself to see Klaire. I always dream about dancing with her under the moonlight. The memory of her first night here cross my mind. How her lips feels under mine. Her soft skin tangled around me. The way she stared at me with those gray blue eyes. I couldn&#39;t stop myself but to be mesmerized by them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly lean closer to her and she close her eyes. I lifted her chin focusing my eyes on her kissable lips, closing the gap between us until our lips meets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cheering of the crowd made me open my eyes. And I almost curse at myself when I saw Sarah who is still closing her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled as soon as I step backwards. Her cheeks reddened when she notice the crowd staring at us. My eyes stops at Hunter who is staring at us while nodding his head. He was standing next to my parents who look more pleased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m gonna get us something to drink.&#34; I mumbled not waiting for her answer. I made my way out of the crowd and head to the forest towards the East Mansion hoping that she would be there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I step closer towards tbe Mansion a familiar scent of Vanilla cross my nostrils.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when I reach the place, she was not here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scent was coming from her things that is left here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Silly me.&#34; I whispered to myself with disappointment.</p>
