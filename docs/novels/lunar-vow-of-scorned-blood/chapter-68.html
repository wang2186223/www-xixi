                <p>Amara&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I came down where Kariz was and found him with some bunch of black large panthers. But unlike the normal one this panthers eyes are red like rubies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are they?&#34; They growl at me first but Kariz hush them. He was stroking one of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I found them once in the dark forest when I came looking for you. If I left them that time they will be dead by now. &#34; He answered not even looking at my direction. Kariz was always fond of animals, just like before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you also experiment with them?&#34; This time he stop stroking them and turn around to finally face me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have no other choice of saving them.&#34; He mumbled, I didn&#39;t say anything and walk around his so called room. His room was completely destroyed, his roof was already nowhere to be found. Only a bed and a chair was present in his room. And by the look of it only the light coming from the moon gives light to this place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now that I remember, you told me before that the time where you died was the time you awaken your power that resulted by my blood.&#34; I forgot to ask this to him last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At first I thought that was the case. But then everything explains why your blood is not giving any reaction from me. Because we have the same blood running in our veins. And back when we are still in the facility, they also used the same black liquid to me. But they didn&#39;t saw any responses unlike to you.&#34; He said, I look up at the moon which is now giving us light into this dark place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why did you attack the Faction? You could have just told us about all of this.&#34; He look away, I pat his shoulders. He seems tense about something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I couldn&#39;t because that time, I was still in his control.&#34; His control? He turn around and gaze in my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Belerick found me that time where I almost died. And I have no idea how but he can control me like he was brainwashing me and I had no other choice but to believe him.&#34; Belerick, just hearing his name made my body tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But he was dead! We left him inside that burning facility!&#34; I couldn&#39;t believe what I was hearing from him. I remember that time he was already unconscious and injured enough. And I was sure myself that he wasn&#39;t breathing anymore when we left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is what we thought, but he just suddenly appear in front of me. He told me to kill the warriors of the Faction and I did it even without his control because I was too enraged to even think. Then after that he told me everything, like how the faction know everything and were helping him before. I didn&#39;t want to believe him at first but when I saw the files that Via had in his house. I couldn&#39;t help myself but be mad. I became his loyal dog and did everything he wants, before I found out that he was the one who killed our parents. It was after I was taken into that place to witness everything.&#34; I know what he was talking about. He looks so sad yet angry at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;After that I became so mad that I wanted to destroy them all.&#34; He added, clenching his fist. I can feel his power radiating around his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you will help me.&#34; He muttered, his eyes were now red as rubies. The red eyes I saw in my dreams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up the next day to start training, Kariz told me that my physical strength right now will not be able to handle my power. That is also the reason why I alway fell unconscious after I used my power. So the next day he started training me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I arrived, he was nowhere to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this the reason why you left him?&#34; I turn to see Zion, he still covered with bandage but his bruises was already about to heal in a matter of 2 days. He was quite a werewolf, knowing that his wounds aren&#39;t just some simple ones. Because by the look of it the faction was using wolfsbane. It was something that they probably develop because by the look of it the one who used this should have been dead by now. Especially if they are like him, a werewolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If it was just a simple matter like what you thought we wouldn&#39;t be like this. And beside did you forget that he was the first one who left me.&#34; I uttered then walk pass him. I don&#39;t wanna waste my time here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Klaire you know that he regrets it.&#34; I haven&#39;t heard that name in a while. The last time someone called me with that name was during my time in the Island.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Klaire isn&#39;t my name.&#34; He stood there dumbfounded by my words. Now I know why he was reacting like this. &#34;Looks like your Alpha didn&#39;t tell you anything.&#34; I mumbled, he frowned at my words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you talking about?&#34; I didn&#39;t say anything and continue walking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should ask him yourself.&#34; I mutter before I completely left him. Before I reach the old castle I came across a girl. She had a strawberry blonde hair and a pair of blue eyes. Our eyes met when we passed each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t be mistaken, she wasn&#39;t a normal werewolf. I grab her arm making her stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34; She mumbled, I was right about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are from that facility.&#34; Her eyes didn&#39;t seem surprised at my words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me go!&#34; I almost smile, she was feisty. What a strong personality. And with that two man came to her rescue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zion who is now holding my risk and the other blonde one was holding my other arm. Making sure I was not able to do anything to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing!&#34; Zion sounded mad, he was glaring at me and I can feel his wolf was about to crawl out of his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let her go!&#34; The blonde one uttered, interesting... Two werewolf who came from the same facilities. He had the same color of eyes like her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Twins.&#34; I blurted out, they all just glared at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, I wouldn&#39;t do anything to her.&#34; I let go of her hand. But Zion was still holding mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I&#39;m fine. Stop now!&#34; Her eyes were directed to her brother but her words was for Zion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he finally came to his senses. He even look more annoyed and ended up walking out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mates?&#34; She look surprised, but then nodded her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;WHAT?!&#34; I almost laugh at his reaction, remember how Clint reacted when I told him I found mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t you say it earlier? He was your mate yet he was treating you like you never exist?&#34; I turn around and started walking away from them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They look energetic.&#34; Kariz mumbled, I glared at him. He always just keep popping out of nowhere. Our bond is still not like what a normal siblings had but it was better than before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you bring them here? Did you also save them like what you did to the others?&#34; We are both watching the twins who are still arguing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I had no plans on getting them into this. But one day I came across Devon, she was holding the dead body of her sister. That time I notice that she wasn&#39;t just a normal werewolf. I already knew she was from the Facility.&#34; So, she lost her sister. I glance at the laughing twins. They look so young.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She beg me to help her, in turns out they are a low rank werewolf and because of that they cannot have justice for her sister who was killed by her own mate.&#34; I look up at him, he had the same stern look on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I used it as an opportunity to get inside the Faction. And there I was able to used Rion who is blinded by power.&#34; I told him to stop, I know the rest of the story. He used Rion to cause chaos in the faction which leads him to an opportunity to get a hold of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t you just took me by yourself, you&#39;ve done it before and I know you could still do it now.&#34; He glance at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is the problem, you may not be aware but you are using your power subconsciously. I tried it one time but then I wasn&#39;t able to even get close to you. Your abilities are growing everyday. And mine where rejecting your so if I stayed closer to you it may kill one of us.&#34; He uttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why are you able to stand next to me now?&#34; If what he was saying was true then he should be dead by now or me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was the time where I used all my knowledge from the data we gathered from you which made my abilities to at least lessen the rejection of your abilities.&#34; So, that explains why he never dared to tell me about his identity. And why he usually don&#39;t come around me and just send Galaz to me all the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But why are we rejecting each other?&#34; I can&#39;t stop myself from asking all this question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will know soon.&#34; And before I could even utter another word. He left already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why couldn&#39;t he just say it now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should show yourself now. I know you are there.&#34; I warned, he came out with his hands in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t mean to eavesdrop and even if I want to, I wasn&#39;t able to hear anything.&#34; He mumbled, it was Kariz doings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34; I know he was one of the werewolf who is with Zion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Claus, I was just about to go look around then I bumped into both of you.&#34; He explain, I can feel any lies in his words. So I will let him go this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see. But you shouldn&#39;t just roam around like you are in a tourist spot.&#34; I muttered then started walking back to my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the look of it, Kariz don&#39;t have any plan to help me with my training today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I entered my room, a shadow crow was waiting for me in my bed. I know it was Galaz.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; I touch it and it finally delivered the message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will arrive there by tomorrow.&#34; I don&#39;t know what to feel about his words but I&#39;m sure this is all Klaire&#39;s emotions again. &#34;But I have some news.&#34; His voice sounded hesitant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just say it.&#34; I mumbled. Feeling a bit uneasy. I don&#39;t know why but I can feel my heart pounding. I thought I was able to stop this? But guess not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We failed.&#34;</p>
