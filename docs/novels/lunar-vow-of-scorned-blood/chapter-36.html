                <p>Klaire&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rion never came back after he left, I still have no idea where am I. I did try using my strength to break the chains but it was useless. I have no idea how long I&#39;ve been unconscious and being in this dark dungeon is not helping also.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard another clicking of keys, someone is coming. I ready myself just in case. The footsteps coming downstairs echoes in this quiet place. The light coming from the torch is starting to reflect meaning they are getting close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes because of the sudden light when they were in front of me. 3 unfamiliar faces were staring at me. One of them was a girl with short hair, she was wearing a mini skirt and tank top showing off her figure. Her hair was dyed with the color green. Two tall figures were standing right next to her. I can&#39;t see their faces because of the light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Is that her, Ali?&amp;quot; Her voice was high pitch; you can hear the enthusiasm in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yeah, that was really her. I saw her that night.&amp;quot; The one called Ali answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finally saw his face. He has a black hair and a well build body, his face had a scar right next to his left eyes. He was tall towering the two others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You said you fought with her friend right?&amp;quot; She tilted her body. Her eyes were watching my reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Oh yes, the guy with the black large wolf. He actually killed my clone, might as well return the favor to him next time.&amp;quot; His eyes are gleaming with malice of whatever thought he was thinking right at the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clench my fist, when I realized what he was talking about. It was the time where the first attack happened right at the East Mansion. And by the person with black wolf he was talking about none other than Dwayne. I glared at him and if I got out of this chains, he will be the first one who will taste death in my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Oh don&#39;t be mad, I didn&#39;t mean to disturb you two by that time.&amp;quot; He said, giving me the knowing look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it was another situation I might end up blushing because of embarrassment but seeing his face make me even much angrier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I will kill you when I get out of here.&amp;quot; I mumbled looking at him dead in the eyes. His hand landed on my cheeks giving me a hard slap. I can taste the blood from my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Oh sorry.&amp;quot; He mumbled but his tone sounded pissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I spit at his face; I smirk with satisfaction after seeing his pissed face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Hey, princess...&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hissed at her, she was grasping my cheeks to make me look at her. I can feel her nails digging down my flesh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You have a really pretty face! And I like pretty thing.&amp;quot; She smiled at me wickedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Don&#39;t touch me.&amp;quot; I warned, I tried pulling my face away from her but she tightened her grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt the blood run down my cheeks. She smirks at seeing me bleed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Oops.&amp;quot; She mumbled then started laughing like a lunatic. The other guy joined her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Enough of that Ria.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, the other one spoke, his voice was low and full of warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes shifted at the quiet one who just spoke. He was wearing a hoodie over his head, making it hard for me to see his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ria put both her hands in the air. &amp;quot;Okay! Okay! I&#39;ll stop.&amp;quot; She started backing away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wipe my cheeks using my chained hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Pussy...&amp;quot; That guy name Ali mutter then started laughing at Ria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ria smacks him using her hand making him stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;That hurts, you know!&amp;quot; Ali complained then started rubbing his arms that is now starting to turn red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Pussy...&amp;quot; Ria mocks back. And they started having their childish arguments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just who the hell is this people? Are they really my captors?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes shifted at the mysterious guy. His eyes were lock at me. I can feel his cold gaze putting bullets on my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Who are you?&amp;quot; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped closer to me. He pulled his hoodie down. My eyes scan his face, haft of it is covered with a bandage. His eyes and forehead is the only thing that wasn&#39;t covered with a bandage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were a lighter shade of green, with a light brown shade of hair, his hands reach for my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I move my head away. He stops mid-way then reach for it again. I didn&#39;t notice it earlier but his hands are also covered with a bandage. He wipes my cheeks using his thumb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m sorry about that.&amp;quot; He whispered, his voice was low and soft. He somehow sounded apologetic at the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He back away when he notices my discomfort. The other two beside him stop with their doing and watch us with both their eyes wide open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Don&#39;t tell me you like her more than me, Galaz?!&amp;quot; Ria asks while pouting her lips. She looks like a sulking child. The guy name Galaz ignored her and keep his eyes on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I apologize for the late introduction. They call me Galaz, her name is Ria and this is Ali. We are here to retrieve you back.&amp;quot; He said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I almost wanted to jump and attack him after hearing that but I stop myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t do anything anyway, not after I was chained with this. I let out a deep sigh. I need to think of a way to get out of this chains and right now saving my energy will be the best option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Where am I?&amp;quot; I ask not minding what he just said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I need to know how far am I from the pack, and knowing Rion was the one who took me. It only means we weren&#39;t that far from the pack because he also need to get back there fast if he wants to avoid being suspected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Right below the cliff.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes went wide upon hearing my location. So that was the reason why I hear some waves, but wasn&#39;t even sure if I heard it right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;No one would suspect that you were just right under their nose.&amp;quot; Ria answer while looking at her nails.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Don&#39;t bother trying to call for help, they wouldn&#39;t be able to hear you. This dungeon is unknown from them, not even the Alpha know the existence of this place.&amp;quot; Galaz added while looking straight in my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can feel the chills from the way he looks at me. Among the three of them, he was the one who I should be wary about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;He ordered this?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That question made all of them stop from what they are doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Do you know he would just kill you? He doesn&#39;t even care if you die out here as long as he gets what he wants!&amp;quot; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all stared at each other and started laughing even Galaz joined them. It was like what I just said is nothing but a sick joke for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Do you really think we care about that, princess?&amp;quot; Ria said with her mockery. She pulled my hair hard making me gasp in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Well news flash princess, we die a long time ago by those fucking factions! They took everything away from us and we won&#39;t stop until we killed them all.&amp;quot; Ria mumbled. Her words were full of anger. She yanked me to the side making me stumbled to the ground followed by the clashing of chains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Don&#39;t worry, we will achieve that using your help. So take your time and rest. Because the boat will arrive once the sun goes down, which is in any minute now.&amp;quot; She added, turning her back at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We aren&#39;t being use, princess. We are using each other.&amp;quot; Those are Galaz last words before turning his back on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He started walking away. The other two followed from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watch them be eaten by the dark as they go further away from me. And again I was left alone in the cold dungeon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I close my eyes trying to use my senses but it was still useless. I can&#39;t even use anything other than my human strength. I got up of my feet and started moving around the cell, again I tried to pull the chains with all my strength but it was useless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Galaz said I was under the Cliff, so the pathway that the rogues used to enter must be near this place. And if they will transport me, they will be using a boat. And Eliot probably notice that I&#39;m missing, making it harder for this rogues to transport me because the search is probably already ongoing at this very moment. So right now I need to find a way to alert the ones above.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But how? I glanced around again and found nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at my hand, it was stained with my blood...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait! Blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can use my blood to leave traces if ever they will start moving me. I only need to cut myself, once I&#39;m in outside, it will be easier for them to smell my blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It&#39;s time, princess.&amp;quot;</p>
