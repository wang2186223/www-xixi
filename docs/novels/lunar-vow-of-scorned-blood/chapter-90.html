                <p>Dwayne&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still couldn&#39;t stop thinking those blue-gray eyes, it feels so real. Like that person was actually there. I tried to avoid that thought by focusing at Sarah and our little dance right now. But I still couldn&#39;t stop thinking about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah notice my sudden behavior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright?&#34; She asked, putting her hand around my neck as I hold her waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sway her hips as the music goes. She looks like she was enjoying herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I&#39;m just probably a bit tired.&#34; I uttered, again I was starting to feel guilty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then glance at me with a hint of dismay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should rest first, while I go catch up with the others.&#34; She mumbled pointing at the group of friends she had? I did saw her talking to some she wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, be careful okay?&#34; She nodded her head and I gave her a kiss before walking back to the pack house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I stop when I saw the corner towards the woods. I don&#39;t know why but I couldn&#39;t shake it off my head. And to stop myself from thinking it over. I started walking towards that direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woods is dark as expected only the gleam from the moonlight gives it a bit of a light. And the little fireflies flying around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed the fainting scent of vanilla, I couldn&#39;t be wrong about this. I started running to where it was coming from then stop at a cape laying on the ground. I pick it up trying to look for the person who left it here. I smelled it and it had that familiar scent of vanilla. I couldn&#39;t be mistaken this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closing my eyes I tried to listen to my surroundings, trying to find something that might lead me to where that person is. Then a footstep is running, it heading to the dungeon, no it went to the other side. And that place only lead to one specific place I know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened my eyes and start running towards that the direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clint! I muttered, then made my pace faster. That person is heading to the facilities that we had. I hardly know that place so I wonder how they knew it. It was down the mountain side where it was hidden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I need to get there fast, I shifted down to my wolf. Because it would be much faster that way. When I got there, it was already too late the guards are all laying to the ground. I sniff the air trying to find any scent left then that vanilla scent was still here. It only means that person might still be here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly head inside, checking every corner where there might be some attacks or something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That person was here for Clint! I stop when a familiar figure was standing not so far from me. Like she was actually waiting for me. Her black hair was full of life right now. Her back was still facing mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And again I could fear my heart pounding in my chest as soon as I saw her. It was like something inside me came alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34; I uttered, she didn&#39;t say anything. I need to know shy she was always appearing in my head and in my dreams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you even real?&#34; I added, not wanting to have the same feeling like before. Where I thought she was actually here but the truth is she was just in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just tell me who are you! Why do you keep appearing in front of me!&#34; I bursted out, I couldn&#39;t stop myself. All this feelings are so messed up and I have no idea why do I feel like I actually missed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The feeling of longing suddenly immersed inside me like a dead crawling out of its grave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She the slowly turn around, as I felt like my whole world was being sucked up by her. Her blue-gray eyes stared at me blankly. Like no emotions was written in them. But the way the two color contrast was just so perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been a while Aiden.&#34; Her voice sounded so cold but it felt so warm at the same time. I know what I&#39;m saying doesn&#39;t make sense at all but I couldn&#39;t help it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, that name again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My name is not Aiden.&#34; I uttered, feeling confused upon hearing that name again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see, looks like they did it again.&#34; She uttered, feeling confused about what should I do right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to go.&#34; She mumbled but as soon as hearing that my body moves on its own and grabbed her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thousands of sparks erupted in my whole system, her eyes mirror mine, eyes wide surprised at the sudden contact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are real.&#34; I suddenly blurted out. She then stared at me like she also have no idea what to do. Finally I saw some emotions in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think your doing.&#34; She pulled her hand away but I didn&#39;t let her. I don&#39;t know if I was afraid that she might escape or was actually afraid that she might be gone and I would wake up again feeling confuse if she was real or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should be the one asking that. I saw you staring at us earlier.&#34; She turn her head on the other side. Trying to avoid my gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You probably know why I&#39;m here.&#34; She mumbled, and I know what she was talking about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was here for Clint and I don&#39;t know why I felt irritated by that thought. I wasn&#39;t like this with Sarah after seeing him talking with Alec.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you call me Aiden?&#34; I ask, she stared at me for a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was a mistake.&#34; She uttered, then I felt a hint of pain in my chest followed by an agonizing headache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She notice my sudden change as I let go of her hand to support myself. She then help me get back to my balance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34; The worry in her voice was evident. And I don&#39;t know why I feel happy just by hearing that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Am I really going crazy? Is this because of the wolfsbane again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m f-&#34; before I could finish my sentence the sound of footsteps heading this way made me pull her into the vacant room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was surprised at what I just did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shh...&#34; I motion her not to make a sound as I released my hand which is covering her mouth right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure there is an intruder.&#34; Someone mumbled, looks like someone did saw her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes sir, I wasn&#39;t sure if it was a woman or a man but that person was wearing a cape and I did saw it run this way.&#34; I glance at her, the room we are in is actually a storage room, it was filled with boxes making it quite tight for us to fit in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her body was actually brushing mine. And I can feel her breath in my chest, I was not wearing any shirt except for the shorts that I carried with me. Her breath was giving me goosebumps down to my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go check the prisoner while you go ahead and start looking to the other parts of the pack.&#34; That voice, I am sure it was Dale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look down at her and she was staring at the door. I could feel her heart beating fast just like mine. And I couldn&#39;t help but smile that I wasn&#39;t the only one nervous right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go!&#34; The footsteps then started to fade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you help me?&#34; She uttered as soon as we step outside. Even I myself was actually wondering why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I still need something from you.&#34; I mumbled, not even knowing what kind of excuse should I say to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I could knocked you out right now and escape.&#34; She uttered, while she stared at the far hallway where Clint was being held.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You could but I doubt that you would and beside I did help you.&#34; I uttered, she just glared at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need you to answer all my questions.&#34; I mumbled, then pulled her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You shouldn&#39;t do that, I need to get Clint first.&#34; She mumbled, I almost forgot that she was here for Clint which only means she was an enemy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You could try to stop me but I swear you will regret it.&#34; She mumbled before started walking to where Clint is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are probably aware that the guards are now there waiting for you.&#34; She didn&#39;t seems to mind what I just said so I pulled her hand again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you want to save you better listen to me first! By this time I am sure that the guards aren&#39;t the only one waiting for you right now. &#34; I mumbled, she then stop for a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There could be someone waiting for you there and if you are gonna badge there you might end up getting your friend hurt.&#34; She looks like she was thinking at first but then let out a deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what are you suggesting? And besides aren&#39;t you here to catch me?&#34; I was taken aback by her words. I did forgot about that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t even say anything, and she smirk before pulling away from my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Heres the deal Mr. Alpha.&#34; How did she know that I was an Alpha? But then the memory of her being in the celebration. She probably heard from them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will help me get Clint out of here and it exchange. I will stay, you could go and locked me up or tell your whole pack that you caught me.&#34; She said staring dead serious in my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The last time I left you, you just vanish without a trace how could I know that you are serious about your words.&#34; It only means that when I saw her in the East Mansion was actually real and it wasn&#39;t just my imagination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t plan on going anywhere anymore. I wouldn&#39;t run away anymore.&#34; She uttered, and with that I nodded my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, but we can&#39;t do this today.&#34; I muttered, she stared at me confused. But I did explain to her that Clint was probably being held into another facility. I still wasn&#39;t sure about everything that change while I was sleeping. But what I know is that this woman was actually connected to the things that I did forgot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine! When then?&#34; I smiled at her irritated and impatient look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;3 days from today. I need to also gather some information about all of you and you will he the only one who could answer all of them.&#34; I then pulled a bracelet and lock it to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was something that would help getting her outside the territory and if she did plan to, I could easily find her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are now my prisoner.&#34; I then carried her into a bridal way which made her almost squeal, but she covered her mouth in time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We couldn&#39;t let anyone hear us, and now that I notice she wasn&#39;t a werewolf at all. She was a human but something doesn&#39;t feel right about her. She was emanating some strange energy around her and by that look I know that she wasn&#39;t a normal human.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I start dragging her to the East Mansion. The only safe place that I know she could use as a hiding place. And just like expected she was familiar with this place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve been here before right?&#34; Her eyes widens at my words, I know she will deny it again so I didn&#39;t give her a chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did saw you that time, you are sleeping and I wasn&#39;t just imagining it. And you aren&#39;t just in my head.&#34; I added, she then stared at me straight in the eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is better for you to forget everything that is connected to me.&#34; She mumbled then head upstairs, towards the room where I saw her before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I watch her the sudden pain in my head was starting to come back and this time it was even worst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My vision was starting to blur, I held the railings but I couldn&#39;t keep myself and before I know it I was falling to the ground but before I hit the coldness of the ground. A pair of warm arms held me. Catching me right before I hit my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And before I know it the darkness completely consume me.</p>
