                <p>Amara&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the moon, it was full moon today. I don&#39;t know why everyone is acting weird around me lately. Everyone is rotating on their surveillance around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I guess Galaz was not able to keep his mouth shut after what happened last time. I was not even able to see Kariz because he was busy looking for this book. That I have no idea what for. He just told me that it was for the time of the ritual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Weird right? I thought we will be using his scientific machine like what they did in the facility before but he said that won&#39;t do anything because this time everything is not like how it was before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The werebouts of the Lycans was still unknown to us, but Kariz has his own suspicion after he found one of the bodies of the Lycan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you planning to do now?&#34; I glance up at Noah, who is now the one keeping an eye on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kariz did say that it was necessary because during this time I was completely unstable and to make sure that I wouldn&#39;t do anything that I might regret after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who knows.&#34; I uttered, he didn&#39;t say anything abd remained silent. We both just stared at the full moon in the dark sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you heard anything about the plan?&#34; I ask, because they wouldn&#39;t let me go with them which is making me mad. They keep on saying that it would be better if I stay here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eliot and Ali will handle the East territory, they tend to keep an eye on them for the meantime. Because as you already know the Alpha&#39;s are back to their territories so it would be more difficult to keep track on them unless Eliot and Ali go there by themselves.&#34; He explains, just like me Noah seems tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do they really want to do there? We already succeeded on destroying some of their warehouse and other facilities.&#34; Noah stared at me then let out a sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The problem is bigger than what we expected, they are breeding new types of werewolves. So we are stopping and keeping track on them before they finish anything.&#34; He answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are they using humans again?&#34; He shake his head. Making me raise an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They discover that using werewolves would result to a much higher progress.&#34; I gasp upon hearing it. So it means they are using their own pack members.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could they do that? That might results to death.&#34; I muttered, still not believing that the Faction I once knew was actually doing this kind of things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They don&#39;t care at all, about how they did it was still unknown to us. But one thing is sure that they used the Lycans blood to create new breeds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hearing all that, I understand why Kariz wanted to awaken my Lycan. Because right now we need this power to fight against the Faction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to talk to you.&#34; We turned around to find Zion, he looks like he run out of nowhere. Wait isn&#39;t he with Clint?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened? Where is Clint?&#34; Noah and I both said in unison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have the book.&#34; He mumbled, but why do I feel like relentless, and what he was going to say next made me stiffen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Clint was caught.&#34; My eyes went wide at his words, Clint? How?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And there is more Dwayne, it happened so fast. I was the one who should get caught but Clint surrender himself. And told me to get the book here.&#34; He muttered the last sentence like he was not sure about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; I ask, unsure if I was ready to hear what he will going to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just like I said, Dwayne was like a complete different person. We were watching the Pack and finally got inside without anyone noticing then it looks like the whole pack was actually busy about the challenge, and just by looking at it, it was obvious that it was for the Alpha title. Looks like after Dwayne was caught that night he was actually strip off his title. But while they were busy we sneak inside the pack house, Clint search the office while I went upstairs. I don&#39;t know how Dwayne got there that fast but before I could do anything he was already chocking me. Like he doesn&#39;t know who I am. Then Clint arrived and push Dwayne aside. He told me to get out quickly and return here to give you this.&#34; He explains while holding his throat which had some markings in it. He was embracing an old book in his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You finally have it?&#34; Kariz appeared out of nowhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, here it is.&#34; Zion said, he was about to give it to Kariz but I took it first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to get Clint first.&#34; I uttered, staring at Kariz who is staring at me with a blank look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amara, Clint wanted us to have the book that is why he made sure that Zion would get it here.&#34; He mumbled, I ignored his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! We have to rescue him first!&#34; I said, I glance at Noah trying to look for another person who would agree to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Klaire, what Kariz said was right. Right now we need to finish what we should do then after we will make sure to get Clint back in one piece.&#34; Noah said, which was unexpected knowing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could you all say that? He sacrifice himself for that book and now you want me to just stay quiet? And Kariz you know that we need him for your plan to happened!&#34; I mumbled, Kariz didn&#39;t say anything. And with a quick move he was able to take the book from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Clint probably saw something in this book, that&#39;s why he let himself stay.&#34; He said. Then started flipping the book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So it was all true, everything he said before was all true. Ha! I couldn&#39;t believe it even if I am seeing this with my own two eyes.&#34; He uttered, talking to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you talking about?&#34; Noah said, while he was staring at him with a confuse look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This book if full of legends, the mystical creatures that are made before we are even made. Just like Lycans. But what we only need right now is to find the location of where the Lycans were sealed. This book was not just an ordinary one. It was a map but it also say something about how to keep the Lycan sealed.&#34; He said. I stared at him still confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you want to awaken my Lycan? Then why are you looking for ways to keep the Lycans sealed?&#34; Kariz remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amara, you are already a Lycan.&#34; He muttered, I started laughing at his words. But Noah remained silent like he wasn&#39;t surprised unlike Zion who have his eyes wide open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait? You are joking right? Me a Lycan? That was impossible, I thought you are trying to awaken my Lycan and now you are saying that I am a Lycan?&#34; Kariz remained silent, are they trying to messed with me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was true Amara. Remember the time I showed you the Lycan and told you that I&#39;ve seen one before? It was true I did see one before because it was me.&#34; And with that Kariz shifted into the furry, werewolf like creature. Black fur with ruby eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was keeping you away, because you are the only key to unsealed them. You are the pureblood Lycan, because you have the power that you inherited to our mother and our father&#39;s Lycan blood.&#34; I stared at him still not sure if I should believe him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t understand. I was just a human all this time and so are you!&#34; Back in the facility we were just some normal human, they are the one who made us into this using the blood of the Lycan. Belerick did that to us! Then what was he talking about that we are actually a Lycan?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know I was staring at him and he was full shift Lycan. But I don&#39;t understand how?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amara, our father was the first one who was successfully shifted into a Lycan.&#34; I stared at him at him with a confused look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not true, I saw him shift in my memories and he didn&#39;t shift like you!&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure about that? Why don&#39;t you revisit your memories again and see everything with your own eyes. You did shift before Amara.&#34; He mumbled, I was surprised to see him speaking normally in that form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah and Zion, remained silent in the back. Looks like Noah knew about this already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did-&#34; I froze when the memories started flooding in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How I was able to kill those werewolves during that time. The reason why I always end up seeing myself covered with blood and mad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the memory from last time came flooding in my mind. How I ended up getting all those mad and went back naked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up and found myself completely thirsty, like I was looking for something. I jumped of my window, I was surprised that I was able to jump that high and not make a sound. And for the first time as I ran fast, I felt like I was actually free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went to the familiar road, to where he was. I stopped to the last place that I spend with him. It was still broad daylight but I don&#39;t know where did I get this courage that I was able to come here without anyone seeing me. Oh yes, now that I remember someone did see me but I was able to subdue their wolf and let them fall asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stayed there for a while, when I suddenly felt that tingling thirst again. Then something caught my eyes, it was a huge deer running in the woods. Before I could even think, the dear was already dead. I glance at my hands then notice the blood dripping from them. I killed it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I notice how my senses are actually enhance, more than the time I let my rage took over. I was near the East Mansion, and before I could even notice I was already inside the Mansion. Taking the familiar step to my old room. Where I last saw him, the look on his eyes that time flash in my mind...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tortured look, how those green-blue eyes lost their brightness when I uttered those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance at myself in the mirror, I can&#39;t even recognize myself. I can see myself but I wasn&#39;t myself. I look like the same monster I saw in my dreams. But unlike in my dreams I wasn&#39;t afraid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closing my eyes, I suddenly felt myself getting dizzy all of a sudden. And before I could even stand in my feet, darkness fully consumed me...</p>
