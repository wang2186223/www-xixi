                <p>Dwayne&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath trying to calm myself but it is not working at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cursed myself before walking inside where she was sitting next to that bastard who was now holding her hand. A growl escaped from me and their head snap in my direction except her she keeps her eyes on the wall like it was the most interesting thing in the world. I even find myself wanting to crush that stupid wall!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Sit down Dwayne.&amp;quot; I let out a sigh and sat on the seat across from her. I keep my eyes locked on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Okay now we first wanted to discuss my son&#39;s situation with--&amp;quot; My father was cut off by that bastard who is now standing and giving me a death glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;There is nothing to discuss that matter.&amp;quot; A loud growl erupted from my father but he didn&#39;t care, he just stood there and gave my father the same intensity of power. It was disrespectful to cut off any Alpha while he was talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You wouldn&#39;t want to fight with me Alpha.&amp;quot; This time my father stood still and glared at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fact that they belong to the Central Kingdom makes him even harder to deal with. Because they don&#39;t follow the rules of the four factions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I can try.&amp;quot; My father said calmly but I know him better than he already wanted to snap his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Stop that!&amp;quot; They are both interrupted by my mother, I can smell the intensity in the air as well as my mother&#39;s fear, and lastly, I can smell my mate that calms my wolf from ravaging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Stop it, Clint.&amp;quot; Finally, she said something. But it irritates me more that instead of me she was talking to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Okay.&amp;quot; He agreed and took his seat back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My father also came back to his senses once he heard my mother who is now standing beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mate bond is really strong... As I thought of that I look at her and she was just staring at my father and mother who are now holding their hands together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Now can we continue what we are here for?&amp;quot; My mate suddenly said, she sounded impatient but I know better that she wanted to get out of here which hurt me and my wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bastard and my Father took their seat and started their discussions about what should they do about it and I heard that the other royalties will come too. I even found out that she was adopted, which explains why she was with him. They didn&#39;t give in further information about her and my father did not seem to mind. But I do mind everything about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We need to put more warriors to guard the borderline. These bastards keep coming!&amp;quot; My father mutters, marking the east part of the northern border.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;The south has already been in contact. Some of their warriors have been injured. Items have been found missing in their warehouses.&amp;quot; The bastard said. Staring blankly, his expression does not give much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;How did that happen? That is impossible! There must be a traitor!&amp;quot; I could not agree less with what my father said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The South is known for its craftsman and weapons. Weapons that can be used to kill our kind. And their warehouses are not an easy one to invaded by some useless rogues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;That is why we are here to find out.&amp;quot; He mutters while staring at the map.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;The other Alpha&#39;s will also be arriving soon, so we could start discussing the matter.&amp;quot; My father announced. I have never seen my father this serious in my entire life. His personality is too far from being savage but once he was in battle, you won&#39;t even recognize him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Good, the others will be here by then.&amp;quot; He mutters. He keeps staring at the map which is in the center of the table. He circled the South Lake Pack. &amp;quot;This is where we start to hunt for the mouse.&amp;quot; He added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the rest of the discussion, I found myself not listening to them and just staring at her. She remains silent for the rest of the meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her beautiful black hair gives her this elegant and mysterious personality. As her blue-gray eyes show every emotion that flickers on them except now all I see is hatred. Her perfect shape lips that I found myself wanting to bite them...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remember how those lips tasted back then. How I claimed those damn lips!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Dwayne, are you listening? &amp;quot; I was brought out of my thoughts as I stare at my Mother confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lets out a sigh and stares at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;The other Royalties will be staying in the east mansion of the pack with them and I want you to stay away from there as much as possible.&amp;quot; I look at her in disbelief. Are they going to do this to me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;WHAT?! You wanted me to stay away from my mate?!&amp;quot; This time I stood up and look in her direction but she just stares at me with nothing but emptiness in them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;She is not your mate!&amp;quot; I snap in the bastard&#39;s direction. He was glaring at me and so do I. My wolf does not like the idea of having him near her especially now!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Dwayne Stop!&amp;quot; My mother came to me before I can even pin down that bastard. He gave me a cocky smirk. After I rip you open, let&#39;s see if you can still smile like that!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wolf:&amp;quot;Want mate！&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can feel my wolf wanting to get out, he&#39;s angry, furious even. Sad and hurt his longing for her. Calling for her to give her the attention he wanted for the past month.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Please... stop! This is for your good.&amp;quot; My wolf calms down but not he still wanted to crawl out of here and tear him apart. I didn&#39;t answer my mother instead I stare in her direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was just sitting calmly with her gaze fixed on him! That son of a bitch! I&#39;m going to kill him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was this close to me and it was making me insane. I just wanna grab her and feel her. Her scent is the only thing that keeps my wolf in control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk towards her but before I could even take a step closer to her she stood up and stare at me in the eye. Her eyes are cold as eyes making a stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Don&#39;t come near me.&amp;quot; She whispered enough for me to hear it loud and clear. And with that, she left the room leaving me in pieces. I stood there unable to move as the world had just crashed into me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can hear my heart beating so fast like I ran a marathon. It was beating loud and clear but I felt like my heart had just stopped beating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You don&#39;t want to get involved with us, so you better listen to her.&amp;quot; He mutters before he went to the door where she left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance at my parents who now staring back at me with the look of sadness and pity in their eyes. My mother looks so heartbroken as she was about to cry. She hated seeing me like this! But I cannot blame anyone because this is what I wanted!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We may know for being savages but our pack value the mate bond. Only I consider it as a weakness. But shit! Now I just wanna rip myself open!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I know how you feel my son, but you need to understand the situation. &amp;quot; He squeezed me in the shoulder before he sat down in his chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glare at him! No one understands my pain! He told me to not show any weakness!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a frustrated growl and left feeling all these emotions that I tried to hide. There are so many questions running in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who are you, people?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A let out a loud growl knowing that I don&#39;t know anything about her and the fact that this is all the result of what I&#39;ve done!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I found myself entering my room destroying the first thing that caught my eye flipping it over until it crashed on the concrete wall. But that didn&#39;t satisfy my wolf. I flipped, throw, punch, crushed everything that caught my eye, and the next thing I know my whole room is destroyed. Falling pieces of glass are scattered everywhere just like how I feel right now. Blood is dripping down my knuckles but I don&#39;t give a fuck about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You can hear the voices of the pack as well as the smell of fear and pity in the air. Of course, they already know what happened. After my sudden outbursts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The familiar smell of my mother caught my nostrils probably running her way up here I don&#39;t wanna see the look in her eyes. Closing my eyes, I picked myself up and jump outside as I let my wolf take a run to the forest. I wanna get out of here and just be with her. Before I know it my paws are taking me to the east part of the park where the east mansion is located.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I need to find answers and right now she is the only one who can give me what I want...</p>
