                <p>I glance at my own reflection, red rubies eyes piercing back at me. Then the growling from the other Lycan pulled me back to my senses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was stunned to see how fast I am, I could even see its movement. Trying to attack me and it wasn&#39;t even that hard for me to dodge it. While earlier it fell like in a blink of an eye it wa able to launch at me. I glance at its hand, Clint was still unconscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gritted my canines, I felt the anger inside me. And before I could even think I was already piercing its arms where it was holding Clint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I caught Clint in time before he hits the ground. And with a loud growled I bite its arm, piercing it out of its shoulder. It started to growled and whimper at the same time. Trying to bite me as it tried to get away from my hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And it wasn&#39;t an easy one to hold, I let go of its other arm and back away. To my surprise, it started picking up its broken arm, then put it back like nothing happened?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What just happened? How could it possibly do that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could even find an answer, it jumped in the air, catching me off guard. Feeling its weight on top of me, it was hard enough for me to get it off me. I glance to where Clint was, who went crashing like me because I was holding him in my arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Red eyes glared at me, I could feel its breath in my face, canines showing just a few inches away from my face. I was completely overpowered by it. Growling loudly, I could feel the horror trying to eat me up. Not even sure if I was afraid that it would kill me or because I was one of its kind. The terror of seeing myself in its state made me even more afraid of myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closing my eyes as I prepare for its attack, but nothing happened. A whistle blew from a far, and the weight from my top was being lifted. I open my eyes and found the Lycan running towards the direction of the whistle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to stand but I couldn&#39;t, glancing at my hand I was back to my old self. Pulling a cover of my naked body, I walk towards Clint. I wasn&#39;t sure if that thing will return again but right now I need to get Clint away from here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we reach the East Mansion, I don&#39;t have any other choice right now but to stay here. I lay Clint in his bed. Feeling my body starting to feel heavy, like all my energy has been drain. I couldn&#39;t help but feel sleepy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking my head trying to avoid the heavy feeling. I need to go and find that thing. After seeing what it did to everyone in the facility. I know to myself that seeing it freely outside might put the others in great danger. And I have to stop it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I couldn&#39;t remember how I was able to turned into a Lycan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held the walls for support as I walk outside the door but before I could even reach the outside my vision became blurry. And the next thing I know I was already in complete darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I woke up no seems to be awake yet, and I was more than satisfied for that. I wouldn&#39;t be able to say anything if Dwayne suddenly saw ne in my state and I wasn&#39;t even sure if what would be his reaction after knowing that he seems to not recognize me at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Contemplating whether I should check him or Clint. Letting out a sigh, I decided that I should talk to Clint first and know everything that happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I went inside his old room, it didn&#39;t take long for him to wake up. He looks shocked at first at his surroundings then started to calm down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are finally awake, how are you feeling?&#34; I ask, he stared at me for a few minutes. Making sure that I was real and he wasn&#39;t just hallucinating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he was finally able to assess himself and I answered some of his questions. I left him, I could feel his presence behind me. I went to my room and before he could utter anything else again I shut the door on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting out a deep breath as I felt a swamping emotions inside me. I slowly went near the bed where he was sleeping soundly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then his eyes opened, and I swear I held my breath when our eyes met. His green-blue eyes still having the same effect like it used to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze was fixated with me. And I know I told him that I don&#39;t plan on running away again but right now there is a much bigger problem that I need to solve first before I let him do his thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the back of my head I know what Kariz means. But right now is not the time to think about this. I jump off the veranda making sure that he wouldn&#39;t be able to follow me but to my surprise he did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Using my remaining strength I vanished into thin air. Clint was waiting for me just near the border. He wasn&#39;t also in his right state to be able to shift to his wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to go.&#34; I uttered as we reach the border. I put them back to sleep. I could hear the chaos from the pack already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to tell you something.&#34; Clint mumbled frozen on his feet. I glance at him and he was hesitating at first. The look on his face was enough to tell me that what he was about to say is something that I wouldn&#39;t like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Belerick is alive.&#34; I couldn&#39;t believe my ears upon hearing that name again. His alive?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remained silent, but then the sound of footsteps pulled us both back to reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go!&#34; I nodded my head and we started to run away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We used the same way I used before. And just like expected the others are waiting on the other side. The look of displeased is written all over their face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you thinking?&#34; Kariz uttered upon seeing me. I ignored his words. I wonder who was older than me for him to nag me like that? Technically speaking he was older than me as of now because I was born again while he remained like himself. But I was still born first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think before you all start to nag at me, you all should listen to us first.&#34; They all remained silent. Waiting for us to say it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Belerick is alive.&#34; And to my surprised they all remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kind of reaction that I wasn&#39;t expecting. I glance at Kariz who didn&#39;t change his expression or doesn&#39;t look surprised at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You knew didn&#39;t you.&#34; I muttered, they all turned their heads towards me. Kariz remain silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
