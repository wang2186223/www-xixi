                <p>Zion&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance at Dwayne, he was acting strange this past few weeks then suddenly change all of a sudden. He was still affected by his mate who turns her back on us then now he acts like nothing ever happened to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Zion have you seen Dwayne?&#34; I turn to see Sarah, she still looks beautiful in my eyes but something about her is not as appealing to me as before. This all started when we came to visit that prisoner in the South. That woman!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>2 weeks ago...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was surprised to see Dwayne badge in my Room. He had this serious look on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to go to the South.&#34; I narrow my brow at him a bit skeptical about what he was planning to do. He was just about to regain the trust of the pack back. Don&#39;t tell me he was planning on doing something again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; He looks at me with an irritated look. Like how he used to do back then when he still hasn&#39;t met her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to investigate Rion, we need to locate the other traitors who are helping him. Because he can&#39;t handle everything on his own without someone helping him.&#34; He muttered, now that he mentioned it. It was practically true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does the Elders knows?&#34; He stops for a minute then I almost regret saying those words at him. His eyes turn dark telling me his wolf was about to come out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you questioning my decisions?!&#34; I lower my head, he was using his Alpha voice. I know he somewhat lost his authority towards the pack but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that he was still our Alpha and whether we like it or not our wolf will still submit to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But because of the issues that happened before he lost almost the respect of his pack, so mostly his pack members won&#39;t follow his orders unless he used his Alpha tone. That is also the reason why he needs to gain his authority back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not Alpha, I just want to remind you about the problem we will have if the Elders happened to object.&#34; This is also the reason why the Factions have the Elders, the Elders are not just the former Alpha but because they made these rules that even Alphas cannot break. And that is also the reason why they came here. Because a rule is broken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alphas are forbidden to take their weak mates even though it was a rule that most of us have to respect. Because Alphas are only allowed to continue a strong bloodline of werewolves. And now I know why because of the continuous war with the Rogues. Up until now, I have hated the Rogues because they have taken so much to us, especially to Sarah. I saw how she became broken after what happened to her. I cannot blame Dwayne for doing what he must to save Sarah. That is also the reason why I object to Dwayne&#39;s decision on chasing Klaire. And after Sarah almost died at the hand of the Rogues in that Island. I promise that I will do everything in my power to stop those Rogues from killing another family. They took to much from us already. Including my own brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will talk to them about it. Now I want you to gather at least 5 pack warriors to join us. Pick the ones who will respect and won&#39;t question me.&#34; He uttered directing his words to me. And for the second time, I felt the chills run down my spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Is he really back? I nodded my head and he left. Now I was left with nothing but things to do. And when he said 5, I know who shall come with us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stop my track at a barn just outside the west wing of the territory. And as usual, he was there. He carried two cows on his shoulders and when he saw me coming he stops and put his cows down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What brought you here Zion.&#34; I smile and gave him a pat on the shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been a while Claus.&#34; Claus was one of the greatest pack warriors we had but he suddenly stops when he lost his mate over the last fight we had with the Rogues. That was also the time that Sarah lost her mate during our first shift. Claus was about 3 years older than us. He was the same age as my brother if he was still alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it this time? Are you perhaps in trouble?&#34; I shake my head at him. Dwayne and he are not really fond of each other but he respects Dwayne as his Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, but our pack is,&#34; I mumbled, his face was telling me that he was aware of the things that is happening. Even though this part of the territory is quite abandoned. The pack members who usually come here are the ones who wanted to exclude themselves from the pack matters. But they are still obligated to at least come to the pack meetings once in a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard it, so the Alpha happened to have a mate who is involved with the Royalties and the Rogues. &#34; He uttered. I nodded my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But that&#39;s not all, the Elders are here. I knew you didn&#39;t come last time so you probably never heard about it.&#34; His jaw almost drops.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So it was really serious this time. Those folks never even show their faces unless it was the succession. But from what I witnessed last time the Royalties are the ones who did the succession.&#34; I nodded my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need 5 members who will come with us to investigate the traitor. Rion the Alpha of the South.&#34; He didn&#39;t look surprised at the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So he finally shows his true colors huh.&#34; He mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know him?&#34; He laugh at me like it was a joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you telling me your brother didn&#39;t tell you anything?&#34; I nodded my head. Waiting for him to continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know that we trained in the South for like 2 years before your brother died. Rion was with us back then. I know something was off around him, especially after what I saw.&#34; He stops for a minute feeling a bit disturbed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw how he kill his opponent during training. I know some of the training can cause death but they usually prevent it. But during that time Rion was a complete ballistic. He didn&#39;t stop when the trainer stops him. He continue to punch his opponent&#39;s face until it was unrecognizable anymore. But what creeps me out is the way he smiled after. The next day we were called to return here because that was the last day of our training. After that, we heard nothing about him and we just decided to forget what happened.&#34; He mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well Dwayne decided to find out more about him and that is what we are about to find out. Are you coming or not?&#34; He smiled and nodded his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now you are sounding like a real Beta.&#34; He uttered, I just shake my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll see you tomorrow at the border.&#34; I turn to find the next two people I know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stop at the pub. And when I enter it they all stop doing what they are doing and stared at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk inside and stop at the bar section.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What should I get for you?&#34; I just stared at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not why I&#39;m here Darren. Where&#39;s Arren?&#34; He pointed at the back towards the Kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it Beta?&#34; Arren burst out of the door. This two are twins and we are together during our training both me and Dwayne. They just didn&#39;t take their position because of their Father&#39;s betrayal who happen leads some of the hunters toward the South which cause them to drop off to the lower rank of werewolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I haven&#39;t seen you two in a while and right now Dwayne needs your help.&#34; They both look at each other and narrow their brows. I just saw myself in them earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this about his mate who happens to be one connected to the Rogues?&#34; I nodded my head. &#34;Are we going to look for her?&#34; He whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, we will probably end up doing that soon but right now we need to go to the South, we will explain the details tomorrow. So are you coming or not?&#34; And again they both look at each other and nodded their heads. I know they will take it. They always wanted to get back to their right position and doing this will help them do that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will meet at the border.&#34; Now I only need to get the last one. And I know making him come will be the hardest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk towards the training grounds and saw Lindon, he was the Beta of the South. And Dwayne instructed me to get him before he left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want.&#34; He still sounded upset after everything that happened in his Alpha and I know he was his closest friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need your help.&#34; He let go the weights that he was carrying, making a loud thug on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What for? Are you planning on using me to betray my own pack? And you know who is the real reason why this happened.&#34; He uttered, getting too close to me like he wanted a fight. This is probably the reason why Dwayne wants me to talk to him instead of himself because they will end up fighting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s cut the chased, you also know that your Alpha is also one to blame,&#34; I muttered while glaring at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But that is partly the reason why we are here. If what Rion is saying was right then I could help him.&#34; He muttered, wait what? This is the first time that I heard about this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You also know what he did to my subordinates. He let them get killed.&#34; I can feel the sadness and bitterness on his words. He was right about that matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I cannot say anything about that. But if you will help me, we can find the other traitors who is helping Rion and with that, we could bring justice to them.&#34; He added this is the first time that I saw Dwayne like this. He really sounded like an Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. I will help you but after this, I&#39;m done.&#34; He uttered then turns his back on us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look at Dwayne who is still staring at Lindon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you really talk to that traitor?&#34; He didn&#39;t answer and just turns his back on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dwayne you have to tell me something. You know you are my friend and even if you aren&#39;t my Alpha I will still help you.&#34; This made him stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did, and he told me something that you wouldn&#39;t believe even if I tell you.&#34; He said then left. I just stood there unable to utter a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since those Royalties came everything is turning upside down. I stared at my surroundings. I can smell the tension in the air and something is telling me that this is just the beginning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>End of flashback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zion? Are you listening to me??&#34; I look at Sarah, not even knowing what she was talking about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I haven&#39;t seen him.&#34; She pouted her lips looking annoyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you being like that? Both you and Dwayne are so cold. You also change!&#34; She uttered then storm out. I don&#39;t know if I should be glad about what she said or be afraid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I change? Suddenly an image of a woman with chocolate brown hair came to my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why am I thinking of her,&#34; I mutter to myself then shake my head. Trying to avoid the answer to my question. Because I know deeply to myself why I&#39;m thinking of her.</p>
