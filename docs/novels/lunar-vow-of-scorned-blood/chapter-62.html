                <p>Dwayne&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we reach the South, the pack were already expecting us. Right now their pack is in chaos because they don&#39;t have an Alpha at the moment only the former Alpha is standing as a replacement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rion never mentioned his mate.&#34; I mumbled as soom as I was alone with Lindon. He turn around and stared at me with a blank face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He wouldn&#39;t even talk to her about anyone after what happened.&#34; He answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have any idea why Rion betrayal the Faction?&#34; This made him froze. A sudden rage on his breathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know. I was even asking that myself, did I really know him? It just sucks that I have to stand beside a murderer all this time.&#34; He clench his fist. I know he was more than angry for Rion&#39;s betrayal. He was his closest friend, and right now I understand why he didn&#39;t tell the Faction about Devon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the reason why we are here. To know why Rion did what he have done. This includes why he was so angry to the point of driving his own pack to the Rogues.&#34; He didn&#39;t answer. And just continue making his way towards the pack house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we got inside everyone is waiting for us. The look of doubt as soon as they saw us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome Alphas. I hope the sudden event won&#39;t affect the relationship of the faction towards the South.&#34; An older man mumbled. Lindon then stand on his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is my father Larry, the former Beta and he was the one who is handling the pack while the Alpha is not yet back.&#34; He was talking about Rion&#39;s adopted father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please let us know if you we could help you with anything. &#34; He uttered, we all just nodded our head then he turn his attention towards a woman standing behind him. He looks exactly like Lindon except that she was a woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is my daughter Liza, and she will be the one to kind you towards your rooms. I hope you had a pleasant stay.&#34; We all excuse ourselves and followed Liza. She took us to the 5th floor where our rooms are. Looks like we have to stay in the packhouse. The factions made sure that we won&#39;t be able to move freely without eyes watching us. Zion and the other&#39;s room are on the 4th floor below us while the Alphas are here in the 5th floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is your room Alpha Dwayne.&#34; She mumbled, I thank her and she excuse herself. When I open the door I was welcome by a huge room. Not bigger than my room back at the North but it was big enough for me. The interior of the room was industrial, from its king size bed down to it&#39;s tiniest details.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lay down on the bed, feeling a bit exhausted after our long run. It took us almost 10 days to get here and that was already our fastest way to get here on a normal run it could took us 15-20 days to reach the South.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock on the door pull me out of my sleep. When I open it Zion was waiting for me along with the other 3. Lindon was no where to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s Lindon?&#34; I let them inside but I warned them not to talk about our plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think he was still with his Father. Are you sure we could trust him?&#34; Zion whispered the last part. I know they have doubts even I myself. But we can only find out soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t have a choice but to believe him for now.&#34; I uttered. They all remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you all need to get out of here if you want to talk freely.&#34; Lindon said, we all turned to find Lindon who is now standing at the doorstep. &#34;I could here your voice from the hallway. Good thing the others aren&#39;t here.&#34; He uttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I found some information from my father.&#34; I glared at him and he raised both his hands in the air. &#34;I know you told me not to tell anyone about this. But my father was more aware of the reason why Rion change.&#34; He added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You could trust my father, he was one of Rion&#39;s father&#39;s follower before he died.&#34; We all just stared at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, if anything goes wrong after this. I will kill you myself.&#34; I uttered, he just chuckle and nodded his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We followed him outside the packhouse. Then we stop on a small cabin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is our house.&#34; He said. &#34;You know we are one of the low ranks before but because of Rion&#39;s father we were able to rise back to being the Betas. &#34; He continue. When he opened the door his father was on the kitchen. He was busy cooking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh I&#39;m sorry for how I look right now Alpha Dwayne. I hope you like some steaks. I&#39;m making some of my wife&#39;s recipe.&#34; He called out from the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought we are here to talk? And not to have a house visit?&#34; Arren whispered. Darren smack his shoulders and told him to keep quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lindon and his Father Larry came out of the kitchen with some food. They set the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please have a seat, let&#39;s have dinner first before we go back to that rough side.&#34; Larry said. We all took our seat and started eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard the real reason why you are here Alpha Dwayne.&#34; Larry started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just call me Dwayne.&#34; I said, not liking the formalities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay then Dwayne. I know you wanted to ask about Rion. To be honest he wasn&#39;t like that before his father&#39;s death. &#34; He look a bit sad, like he recalled some memories that he don&#39;t want to remember.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He told me something about his father&#39;s death. But I wanna know what you know about his father&#39;s death.&#34; I look at him in the eyes and he chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You hated wasting time I see.&#34; He took a sip of his wine and then cleared his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wasn&#39;t sure how his father died that time. But his father talk to me the night before his death. He told me to take care of Rion and his wife because something might happened to him. At first I thought it was a joke but the next day I just heard the news that he died on the hands of the hunters.&#34; He explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He wanted to take the south out of the Faction. I don&#39;t know the reason why but he told me that he could take it anymore. I wasn&#39;t alone that time when he said that. Rion&#39;s uncle was also there that time. At first I didn&#39;t give it much of a thought but then one day I heard him and Rion fighting after his father&#39;s death. Rion was blaming his uncle for his death. I thought he was just angry at everyone until today when I heard that Rion betrayed his pack.&#34; He said, his voice sounded lonely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rion was like a son to me especially because Lindon became his Beta after that. But then I don&#39;t know anymore what is happening. I know it has something to do with his Father&#39;s death.&#34; Lindon cleared the table as we listen to his father&#39;s story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had hopes that everything was already okay after he met his mate. But then she died one day, we found her in the wounds the night of her first shift. That was the first time I saw Rion look so sinister after that but then he started acting like nothing happened. I&#39;m not sure if this will help you find your answers but that is all the things I know.&#34; He ended his story. We all remain silent after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was more than enough. Thank you Larry.&#34; His face brighten up as soon as he heard me say those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was always feeling guilty for not doing anything that time. That is why he was willing to tell you this.&#34; Lindon whispered as he look at his father who is now busy talking to his wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that also why you trust Rion so much?&#34; He nodded his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, but still that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not angry at him for letting our team get killed by those rogues.&#34; He added. He was talking about the attack where he was the only one who came out alive. It was also the time where I saw Klaire with Rion. I swear just thinking about that day made my blood boil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When are you planning on visiting Devon?&#34; He ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tomorrow, we need to move fast. Tomorrow Cameron and Harid will start with the other two while us will interrogate Dieter.&#34; I uttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just so you know, I do not know where she is but I might knew where she might head to.&#34; Lindon then scratch the back of his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t you tell us earlier?&#34; Zion voice came from my behind. His voice as a hint of annoyance in them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I totally thought you wouldn&#39;t let me come if you knew.&#34; He answered. This time Zion pulled him outside their house. Larry and his wife was surprised but I told them it was fine. They were just playing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all went outside except for Lindon&#39;s parents. I close the door and watch Zion throw Lindon on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arren and Darren stop Zion and Lindon from breaking into a fight. They were both holding each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you end up wasting our time I swear I will beat you! You little punk!&#34; Zion bark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You all have no one other than me so better shut up.&#34; Lindon answered back. I don&#39;t know why but Zion suddenly started getting irritated by Lindon. He wasn&#39;t the type to suddenly attack someone unless he have his reasons and right now I have no idea why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Relax beta, she was my childhood friend. And that is the only place I could think of that no one knew except me and her brother. This us your best chance of finding her.&#34; Lindon uttered, pulling away from Arren&#39;s hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s enough Zion. He have a point, we still need him if we want to find her.&#34; Zion just hissed then walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is wrong with your beta?&#34; Lindon ask. I shrugged my shoulders unsure about it myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe something is pissing him off or someone was.&#34; Claus finally found his tongue back and decided to actually speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And who was it?&#34; I uttered but he just replied with a shrugged on his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claus and I wasn&#39;t in good terms. It was during the time of my trainings where he was one of the strongest opponent I had. But he ended up losing against me and you know the pride of a werewolf. He didn&#39;t like it, I know he wanted to be an Alpha before, he was practically my cousin, his father was my father&#39;s cousin who are also not in good terms. We grow up being rivals after that. But I respect him as a warrior, he was really strong but after his mate&#39;s death he started to show no interest on everything and turn his back towards his responsibility and stayed in the country side of the territory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we head back Cameron and Harid was waiting for me in the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Took a night stroll?&#34; Cameron uttered, he was leaning on his door frame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t answer and just walk pass them. Harid tap my shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I were you, I would be careful for who will I trust.&#34; He whispered then entered his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know that already...</p>
