                <p>Amara&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Galaz entered my room with uneasy look on his face. I&#39;m still annoyed at him for telling Kariz about last time we went to the north pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I couldn&#39;t stop myself to ask. He let out a sigh unsure if he should tell me or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not sure if how will you react to my news but I guess you need to know?&#34; He said, now his starting to get into my nerves</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to talk or not?&#34; He let out a deep sigh then took a step towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Central Kingdom is about to get attack.&#34; I remain silent and he just stood there watching how I will react. I know they are still fully aware of the fact that I still cannot shake my emotions as Klaire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And it looks like the faction already decided to finally show their true intentions.&#34; He continue, and again I still didn&#39;t say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And right now we will head to the Central Kingdom to help them.&#34; Now I&#39;m nothing but confused. Help them? I thought they want them dead?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you want to ask why, but I wasn&#39;t sure myself. Only Kariz know what is happening. He even told us to keep it from you but I don&#39;t want you to end up strangling me like Ria.&#34; So he saw that? Why didn&#39;t he stop me? Anyway I didn&#39;t say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You may go.&#34; I muttered then turn my back at him. &#34;I don&#39;t care about them anymore.&#34; I&#39;m not sure if I was convincing him or I was convincing myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay then. I&#39;ll see you in a few days.&#34; I&#39;m not sure how they will get there, but after staying with them for weeks. I can say their abilities are not far behind from ours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I jump to my bed trying to stop myself from following them but then I cannot stop it. I pulled myself up and was about to open the door when Kariz suddenly show up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you will do this. You still haven&#39;t change at all Amara.&#34; I ignored him but he grab my arms and pulled me back to my room. Now I&#39;m sure he was really like me. The way he pull me is not like the ordinary strength of a normal werewolf. And as I stay with him I never saw him turned into a werewolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t stop me Kariz!&#34; I warned him. He didn&#39;t even budged at my words and just pulled a chair with his other hand and force me to take a seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared at him, still his hands was still in my arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously Kariz what the hell is happening? I thought I could trust you but right now you are leaving me in the dark!&#34; I cannot stop myself for showing how pissed I am. With everything that happened to me all this past few months I was even surprised that I was still sane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need them, I didn&#39;t mention this to you but in order to be fully awake you need all your given blood back.&#34; My eyes widen with disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That could kill them!&#34; I muttered, he shake his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They won&#39;t die, but they could lost their wolves and become a normal human. In the first place your blood made them werewolves.&#34; I don&#39;t know what to say after hearing all of that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about you? Are you also going to give back the blood that you received?&#34; He didn&#39;t say anything and turn his back on me. He went towards the open window. By the look of it Galaz already left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You may not believe what I&#39;m about to say but I don&#39;t have your blood because in the first place I don&#39;t need it. &#34; I frowned at his words. I know he wouldn&#39;t see my expression but I couldn&#39;t help but frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t understand.&#34; I said, unsure what he mean by that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You already saw what happened during the first war. How can you forget it?&#34; Is he talking about what I saw in my dreams during the time where Vicky took me into the glass cage?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I only remember a few glimpse of it.&#34; I uttered, I only remember how Belerick killed my mother and father then he took me and started the experiments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me show you again.&#34; Before I could even react he was already a few inches away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was pulled back into the same castle as before. But this time it wasn&#39;t the time where Belerick killed them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is where it all started.&#34; I almost jump when Kariz suddenly spoke behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There are two man in front of us. I&#39;m quite sure it was Belerick and Elijah. They are heading towards a cave, we followed them until we reach a magnificent place. It was glowing with all those crystals. And at the center of it was a light coming from the moonlight. Probably from cracks around the cave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are we here again?&#34; I know this place, this is the place where they first met Amira. My mother who is the guardian of the Lycans blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you already know they took the blood from the fountain. But look closely.&#34; I gasp when I finally notice a figure standing just above the fountain. I saw this before...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly move backwards, wanting to get away from here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what that is right?&#34; I glared at him. Why would he take me here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not sure. I-I don&#39;t know!&#34; I shouted and ran outside the cave. He followed me. The image of that beast came flooding in my head, ruby eyes, canines that are bigger than a normal werewolf. And that deadly stared, and what worse is that I can feel his blood thirst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have to stop being Klaire!&#34; I&#39;m not sure why but I felt something when he touch me. A familiar feeling, this is the first time I felt this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not!&#34; I mumbled and pulled myself out of his grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You already know what I showed you. I know you already saw it before.&#34; I shake my head, I remember the exact dream I had. I wasn&#39;t even sure if that was a dream or not. &#34;Because I also saw it. No! It was actually me who looks exactly like that being.&#34; He muttered, making me stop my track.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you talking about?&#34; This time I was transferred into the exact time before Belerick killed my parents. Then I notice the baby bump on my mother&#39;s belly. I know she was pregnant that time but she died meaning that baby which is my sibling also died.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like what I saw before Belerick killed them and took me but before he left. One of the former Elders called for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was still breathing my Lord.&#34; I put both my hands in my mouth. Why didn&#39;t I saw this before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Belerick smiled wickedly and told them to take her with them. And again we are transferred into another place. This time it was a dark cave like cell. And there she was bleeding heavily while shouting for help. She was about to give birth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t stop myself but cry, as I watch her gave birth by herself. Her cry was hammering in my ears. I glance at Kariz and for the first time again I saw the sad look on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finally deliver the baby, she took a cut off fabric from her clothes. And whispered something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, I was not able to protect both you and your sister. I love you..&#34; that was her last words before she finally took her last breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was still in tears, and when I glance again at Kariz he was back on his composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was you... You are my brother.&#34; I mumbled and he smiled at me sadly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you not tell me?&#34; He look at me with a sad smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wasn&#39;t aware at first, and I couldn&#39;t tell you after I saw how you finally got a new life.&#34; He look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why did you kidnapped me?&#34; I cannot stop myself but I can feel how afraid I was during that time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t have a choice because I want to find a way to save you. And if I didn&#39;t the Faction will find you first.&#34; He explained, still I can feel my anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And to be honest I got mad, I was mad that you were able to start again and forget everything while I was here living every painful memories.&#34; I don&#39;t know what to say to him. Something inside me was sad and pitying him but on the other hand I was mad for doing all this things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t you get old?&#34; I know he wasn&#39;t reincarnated like all of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wasn&#39;t sure myself. Everything about us is still confusing. Just like how our mother didn&#39;t get old after reaching our age. &#34; Now nothing is making any sense at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not sure how I should react with all this things but I&#39;m glad your alive.&#34; I pulled him into a tight hug. Looks like I was actually not alone in my both two lives. I had a brother in my first life which is Kariz and in this life I have Clint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clint! Now I can feel my worry back again, I have no idea what is happening outside this walls. Kariz made sure that I wouldn&#39;t hear any news from them because he wants me to be ready and by doing that I have to complete destroy all this emotions I have as Klaire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, we will make sure they will come back alive. And Clint won&#39;t let anything bad happened towards the others. He was your brother in this lifetime. So technically he was far more closer to your blood than the others.&#34; I don&#39;t know why but his words made ma calm. So this is why I suddenly felt a familiar feeling around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He left after we start to talk about everything that happened. He actually almost died before just like what he said, that is also part of the reason why I lost control. Because according to him we can feel each other. Like we are connected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the second war where I also lost control, that was the time where he awaken. He didn&#39;t told me the details but it cause me to react that way because I couldn&#39;t control the sudden shift of our powers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We still don&#39;t know much about Lycans because their history was far buried before the werewolves was created. But then he told me that only one person can answer all our question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t say who it was. But I know I shouldn&#39;t be impatient because right now I need to train both my body and mind to not get myself into that same situation where I let my inside Lycan control me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a deep breath, staring at the dark scenery outside my window. Only the light from the moonlight gave me a comforting feeling. I glance down and saw Kariz, he was talking to some of the Rogues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I found out that this rogues are from the Factions before and they are accused as traitors which resulted to some of them to die. And some successfully escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This place is hard to track because I myself don&#39;t know exactly where it was. This is also the reason why Kariz choose this place. He told me that he tried everything in his power to find this place and when he finally found it. He used it as his hiding place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A movement just across the lake caught my attention. I glance at Kariz and he was also staring at that direction. What are they doing here? My eyes were focus at the familiar face. How did they found this place? And suddenly I can feel my heart pounding. Did he order him to find me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zion stared back at me when he notice me. What the hell is his beta doing here?</p>
