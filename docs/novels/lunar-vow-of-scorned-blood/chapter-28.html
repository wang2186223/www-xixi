                <p>Klaire&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Let me introduce to you all Amaris Klaire Calypso the granddaughter of King Felcio Alec Calypso. And my sister.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard someone gasp from the crowd. And found her red hair, she clung around Dwayne&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes focus on their hands, a flinch of pain resurface, I suddenly wanted to get out of there. Someone grabbed my hand making me turn around to see who is it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yustef was staring at me seriously, I thank him silently for helping me get my eyes off them. He squeezes my hand as an answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a sigh, finding my courage back. I step forward to say my speech.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Good evening, you are all probably surprised but that isn&#39;t the concern for today.&amp;quot; I pause for a moment and lift my arms in the air to the next line Alpha. &amp;quot;It is for them, for now, save your questions for later.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Directing my eyes to the Alphas in front of me. They are probably dying to ask questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I step forward right at the center where a huge circle sits on the center of this stage. Clint, Yustef, Eliot, and Noah were watching from my behind. Make sure no one tries to interrupt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The succession will begin once the moon shines right at the center of the circle. The oaths will be taken by then and the markings from the Alpha&#39;s will be transferred to the next line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would be a painful one as the moon shines making their power even stronger. The Alpha&#39;s who first successfully claimed the new Alpha mark will be the Center of the faction&#39;s authority. Which is right now the North being the center.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can feel their eyes watching my every move, the moon started to line up at the center.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closing my eyes, I wave of light shine upon me, making a wave of golden auras circulates to me. The crowd remains silent in the process, letting go of my chains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can feel my whole body feeling lighter. My hair is brushing the wind, the wind circulates my body, creating small golden butterflies flying around me. I open my eyes lifting my head to stare at the moon directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;May the Moon Goddess grants us her power... &amp;quot; I mutter, the moon shines brighter. My mouth curls into a smile, as I feel my body radiating the power that I always hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hair started to turn to its original color, that silver-white hair. The crowd&#39;s eyes were now wide and in fascination. I close my eyes once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;As the Moon Goddess grants you your position, may you continue to serve with all the power vested within you,&amp;quot; I mutter for the last time, before slowly opening my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all remain silent, only the crickets can be heard around us. I lifted my arms motioning them to gather in their rightful places. Clint stands right next to me, holding the red-black ink that I will use to mark their foreheads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clint started the Oath, and they followed they are all kneeling right next to each other. Clint stood at the center. Each Oath taken, I place the markings of a C like downward in their foreheads all eyes were close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rion smiled when it was his turn to receive the marking. My movement started to slow down as I move to the next person. Dwayne&#39;s eyes were close but I can feel his green-blue eyes gawking at me like his prey. And I let myself be captured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I, Dwayne Carter accept the position of Alpha.&amp;quot; His voice was low and hard, sending chills down my spine. I lifted my hands, dumping my index fingers in the black ink. It suddenly feels cold right next to my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;May the Moon Goddess gives you her blessing,&amp;quot; I mumbled, my hands almost freezing as our skin touched. Sparks started traveling down my whole body, I almost close my eyes as the pleasure started to build up. This is what I&#39;ve been longing for these past few days. It felt so right but wrong at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can feel Dwayne&#39;s hard intake of air as I move my finger to draw the markings. Once I&#39;m done I hurriedly took my hand away like I was burnt from something hot. And I can&#39;t imagine anything hotter than the person in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first part is done, the Alpha&#39;s step forward standing right to the new ones. This is the part where the markings will be transferred to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clint warns me about how it feels and it would be painful... Very painful as he said. It will take a minimum of an hour before your body accepts the new markings and power. I and Clint made our way to the seat prepared for us at the center next to the Alpha&#39;s seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They took their coats off, next is their inner white clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hand clench at the armrest as I watch Dwayne&#39;s muscles move magnificently. He was just taking his shirt off... I scolded myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dwayne&#39;s eyes shift and turn toward me, I almost run away by how his intense gaze locks on mine. His eyes glowing. I can&#39;t read what he was thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They kneeled again in front of their Fathers. The Alpha&#39;s place their right hand in the head of the next Alpha&#39;s. They received another Oath that is made from each faction. As the Oaths continue the pressure of their power filled the air. Making other Pack members uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was getting harder to breathe to some. I lifted my hand, creating an invisible barrier to contain their power inside and not crash the people around them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the Oaths with ended, the former Alpha&#39;s took their step out away from them. We all watch the four being in front of us, their eyes all turn black indicating their wolves are the ones present. The challenge here is they have to tame the ravaging beast inside of them. It was an inner battle between their human and beast sides. Their beast side is one of the higher scales.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During this time, you can hear their growls and screams as they are taken deep down their minds where the line between them and their beast is equal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their fight will start, if they failed to beat or tame their beast the Alpha&#39;s marking will remain but their power won&#39;t be like the other Alpha&#39;s who successfully beat their beast. Control is one of the main objectives of this part. How they handle their new power will be tested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes stay at the only calm one among them. Dwayne&#39;s eyes were close, making it hard to figure out if his beast was reacting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart stops, Dwayne&#39;s eyes were slowly open. Black eyes gaze back at me... I inhale sharply he was watching me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grins his boyish grin. Wow...I&#39;ve not expected that. It didn&#39;t take so long, his eyes shifted back to their original ones. Green-blue eyes, he turns and smirks at me, and for the first time in five days, I feel uneasy... I can feel another storm coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dwayne&#39;s newly awaken power is radiating around him. I can feel his dominance, his gaze remained at me the whole time, like how a predator selects his next prey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He steps out of the barrier, his pack members started to cheer. Feeling the pride for their new Alpha. Stella hugs her son congratulates him, Brent remains silent but you can see the pride written on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rion was the next one who gain control, his friendly demeanor is still there. He smiles at me as he steps out of the barrier. The South Lake started cheering also, welcoming their new Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next one who steps out is the White Moon followed by the Golden Arid. They all successfully gained control, it only means the last part will be my worst nightmare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The claiming of Luna&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The successor of the Alpha Title will always end up finding their mates, it will only depend on their decision to claim them and reject them if they find them not suitable for being the Luna of their pack... In my case, the former happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shove that memory to the back of my mind. Not wanting unintentional emotions popping out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clint ended the ceremony by then. The last part is already not our concern. The new Alpha&#39;s will be the ones in charge after this. Their chosen Luna will be presented tomorrow. And the marking will happen by then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Based on Noah&#39;s information most of their mate is only ordinary rank werewolves, which made them reject them and take another she-wolf. I don&#39;t what is wrong with this bunch of Alpha&#39;s that they have to break the mate bond. Only Rion was the one who accepted his mate as his Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A loud explosion brought me back to my senses. It was coming from the East, my eyes shifted to Clint who nodded his head. It was the direction of the East Mansion. Followed by the explosion was the noise of werewolves&#39; paws heading in our direction...</p>
