                <p>Klaire&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cry of the infant was the only thing that filled the silence, it was a long and sad silence. I was just staring at her lifeless body; she was covered with blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A loud bang in the door made me flinch, and there he was Elijah standing in the door way, his eyes were furious. His eyes were glaring at Belerick, it was full of hatred. He can&#39;t hide the sadness written in them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a step closer but stops mid-way when he noticed the body lying on the floor. His whole body froze, he rushes towards the dead body of his wife and started crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;No, Baby please wake up Amia...&amp;quot; No one answered, he hugged the body in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other hand, Belerick was just watching Elijah with contentment. He was still holding the baby in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;This is the reason why, look at you Elijah crying over a petty Human! You became weak!&amp;quot; Belerick utter with anger and disgust, he looks different from the Belerick earlier. The warmth in his eyes are long gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Is that all the reason why you killed my mate?!&amp;quot; Elijah said, his voice was low and angry. He slowly lifted Amia&#39;s body and lay her to bed. He kissed her forehead before turning his back to where Belerick is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Tell me Belerick, what kind of death do you plan on having? I can help you with that.&amp;quot; His eyes were starting to turned black. I can feel the pressure of his power and it was overwhelming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I could watch you try.&amp;quot; Belerick smiled, Elijah didn&#39;t notice earlier but Belerick was holding the sword he used to stab Amia. He was doing the same thing he did to Amia to surrender herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled the knife and used it to threaten Elijah, he was sticking the knife right at their baby. Elijah&#39;s eyes remain black but something shifted in the air, the tension of his power was starting to lessen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I guess you understand your situation.&amp;quot; Belerick mutters, he looks like an evil antagonist that you can hear in some stories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Let her Rick, my daughter doesn&#39;t know anything about this.&amp;quot; Belerick laugh at Elijah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Really? But I need her to fulfill the thing that you didn&#39;t finish. I need to finish what we started Eli.&amp;quot; He mumbled, Elijah&#39;s eyes went wide at the realization of Belerick&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;No you can&#39;t do that Belerick! You know it will cause you everything!&amp;quot; You can hear the panic in Elijah&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;That&#39;s the point, I need your daughter as the key. You know she&#39;s the only vessel that can be taken. But instead of using her mother you decided to turn your back on us right Alpha... Or should my King?&amp;quot; His words are like poison at Elijah, I have no idea why but the Legend about the King of werewolves came to mind. It was them, the Alpha, Beta and the Luna. Their story in unfolding right before my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But why are they connected to my memories? Vicky said before I fell asleep that I need to remember. And right now everything still feels unclear, and whenever I tried to think about it my head was starting to hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Belerick I know you were under his influence but please think about this first. Take me instead not my daughter.&amp;quot; I can hear the desperation in his voice. His eyes were focus on his daughter; she was the only remain of his wife. The sadness written in his eyes as he stares at his daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Okay then let&#39;s do this.&amp;quot; My eyes went wide when I realized what he was about to do. His eyes were glowing as he threw the baby off the veranda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Noooo!&amp;quot; Elijah quickly shifted to his wolf and jump off the veranda. I also run towards it. I can suddenly feel relieved when I saw that he caught her right in time. His white wolf was stained with blood; he was covered with wounds when he got in the room. Probably from the stab cause by Belerick and all the fighting he did. Only if he arrived a bit earlier he might end up saving his wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was biting the clothes of his daughter, his grey eyes were glowing. He glances at our direction, Belerick was also gazing down at them. He looks annoyed that Elijah caught the baby in time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elijah shifted to his human form then glances at his baby, he started checking on her and when he noticed that she wasn&#39;t wounded or hurt anywhere he let out a deep sigh of relief then kissed his baby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m sorry my daughter... This is all my fault.&amp;quot; I can hear his baby giggling, he smiled sadly as he stared at his child. &amp;quot;I will finish this soon and no one will come and hurt you.&amp;quot; He slowly placed her daughter on a little box that was lying around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Stay here Amara.&amp;quot; My heart started beating fast when I heard that name. And there I notice his resemblance to me. His almond shape eyes that looks exactly like mine, the way his lips form a moon shape when he smiles. Suddenly my tears started flowing once more...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amia&#39;s face flash in my head again. That was the reason why I somehow feel like I&#39;ve seen her before because she looks exactly like me. Her shining black hair, her small pointy nose. Pale skin and her round shape face... Why didn&#39;t I realize this sooner?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance back at them, Belerick also jump off the veranda I followed from behind. They were now standing face to each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I don&#39;t want to do this.&amp;quot; Elijah said, I can see the hesitation written all over his face. &amp;quot;But you gave me no other choice Rick, I can&#39;t allow you to continue your plan.&amp;quot; He mumbled, the air fill with the sound of bones snapping. Until his White wolf made his appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Then you have to kill me first Eli.&amp;quot; Belerick shifted also to his wolf, it was a large black wolf. Their size was almost the same but something bis different with Belerick&#39;s wolf, his eyes was red as blood. The same eye color like him... I shake that memory away and focus on them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both circled each other, showing they&#39;re large canines as they glared at each other. I can feel the killing intent of each party. Belerick snarled viciously and he continue to circle around Elijah while snapping towards him every few seconds, provocation I presume. He decided to kick up a notch, he jumped to Elijah he was already on his position and he bite Belerick&#39;s leg then tackled him on the ground. Elijah kick him in the gut knocking the air out of his lungs. Belerick straddles his waist trying to bite him, he tried to scratch Elijah&#39;s right cheeks using his claws and succeeded. Elijah&#39;s head whipped sharply to the side. Pain flared on his face but instantly dimmed and went away. He looks straight up at Belerick, eyes glowing you can picture his wolf smirking at the sight of Belerick&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Belerick attacks one more but he was cut by his own grunt as Elijah&#39;s threw claws at his, a solid slash on his upper abdomen open. Blood started dripping out his wound. His weight was lifted off Elijah and he jump of his feet without a moment to spare. Belerick looks in pain by his wounds. Belerick let out a groan before I notice his outline showing that he was about to stumble on his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time Elijah attacked him one last time, running at him jumping with his feet landing on his back with a solid thump. Belerick&#39;s body flew back several feet hitting what sounded like a tree. I notice his colors dim, meaning he was badly hurt by the force. He slowly got up on his four legs, shaking his head for a bit then growls back at Elijah who is standing a few feet away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw something flinch in his eyes, and I was right he rush to attack once more but this time the attack was nit directing to Elijah&#39;s it was heading to his daughter. Elijah notice the sudden shift and ran towards his daughter. He blocks the attack using his own body. I gasp at the sight in front of my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Belerick was biting Elijah&#39;s neck, blood dripping out his wound. Belerick was already expecting this reaction that&#39;s why he attacks his daughter. He deepens his canines down his flesh, I can hear some bones breaking as he digs deeper. Elijah&#39;s whipped in pain, his eyes was focus on his daughter as he struggles to get out of Belerick&#39;s gripped, one he was satisfied he threw Elijah&#39;s wolf on the ground. I can hear the small cry of his wolf, as he struggles to get back on his feet. His white fur was now covered with blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was crying heavily at the sight, it felt like a part of me was being thorn into pieces. Belerick slowly made his way to Elijah, he was towering the now struggling Elijah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I close my eyes at the next thing that happened, right after I open my eyes I regret it immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grey eyes staring at me as his head went flying to my direction. It was lifeless...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Vision end***</p>
