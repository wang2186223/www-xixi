                <p>Clint&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up with the sound of someone screaming. I held my head as I sat down because it was still pounding. When I glance around I was still in the glass like cage, but something doesn&#39;t feel right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to break the glass over and over again until I was successful enough to put a crack on it. I need to get away from here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then I froze when a loud growl came from the door outside. It was something that I haven&#39;t heard before. It was too loud that I even need to cover my ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shit! What was that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a loud bang the door swung opened following the creature that I never expect to see here. Red eyes stared at me when it finally saw me. Drool in his mouth was coming out, I can still see the red liquid in its black fur. And the scent of blood reach my nostrils.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What does this thing need? And how? I really need to get out of here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could even move it started pouncing on the glass. Now I regret that I even put a slight crack on it. It broke as soon as it made contact with it throwing me out with the pieces of glass in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without even thinking I shifted to my wolf. I couldn&#39;t see any thoughts in its head. Like it wasn&#39;t even human at all?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know I wouldn&#39;t be a good match against him but during the training with Kariz, I know I could at least try to get away from him before it was too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It growled as soon as its sees my wolf, the wolf shake his head trying to get away from his intimidation. It wanted my wolf to submit but I wouldn&#39;t let that happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I growled back, not liking the intimidation it was applying to my wolf. And it looks like it didn&#39;t like it. It started breaking all the equipment in this room. Which started a fire, that&#39;s more like it, we really wanted to burned this place. But then I haven&#39;t checked the whole facilities yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My wolf used this chance to pounce at it, it almost lost it balance but it recover fast and hit me with it&#39;s hand. I could feel my flesh being split open when it hit me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking satisfied, it lick the blood I had in its claws. I thought Lycans don&#39;t think? They just kill? But why does it looks like it was playing with me? Or it was playing me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring the pain I rush another attack this time I was able to bite its shoulder. My canines digging deep in its flesh, ignoring its claws hitting my back as it tries to make me get off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then it started hitting me in the wall the first hit made me close my eyes, my wolf strength was still not fully recover. After I woke up I could feel that my body was somehow weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I couldn&#39;t take it anymore I let go, spitting out its blood in my mouth. Unlike the normal color of blood, its blood was black, dark like its fur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And before I could know it I was already flying in the air, the wall I hit broke into an hole. Me and my wolf gasp for air, feeling that a few parts of our ribs breaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could recover it swung his arms, hitting me across the hallway. I could feel the blood in our mouth, my wolf whimpers because of the pain. Our left leg was injured this time. Having a hard time maintaining it&#39;s balance. Hearing growling sound across the room, expected that it will come here before i could even recover. My injuries are not even healing like before. I know those faction did something to me while i was unconscious, i remember the wolfsbane they use during the attack in the central of kingdom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know my wolf was already weak enough that he couldn&#39;t stand against it. Letting out a deep breath, i decided to do the last thing i know even if my wolf is against it. I know to myself that it wouldn&#39;t take long for me to shift back my human form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel its presence getting closer and closer to me. Until its face was a few inches away from me. Growling I could feel its breath on my face. My wolf was starting to lost its focus. I wasn&#39;t even sure if it was because of whatever those faction did to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My wolf tried to back away but with swing of its arms, we both went crashing into something that I wasn&#39;t sure what is. I glance at my hands, I was back into my human form, my vision was starting to blur, I could feel the warm fluid running in my head. It was red, I smiled bitterly to myself. I couldn&#39;t let myself die yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I felt it grabbing me, I could still feel my surroundings but my body feel paralyzed. I felt it lifting my body up to its head. Knowing what it was about to do I shut my eyes closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I felt someone else presence, I couldn&#39;t determine who it was because I was too weak. Then followed by a loud crash, are they fighting? I wanted to open my eyes but sleep is trying to take me in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing myself to open my eyes, I saw something else, it has the same dark fur like what I fought with earlier. Their growling at each other, are they going against each other?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to even clarify my vision, I let my eyelids shut close. Hearing nothing but the sounds of crashing walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I open my eyes, I was surprised to find myself inside my old room. This isn&#39;t the Central Kingdom, it was the East Mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance to where the only person standing next to the window was. Black hair swaying at the direction of the wind. She turn around, blue-gray eyes stated at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are finally awake, how are you feeling?&#34; I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes. She had the same appearance she had before. I was used on seeing her silver-white hair but I did missed seeing her like this. It reminded me of her being the Klaire that I know. My sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How? Where is that thing?&#34; Feeling confused about what happened, I couldn&#39;t even utter a right word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And what is she doing here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That thing escaped, before the fight ended it started to retreat like it was being controlled by someone?&#34; She mumbled. Like she was having her own suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you come here Klaire? You know how dangerous it was for you if they caught you.&#34; She ignored my words and gave me a glass of water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m okay, and if I didn&#39;t arrived in time that thing would have eaten you alive.&#34; I could feel her irritation and anger in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does the others know that you are here?&#34; She stiffen at my question, I guess I was right. She did run away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could even utter another word, the sound coming from the next room made my eyes wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why is he here?&#34; She ignored me and walk to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Meet me outside.&#34; She uttered, I followed her from behind but before I could enter she shut the door in my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seriously?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I listen to their conversation without even trying. But before it ended I decided to do as she said. Grabbing my clothing back to my room. I slip into a pair of old jeans and shirt. I was surprised that I still found some remaining things that I left here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I went outside, it didn&#39;t take long for Klaire to jump off the veranda. Then without saying a word she was standing next to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to go.&#34; I uttered, she didn&#39;t say anything. As we crossed the border she put the guards to sleep again. I wasn&#39;t able to shift to my wolf so we just walk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then something crossed my mind, I stiffen at the thought of him. Should I tell her? But hiding it from her won&#39;t change anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Belerick is alive.&#34;</p>
