                <p>&amp;quot;You know that better than anyone else. Look at what is in front of you!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance at my own reflection; she shows me the markings on my back. It was the same as her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears started streaming down my face as my memories started flooding back to me...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No this isn&#39;t real! It can&#39;t be true!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I close my eyes trying to block her out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You are not real! You are not me! So get out of my head! This isn&#39;t real!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted my face up, I close my eyes tightly not wanting to open them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She whispered again to my ears and my body move on its own. I slowly open my eyes; tears were streaming down my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What is in front of me was me, but the older version... Striking silver-white hair but with red eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m glowing, I have no idea where was this place bat on what I can picture it was a battlefield. Bodies were scattered around, blood is everywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other half I notice the familiar markings; those are from the factions. And on the other side where I or the older me was standing holding a beating heart in my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t even recognize myself, the older me look completely different, she&#39;s expression was blank, and the chilly feeling around me. I can feel her killing intent. The smirk on her face was giving me goosebumps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You&#39;re all gonna die out here.&amp;quot; Her voice was different. It&#39;s like someone was inside me? It was low and creepy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With one look the werewolves who wanted to attack just vanished, blood splashed as they became dust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;That was funny...&amp;quot; I heard she mumbled, and saw she licking the blood in her hands. She already throws the heart away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all froze as they witness what just happened to their colleagues. None of them wanted to move. She tilted her head, she looked bored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;If you won&#39;t fight anymore. I could start doing this-&amp;quot; She vanish and when she reappears she was holding another heart in her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes went wide at who that heart belongs to...it was Noah, or he looks exactly like Noah. Blood gushed out of his mouth. His hand was holding his chest where his missing heart was located</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s when I notice that their faces were familiar, Eliot or the person who looks like Eliot rush to where the lifeless Noah was lying. Yustef and Clint were nowhere to be found...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scan the battlefield trying to find where they are. My hands went to my mouth, eyes wide. Clint was lying on the floor next to where the one who looked like me was standing. His heart is also missing. Then it hit me, the heart that she was holding earlier was from Clint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Amara stop this.&amp;quot; Eliot&#39;s voice was pleading. He was holding Noah&#39;s body in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;But I was just starting.&amp;quot; She mumbled then laughed like everything was just a joke to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance back at the Faction, only a few of them were standing, 10 werewolves in total including Eliot. Yustef was still nowhere to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I don&#39;t wanna fight with you, but I won&#39;t let you kill everyone here.&amp;quot; Eliot slowly let go of Noah&#39;s body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliot&#39;s eyes were glowing and within a minute he shifted to his Wolf, that same white fur gleaming to the moonlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Finally.&amp;quot; She mumbled with excitement. She even claps her hand as she walks slowly to Eliot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliot&#39;s wolf growl at her, you can feel the ground shaking. He slowly marches to her, eyes watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She attacks first but Eliot dodges it smoothly, the impact of her attack on the ground was evident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook off the dust in her hand, glancing at Eliot with a boring look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Oh yeah, I forgot you have a vision.&amp;quot; She uttered, then vanish again. This time she caught Eliot&#39;s neck. His wolf was towering over her but she lifted him like he was nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;But did you forget that those powers belong to me?&amp;quot; She smirks, tightening her grip on his neck. I can hear the bones breaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A loud crash made me flinch, I didn&#39;t see what exactly happened but the next thing I know she crash on the wall across the field. The whole wall crumbled to pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance back at the cause of the loud crash. My heart started beating fast... It was Yusef and Dwayne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dwayne looks exactly as I remember him to be. Blond hair, green-blue eyes glowing. He looks more mature and firmer right now. His chest was showing his Alpha marking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you okay?&amp;quot; Yustef asks Eliot who is gasping for air. Eliot shifted back to his human form after he got out of her grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliot nodded his head while his hands were still on his neck, the bruise was showing. Yusef helps Eliot standstill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Seriously? What a buzz kill.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes snap at her; she was already on her feet like nothing happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Amara, stop this nonsense already!&amp;quot; Dwayne said, his voice was low but wary. I notice his hand was shaking...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;And if I don&#39;t stop? Are you going to kill me, my mate?&amp;quot; Her words were amused, what she just said made me stiff. What the hell was happening?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dwayne didn&#39;t answer instead Yustef shifted and rush forward to attack the older me or Amara. Yustef&#39;s lightning speed made it hard for me to follow his every move. Only the sound of clashing filled the air followed by a loud thud in the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amara was sitting right above Yustef, pinning him down on the ground. Yustef tried to struggle but it was useless? He shifted back to his human form, meaning he was giving up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No! You can&#39;t! I wanted to shout that but my voice won&#39;t come out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m sorry...&amp;quot; Yustef mumbled, then glance at Dwayne&#39;s or Aiden&#39;s location. &amp;quot;NOW!&amp;quot; Yustef shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything happened too fast, Dwayne rush to Amara, and he was holding a sword that I didn&#39;t notice earlier. Yustef made sure that Amara won&#39;t get out of there, he used his body to hug her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;NOOOOO!&amp;quot; Amara started struggling but it was useless, the sword was already buried in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dwayne was closed his eyes as tears streamed down his face. His hands caught Amara&#39;s body. He holds her in his arms as he cries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m sorry...&amp;quot; Dwayne keeps mumbling,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I-I w-will c-come back... We w-will meet a-again,&amp;quot; Amara said struggling to her words. Her eyes turn back to normal just like her hair. She smiles sadly...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t notice that I was crying until I felt the warm water on my cheeks. I clench my chest, I can feel their pain and it was sad and tormenting. Like my soul had been stabbed into pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*** Vision finished ****</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Klaire!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blink a few times trying to adjust my eyes from the light. I was already in my room. And Clint&#39;s face was right next to mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you okay? I heard you shouting.&amp;quot; Clint mumbled worried. Eliot, Yustef, and Noah rush to my room, probably hearing the same thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can feel my heart still beating too fast, I glance at Noah. The image of his heart in my hand made my face pale. I glance at my hands, there&#39;s is no blood in them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was just a dream. Klaire, calm down!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to calm myself but then I saw Amara. She was staring at me with the same smirk on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clint notices my reaction and turns around to see what I&#39;m looking at.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What is it?&amp;quot; He asks worriedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I close my eyes and shake my head. Clint hug me tightly and I did the same. Closing my eyes, feeling his warm body. The image of his lifeless body was buried in my mind. I can&#39;t believe that I did that to him and all those werewolves...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Shhh... Everything will be okay. We are here with you.&amp;quot; Clint whispered. I hold him tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No! You can&#39;t be with me... You can&#39;t!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I saw something, I... I killed everyone and&amp;quot; I wasn&#39;t able to finish my sentence as tears stream down my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can feel Clint&#39;s body stiffen at my words. I pulled away and stare at them in the eyes. Clint wipe my tears away using his thumb... then whisper something and I felt my head become light-headed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It was just a dream...&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the last thing I remember before sleep fully consume me.</p>
