                <p>Dwayne&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight in front of us is like a straight-out of a horror movie. It was gruesome. Dead bodies flying around and the ground was all painted by red blood. I can feel my heart pounding as we approach the scene in front of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where is she? I won&#39;t forgive myself if something happened to her. Then the familiar scent of vanilla caught my nostrils. I can&#39;t be mistaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;She was here.&amp;quot; I announced and started following her scent, as we get further, another familiar scent caught my attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah? I glanced to where her scent came from and found her lying on the ground. She was bleeding. I tried to find something that could use to cover her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Sarah?&amp;quot; I tried to shake her shoulder just to make sure she was awake. Then she weakly opened her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What are you doing here?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked afraid once she opened her eyes then when she noticed that it was me, she started crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;They took me here, a-and she tried to kill me.&amp;quot; She mumbled when her sobbed then lost her conscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So they didn&#39;t just take Klaire, but also took Sarah. I could feel my anger, then a pair of hands tapped my shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We need to find Klaire, I&#39;ll handle Sarah.&amp;quot; It was Noah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded my head and let Noah carry Sarah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed Klaire&#39;s scent once more until we reached the circle like altar. this was the same route when we tried to ran away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ground started shaking and we all fought to keep our balance. I glanced at the direction of the smoke where the explosion came from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;They are destroying their Laboratories.&amp;quot; Yustef mutters, confirming what I was thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we got further to the forest, the crack from the earthquake was getting bigger, and the dead bodice of werewolves were increasing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Klaire&#39;s scent was starting to get stronger and stronger, but something was mixing with it. She wasn&#39;t alone...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hurried my pace until we reached the end of cracks. And there she was staring back at me with a pair of red eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Klaire&amp;quot; I whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was with some unfamiliar faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Galaz.&amp;quot; Clint muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to Clint and he was staring intensely at the guy who was covered with bandage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Hello, Clint.&amp;quot; Galaz answered back in a cheerful way. He may sound like that but I can feel his power radiating around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then just right behind Galaz that same familiar face. He was also staring at me with a smirk in his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Sorry to disturb you that time.&amp;quot; He started snickering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t be mistaken; he was one of the rogues who attacked us. I know I killed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What you killed is actually his clone.&amp;quot; Clint said, answering my question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Bingo! Clint, you are really smart!&amp;quot; He added then started clapping his hand. Like this was some kind of game for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We aren&#39;t the only one who had abilities.&amp;quot; Yustef said, who was also staring at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We want to have a chat with you all, but we need to go. The island will soon sink.&amp;quot; Galaz said then turned his back on us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Wait Klaire!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stopped then turn her head towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes were starting to glow. A pair of red eyes were staring back at me like the color of my surroundings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel myself being pull with her stare. Like I was losing control over myself, Feeling my wolf cowering at the back of my head. My wolf was starting to feel uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clint was slowly making his way towards her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Klaire.&amp;quot; As soon as Clint said her name, he went flying, landing on a tree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;My name is not Klaire.&amp;quot; She sounded different. She then turned her gaze at our direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You all know who I am.&amp;quot; Her words were direct to us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Amara...&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her grinned widely as soon as she heard that name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I will not kill you all right now because of my memories as Klaire, but if you try to stop me again. And I will make sure that you will all die.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I suddenly felt a huge pressure in my chest, making my knees felt weak like all my strength vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at Yustef who was also on his knees right now. I tried to stand but the pressure that she was putting on us was not making it easy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Klaire...&amp;quot; I whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;My name is not Klaire!&amp;quot; She shouted then I felt my body unable to move and I fell completely on the floor. I couldn&#39;t even lift my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You don&#39;t deserve to call me with that name!&amp;quot; Her words were directed to me. And I exactly knew why...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m sorry...&amp;quot; It&#39;s all I could say right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We need to go.&amp;quot; Someone said to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was not sure who it was but I didn&#39;t like the idea of her leaving with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Don&#39;t go!&amp;quot; I shouted as I found my strength to slowly support my body. My wolf was starting to step out of the shadow, letting me borrow his strength until I could stand to my feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Don&#39;t go, please...&amp;quot; My eyes were locked into hers and she was just staring back at me with hatred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Too late for that.&amp;quot; She whispered then turned her back on us and started walking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And it&#39;s the 3rd time, I lost her again...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We need to go!&amp;quot; Noah appear. I didn&#39;t notice but Clint was nowhere to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;The island is about to sink now. hurry!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ground was starting to crumbles. I glanced back to where she vanished before I shifted to my wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed Noah and Yustef was right behind us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Where Clint?&amp;quot; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced back and still found no sign of Clint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Hurry, we have to get to the boat now.&amp;quot; I could feel the intense shaking of the ground as we kept running.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as we reached the coast we rushed to where the boat was located. Sarah was already there sleeping when we got in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I left her here once I notice the sound of cracks penetrating under the earth is getting louder. I have no idea what kind of explosive device did they used that resulted for an island to split into two.&amp;quot; Noah mumbled when he noticed me staring at Sarah. He somehow sounded annoyed at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kinda have the idea why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Look Mulac.&amp;quot; That slip my mouth all of a sudden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;So you do remember everything.&amp;quot; Noah said while crossing his arms. &amp;quot;But it doesn&#39;t mean I forgot everything you&#39;ve done to Klaire.&amp;quot; Noah added then walked to the other end of the boat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew that already because I would never forget what I&#39;d done to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all remained silent on our way back to the pack. No one dared to talk about what happened today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel the chill in my blood just by thinking about it, coldness bringing the synapses of my brain to a standstill but most part of it is pain, pain of losing Klaire again, yet I don&#39;t know how much can I still endure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It feels like someone blew a hole in my heart with an ice-cold magnum. The pain is dull as if some lazy torturer is standing right behind me stabbing me over and over again. The strikes radiate pain in a way that shatters my soul or at least that is how it feels like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rain started pouring like the sky is crying for me. I close my eyes, letting the rain wash away the pain. Hoping that once I open my eyes all these feelings are gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then a pair of red eyes hunted me as soon as I close my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those same old eyes...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Vision***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a whole 2 years, before we woke up. As I opened my eyes I noticed the drastic change inside me. I stared at myself at the mirror. I still looked like the same kid I used to be but I also looked different at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Now come with us.&amp;quot; They all took us into different rooms. I glanced at the other trying to look for Amara but she was nowhere to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They started doing different kinds of test. And when they were done they took us into another empty room with five beds in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kariz was also nowhere to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A loud noise woke me up that night. A turned to look at the direction of the noise and it was coming from the outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others also woke up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What was that?&amp;quot; Mulac asked, still feeling sleepy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Someone set the fire.&amp;quot; Aris mumbled. We all stared at him unsure, we didn&#39;t see any smoke or smelled one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then the door suddenly opened. Followed by the loud explosion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Let&#39;s go!&amp;quot; Afreo broke the silent and we all started running outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Wait, we need to look for Amara and Kariz!&amp;quot; I mumbled. The smoke was starting to cloud our vision. &amp;quot;I&#39;ll look for Amara and you can find Kariz.&amp;quot; I didn&#39;t wait for them to answer and started running to the other direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart was pounding when I noticed blood running down the hallway, then noticed someone. Amara was covered with blood...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Amara?&amp;quot; I called, unsure if that was really her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned her head and stared at me with those red eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Vision end***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I open my eyes and watch the island trembled down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What on earth happened to you in those 2 years...</p>
