                <p>My tears started to stream down my face, I couldn&#39;t believe what I just saw. All this time it was all me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you see it now Amara?&#34; Kariz was back to his normal state, and I nodded my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled me into his arms, stroking my hair as he tried to comfort me. How could I not remember it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amara, I know it was hard because even I myself didn&#39;t believe it at first.&#34; He whispered in my ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know if I feel any better because of it. I glance up to where Noah is and he was just staring at me with a sad look on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since when did you found out everything?&#34; I mumble, I wasn&#39;t sure who am I directing that question is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zion already left, because he was kind of injured and Kariz told him to go see Ria. Yustef barge in with Eliot they probably heard what happened from Zion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was during the second war, the time where I almost died in your hands. That is where I successfully shifted into my Lycan. And that was also the reason why I got our of Belerick&#39;s control.&#34; He mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And about the Royalties, only Clint was aware that you are able to shift into a Lycan. He saw you one day that you suddenly shifted. He told me about it when we met in the Island. That is also the reason why he agreed to do this in my terms.&#34; He added, my eyes went wide. Again Clint? I wonder when was time time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amara, you are the one who could unsealed the Lycans. The awakening that we are planning on doing to you was letting you have control on your Lycan, be connected to it.&#34; He said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you do it?&#34; I couldn&#39;t stop myself but be curious on his own methods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To be honest I don&#39;t know, but one thing I&#39;m sure off. It was connected to our mates. The Lycan was only able to be subdue by the Lycan. Which means only the mates can kill or help you.&#34; I stared at him still confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you mean your mate helped you?&#34; He nodded his head. His mate?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then where is she?&#34; I ask, his gaze avoided mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She tried to kill me once, she was an Hunter, but unlike a normal human she was a half blood vampire.&#34; He uttered, which made it more understandable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then how are you able to control you Lycan if she wasn&#39;t with you.&#34; I mumbled, not wanting to ask about their encounter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was able to gain control through the years, but it wasn&#39;t stable. I couldn&#39;t keep myself to shift as a Lycan and not hurt the people around me.&#34; He explains, which reminded me of the times that I always go back with blood or muds in my feet. Did I hurt anyone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The worried look was written all over my face. I couldn&#39;t hide my own emotions right now because of shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did not hurt anyone Klaire, we assure you and Clint did say that in the other hand you protected us.&#34; Yustef said, I glance at him still unsure what should I feel about all the information right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you all please leave, I want to think alone.&#34; I uttered, Kariz and the others didn&#39;t say anything and walk outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If everything Kariz said was true then it only means that I will still need Clint but right now Clint was caught because of me. I glance up it was still full moon, Kariz did say that the full moon had an effect with our Lycan but because he was able to train me and let me awaken some of my abilities, I was able to subdue my Lycan for the mean time. He was awakening my abilities that came from the Moon Goddess in order to overpower my Lycan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then there was him, if I want to get my full control like what Kariz said, I would need him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Am I ready to see him again? After everything that happened am I ready to be chased back?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But first I need to do something about Clint, but right now is not the right time. Kariz said that Lycans are most powerful during the full moon just like the werewolves. But the I didn&#39;t shift at all, and the last time I did was in the broad daylight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It doesn&#39;t make sense because right now is the right time for me to shift but I couldn&#39;t even feel my power at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closing my eyes, I need to remember something, any details that might help me to answer why I suddenly shifted to my Lycan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did remember dreaming of running into the darkness where I couldn&#39;t see where I was going. But then a voice called me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That voice! I just followed it until a bit of light shines upon it, I followed the light then the voice was starting to become louder and louder. It was calling for my name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when I opened my eyes I was on that spot of the cliff then, ended up in the East Mansion. Feeling dizzy I fell completely asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then I did remember hearing noises from downstairs, I wanted to go see what was it but I felt my whole body was drained, like I don&#39;t have any strength left in my body. Whoever it was I couldn&#39;t possibly defend myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The footsteps was starting to get closer to this room, followed by the sound of door opening. The scent of winter and mint, welcomes me. Feeling myself inhaling it and felt that my strength was somehow returning. He started walking closer to me, I was telling myself to move and get out of here but it was like my body had a mind on its own and just remained in that same position, my eyelids was still close. I want to open them and stare at the person who was in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This familiar feeling of longing was starting to creep out again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was preparing myself from getting hit, but what hits my skin is the soft cloth, covering my whole body, that lay on my shoulders and down to my ankle. He was muttering something to himself but I couldn&#39;t hear the words quite clearly. My body still feels weak but unlike before I was able to feel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then some noises came from downstairs again. Followed by the voice of a woman. Calling for him. I couldn&#39;t hear his name clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;DWAYNE!&#34; my eyes shut open, the same time he run downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fck!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lay in my bed still couldn&#39;t believe what I just did, it was him! All this time it was him who is calling for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know but I suddenly feel afraid, that woman that I heard was Sarah. I am sure about that and why are they together? And did he saw my face? Or saw me in that state of my Lycan? Questions keep running in my head and I could feel my heart hammering in my chest, like any minute now it will jump off it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood up, I couldn&#39;t even sleep after everything that happened. The information that I just heard and remember right now was overflowing like a river flows during the storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance at the window then back to my room, was Clint even alive right now? And Zion did say that Dwayne was like a different person. And that time he was like mumbling to himself. And he was acting like he doesn&#39;t remember me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shit! I brush my hair out of frustrations. What the hell is happening! I started throwing my pillows on the wall, trying to let out this frustrating feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know that those pillows would fight against you right? And they didn&#39;t do anything wrong to you.&#34; I glared at Galaz who entered in my window. He was still wounded but unlike before he was able to move freely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up and get out of my room!&#34; He just laughed at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Woah! Someone is feisty, look remember you owe me one. I never said anything about your unknown whereabouts last time.&#34; So he did keep his word? I look at him with confused look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you couldn&#39;t hide anything to Kariz?&#34; He sat down to my bed while I pick all my pillows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, but I could still keep some informations you know.&#34; He then wink at me. I threw the pillows that I gathered at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I went to the North.&#34; I mumbled, he then stared at me with wide eyes open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you crazy? How could you do that?!&#34; He said, now he was acting like the crazy one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat next to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t intend to, I was even surprised about it myself. Because I couldn&#39;t remember everything not until today.&#34; I muttered and he remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you saw him?&#34; Hearing him say that made me feel like there is a large lump in my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
