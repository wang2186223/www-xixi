SO SHUT THE FUCK UP AND LEAVE ME ALONE!&amp;quot; I feel betrayed, heartbroken, tired and most of all afraid of everything that might happen is I gave in to his affection.</p>

                <p>I can feel the gaze of everyone, they probably heard everything. I didn&#39;t bother to look at them and just run as fast as I can away from there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I even heard Clint cursing as I run further to the forest. When I finally have no energy to run I let myself stumbled on the ground. For the second time I found myself again on the ground. I let myself sink between my knees, hugging myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A huge brown wolf jump from my behind, making me flinch. I glance at it and it was a female. I stand as soon as I notice that she was snarling at me. Is she also here to take me? She shifted back to her human form. She stared at her brown eyes flickering her anger and remorse?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave me a smile, but I&#39;m sure it was not a friendly one. She glanced at me from head to toe, she frowned as if she was thinking of something unpleasant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You better leave him alone.&amp;quot; She mutters, her voice indicating possessiveness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look at her slightly confused and then it hit me. That&#39;s why she looks familiar. It was her, the girl kissed Dwayne!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to shout at her and tell her that she has no right to say that to me. But what happened earlier flashback on my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You should know he promised to not take anyone as his Luna not even his mate if it was not me.&amp;quot; She circled around me while giggling to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remember what he said back then &amp;quot;I don&#39;t need a weakling human as my mate.&amp;quot; I bit my lower lip stopping myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;He always reminded me every night while we sleep together that I will always be his only Luna.&amp;quot; She was mutter giving emphasis in every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An image of him in the same bed with her made my stomach crunch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You will never be his Luna!&amp;quot; She smirks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;But you will still never be his rightful Luna.&amp;quot; I mutter giving her a triumphant smile. I know everything she was saying was true but something inside me wanted to hurt her and remind her of her place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile fades as soon as I say those words. She looked really pissed, her eyes started turning black.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned my back at her, and started walking away from her. I don&#39;t wanna do something that I might regret later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she wouldn&#39;t let me, she pulled my arm hard and yanked me to the ground, my right arm hit a huge stone that I didn&#39;t notice was there. I&#39;ll end up getting more bruises later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look at her blankly, she looks pleased at my current state all the things she said keeps echoing in my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t reject me because I was human, that realization made me lost it. All the emotions that I tried to gain control took a hold of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling my body feels lighter. I close my eyes liking the feeling of letting everything out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wind started to blow stronger. Making it hard for her to see, she closed her eyes and put her hand over her eyes blocking the wind, keeping a small distance enough for her to see a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What the hell is happening!&amp;quot; She shouted still unable to see anything through the wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wind whirled around us, she started to have a hard time breathing as the oxygen decreases around us. I know I should stop but something inside me is actually satisfied on what I was seeing. Her naked body started to tremble as she gasped for air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;H-he-lp.&amp;quot; Tears streaming down her face. Her cheeks turning red as it became harder for her to breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An image of Clint running in the distance stop me. He stops a few feet away from, hands covering his eyes as he took small steps closer to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Klaire that&#39;s enough.&amp;quot; I stared at him blankly not liking the idea that he was stopping me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Don&#39;t stop me Clint.&amp;quot; I stared back at her, she was about to lose her consciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Klaire, enough!&amp;quot; I didn&#39;t notice that he already gotten close to me. He pulled into his embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;That&#39;s enough, sister&amp;quot; he whispered between my ears. I snap out of it letting myself melts in his warmth. My eyes started to water again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slip out of his arms, I keep my eyes on the ground embarrassed of my sudden outburst. Good thing no one followed him, he walks to the direction of her, who is now unconscious. He took his jacket off and cover her with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You go back to the mansion, I&#39;ll handle this and wait for me there.&amp;quot; I open my mouth trying to mutter something but close it again because I have nothing to say at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed his instructions and started making my way to the East Mansion. The walk back there is cold and dark? I feel like something inside me is starting to eat me up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I recall how satisfied I felt seeing her suffer. And wanting to see bleed to death. I shake my head at that thought. Not liking the idea in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as I got in I went straight to the bathroom. I look at myself in the mirror, my eyes are blood shot red from crying my eyes out. Letting out a deep breath I need to get myself together. And this time there is no backing out! I won&#39;t be sway by him again. Not anymore. I smile bitterly and blink my tears away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning Clint knock on my door. I open the door still sleepy. I somewhat feel so tired, and this is the first time that this happen again after a very long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Good morning sleepy head!&amp;quot; He patted my head, I glare at him. My hair is already a mess and now he was even messing with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You okay?&amp;quot; After he notice that I feel a little gloomy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yes, I just feel tired.&amp;quot; I mutter walking to the bathroom to get myself ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Klaire, we have to go.&amp;quot; Clint called, and again I took a deep breath trying to get myself into place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;They are here.&amp;quot; He announced, knowing what he was talking about. My eyes went wide,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know he already told me that they will arrive sooner but he did never mention anything that the sooner he was talking about actually today!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me??&amp;quot; I ask still shocked. I pick another hoodie just lying around my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remains silent, of course! After what happened yesterday especially the part where I almost killed someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;They were done earlier than expected.&amp;quot; He mutters trying to hide the obvious fact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He probably notices my face; He squeeze me into a tight hug</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Everything is going to be okay.&amp;quot; He muttered, which made me believe that everything is going to be alright... I hope so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We walk ourselves back to the main house, I followed on his behind hiding myself from those piercing eyes. I could even hear them whispering that now their real Luna is back, I don&#39;t really stand a chance anymore. I tightened my fist stopping myself from bursting again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just hope I don&#39;t run into them for who knows what might happen if I couldn&#39;t control myself. Clint didn&#39;t say anything about what happened yesterday after I left. He probably doesn&#39;t wanna talk about it also. Making me even more guilty that he has to handle everything for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My thoughts get a hold on me making me that I didn&#39;t even notice the large wall in front of me. Or so I thought</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I almost lost my balance but the large wall caught me before I even stumbled on the ground. I blink twice trying to make sure my eyes aren&#39;t playing with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile automatically forms on his lips as I stare at the familiar person who helped me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Eliot?&amp;quot;</p>
