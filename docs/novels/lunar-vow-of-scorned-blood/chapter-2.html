                <p>I was walking around the campus waiting for Clint to finish whatever business he had around here. And as expected the students keep staring at me because I was distinct from them. I pulled my hood over my head to hide my face just to avoid their piercing gaze. But none of it works because they could smell me even if I was across the field.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the students even tried to dump his drink on me but I was fast enough to avoid it which resulted in getting his shirt soaked with orange liquid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Now look what you&#39;ve done!&amp;quot; he exclaimed. Now we were getting some attention, the students started crowding at us and I do not like it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Sorry,&amp;quot; I mutter. I just have to escape here as soon as possible. A larger frame is blocking my way, looking at his pissed face makes me even want to get out of here faster. He involves in that orange juice guy&#39;s friends. He was around 6 feet tall or taller than that, towering my 5&#39;7 height.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Getting somewhere?&amp;quot; he mumbled, I didn&#39;t answer instead I turn my back on him, keeping my head down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keep calm... keep calm...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was trying to calm myself by keeping my breathing in check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you deaf?!&amp;quot; He pulled my right arm harshly making me gasp in pain. He was a werewolf so his strength is far from a normal human being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some of the students around us are enjoying the show, while others are too afraid to become involved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Let go of my arm,&amp;quot; I whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Did you catch her? She&#39;s trying to give me a command.&amp;quot; He and his friends started laughing and the crowd followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What are you gonna do about it?&amp;quot; He pulled my hood down exposing my bare face. His eyes are glimmering with malice, and that triumphant smile makes me wanna throw up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression soon turns more wickedly as he examines my face. Making me disgusted just by being near him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You were really pretty. Maybe I can let you be more useful.&amp;quot; He was trying to touch my face but I slap his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Don&#39;t,&amp;quot; I warned. This time I stared him in the eyes. He was taken aback by my sudden reaction making him lose his balance. But I know too well why...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all look surprised about what happened. This is my cue... I pulled my hood back and escape to the crowd who is now too busy asking what just happened. I even heard someone cursing before I escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I get out of the door an alluring scent of mint and winter welcomes me. I tried to find where the source of that scent from the crowd. And there I found him leaning on his car with his blue-green eyes staring back at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like time stopped and it was just the two of us here his gaze is piercing my soul making my whole body shiver. It was like I was being pulled into an unknown black hole and I cannot escape from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes grow wide when all the realization of what is happening hits me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mate. That thought felt so strange in my head but I don&#39;t dislike it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watch him march in my direction and I suddenly feel a lump in my throat. This is just not me! How can someone look perfect without even doing anything? His blond hair gleams as the sunlight hits it. Showing a golden silhouette. My thoughts stop as he stops walking. I heard him growl. His expressive eyes turn cold and I don&#39;t like the idea that is popping in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Come with me,&amp;quot; he said coldly not letting me even mutter a single word. I stared at him confusedly... I can touch my heart beating so fast. I silently followed him not minding the piercing gaze of the student who wondering what is happening which is I do not even know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was following and he was going in the direction behind the school. Maybe he just wanted to talk privately? Nevertheless, my guts are telling me there is something more to what is about to happen here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stops when we are completely alone far enough from the ears of the other werewolves. He turned around to face me and that coldness in his eyes is telling me this was not the kind of thing that I was expecting. And I was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood still as I watched him blow everything in my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I Dwayne Carter rejects you human as my mate. I don&#39;t need a weakling human to be my mate.&amp;quot; His voice kept echoing in my mind as I felt a thousand knives stab me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When everything registered in my mind, anger boiled out of my system as I tried to keep myself calm down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breath... You need to calm down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gazed back at his eyes and my eyes grow wide when I felt his wolf surfacing as his blue-green eyes started to turn black. I let myself touch his arms to tame the beast inside him. Sparks of pleasure flowed in my entire body as I felt his skin into mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Calm down,&amp;quot; I whisper, not so sure if I was saying it to him or myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took my hand off once I felt his body relax.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look away from his gorgeous face as I felt the excitement and pleasure urging inside me not wanting to make a fool of myself. As his voice echoes in my head reminding me that he doesn&#39;t want me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I Dwayne Carter Reject you human as my mate. I don&#39;t need a weakling human to be my mate&amp;quot; his words echo in my head. My anger surfaced is once more the hint of sadness and pain collided, I open my mouth to say something but what he did next catch me off guard his lips claimed mine. I can feel a thousand sparks running to my whole body and it felt so right Like this is what we were meant to do, to be together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can taste the strong mint in his mouth as he kisses me. He bit my lower lip for entrance and I found myself hesitating. This is wrong! He rejected you! Was all I can hear in my head but my body had its mind and found myself letting him. A moan escapes from my mouth as his tongue slides inside my mouth tasting and devouring me. I trail my hands in his blonde hair while his hands travel on the hem of my shirt his kiss deepens as I heard him groan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes shot open when I felt his canines. And found my strength to push him away despite the excitement and pleasure of lust I am feeling right now. I wiped my lips harshly as I gazed at him with confusion but soon turn into a complete hatred. How dare he even tried to mark me when he just rejected me!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;W-what do you think you&#39;re doing!&amp;quot; I manage to say while catching my breath. He was just looking at me in the eye I saw the same pain, sadness, and just reflecting mine as he rejected me. Nonetheless, I flipped the thought away. HE REJECTED YOU!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watch him turn stiff as I utter the words that he doesn&#39;t seem to expect to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I accept your rejection...&amp;quot; I turned my back at him before I fully let myself break in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears were streaming down my face but I wiped them off just like how I will wipe him off my system.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stupid Mate Bond!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A groan escaped from my mouth as I let my hand brush my hair out of frustration. I didn&#39;t know that finding my mate will turn out like this. I smile bitterly as I recall what he called me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I don&#39;t need weakling human as my mate.&amp;quot; His words are like stabbed in my soul tearing it apart like a piece of paper. I didn&#39;t notice that I was using my ability until someone snaps me out of my building rage of anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Something happened little sis?&amp;quot; I watch as Clint stared at me with the curiosity of my sudden rage. How I loved to stare at his eyes who have the same color as mine except for his is dominated by gray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I found him.&amp;quot; I tried to mutter. He remains silent wanting me to continue. &amp;quot;And he rejected me.&amp;quot; The last statement turned out to be a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His silver-white wolf surface. He looks into my eyes with full anger but turns to sympathy, I brushed it off by touching his soft fur. His outraged I can feel because he was my better half.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Calm down my twin brother&amp;quot; I whispered, his eyes soon turning softly as he shifted back to his human form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cupped my cheeks gently with both of his hands and I found myself feeling safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I will make sure he will regret what he did to you.&amp;quot; I chuckle at my protective brother but soon tears started streaming into my eyes again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You need to let it go by Klaire. I can feel it...&amp;quot; He whispered in my ears, he touched my now silver-white hair with his hand and kissed me on my forehead. My mouth twitches into a weak smile trying to blink away my tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Let it go.&amp;quot; He assured me. Letting my hand goes. I took a step away from him letting myself sink into the unknown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blue-green eyes haunt me as I close my eyes. Everything went black as I felt my rage fully take over.</p>
