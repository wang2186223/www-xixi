                <p>A few hours age.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wake, feeling warm. I&#39;m wrapped around a naked Dwayne. Even though he&#39;s fast asleep, he&#39;s holding me close. My mouth curls into a smile as I watch him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soft morning light will soon arise. I lay my head back on his chest, my leg still tangled with his, my arm across his stomach. Feeling every moment that I&#39;m with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything still feels like a dream, I let myself forget all my worries and let him embrace me. But just like a dream, I have to wake up soon...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raise my head slightly, slowly lifting his arms to get out of his grip. I was slightly scared that I might wake him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I finally got out, I look for my nightgown and it was sitting just around the corner. I slip to it; it was slightly ruined. I flush at the thought of what happened...if things weren&#39;t as complicated as before we could stay like this forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bite my lower lip to contain myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stayed for a few more precious moments. I lean over and tenderly kiss his lips. I tentatively stroked his face, running my fingertips through the smattering of hair, he didn&#39;t stir. I smile again at how peaceful he looks while he sleeps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Goodbye...&amp;quot; I whispered and kissed him again, whipping my tears away from my cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance back at him once again for the last time and started heading back to the East Mansion. I wipe my tears away, determine that this would be my last farewell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dwayne&#39;s words leave a tingling pain inside me. The thought of him telling the truth leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, but I dismiss it and try to keep my mind as numb and as blank as possible. I can&#39;t think about him... Not anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clint was waiting for me at the entrance of the Mansion. He was a little surprised at how I looked but decided not to say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;ll go to my room,&amp;quot; I mutter not waiting for his reply I went straight to my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I open the door to the bathroom and started taking a shower. I stand and stare blankly at the brick wall letting the water wash away his scent from my body. I am numb, I feel nothing but the pain. How long must I endure this? I wrapped my hands around my body hug myself while sobbing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stay in the shower for a while until I calm down, I pulled the red dress in my closet. It was hugging my figure as I slip on it. It was tight but not too tight that my figure will go showing off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any minute now I know Dwayne would be here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sun started rising, making me feel more uneasy. My heart is beating too fast. I don&#39;t want to start crying again not when I wanted to really end everything between us. Our bond should end a month ago. I know I will break even further and I have nothing left to break.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This cycle of chasing should stop...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I flinch as soon as I notice Dwayne&#39;s burning gaze at my back. That tingling feeling is there again. I slowly turn around, his eyes burning my gaze, his lost look, his hair burnished and bright... all haunt me slowly like his prey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Why didn&#39;t you woke me?&amp;quot; His tone is so warm and welcoming it&#39;s almost enough to push me over the edge again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I inhale sharply, not wanting to end up hesitating again. I look straight into his eyes; I must be strong...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Forget what happened, because this will be the last&amp;quot; I mutter, my gaze blank and cold like my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; His voice is low and confused worried at the same time. His tortured expression made my knees weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You don&#39;t mean that r-right?&amp;quot; His voice crack, I didn&#39;t answer him. His expression worsens. He mumbled something underneath his breath, looking at him is too painful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look away, trying to stop my tears. I need to be strong, I reminded myself again. He steps closer to me but I flinch, he stops mid-way. He looked like he was in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His shoulder slumped as he gave up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;If that is what you wish...&amp;quot; His voice was slow and weak. He glances one more time at me hoping for me to stop him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I averted my gaze avoiding his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slowly turns his back on me and jumps off my balcony as he shifts back to his wolf. He never glances back as he continues to run further away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slump on the floor, all my strength collapse. I wrap my arms around my body, hugging myself tightly, trying to hold myself together. I cry, crying all the pain away. I smile bitterly how the last remaining good memory I have with him will be last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You made a deal with yourself, Klaire... I reminded myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clint knock on my door he probably heard me crying. He opened the door and found me on the floor crying my eyes out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Klaire...&amp;quot; He mumbled as he saw my situation. He kneeled down leveling me, hugging me tightly into his arms. I cried again like my tears wouldn&#39;t end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We remain silent the whole time only my sobs fill the room. He was stroking my hair as I sob in his chest. He knew this would happen sooner or later. Especially if we will reveal my identity...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clint lifted me up and carried me in his arms. As we reach my bed he slowly lay me down on the bed. He sat on my bed next to me. He holds my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We have already discussed this, the danger that would affect Dwayne and his pack that he will soon lead if I decided to stay with him. And that is what I couldn&#39;t afford to do it again, I can&#39;t be selfish and not think about the pack members that might suffer because of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m sorry that you have to go through this.&amp;quot; He mutters apologetically, I squeeze his hands and shake my head at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But deep down I know it was my fault. If only I was born like a normal human or werewolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cry myself to sleep that night, wishing I hadn&#39;t walked out and said those words to Dwayne, wishing that I could be different, wishing that we were together. How long will this hideous overwhelming feeling last?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lost count of the days that I missed, the whole time all I did was stay in my room developing a cycle of wake, cry, sleep. Well, try to sleep. I can&#39;t even escape Dwayne in my dreams. Green-blue burning eyes gazing down at me, his lost tortured look, his hair burnished and bright blonde all haunt me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The treaty had already been done during my absence, Noah, Yustef, and Eliot were dealing with the traitor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They caught someone watching us last night and once they caught him, he killed himself. His identity was unknown, as the four Alpha&#39;s checked his identity, he belongs to none of the four fractions. Indicating he was a rogue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We still don&#39;t know who gave them access to get inside as the old passage in the Cliff was heavily guarded. Noah was even the one handling that matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yustef remain to surveillance the ship but he found nothing again. The shipment remains on products and materials that will be used during the succession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was even pissed when he confronted the Alpha of the White Moon when he saw him lurking around the ship. And again he found nothing only some bunch of flowers. After that incident a fight broke down, making the faction not trust us more. Making the treaty almost fail but they handle it well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The White Moon Alpha just let it slide, they are known for their harmonious living anyway. But we know better, their cunning attitude making them dangerous. The way they look harmless is what makes them more dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliot was the one handling the investigation over the higher-ups, he was busy watching the next Alpha&#39;s and their members. The next Alpha&#39;s of Golden Arid and White Moon already arrived for the succession. I haven&#39;t met them but Eliot said to be wary at them all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a sigh, they are all busy while here I am all I did was lock myself in my room and cry. I don&#39;t even talk much to them; I haven&#39;t spoken about what happened but they already have the idea. I don&#39;t have the capacity for idle talk right now. I am surviving on a newfound tolerance for pain and heartbreak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The succession will be tomorrow and I have no choice but to attend. The day that I fear the most will come. Can I see Dwayne again? Could I bear it? Do I want to see him? I close my eyes and tilt my head back as grief and longing lance through me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance at the white long lace dress, with a hint of golden traces on the bottom part of the dress. It was hanging next to the glass box where my crown is resting...</p>
