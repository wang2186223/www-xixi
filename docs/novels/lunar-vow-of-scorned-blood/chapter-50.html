                <p>Clint&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we arrived it was already too late, the whole place was a mess. Burning buildings and lifeless bodies scattered around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can sense that Dwayne already knew something about the past, I&#39;ll ask him later about it. I tried to hide the fact that he was one of us when I heard that he rejected her. But right now she was more important than my anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day where she also went missing came flooding in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Flashback***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Clint let&#39;s go!&amp;quot; She said with full of excitement. I climbed down the stairs and followed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I promised her that I would spend the day with her because I was too busy with my training.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once we reached the wall, she held my hand. We both looked for the small cracks that only me and the 3 others know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Shhhh... We usually used this whenever we want to go outside.&amp;quot; She looked amazed at that time. She started clapping her hands and giggling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Okay.&amp;quot; Her small hands closed her mouth. My sister is adorable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We crawled to the hole and the forest welcomes us. It was her first time going outside, she was always locked up inside because she has a weak body. She was born human.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled as I watched her running around. She was picking wildflowers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;This is so beautiful Brother! I have never seen such beautiful flowers.&amp;quot; She mumbled. I sat at the tree and watch her play. I also played with her until dawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We need to go back; they will notice we were gone if we won&#39;t get back before dinner.&amp;quot; She pouted at first but nodded her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I knew that was the last day of her peaceful life, I would have just spent the whole night outside the walls with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That same night we were attacked by rouges, we had no idea how they got inside but we are outnumbered. And they are stronger than a normal rouge. Those piercing red eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Clint get your sister!&amp;quot; Our father called from a distance as he was fighting a huge black rogue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran upstairs but I was too late already. Klaire was nowhere to be found. I went looking for her in every corner of her room but found nothing only traces of blood were left behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Where is she?&amp;quot; I didn&#39;t notice my father&#39;s arrival I just stood there and shake my head as tears streamed down my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;She&#39;s gone,&amp;quot; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our Father did everything to find her and when we did it took us 2 years. But when we found her she was already different, too different... silver-white hair with a pair of red and golden eyes stared back at us. As she kills anyone that crosses her sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were already too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our father tried to stop her but she was too powerful. She looked like she was a completely different person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Klaire stop please.&amp;quot; My father pleaded then turn in my direction. &amp;quot;Get away from here Clint.&amp;quot; He ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know what to do at that time and I just stood there frozen, unable to even move my own body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And everything happens fast within my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked in her direction not even shifting to his wolf. He will die if he won&#39;t shift. I wanted to shout and ran in his direction but no voice came out to my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;My baby please come back to us.&amp;quot; He stopped when he was right in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m not your daughter.&amp;quot; She mumbled coldly the way she smiled is making me shiver. &amp;quot;It&#39;s been a while... You must be the son of Aris. You look like your father.&amp;quot; She said while scanning our father from head to toe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Give me back my daughter Amara.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have no idea what they are talking about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;ll give her back but you will know we will be awakened again.&amp;quot; She mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My father didn&#39;t say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Just give her back please.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled and turn her head in my direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Don&#39;t you dare do something to him!&amp;quot; He warned, making her smile grow bigger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a blink of an eye, she was gone from where she was standing earlier. Before I know it she was already standing in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything happened too fast, the next thing I know my Father was standing in front of me with a hole in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Such a bummer.&amp;quot; She mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was unable to move; I watch as my father&#39;s body fall on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turns to me and I can feel my whole body trembling. She pats my head like I usually do to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;ll see you soon Afreo...&amp;quot; She whispered and then fell unconscious with my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that day I found out that she doesn&#39;t remember anything at all. And I kept it that way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after that, I started remembering everything when I was Afreo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, they started as nightmares, then as time goes by everything started to make sense. Then one-day Yustef, Eliot, and Noah all the three of them started remembering. It was around their first shift when they came running to me and telling me about what they have just seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I told them everything they saw in their heads were all real. They didn&#39;t believe it at first but when they saw Klaire everything came back to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Klaire knows nothing about her real identity, but then her fear started coming. She told us everything about what is happening during the years she was taken. She told us about the blood they took from her and there was a body. She can&#39;t remember the details but she was afraid about what she only knew so far. I wanted her to forget everything but it was useless she always surpasses my power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day where I saw her use her power again made me realize that the same thing might happen again. And the fact that her captors knew something about her is another serious matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I monitored her during that time when her rage started, we started training her to control it. At first, I was afraid that she might end up losing control but as time goes by she started to learn to control her power. But then one day something happened she met Dwayne, and when she told me about him... I already knew Aiden was back. He was her mate after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything is starting to happen again...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Flashback end***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Clint are you okay?&amp;quot; I was brought back to reality when Yustef nudge my arm. I glance at him then back in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scene was familiar. I look around to look for any sign of Klaire, she was nowhere to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The same thing happened during the second war. After we got out of the facility we all stuck together, we build the Central Kingdom. She became our Alpha during that time, we still have no idea how it happened but another war broke down. This time Kariz was the one who is leading the rebellion after he went missing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, we have no idea where he was, we thought he was dead due to the report before that they found his body floating in the cliff. Until we saw him killing everyone that belong to the Factions. That gave us no choice but to fight him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kariz was the only one who didn&#39;t shift after receiving Klaire&#39;s blood but he was completely overpowering us during that war. Just like before he remained human but his abilities somehow look like Amara at that time. I&#39;m not sure if it was just my imagination but it felt exactly like hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That war causes us everything, especially her. It happened so quickly that she lost control of her power, and she started killing everyone that came across her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all sacrificed ourselves just to stop her that time, and that was when everything ended or so we thought...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Clint over here!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I snap out of my thoughts and followed them, what I saw was nothing to what I anticipated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was more gruesome than what we saw earlier, the place was nothing like a blood bath. Bodies were lying around and they weren&#39;t just killed normally, their whole body was torn into pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What happened here?&amp;quot; Noah mumbled to himself as he took in everything he was seeing. This was worse than before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You think it was her doing?&amp;quot; Yustef ask, not wanting to believe everything he was seeing. The smell of dead werewolves was in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;She was here...&amp;quot; Dwayne uttered, then started walking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We followed him from behind. You can see all the remains of the werewolves around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I can smell her scent, she was close.&amp;quot; He announced then started running faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We also did the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We are heading on the further part of the forest the same way where we tried to escape before there was a huge crack on the ground that split the ground into two. He stops once we reach the far end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And there she was...</p>
