                <p>The next day I entered the office and found my father looking like he was looking for something. He was even surprised when he notice me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you looking for?&#34; He stared at me with complete horror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They got the book.&#34; He uttered, I don&#39;t know what he was talking about but then the sudden event of last time came to mind. Clint did gave something to Zion before he left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was just a book.&#34; I mumbled, he started shaking his head like I just said something that I shouldn&#39;t have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That book was a map.&#34; I stared at him still confused but then he decided to tell me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have a sit first, this is something that I wouldn&#39;t wish to tell you but you have to know.&#34; I didn&#39;t say anything, because it feels like it was something serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That book was from an oracle, she was a woman from the protectors of the Lycans blood. I met her before I met your mother. And she gave me that book telling me that it was map towards the location of the fountain of blood. It was the only way to locate the whereabouts of the Lycans.&#34; I just stared at him completely lost at his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you saying that Lycans are still here? Is that the reason why the Rogues attacked us?&#34; He nodded his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The rogues and Faction are both looking for its location for a long time now. I hid the book with the protection of the Oracle inside the book.&#34; Now that was something, I glance at my hand remembering what I witness last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What kind of protection are you talking about?&#34; He stared at me in the eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Only the rightful bloodline can used it. And the ones who are not can&#39;t access it. It will just look like a normal book that has the distinction of the mystical creatures.&#34; He explains. Rightful bloodline?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean by rightful bloodline?&#34; He stop at my question and stared at me with suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Only the bloodline of the protectors and Lycans can access it.&#34; He added, then a sudden headache made me lost my balance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aiden...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance up, looking over my shoulders for someone but found no one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34; My father ask, he looks at me with worries in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, but let me ask you one more thing. If you had that book for quite some time then why did you not gave it to the Faction?&#34; Now it was his turn to stiffen. I could see the discomfort in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It would be-&#34; before he could even finish what he was about to say my mother burst to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was smiling when she saw me, her blonde hair was tied into a bun and she was wearing her usual white flowy dress that sits on her ankle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My dear Dwayne, I thought you would be on the training grounds.&#34; She mumbled then gave me a kissed on the cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will, but I just went here to ask father about the trainings.&#34; She smiled at my words, but something about her doesn&#39;t seems right? Or was I thinking too much lately?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh right, you will start hunting them later right?&#34; I glance at her then back to my father. He avoided my gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; I mumbled then turn my back at them. Slamming the door shut. Hunting them down? How come this is the first time that I heard this matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was the Alpha now!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I step outside the packhouse, Hunter was outside and when he saw me his smile widens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my Great-great grandson, how are you feeling?&#34; He uttered, and just like expected everyone is already gathered at the training grounds. While some are getting ready for tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you gave the orders?&#34; I mumbled, he turn his head at me with his smile. And I swear I wanted to rip that smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yes, I forgot to tell you.&#34; Now he was starting to get on my nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could you just decide on something without my consent.&#34; I uttered, my words are full of warning. And I swear I was pissed enough about everything that happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t sulk Dwayne. This matter is for the good of the pack.&#34; He mumbled while taping my shoulders. I shove it away then his smile fade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was the Alpha, and my authority is something that you couldn&#39;t just ignored.&#34; I said, with a warning tone. My wolf was on the verge of crawling out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m still an Elder, Alpha and your authority is similar to mine.&#34; He bark back. I know what he was saying is true but an Alpha is someone that they couldn&#39;t just ignored. Elders are well respected by the Faction but Alpha&#39;s have the same ranking as them. They couldn&#39;t just ignored both sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You still should have consulted me.&#34; I mumbled through gritted teeth. I didn&#39;t notice that everyone was already staring at us including Sarah who just walk outs of the packhouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension in the air was too much that no one dares to speak up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I did? Could you do the right thing? I know what you did Alpha.&#34; His last words was a silent whisper enough for me to only hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knows what I did? Then the night at the facility. My eyes widens and stared at him. He had a smirk on his face before walking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t even have the guts to pull him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34; Sarah ask as soon as she reach me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing, it was just something about the hunting.&#34; I said, still staring at the back of Hunter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh right.&#34; Now I&#39;m really pissed, she knows it before me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who told you about it?&#34; I ask, she stared at me with a confused face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard about it last night. It was the time where the eruption about the rogues and attacks happened.&#34; She explains, I let out a sigh. I was even putting my anger on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s just have something to eat first, I think I was just really hungry.&#34; I uttered and her lips turns into a wide smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, the baby is probably hungry too.&#34; She said, then tapped her small tummy. I even forgot that she was pregnant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, let&#39;s feed my babies first.&#34; I pulled her hand and we decided to eat on a local restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat down while I order something. The server came to me in no time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good afternoon Alpha. What can I get for you?&#34; She looks familiar, then I notice her name plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dinna.&#34; I uttered as I read it. I didn&#39;t even notice that I read it out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Alpha?&#34; She uttered, she looks like she was about to burst out crying but her tone of voice had a mixed confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll just have a 2 steak, medium rare.&#34; She then write our order on her notebook and then went her way back to the Kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah stared at me with a confused look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know her?&#34; I shaked my head, then remember someone with the exact resemblance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was the sister of the twins.&#34; I bursted out, they are one of the escapists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see, so that is the reason why she was staring at you that intense.&#34; She mumbled while nodding her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She probably wanted to cursed me after what happened to her brothers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who cares? They are some low ranking werewolves anyway.&#34; She said, saying it louder where the walking Dinna can hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was holding the two steaks and some drinks in her hand. She didn&#39;t even blink upon mentioning her brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Finally, yiu didn&#39;t put any poison on this right? Or are you one of the traitors?&#34; Sarah suddenly bursted out. I couldn&#39;t believe that she would actually say something like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My brothers are not traitors.&#34; She uttered firmly, directing her gaze at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could you be sure? They saw them escape with the traitors.&#34; She answered back. I watch as she clench her first, her wolf was just about to come out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with my wolf instinct I grabbed her hand and pinned her on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t do that if I were you. She was pregnant.&#34; I mumbled making her eyes widens. It was part of the law that any harm towards a pregnant she-wolf could lead to exile. Because they couldn&#39;t defend themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t know Alpha.&#34; She uttered, I released her and she ran back to the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah then held my arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was so afraid, I thought she would actually hit me and our baby. I&#39;m so happy that you are here to protect us.* She said, I let out a deep sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You shouldn&#39;t have said that. You put my child&#39;s life in danger.&#34; I said, then pulling my arms away from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood there glaring at me. I ignored her and started eating. I have other things to think about right now.</p>
