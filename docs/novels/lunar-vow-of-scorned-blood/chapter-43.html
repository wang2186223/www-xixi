                <p>I moved a little to the end of the cell where the direction of the 3rd Cell was located. I still couldn&#39;t see her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you okay?&amp;quot; I asked, no one answered. I don&#39;t know if she heard me or what. So I ask again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you okay?&amp;quot; This time I made my voice louder, I heard the clicking sound of chains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Y-yes...&amp;quot; She answered in her soft voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What did they do to you?&amp;quot; I asked again, she didn&#39;t answer this time so I changed the question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;How old are you Amara?&amp;quot; Her name sounded foreign in my head but it was like something inside me was telling me it was familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I don&#39;t know...&amp;quot; Her words came out to be a whisper. I suddenly felt a sting in my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Well never mind that, I don&#39;t remember my age.&amp;quot; I tried to cheer her, and it seems like it was working she giggle and it sounded nice in my ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;So tell me what is your favorite color?&amp;quot; I just started spouting random questions, I don&#39;t know how to handle a child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Well, I wanted to see the sky, and based on what Vicky said it was color blue.&amp;quot; Her words were full of enthusiasm. I feel a little bit sad by her words. So she hasn&#39;t gone outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Is she locked up in this dark place ever since?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Oh the sky, is really pretty. It also changes color depending on the time of the day.&amp;quot; I said, I can imagine her leaning forward so she could come closer and hear me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Really? Like what?&amp;quot; She asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started explaining to her how the sky looked during dawn, sunrise, and sunset. I also told her about the outside world. Like how there is lakes, mountains, forest, and flowers. I also explained to her some other things that she could see outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;That sounded nice.&amp;quot; Her voice sounded sad at the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our conversation stops when the guards came back. I stood up on my feet when they open her cell. The sound of chains hitting the floor echoes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It&#39;s your turn little bitch, now get on your feet and move.&amp;quot; I heard another loud slap then they started moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Hey move faster!&amp;quot; I saw a flicker of light and saw her face, her eyes went wide when she saw me staring at her he quickly looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I told you she&#39;s different,&amp;quot; Afreo mumbled while staring at the same person. She had silver-white hair and a pair of golden and red eyes...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was the same child I saw before in the vision of the Lady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Vision end***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Sorry to interrupt your slumber but we have to move.&amp;quot; I blink twice and found myself still inside the underground dungeon. I look at Eliot who woke me up and found them getting ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did I just experience? It was already dark when I woke up. They all went outside and I followed trying to register everything in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yusef saw a boat that we could use.&amp;quot; He explained when we reach the exit the boat was already waiting for us. Yusef was already on board. It was a speed boat that can fit us all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Where are we going?&amp;quot; I ask once we are on the boat. They all turn to look at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Until how far did you see?&amp;quot; Clint ask. They all focus on me and waited for my answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I explained to them what I saw, regarding the children the meds, the cell, and the little girl. I even explain to them the first time I saw her. Even my encounter with the lady in the woods. They all remained silent the whole time I was telling them what happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;So you also saw her,&amp;quot; Clint mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What do you mean by that? You know her?&amp;quot; I ask, a little surprised they all nodded their heads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We also saw her before, she said the same thing to us,&amp;quot; Eliot explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;But based on what u know so far, once you saw that place things might start coming back to you again. &amp;quot; Clint said, I can hear the warning in his tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look ahead of us; we are heading north. I have no idea where we are going but it took us an hour before we started seeing some landscape. And another hour before we stop on a remote Island. I have no idea that there is an Island around here. I understand why you have to pass by the foggy area and if you have no idea where you were going you will end up dead. I saw some sharp stones just laying around the shallow grounds. Before reaching the coast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was still dark, but it wasn&#39;t an issue for us at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Where did you last see her Eliot?&amp;quot; Clint asks as soon as we step on the Island. I can feel my heart beating fast right now, there is something in this place that is making my wolf uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It was the pressure, the atmosphere in this Island is different from the outside,&amp;quot; Yustef mumbled from my behind. I didn&#39;t even notice that he was done doing his part in hiding the boat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Let&#39;s get going, we have to find her.&amp;quot; Clint utter, just who on earth would take her. Once I found out who he was I will rip him to pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We can&#39;t shift they will detect us once we did that,&amp;quot; Yustef said, but it would be faster if we used our wolf because our senses would be much stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We don&#39;t want them getting caught up in us being here. &amp;quot; Yustef added then started moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed them from behind, we headed to the forest. Something about this place is somewhat familiar. We started climbing the mountain. It took us longer than I expected. We didn&#39;t encounter anyone during our hike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you sure this is the place?&amp;quot; Noah asks again when we reach the top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yes, I saw the same white walls and structure,&amp;quot; Eliot answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all stood outside the burned building. I stop to scan the place then something flashed in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Vision***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Hurry up Aiden! We need to run faster!&amp;quot; I turned to follow the little kid in front of me it was Afreo. Someone was chasing after us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Amara is still inside!&amp;quot; Someone shouted, I glance at Mulac who is crying while being held by Calixto.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;ll get her.&amp;quot; I mumbled then stop to return to the building. But I was too late the guards had already caught upon us. They started carrying us back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Vision end***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Dwayne let&#39;s go.&amp;quot; I blink and look at Eliot, it was just the two of us left standing outside the burned building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;They left already, we decided to check the premises just to make sure,&amp;quot; Eliot explained. I nodded my head and started following him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The structure of the building was still there. I scan the place it was dark. The place looks abandoned like no one ever came here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we turn to the right hallway, I stop mid-way when I notice the familiar room. I slowly walk inside it and found the empty room in my memory. I can&#39;t be wrong this is the exact empty room that I saw where they gave us the medicine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Something wrong?&amp;quot; Eliot ask, I turned to face him. His expression wasn&#39;t good. He looks like he somehow feels uncomfortable being in this room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Tell me Eliot you&#39;ve been here right?&amp;quot; I said, he averted his eyes and nodded his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Just what on earth is happening? What are those memories? Are they even real?&amp;quot; I mutter, I can feel my anger. I brush my hair using my hand because of frustrations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You will remember everything soon Dwayne. You just have to be patient.&amp;quot; He uttered, I didn&#39;t answer him and made my way out. I even bumped into him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started walking down the familiar path, where the dungeon is located. I slowly opened the old door leading to the dungeon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was still intact, the path down the dungeon feel like years. That every step I&#39;m taking the heaviness became unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scan the place and it was exactly like how I remember. I slowly walk down the path and stop at the third cell. This is where I last saw her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body move on its own and entered the cell. Something started flashing back in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Vision***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Aiden wake up! If you don&#39;t get up, we will get beaten!&amp;quot; I opened my eyes and saw the familiar face of Mulac. His small hands were shaking me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly stood up then glance in the direction of the third cell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;She wasn&#39;t there,&amp;quot; Afreo said, knowing who he was talking about. I glance at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We heard some footsteps and then the guards arrived but they weren&#39;t alone. There was a woman with them wearing the same lab coats that the Doctors from before were wearing. She smiled at us and it was giving me goosebumps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Hello kiddos, shall we begin?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the scene shifts.</p>
