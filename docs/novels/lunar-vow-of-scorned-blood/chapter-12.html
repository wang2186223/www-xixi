                <p>Staring at Clint makes me dizzier. He keeps walking back and forth. &amp;quot;Will you stop and sit down please?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at me in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;How can I do that knowing that they found you... again.&amp;quot; He whispered the last part. Worries and terror flash in his beautiful eyes, reflecting mine but easily hide the terror of the fact that it... ugh! I shook my head dismissing that idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;That won&#39;t happen again, not anymore,&amp;quot; I assure him, he squeezed my hand and I smiled at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;The others are coming.&amp;quot; My smile soon faded. He walks to the counter to grab a bottle of wine and a glass of wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I know they shouldn&#39;t be here until the end of the month. But I can&#39;t calm my nerves unless I know we can take turns looking after you.&amp;quot; He continues. I was about to disagree when he stopped me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Please?&amp;quot; He added. I let out a deep breath and just nodded my head. He smiled and kissed my forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We need to finish the treaty earlier than expected.&amp;quot; I can&#39;t agree more with him. The earlier the better, we can&#39;t afford to lose so many werewolves again. Plus, him... remembering him makes my heart ache more. This is the right thing to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We have to move...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What happened with the meeting?&amp;quot; I ask trying to change his attention to the attack that happened last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;The other Alpha&#39;s will arrive much earlier this time. Looks like they are eager also want to wrap things up.&amp;quot; He took another sip of his wine, he only drink like this when he wanted to calm himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Don&#39;t get yourself too drunk,&amp;quot; I said. Trying to remind him how hard it is to handle him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last time he got drunk like this was the time our father died. I grip my shirt at the memory of it. He died because of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You know I&#39;m not gonna get drunk easily.&amp;quot; He laughed. I just rolled my eyes at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;As if that would convince me,&amp;quot; I mutter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I step out of the veranda, the cold breeze feels so good on my skin. I blush at the last memory of what we did here. I smile bitterly, our conversation here didn&#39;t end well at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s been two days since I last saw him and I don&#39;t know if I should be relieved or irritated. Well, this is what we both wanted should happen in the first place. A rejected mate should stay away from each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I found myself waiting for him to suddenly show up again like before. Maybe he came to his senses, after all, sooner or later he will mark another female wolf and this bond will soon be weakened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just thinking about it makes my chest feels heavy, a tingling pain resurface when an image of him with another girl flashes in my mind. Ugh! This thought is driving me insane!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You okay?&amp;quot; I didn&#39;t even notice that Clint was already beside me. He offered me a glass of wine and I took it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Clint, I&#39;m having a hard time fighting it.&amp;quot; I look down at my feet trying to hide my embarrassed face. This is the first time I&#39;m completely honest with him regarding my mate&#39;s issues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I figured, I know he went back here.&amp;quot; My eyes widen, since when did he know everything?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You can&#39;t completely wash away his scent. You know my senses are far from normal werewolves.&amp;quot; He added. I open my mouth to say something but decided to not say anything. I don&#39;t even know what to say, I can&#39;t even make an excuse. He caught me red-handed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Klaire, looks at me, I&#39;m not here to scold you or anything. You know I want you to be happy.&amp;quot; He wipes my tears with his thumb. I didn&#39;t even know I was crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t say anything, I let myself melt in his arms. But we both know we can&#39;t live normally until this matter ended. And with that, I can feel my anger resurface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After my talk with Clint, I found myself roaming around the Pack, it was already being a week since we arrived here and this is my first time stepping outside the east mansion after the day we got here. And Clint is probably in the office discussing the matter with Alpha Brent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other Alpha&#39;s will be arriving 3 days from now. The matter about the traitor remains a secret. We will wait for the arrival of the others before starting the investigation. We found a secret passage around the Cliff just like what we suspected. We won&#39;t even be able to find it if not for Clint&#39;s abilities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stop my track when I smelled a familiar scent that I was longing for and found myself in the woods. I didn&#39;t notice I walk this far already. I need to get out of here before he even caught up on my scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was about to run back when I saw a familiar shadow standing there in the middle of the woods and he was not alone. The next thing I know, tears streamed down my eyes as I ran myself out of that scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was him kissing with another girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My tears started to blurry my vision but I just wanna get as far away from this place. I stumbled on a rock, I hit my left knee. I can see my blood flowing out of my fresh wound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lose all of my strength and just sat there in the middle of nowhere crying while recalling that image of him kissing another girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit my lower lip, just a few days ago he went to me saying he wanted me back. But here he is kissing another she-wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why does it hurt so much? I thought I will not feel this way again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seems the sky felt my pain, the rain started pouring. I close my eyes and let the rain wash away all my pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes pop open as I felt a presence of an unfamiliar wolf. My eyes stop in his direction; he was just a few feet away from me. Gray fur soaked in the rain. He brushes it off as he walks slowly in my direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t feel any threat coming from him. He must be one of the pack, but his size is not like a normal wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hazel eyes stay on me. I keep my eyes on him just in case he tried to do something to harm me. He stops in front of me, I look small for his size. Is he trying to comfort me? He sat down beside me. I brush his fur with my hands, it was so soft. It reminded me of Clint&#39;s wolf every time I play with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you here to comfort me?&amp;quot; I whispered. I continue to brush his fur; I lay my head on his fur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He flinched at my sudden action, but he didn&#39;t stop me. His eyes stop at my knee which is still bleeding. I curl up and hug my knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Oh, that? I stumbled on a rock. I guess I&#39;m too clumsy to even roam around here.&amp;quot; I bury my head between my knees trying to hide my face. I know he saw me crying and I don&#39;t wanna imagine how I look right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t even know what&#39;s gotten into me talking to a stranger, specifically a werewolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We just sat there in silence, he covered me using his body just close enough so I wouldn&#39;t feel cold. The rain continues to pour down, only the sound of the rain-filled the silence between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I have no idea who you are but thank you,&amp;quot; I whispered, my eyelids are starting to feel heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a pair of arms carrying me before sleep completely consume me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up in an unfamiliar place. This is not my room. I look down at myself and my clothes are gone. I was only wearing a male shirt. Shit! Where the fuck am I? I started to panic, I scan the room trying to figure out something that might help me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A golden marking caught my attention, it has the familiar marking of the South. Wait am I at the South Lake Pack mansion? Shit! Did that wolf belong to the South?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opens and a tall tan guy entered. He&#39;s not wearing a shirt, his well-toned body reflexes as he walks in my direction. Why are they so many good-looking guys around here? But this is not the time to wonder about that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Who are you? And where am I?&amp;quot; He handed me a glass of water. I frowned at him not trusting is that the water is safe...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His familiar hazel eyes stared at me. He was the werewolf earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I think you trust me better in my other form&amp;quot; he smiled at me, he took a sip from the water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;See? It was safe.&amp;quot; I didn&#39;t answer him and just pull the cover tighter. I need to get away from here, but where are my clothes?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I let your clothes dry, they are in the bathroom. You can change on them if you want to.&amp;quot; I didn&#39;t answer him and just pull myself to the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stare at myself in the mirror. I&#39;m still in one piece. Only the bandage on my knees is different and the rest is completely fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slip into my shirt and pants, then grab my hoodie. When I got out of the bathroom, he was sitting on the bed. His eyes look up when he realized my presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Why did you bring me here? And who are you?&amp;quot; I ask again. I remain in the far corner of the room away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I brought you here in the Mansion for the South Lake Pack because I don&#39;t know where else should I take you. And I can&#39;t just leave a girl bleeding in the middle of the woods.&amp;quot; I narrow my eyebrow at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You didn&#39;t answer who you are.&amp;quot; A slight irritation is evident in my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Rion Altizer, the next Alpha of the South Lake Pack.&amp;quot;</p>
