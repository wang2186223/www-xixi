                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t you smelled anything? Like vanilla or something?&#34; I ask, she just stared at me with a confused look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What vanilla? All I can smell is the moist in the ground as well as the forest. What else should I scent?&#34; She inhaled deeply the air around and then think for a minute then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was still have the same scent of the forest, oh I can smell some dead bodies of animals not far from us probably from your hunting. &#34; She mumbled, while pointing at the direction of the east part where I ended up earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess I was just imagining things. Anyway I&#39;m sorry about earlier.&#34; I muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t have any excuses for what I&#39;ve done earlier. Maybe I was still confused about the things that happened to me this past few weeks? Months? To be honest I don&#39;t know anymore.&#34; I blurted out, then brush my hair out of frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah pulled me in her arms, letting me sink there like a kid. I know it was usually me who does this things to her but right now I just want to feel like this is the right thing to do. But yet in the back of my mind I knew something still doesn&#39;t feels right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s just go home and sleep. Maybe you just need some rest and things will get better. Don&#39;t force yourself to much for the time being.&#34; I nodded my and lean close to her to kiss her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She welcomes my kissed, shutting her eyes close. I did the same thing shutting every thought I had with that woman in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wouldn&#39;t let her ruined everything to me whoel</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ver she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we returned back, the pack was busy preparing for the departure of the Alpha&#39;s. I stood there next to Salll6io pp 0000 therah I wrapped my arms around her waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cameron and Harid show up watching us, they both gave me a knowing smile then muttered something between them. I just ignored them. I was surprised to see Alex talking to them, they even turn their heads towards us. I glance at Sarah who is now clenching my shirt hard without even her noticing that she was doing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34; She look shocked at my words then became aware of what she was doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh... Yes, I just don&#39;t like having them around.&#34; She mumbled, the look of panicked is evident but I just ignored it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about them, they were just trying to pissed me off.&#34; I uttered, I just watch as they started heading towards their cars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The former Alpha&#39;s are talking to my father and Hunter along side the Elders. It looks like they were talking something serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you thing are they talking about? I ask Sarah, she turn her head towards the direction of where I&#39;m looking at.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Probably something about the pack? Who knows.&#34; She mumbled, dismissing the subject.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s just go up to your room where we could be alone.&#34; She mumbled then wink at me. Giving me her playful smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could even answer, my father was already walking towards us. When Sarah notice his presence she smile widely at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello Alpha Ben.&#34; She uttered while bowing her head. My Dad smiled at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like you two are in good terms again. I was happy to see you around Dwayne again Sarah.&#34; He uttered, I ignored his statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; I ask, then he cleared his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The challenge for the Alpha Title will begin this week. The Elders already approved to it. Everyone is allowed to partake in the challenge.&#34; He uttered, directing his words to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have to win.&#34; He uttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought I have to prove myself again before being allowed to join the challenge?&#34; I ask with disbelief. That is the condition that they have given to me after they told me everything that I did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well the Elders already agreed to it. So prove to us that we aren&#39;t wrong on choosing you.&#34; He mumbled then started walking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yey!! That was great Dwayne! You will be able to get back your title!&#34; She squeal with joy and started jumping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know.&#34; I answered with still full of confusion. I don&#39;t believe it, not even a single thing about it. I can&#39;t just believe that they will just let me go like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m sure they are expecting something from me. And right now I have no idea what it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look at Sarah who still cannot contain her joy and then back to the crowd. The Elders were also staring at me before giving me a nod. And for the hundred time why does it feels so wrong?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood there watching them until their cars fully disappear in my eyesight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dwayne we need to celebrate!&#34; She mumbled, I glance at her the let out a sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to do something for now Sarah. When I get back we will celebrate. And just to remind you I&#39;m still not the winner yet...&#34; I muttered then kissed the top of her head before running inside the pack to find my father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I entered his office, he was nowhere to be found. Then something caught my eyes. It was the same book that we used last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know why but something was telling me to look at it again. When I made sure that no one is around, I close the door. Slowly making my towards the bookshelves. I have no idea why my heart is pounding so fast. My hands was starting to sweat. Wait, am I nervous? Nervous by just opening a book?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I finally reach the bookshelves, which is not that far yet it feels like forever. I slowly pulled it our of the bookshelves. Putting it at the table as I start to flip every pages, different types of mythical creatures are written in it. From Hybrids to the none existing clans in our generation. I flip it again until I reach the page where the word Lycan was written.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tracing the markings in the paper, the word Lycan was actually like it was engraved in the paper. The black ink used to write the content of it looks like blood. I lean closer to make sure I was right. And there it was, it has the scent of old books yet the fainting metallic scent is still there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the symbols that I couldn&#39;t read, but as I touch it my finger was cut by the edge of the paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh shit!&#34; I tried to wipe it down but my blood already spread in the paper. But what happens next made me shock, the wording on the book was actually starting to move at it glows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was happening?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I can suddenly read the content of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The beholder with the blood of the King should find the match to ignite the beginning of the night.&#34; I mumbled, I have no idea what is means.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the next line was starting to change again but before I could even read it. The footsteps approaching was starting to head this way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And without even thinking twice I hurriedly made my way to return the book to where it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Followed the sound of door opening, my mother look surprised to find me here alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh Dwayne? I thought your father was here?&#34; She said, I hope she didn&#39;t suspect me of doing anything or what.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was also looking for him that is why I&#39;m here. I wanted to talk to him about the challenge for the title of the Alpha that will happened within this week.&#34; I hope she will believe me, but technically speaking I am telling the truth because that was the plan earlier. Before I caught a glimpse of that book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yeah, I heard that earlier. Are you sure you are ready to take the responsibility back?&#34; Her eyes was blank, I couldn&#39;t read what she was thinking right now. And I don&#39;t know why I suddenly feel uneasy being around my own mother even we are quite close before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t waste this chance. I need to get my old life back.&#34; I answered with determination and for the first time she smiled. And instead of feeling like she was sincere, it feels more like she knows something that I don&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know that my son, just make sure that this time you will aim to kill your opponent.&#34; She mumbled, then turn her back at me. She was probably going to continue to look for my father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance back to the book but then decided to get out. I need to focus on this matter first before doing anything that will only end up destroying everything I had today.</p>
