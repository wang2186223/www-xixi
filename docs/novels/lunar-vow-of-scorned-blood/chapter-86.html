                <p>Alec and I are now both inside the Arena. And as time goes by my wound was actually starting to be a pain in the ass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does it hurt?&#34; He ask, but I know best that he was mocking me right now. I ignored him and continue to watch him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry I could still beat you even if I&#39;m injured.&#34; I uttered, he started laughing like I just a joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s too bad, you aren&#39;t at your best condition so this will finish quicker than I expected.&#34; He mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that he jump in the air, trying to kick me in the face but I was able to lean backward, then he used his other foot transferring his weight then landing on my back. He was quicker than before, or was I being the slow one? He kicked me from behind, making me almost stumbled on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I close my eyes as I feel the agonizing pain in my leg, I need to finish this quick because the wolfsbane was starting to penetrate inside me. And if I didn&#39;t get treated quickly it would result to further injuries in my inner body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You could give up now, you know that right?&#34; He muttered, I ignored his statement and pulled my self back to feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closing my eyes, I need to focus all my energy and remaining strength to this attack, if I want to finish this quick I need to hit his weak spot. I let out a deep breath then opened my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec started punching, kicking, attacking me and all I did was to block all his attacks, and it was not easy because all his hits are almost causing my bones in my arms to crack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that all you could do now? Block me?&#34; He smirk as he continue to give me solid blows of his fist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I keep silent and continue blocking him until I saw an opening, finally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To answer your question. No, I could actually do this.&#34; Before he could even think of my next move, I let his next attack hit me. It was a solid punch in my face but then, when he finally lost his focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is the end.&#34; I mumbled, then change my weight to my other side then gave him my strongest punch in his abdomen, it was right between his upper stomach and ribs. The sounds of his ribs cracking can be heard in the whole arena, as they all turned quiet. Seeing Alec eyes went wide as he flew across the other side of the arena. Hitting the metal barriers. He lay there on the ground, not even moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd was completely quiet, not believing what they just witness, that I was able to end the round with just a single attack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Dale stood there dumbfounded, he couldn&#39;t even close his mouth because of shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think it was time to declare the winner now Dale.&#34; Hunter&#39;s voice broke the silence, then everyone started cheering. It reminded me of the time of the succession, where the first one who got out was me and they started cheering like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dale then took a walk towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What just happened?&#34; He mumbled with enthusiastic and disbelief of what he just witnessed. I shrugged my shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are really something Kid.&#34; He then grab my right hand, raising it in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our Victor! He would be the one to challenge our Alpha for the title!&#34; Everyone started cheering, I look around still not believing what I&#39;m seeing. The hatred that I always receive whenever they saw me was now long gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally I was able to get back their respects. I glance up to where my father is. He was nodded his head when our eyes meets. I would be fighting him next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance around the crowd, everyone was busy talking, cheering, crying. But then two figures caught my eyes. As Dale keep telling me about how amazed he was that I was able to finished Alec with one blow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I keep my eyes at the two suspicious figures, they are wearing some cape that you could see that the crowd was also wearing then, the other one look around and I was able to caught a glimpse of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zion...&#34; I muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ha? Dwayne you need to go to the Doctor first and get your wound treated first before we resume the fight.&#34; I ignored Dale, and climb out of the Arena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pack members started to crowd me, shit! I lost them as I try to excuse my self from the crowd. Where did they go? I was sure they are heading this way. When finally got out of the crowd, Kyler was waiting for me with a smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you are strong, but I never thought that you could actually do that in one blow.&#34; He mumbled, hearing that same thing for a hundredth time already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I really need to go somewhere right now. I will talk to you later.&#34; Before hw could even say something I excuse myself and start heading to where they could only possible go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I entered the pack house which is now completely empty, then I heard something inside. I slowly made my way inside, then the sound was coming from upstairs. I run upstairs and to my surprise Zion was there, he was looking for something as he started to trash the area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cannot explain what&#39;s gotten into me but when I saw his face anger started to consume me and before I realize it I was chocking him. He tried to struggle from my grip but I didn&#39;t let him and continue to chock him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His struggle was starting to become weaker and weaker as he struggle for air. I don&#39;t know why I felt satisfied watching him get having a hard time just like how I enjoy my fights in the arena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let him go Dwayne.&#34; Before I could turn my head to see who it was. I was already being pushed away. And when I finally saw who it was, my blood started to boil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go now Zion! And take this.&#34; I watch as Clint gave Zion a book. Wait! That was the book that me and my father used last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wall behind me crashed, making ne fall from the second floor. The pack members probably heard the noise as they started coming this way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could hit the ground I shifted to my wolf and landed on our feet, but the pain from my wounded leg felt even worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I jump back to the second floor and Clint was still there which made me surprise, he could have escape but I wouldn&#39;t let him even if he wants to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t fight Dwayne.&#34; He uttered, I stared at him confusingly as he completely surrender himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My father then just in time and Clint was on the floor while I was pinning him down. He wasn&#39;t even making it hard at all, he didn&#39;t even tried to fight. Was this really the leader of the Royalties?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened here?&#34; He ask, he was staring at me then back at Clint who wasn&#39;t saying anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I found them sneaking out here.&#34; Dad didn&#39;t look surprised at my words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who was with him?&#34; I let out a deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was Zion.&#34; Looks like all they said about Zion betraying us all was true. All this time I don&#39;t even want to believe them but after seeing him help Clint. It only proves that all their accusations are true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah entered the room, along side Hunter who was staring at me with content. Then guards started appearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What an awful surprised to see one of the Royalties here. I was really happy to see you again Clint, it&#39;s been a while.&#34; Hunter mumbled, making him receive a glare at Clint. He wasn&#39;t being hostile right now but I can feel his hatred towards Hunter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will I could also say that I was happy to see but on the contrary I don&#39;t even wanna see your face, not even a glimpse.&#34; He answered, Hunter just laughed at his words. Like it was actually really funny for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be so bitter Clint, you know that you used to follow me around when you are still a kid.&#34; Looks like they both knew each other for quite long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is the biggest mistake that I ever done. I was deceived by you and now that we know everything, you will soon pay for everything you have done.&#34; Clint said, full of anger about something, and I don&#39;t know why I felt like I did missed something important.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, you will all be joining the others soon.&#34; Hunter said, the turning his back and started walking away. Clint remain angry and agitated and I could feel him trying to control himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dwayne get dressed, then guards take him to the facility.&#34; My father ordered and I slip on my clothes and Clint was dragged away. I want to follow the guards but Dad stop me. I look at him with a confused look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go to the Doctor first, you need to get that treated properly.&#34; He mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about the fight?&#34; I ask, we still need to finish everything and get my title back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then shake his head and I couldn&#39;t believe it. Are they changing their minds right now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go Baby, you need to get some rest after.&#34; I didn&#39;t say anything and let Sarah lead me to the Clinic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I went outside the pack members started clapping their hands as soon as they caught a glimpse of me. Sarah who had no idea what happened was as confused as I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we got to the Clinic the Doctor started to treat my wounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wolfsbane, but this isn&#39;t a regular wolfsbane. Because this one is actually trying to attack the internal organs of the patient, making sure that it&#39;s healing abilities won&#39;t be able to regenerate that fast and it was weakening the whole process. I was even surprised to see you standing right now after having this on your body for quite long. &#34; The Doctor explains, but i wasn&#39;t even interested to know about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And your fight earlier, if I didn&#39;t know that you are severely wounded earlier I could have believe that you are using all your strength, but I knew that you are not able to used your whole capacity. You really are born as an Alpha my dear child. Only an Alpha can withstand that kind of fight.&#34; He added, I didn&#39;t say anything. And just nodded my head, because now that I was in bed, I could feel my body being tired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah did left after my mother called for her because of something, I didn&#39;t ask what is it because I don&#39;t have the strength anymore to even lift my hand right now. All I could feel is that my whole body was tired, and that all my strength left my body. Making it harder for me to even move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Doctor then stitch my wound, it wasn&#39;t that deep like he said, but because of the wolfsbane that they used in the knife, it was harder to heal than my other normal wounds. I did receive quite many after my fight from one participants to another. And mind you, the participants are not just some normal ranking werewolves they are trained fighters to kill their opponents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After he was done cleaning and stitching my wound on the leg, he then move to my other wounds, putting some ointments, then covering them with bandage. The process did took longer than I expected, and the whole time I couldn&#39;t even feel anything. He said that it was because of the wolfsbane, because it was also targeting my senses, making it hard for me to fight. Good thing I did finish my fight with Alec early because if not my whole body will end up being paralyzed while we are fighting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should rest now.&#34; He mumbled when he was finally done, and with that I felt my eyelids started to feel heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And soon, sleep started to visit me.</p>
