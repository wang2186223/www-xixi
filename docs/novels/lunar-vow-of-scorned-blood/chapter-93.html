                <p>Clint&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zion and I decided to split up and he will go upstairs because he knows that place more than I do. While I will go and check the office. Because I&#39;ve been there quite sometime so I was familiar with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I open the door and it swung open. The place still looks exactly like the way it was before. But what does that book looks like. Kariz said that the book contains the ritual to return everything back to it rightful place. We don&#39;t know the real meaning of that but we guess that our abilities will return to Klaire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started rummaging the cabinets, tables and the bookshelves. Nothing was in here that looks like anything useful. I turn around and was about to go out when something caught my eyes. It was a book right at the top of the bookshelf, it wasn&#39;t that visible unless you are in this position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart started pounding as I step closer to it. Is this the book that Kariz was talking about? I reach for the book but as soon as I touch it my hand felt like I was burnt on something. Pulling my hand, I stared at it, my hand was cut. How am I going to get it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took off my cape, then wrapped it around it. The burning sensation was still there but it wasn&#39;t like before. Feeling curious I ignored the burning feeling and started flipping the pages, just like what Kariz said all the long gone creatures are here</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demons, Goblins, Dragons and Lycans. I stop at the page of the lycan. As I flip it my fingers were cut again, the blood drops on the pages, but what surprised me is that the page started glowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The unknown symbols from earlier started to assemble, changing into a language that I can read.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The beholder with the blood of the King should find the match to ignite the beginning of the night. The unbreakable bond should die or the crescent moon shall rise.&#34; I don&#39;t understand anything but I know that the beholder is pertaining to Klaire and the match, only means it was Dwayne? I don&#39;t understand if that was what it means but I need to read it further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to read the next line but I stop when I heard a noise coming from upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then realized that we are not the only one in here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran upstairs and found Dwayne chocking the death out of Zion. And his aura is emanating a black light. He would really kill Zion. I didn&#39;t think twice and push him on the wall. The wall cracked open making him fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34; I ask Zion who is now trying to catch his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Y-yes, thanks.&#34; I pulled him up, and it didn&#39;t take that long for Dwayne to get back to his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get this back, I will handle him. Make sure to take this to Klaire!&#34; And with that Dwayne appear in front of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zion looks hesitant at first but nodded his head. I need to know what they did to him and by the look of it he doesn&#39;t recognize or remember us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t fight Dwayne.&#34; I mumbled, because doing that will lead to ones death and Klaire would end up getting hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forgive me Klaire, because I know ones you found out that I was caught you will end up blaming yourself. But right now we Dwayne. No, you need Dwayne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could hear footsteps heading our way and it didn&#39;t took that long for Ben to arrive. I glared at the person behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What an awful surprised to see one of the Royalties here. I was really happy to see you again Clint, it&#39;s been a while.&#34; Hunter said, I glared at him, just seeing his smug smile makes me want to punch him in the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remember what he did towards my pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wish I could also say that I was happy to see you but on the contrary I don&#39;t even wanna see your face, not even a glimpse&#34; I hissed, he just laughed at my words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t believe that I let that person get close to me. He even treated me like his own grandson not knowing that he was one of the reason we all suffered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be so bitter Clint, you know that you used to follow me around when you are still a kid.&#34; I don&#39;t even want to remember that, just thinking about it makes me want to puke! Now I understand why our Father tried to hide Klaire to them, they never knew that she was still alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, you will all be joining the others soon.&#34; He said then turns his back on us. I tried to struggle but then calm myself back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like planned I need to get inside their facilities, that was exactly the reason why we came here not just for the book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We have to know the details they know about Lycan and if they still hide something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dwayne just stood there, he was like a loyal puppy. They really did something to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we got out of the room, they injected something to me and when I stared who it was. My eyes went wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Belerick?&#34; And with that the darkness started to consume me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I woke up, I was locked into a glass like cage, I tried to punch it and smash it but it was useless. I glance around me and I was in a white room, in front of me was a machine. I couldn&#39;t distinguish what it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the door opened and people wearing capes started entering, they all look excited upon seeing me. The amusement in their eyes was glimmering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t dismissed the fact that I know they will do something to me. Those familiar white coat people, it was all just like before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are finally awake.&#34; A man with a cape entered and without even taking his cape off, I already know who it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Belerick.&#34; He smiled upon hearing his name. He still looks exactly the same as I remember but how?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you wondering why I was still alive after that bitch tried to burned me?&#34; I didn&#39;t say anything, his face have burnt scars, probably because of that time. But his hair and eyes... It looks exactly as Klaire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know that time I also thought that I would die, but you know what happened? After all the experiments I did to myself that day was the only time it shows the progress that I want. I was able to become a powerful being!&#34; He started laughing like a lunatic, I wasn&#39;t sure how to react as his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t believe me? You will see it soon.&#34; He mumbled before turning his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Start now.&#34; And before I knew smoke started coming inside the glass chamber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shit!</p>
