                <p>I opened my eyes and saw Vicky waiting for me to wake up. And she was not alone. Someone is standing behind her, it was a man and his figure is familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You finally wake up.&amp;quot; She mumbled then, the door on the glass box was already open. I slowly walked outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;So what do you want now?&amp;quot; I asked. I scanned the place and my eyes landed on the man behind her. She probably noticed me staring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slowly walked into the light my eyes went wide as soon as I saw his face. He was smiling as he glanced at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Kariz?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smile widens, something is different about him. His eyes are glowing and they are red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Long time no see Amara or should I call you Klaire?&amp;quot; He still sounded like how I remember him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What are you doing here?&amp;quot; I asked unsurely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Did you not know?&amp;quot; He asked, he slowly walked around the room. I watched his every move not wanting to missed anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Just let me go Kariz!&amp;quot; His eyes glared at me, red eyes glowing. I suddenly felt like something is strangling me. It was getting hard for me to breathe, he smiled at my reaction. The tightness in my throat loosens making me gasp for air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Calm yourself, princess, we don&#39;t want you doing the same thing you did before. Especially after what you did to your own Father.&amp;quot; I frowned at his statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I don&#39;t know what you are talking about!&amp;quot; I rush to attack him but my body flew back a few feet hitting the walls within the room. A crack can be heard at the wall as I landed creating a big hole in the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Oh don&#39;t be mad, don&#39;t tell you were still under denial. C&#39;mon Klaire we both know what you did.&amp;quot; I glared at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then it all came to me, a blurry memory of the time when I was rescued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Flashback***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;My baby please come back to us.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My father&#39;s voice echoes in my head. He was walking slowly in my direction; I glance at my hand then it was full of blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It&#39;s okay my Princess, it wasn&#39;t your fault.&amp;quot; He whispered as he tried to cover Clint who is behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It can&#39;t be?&amp;quot; I stood there dumbfounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crouching low on the ground as memories came flooding in my head, I tried closing my eyes wishing that it will help me hide those memories away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then a pair of arms pulled me. It was my father standing in front of me with a hole in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice started screaming in my ears. Making me want to cut my both ears away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You killed me!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You are not my daughter!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried covering my ears but it was useless. The scream is starting to grow louder and louder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Flashback end***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;No, this can&#39;t be true.&amp;quot; I shake my head not wanting to accept what I just remembered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Oh, C&#39;mon Klaire, stop denying that they keep lying to you.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t deny the fact that what he was saying was partly true. I stared at him still not wanting to accept what I had just done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;No! Clint won&#39;t lie to me!&amp;quot; I shouted. Still closing my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Wake up Klaire this is the real you.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No! It can&#39;t be! He was lying!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I open my eyes and crash the wall next to me, then pulled his collar. &amp;quot;You are lying!&amp;quot; I mumbled before throwing him on the walls. But before he even hits the wall he stops midway. I grabbed everything that my hands can take and throw it at him. But everything is just turning to dust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;How?&amp;quot; That was all the thing I could say, he doesn&#39;t have that kind of power before. I stare at him still full of questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t notice him move but the next thing I know he was already standing next to me. His speed is much faster than Yustef. Just what on earth happened this past few years?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Why are you doing this Kariz?&amp;quot; I ask while my tears are still streaming down my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just stared at me and again I saw a flicker of emotions that he was trying to hide. He looked sad and broken right now but then it turned to hatred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Everything we know was all made of lies.&amp;quot; He mumbled, I saw him clenching his fist. As he said those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I followed you guys, because of what I thought everything that we did was right. We protected the Factions, the werewolf. But during that time I was still naive.&amp;quot; He stopped then stared at the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I discover the truth during the time where you ordered me to start looking for Via the only one who has all the information we need to know the truth behind the experiments. But what I discovered made me mad.&amp;quot; He stops and stared at me in the eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I was attacked by the pack of werewolves on my way to where Via is located. I found out that they are no ordinary Rogues but one of the Factions. They were ordered to kill me so I wouldn&#39;t succeed in finding out information. I was still human that time.&amp;quot; I remained silent the whole time and just listened to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I almost die that time; they threw my body right at the cliff. I also thought I would die but thanks to your blood I didn&#39;t. My powers started awakening as I was on the verge of dying. It was like I was born again but I remained unable to shift. I went back to where the Pack members were located and killed them one by one. I didn&#39;t get any information from them. So I went to the last person that I could think of. I visited Via but she was already dead when I got there, the only one breathing is her child who is bleeding to death. I took her in and started investigating on my own.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m not even sure myself if what he was saying is true. I had enough people lying to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I didn&#39;t tell you anything because I needed you. I found the hidden files of Via and started looking at them. And there I saw the reports of each of us. They wanted to use us as vessels of the Lycans. This is the reason why they killed both of your parents because you have the blood of the Moon Goddess within you.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard all of this from Belerick before. But I still can&#39;t believe that all of this is real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;But what shocked me is that the Factions are also behind these experiments. They started capturing human children to used them but none of them became successful until they found them, Aiden, Aris, Afreo, Mulac, and Calixto are the only ones who showed progress. I was just even lucky that I didn&#39;t die during the whole process so they took me in but before that happened they tried burning me. Those bastards made my life a living hell, every day I get beaten up just because I was not showing any improvement, unlike the others. They would take me into this dark room and start doing all kinds of stuff that they wanted. Every day I prayed for my death&amp;quot; He explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel my anger right now as I remember the same hell that I experience with their hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;As I was inside those four dark corners of that room, I heard them talking about the Lycans. I became more and more interested in the Lycans after that, wanting to gain that power to erase them all. Because why not? They don&#39;t deserve to live after what they have done to us.&amp;quot; He stops and cup my face and gave me his sinister smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I started gaining my army after I found out the truth, I didn&#39;t tell you anything because I need you. You are the only key to my plans. At first, I thought I can fight you on my new awaken powers but it was a huge mistake. You are more powerful than I thought. I almost died that time and I was devastated when I found out that you died in the hands of Aiden. I thought that was the end of everything until one day I came across you. You were playing in the forest and I can&#39;t be mistaken. It was you, you came back to life somehow.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smacked his hand away from me and he started laughing at my reaction</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then started playing with the strands of my hair. Making me flinch, I pulled his hand away from me not wanting to feel his touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You know I always like your silver-white hair.&amp;quot; He said then move closer to see my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t move all of a sudden and I know it was his doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I planned on taking you with me that time but you weren&#39;t alone, what I saw next fascinate me. You were with Afreo that shocked me at first then I discovered that all of you are reincarnated. That night I can&#39;t get you out of my mind so I took you back to where you belong.... to me.&amp;quot; He continues then turns his back from me. To get something and when he got back he was holding something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I need you back Amara.&amp;quot; He grasped my neck and injected a syringe into my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he was done he let me go as I wobble on my feet. My hand was holding the part where he injected it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m going to kill you right now&amp;quot; I gritted my teeth before I fall to my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was just staring at me from the ground smiling with satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Then I will look forward to that day. But right now I still can&#39;t die.&amp;quot;</p>
