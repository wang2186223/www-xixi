                <p>Amara&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Why are you with him?&amp;quot; I asked after we reached the boat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kariz was nowhere to be found. Galaz let out a breath then took his hood down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Galaz slowly started taking off the bandage on his face. It started showing some burnt scars, his whole face was full of burns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Before, I was only a normal human being living a normal life with my mother and siblings. Then one day the Factions attacked us, they took all of my younger siblings. They were both just 5 years old, twins, one girl, and a boy. They took them and I can&#39;t do anything about it I was only 13 that time and compared to their strength I was nothing... Then they killed my mother and they locked me up inside the house with my dead mother. They started the fire after that. I was left there I tried to do everything I can to get out but it was too late. The fire was already too big for me to get out. Half of my upper body got burnt, then someone came to save me. &amp;quot; Galaz stopped for a moment, hatred flickers in his eyes followed by a sense of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;He appeared and pulled me out of that house, right after we got out, our small house collapsed. He took me in and he help me heal my wounds. After I was fully healed he ask me if I want to stay with him. He told me about his plan and I have nothing else to lose and agreed. He started training me until I regained my strength and then he started giving me his blood. Vicky was the one who facilitates it. After they saw some changes in me, I started training harder, until I was finally able to shift. I was surprised at first but if that strength will help me get my siblings back I embraced it. We attack the laboratory after that. It was this place where they started doing it again. When we got here and succeeded in our first attack, both my brother and sister were already dead. They didn&#39;t even look the same when I found them. Both their bodies were covered with wounds. They were just too young that time.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have no idea that his siblings also went through that same process. I looked away not being able to keep my eyes on his. It was too sad for me and the memory was not something I would like to embrace at the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Ali and Ria are the only two persons who survived that time. Just like what they did to us, both of them lose their families because of the Factions. Ria saw her mother being raped by those bastards before killing her. They let her father watch everything as they raped her mother. After that, they cut off his father&#39;s head. They took her after burned their house.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at their location, Ria was arguing with Ali right now. They both looked young for this matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Ali&#39;s parents sold him, but after that, they also killed his parents right in front of him. He wasn&#39;t talking at first but Kariz started helping him and Ria. Kariz thought that they can find strength while embracing their hatred. He started doing the same thing he did to me but he wasn&#39;t cruel. He helps us. He gave us hope in the times when we all wanted to give up. He saved us all. And after that, we promise to serve him no matter what and whoever went to go against him will be our enemies.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Galaz&#39;s eyes then stared at me, I can&#39;t see any emotions within them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are we done here?&amp;quot; Ria asks as she watches the island crumble within our eyes. That place where we are all imprisoned and mistreated is now completely gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You look gross right now.&amp;quot; Ria uttered, looking at me from head to toe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ignored her statement and started walking away from them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What a snob.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard her whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kariz, the first time I met him was just a little kid, trembling on the corner of the room with his long hair covering half of his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remembered how he used to follow us around. And when we got out of that hell hole, he became loyal. He did all the work that we couldn&#39;t do without being detected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I suddenly remembered a memory fragment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One day Kariz came back late, I came looking for him and found Via with her daughter living at peace. I just lost control. When I opened my eyes, my whole body was covered with blood. I glanced down at my hands started trembling at the sight of blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly looked up to scan my surroundings and I regretted when I saw the gruesome sight in front of me. The place was nothing but a huge messed. It was something I cannot describe. A dead body was lying in front of me, heads, hands, legs, all detached from whoever body it belongs to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, I buried the memory away from me and even forgot Kariz.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I close my eyes letting the cold breeze of the wind brush my skin. The cold is somehow giving me comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To be honest, I&#39;m still confused. I don&#39;t know who am I right now. Am I Klaire or Amara now? Especially after all those things I&#39;ve done now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I know it was a lot to take in, especially after you found out everything in one blow,&amp;quot; Galaz mumbled from my behind. He took the spot next to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I just don&#39;t know. It was just too much for me to take in.&amp;quot; I answered honestly. It surprised me that I was even talking these things to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I know how that feels.&amp;quot; He stops then took something from his pocket. It was a necklace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You see this is the only thing that keeps me sane. It was from my sister. After everything that happened to me, I always ask myself why am I still alive? I just feel like I was walking into this void that I have no idea what the end would look like.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stare at Galaz for a minute then notice how sad his eyes are.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You are aware that our situation is completely different,&amp;quot; I said, then turned my attention back to the deep blue sea in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Well, you are right about that.&amp;quot; He scratched the back of his head feeling embarrassed. &amp;quot;Oh, maybe this is. We are both humans before then a sudden event happened, and our lives completely changed.&amp;quot; He added, feeling proud of himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m talking to the same guy that looks intimidating in the dungeon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t answer him and turned my back at him. That somehow made me smile a little. At least I can still say that I am still Klaire and I can still feel different emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sun is about to rise when we reach the place where Kariz is. I scan my surroundings, it looks familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then it hit me, this place was where I was taken when Kariz took me. I followed the concrete pathway of the old castle. I scanned the castle. It looked abandoned like how humans used this kind of places for some horror films that they used as entertainment. The world outside was totally different from here. Sometimes I do wish that I was just a simple human. A normal human... I stopped my track and gazed at the familiar track it was now covered with snow...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a flash, my surroundings are full of blood, I blink once more then it turns back to normal. I wipe my eyes just to clear my vision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you okay?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to see Galaz&#39;s face just a few inches away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I step back and he finally notice my discomfort making him back away a little. He scratches the back of his head probably embarrassed? Is that even possible him to feel that way?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I just thought you ran off when I notice you aren&#39;t following from behind.&amp;quot; He mumbled while not looking at me in the eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I have no other place to go, so I won&#39;t run away.&amp;quot; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face is still covered with bandage. His black eyes gaze at me, looking for any sign that I must be lying. When he was satisfied his lips curved into a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t mistaken right? The cold, a mysterious captor actually knew how to smile and earlier he even tried to joke around? If that is how you should call that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Hey, both of you are you coming or what?&amp;quot; Ria called, she was tapping her shoes feeling annoyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Why do you always ruin the mood?&amp;quot; Ali mumbled as they both watched us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We didn&#39;t even notice their presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Shut up, Ali.&amp;quot; She then marches inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ali started laughing and then followed Ria inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both looked at each other then started heading inside.</p>
