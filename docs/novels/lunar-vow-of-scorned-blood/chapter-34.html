                <p>The diary thing made me can&#39;t fall sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day, I went to the office in advance. Cameron and Harid were also arrived in a few minutes and sat in their places.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another a few minutes later, Clint arrived with the other 2, Noah and Yustef.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look around trying to find the only person that I was interested in seeing right now. But Klaire was nowhere to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot; Klaire can&#39;t come because she was still recovering.&amp;quot; Clint mutter, making me give up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rion hadn&#39;t shown up yet. He&#39;s already late, so I was about to let Zion call him. But he just arrived with apology.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We are now ready to hear what the royals were about to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My place was in the Center, Clint sat across me, the other two followed him and took the seat on each side of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I know you all have questions about us, so let&#39;s start with the legend that you all know about.&amp;quot; Clint started, he was staring right back at me. His eyes were piercing, the way his eyes somehow looked like hers was making me uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You all know about the elders who created the Factions, but the Central Kingdom was already established before the Factions. The silver hair lady was the one who started the Central Kingdom or the royals. She was the daughter of the King of Werewolves, and the daughter of the great Luna who has the blessing from the Moon Goddess.&amp;quot; Clint stops for a moment then glances at us, trying to see any reaction. When he was satisfied with he continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;She inherited both her parents&#39; power, but she was born human just like her mother. During the war stated in the legend, she and the royals fought beside the Factions against another pack of werewolves which we all know as rogues, the ones who don&#39;t have a place of origins. They won the war because of her like what was written. But because her power was too strong to the point that she couldn&#39;t control it anymore. It resulted in her to lost sight of everything. She died by the hands of her mate.&amp;quot; Clint looked at me and muttered the last part with some unknown tone on it. It somehow sounded sad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last detail was not written in the book. And it made felt painful about the sentence that she died by the hands of her mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;After that war, the Central Kingdom became known to every pack of werewolves, not even single werewolves have no idea about the Central Kingdom. This is where our birth started. It was said to us by the great elders that one day another set of royals will be born as well as the birth of another human born out of werewolf blood.&amp;quot; Clint&#39;s eyes stop at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like everything sink in. Like puzzle pieces were starting to come into places.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Klaire was born right after me. She was human and that was the indication that the prophecy was real. Yustef and Eliot were born before us. Then Noah. The five of us were born in the same year, meaning we are the chosen royals.&amp;quot; Clint added, his eyes shifted at the map that is showing the whole Kingdom. Each marking of territories was stated there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We know that another war will come into place. That&#39;s why we are here, the past weeks have been eventful. The new Alpha&#39;s are selected now. Meaning the training will be much harder. What we fought last time is nothing compared to what you are about to witness. These rogues are not your typical werewolves. They are stronger, so don&#39;t ever underestimate them.&amp;quot; Clint uttered. he showed some documents that have some information about the rogues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes were focused on the red eyes man that we saw last time. His face was still not visible in the drawings. Clint notice my attention and pick the picture he showed to us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;This is their Leader. We still have no idea what he looks like. Only his red eyes are what we know. His power was still unknown to us. But he was the most powerful among them. &amp;quot; Clint showed another six pictures of faces that I just saw, but one of them caught my attention. It was the rogue that we fought last time in the East Mansion that I took his heart out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;That one is already dead,&amp;quot; I mumbled, and Clint didn&#39;t look surprised by what I said and took his picture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;This guy is Merix, the one you fought with is probably one of his clones. He has a hobby of creating clones of himself. A perfect copy even the scent and the way they think. The power may not match the original but the clones are still stronger than ordinary werewolves.&amp;quot; Clint explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that he mentioned it, I did notice that before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;This is Ali, the shadow-like wolves we fought last time were because of his doings. Ria, she likes beautiful things, but she was someone that you shouldn&#39;t underestimate. She has a sadistic nature like Leon. Leon has the strength that the combination of 3 higher-rank werewolves. He may not look like that, but he can kill you. Galaz is the right hand, all the other 4 persons were following his orders in accordance with the red eyes order. And this is Vicky, she was the one who was in charge of their laboratory. We suspect that she was the one who created the poisons and the toxins in the flowers&amp;quot; Clint explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A loud bang of the doorstop us, we all turn our heads at Eliot who doesn&#39;t have a good complexion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Klaire is missing!&amp;quot; He announced weakly, he was holding the door frame firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What do you mean she was missing?!&amp;quot; Both Clint and I said in unison. We are both on our feet, Clint went to Eliot and help him sit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I also went closer to Eliot. I need to know what happened. My heart is pounding in my chest; I can feel my palms sweating. I&#39;m stopping myself from running to the East Mansion to check if Eliot was telling the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliot grabbed Clint&#39;s collar and looked at him dead serious in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;He took her; I don&#39;t know what happened. I just felt like my whole body became weak and when I woke up I was like this. It took me 10 minutes to make my fingers move. It was already an hour before I could stand, when I went to her room she was already missing.&amp;quot; He muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to punch him in the face for not watching Klaire but particularly it should be me who should watch and protect her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Did you try tracking her?&amp;quot; Clint asks. Eliot shake his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I did, but it wasn&#39;t working. I can&#39;t use my ability.&amp;quot; Eliot said looking down like he was embarrassed that he couldn&#39;t use his ability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What ability they are talking about right now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Again another attack happened and we have no idea about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clench my fist feeling all my frustrations. I don&#39;t know what will I do if something happened to her. The image of her that night came to my mind. My strength is no match to her. But, if something did happen, I wouldn&#39;t be able to continue. I can&#39;t afford to lose her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Stay here and wait for us. You need to recover first.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliot was about to stand but Clint stop him. Clint called someone and ordered him to take Eliot to the Clinic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We need to fight back.&amp;quot; I announced. I jump out of my seat and followed them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m coming with you.&amp;quot; Clint stop for a second. He still has his back to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Make sure to keep up.&amp;quot; I smiled at his remarks, three footsteps followed me from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We are going to.&amp;quot; Cameron and Harid announce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turn to look at them. Their faces are telling me they are serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We still need to get back to those rogues 10 times of what they did to us,&amp;quot; Harid said, he looked pissed at the thought of what happened last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I will stay behind just in case they came back,&amp;quot; Rion said. I nodded my head at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We need someone to watch over, Harid and Cameron stood beside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The royals shifted, showing their large sliver-white wolves. We also shifted after, following them from behind. We move separately just to scout the area if there are still traces of rogues or anyone that took Klaire. But we found nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We went deeper in the forest until we reach the border. We decided to move into groups by two. Clint was with me, Yustef was with Cameron and Noah was with Harid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was starting to feel colder as we enter the dark forest further. My wolf adjusted in the dark. It was snowing out here, the cold damp texture of the snow saw stuffing my paws. It was becoming harder to run faster as the snow was starting to get heavier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clint stop probably noticing the drastic changes. I scan our surroundings. There is still no sign at all, only endless trees. We usually avoided going to the dark forest because we might end up getting lost and the mysterious creatures lurking around here have killed thousands of werewolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We heard some branches breaking, my head snap in the direction where the sound came from but found nothing. We continue our search but still found no luck. When we got out it was already dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Where are you...&amp;quot;</p>
