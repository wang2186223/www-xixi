                <p>Dwayne&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rion was completely quiet after his sudden outburst. I wonder what Hunter is planning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The look of Belerick stuck in my mind. He look totally different from before and that aura he had was completely different as if it was similar to Klaire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this rate I&#39;m sure the Royalties are already with her. Because knowing Belerick I&#39;m totally sure he was after her. And if what Hunter was saying earlier was true it only means that they overpower us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What happened during all this time? I remember the time when I was still a kid we were all just a normal pack. I never even imagine that my own pack us actually involved with this human experiment. Are they aware that I was actually Aiden? After our encounter with Hunter last time only proves that they know something that we don&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The time that they used just to get this far is really something that we couldn&#39;t just dismissed. They were even able to do everything under the nose of the Royalties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft footsteps were approaching followed by the jiggling of keys. I close my eyes as soon as the light from the torch hits my face. She was wearing a black cape but I was fully aware who it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mother.&#34; She pulled her cape down, her eyes were the same as before. That even muttering that words from my own mouth feels so unfamiliar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dwayne. I never expected for you to rebel this early. &#34; She mumbled, she was gazing around my whole body. I remember her soft demeanor that would lead her in tears if she even saw me in pain but right now. That woman that I once called mother was staring at me with a blank look on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you? Are you even my mother?&#34; I cannot stop myself, then I remember what she said before. She was from the human territory before she was taken to the pack. Don&#39;t tell me? My eyes went wide upon realization.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like you already figured it out. I was one of you Dwayne, I was once a human but then Belerick gave me a chance to have a great power which I gladly accepted. I was the second successful experiment after you. And about me being your mother? No, my twin sister gave birth to you. She was the real mate of your father, but I took her place after she died giving birth to you.&#34; Her voice was full of wickedness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you saying that she was also part of the experiment.&#34; Her mouth turns into a smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes! But unlike me she was a failure, after she received the bloods she was just able to shift once and then she met your father who was blindly in love with her. I guess, like father like son. He wasn&#39;t even aware of the fact that his real mate is dead. Like how could he be that stupid?&#34; She added, while laughing at herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared at her, and she just laughed at me. Laying a hand on my face as I struggle to get out of my chains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Poor Dwayne... You wouldn&#39;t be able to break off. Those chains are made to  confined you. It was just sad that the others aren&#39;t here yet.&#34; Then she gave me a loud slap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Consider yourself lucky, because we need you to get your mate. &#34; And with that she pulled something in her hands and before I could even react my vision was starting to blur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I woke up I was back into a the same white room. I glance around and when I tried to stand both my hands are tied up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your finally awake.&#34; When I turn my head, an unfamiliar face entered. They are wearing a white lab coats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is going on?&#34; I cannot feel my strength at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We just need to take some samples.&#34; She mumbled and with that she started injecting something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to reach for my wolf but he wasn&#39;t responding at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t even try. Your wolf is asleep.&#34; I turn to find Hunter, he was also wearing a white lab gown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell are you planning!&#34; He just smirk at me and start reading the file he had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well you will see soon. But once you woke up I doubt that you will remember anything.&#34; He muttered, I just glared at him. And tried to struggle but it was all useless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you, that won&#39;t work.&#34; He uttered as he watch me try to get my chains out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were just wasting your strength. You&#39;re wolf is under sedative. He wouldn&#39;t even response even if I chop your leg off. But of course I wouldn&#39;t do that because I need your whole body intact.&#34; He muttered, I ignored his words and continue to pull my hands but like he said it feels like I lost all my strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir the level are now all equal. Shall we start?&#34; I frowned at them but they just continue talking to each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hunter looks please at the news, when I turn my head to the side I found my father standing right outside the glass window. The room looks like an operating room except for the tools. It was full of equipments and it has the same capsule like bed that they used before. But now it was around my height.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When are eyes met he look away to where my mother. No! To where that imposter is standing. She pat my father&#39;s arms then whispered something to him and he nodded his head. While she was doing that her eyes were directed to me. She was smirking before she pulled him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to kill you once I get out of here!&#34; I muttered, directing my words to Hunter. He just shrugged his shoulders dismissing my words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I doubt it, just like I&#39;ve said you wouldn&#39;t be able to remember anything. Oh just to be clear. After we are done. You, yourself will be willing to kill your own friends.&#34; He smiled, I glared at him. Wanting to rip that smile out of his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will have to kill me first before that happens.&#34; He just laugh at my words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need to do that for you to do as I say.&#34; I frowned at him, are they up to something again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other Doctors started walking towards me. Putting more straps around me, like I am some kind of mental patient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to struggle and get their hands off me but I wasn&#39;t even able to shove them away because I was tied up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t fight Dwayne. After this you will feel like the Dwayne before you met your mate.&#34; Hunter uttered, I cannot see him anymore because I was surrounded by this Doctors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they were done, some of them injected something in my neck, I couldn&#39;t even react. As I watch them do something to me, I can feel my remaining strength fading. All I could do is lay on the bed and watch them as they pulled some kinds of chemicals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this enough to keep him still?&#34; One of them muttered. I was trying to find Hunter but he was nowhere? Or my vision was just starting to blur. I tried to focus my vision towards the direction where I last saw Hunter and there he was looking please at what he was seeing. And standing next to him is none other than Belerick who is now nodding his head with satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let us start.&#34; Was the last thing I heard before I was completely taken into the darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Here we go again.</p>
