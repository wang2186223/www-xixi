                <p>Dwayne&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It&#39;s time.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were taken into a pure white room; it was empty not even a single chair is present in the area. I glance at the four children with me. They all look unbothered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Where are we?&amp;quot; Mulac glance at me then shrugged his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;This were they usually take for checkups. &amp;quot; Aris answered then sat at the floor next to Calixto. Calixto was the quiet one just like Yustef.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We usually meds around this time.&amp;quot; Mulac mumbled in his small voice. He was the youngest among us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that the door opened followed by a woman who is wearing a lab gown. The clicking of her heels echoes inside the room, she was holding a file in her hands then another person entered, also wearing the same as the first one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afreo stand to his feet then the others followed and form a line. I don&#39;t know what is happening but I did the same thing. I didn&#39;t notice it earlier but the second Doctor was holding some little cups in his hands. They were 5 cups in total, Afreo&#39;s took the cup then drank it. After that they check his mouth to make sure he drank it. Mulac was the next one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What is that?&amp;quot; I whispered at Aris who is in front of me. He glances back at me the shrugged his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We have no idea what it is, it was some vitamins or something.&amp;quot; He whispered back, I frowned after hearing that and look ahead of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mulac was already done by that time, Calixto was next then did the same thing as the other two. Aris was next and I tried to look at what was inside the cup and saw some 3 red tablets. It was now my turn I look up at the person who was giving me the cup. I slowly took it on his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Don&#39;t worry, that will make you strong.&amp;quot; I hesitate at first but decided to drink it, I slowly lifted the cup in my lips and swallow the medicines. The other one checked my mouth, flipping my tongue up and checking the side of my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Okay, very good.&amp;quot; She mumbled then gave me a smile, I didn&#39;t return it and went back to my place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aris was waiting for me when I finish. When I sat down he hurriedly started talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;How was it? He asked. I didn&#39;t exactly taste anything from the medicines. I don&#39;t feel any weirdness or anything at the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I don&#39;t know?&amp;quot; I answered unsure. The Doctors brought some toys around and Mulac started playing with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Since we arrive here and started drinking the meds we notice some changes in our body. Like Calixto he was wearing eye glasses before and they were thick then lately he doesn&#39;t need them anymore.&amp;quot; Aris said, I glance at Calixto who is watching Mulac play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Where are you from? Where are your parents? How did you get here?&amp;quot; Aris eyes turns sad all of a sudden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I really remember much, my memories started when we got here. All of us don&#39;t remember anything before we arrive here. Just are names but no surnames at all.&amp;quot; He mumbled, then cover his sadness with a smile. I forgot that I was talking to some kids and not the Royalties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;How about you, do you remember anything before you arrived here?&amp;quot; I turned my head at Afreo who I didn&#39;t notice that he was standing right behind me. And now that he mentioned it I also felt completely blank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;No, I don&#39;t.&amp;quot; I answered, he clicked his tongue then sat next to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I wouldn&#39;t be surprised.&amp;quot; He sounded bored and uninterested at the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I arrived here first, I&#39;ve been here for a month now.&amp;quot; He added then look in my eyes. He has the same intensity just like Clint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Aris arrived second 2 weeks after I came here, then Mulac and Calixto got here together.&amp;quot; He added then started playing with the ball in his hands. He was throwing it in the wall. My eyes focus on the point that the ball was hitting, it was the exact same point everytime he throws it. I notice some little cracks on the wall as the ball hits it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Did you notice any changes by that time?&amp;quot; I ask, he stop for a while the shrugged his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I notice that I became stronger since I came here. Ever since I started drinking those meds my body felt stronger and I can see better in the dark dungeon after that.&amp;quot; I turn to where the two Doctors was standing they were watching us. I glance at the direction they were staring at the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were staring at Mulac who is playing, I don&#39;t know why but they started writing something in their notes. I have to see those, I stood up but a hand stops me. I turn my head to look who it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Calixto, he was staring at me with those blank eyes. Then shake his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;He was right, don&#39;t even try.&amp;quot; Aris utter, he was staring at the two Doctors who was now staring at us. Calixto let go of my hand and went back to where Mulac is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What do you mean don&#39;t?&amp;quot; I ask, feeling a little bit irritated at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You will get beaten, Calixto tried that before. He tried to take those file but he ends up getting beaten up by the Doctors, he was taken somewhere then when he returned he was almost bleeding to death.&amp;quot; He explained, I stared at Calixto. I can&#39;t believe those bastard hurts this young child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;He didn&#39;t tell us exactly what happened or where they took him. But after that event he stops talking that much.&amp;quot; He added, I let out a sigh. Feeling a little frustrated. Just what on earth is Clint&#39;s thinking that he was showing me this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a 3 hours, that felt like forever they take us back into that dark Dungeon. Afreo was right my eyesight was brighter right now, it wasn&#39;t that bright like our wolf vision but somehow I could start picturing the place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were like 6 cell, all was empty except for the 3rd one. When I pass by the cell I notice the figure of the little girl, she was laying on the floor. I have no idea if she was even breathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Just don&#39;t mind her.&amp;quot; I flinch when I heard Afreo&#39;s voice, he was also staring at the little girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What do you mean?&amp;quot; He started walking and I followed him, we were at the 5th cell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Hurry up!&amp;quot; The guard shouted, we all walk faster. When we arrived he started putting our chains. Why would they need this for this children?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;That girl is cursed.&amp;quot; He mutters a little surprised by what he just said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I don&#39;t understand.&amp;quot; I said confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You&#39;ll know when you saw her property in the light. That girl is not normal.&amp;quot; He added, his words were strong and firm. I can see the fear in his eyes as he mumbled those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance at Aris trying to find some answer or explanation about what he was saying. He turns his back on me when he notices me staring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looks like I won&#39;t find answers, I sat down on the corner. Calixto sat next to me. I was surprised when I heard his voice for the first time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;She was the reason why we were here.&amp;quot; He said, I was waiting for him to continue but he was already on his feet before I even utter a word. He went to the other corner of the cell and sat there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard the keys clicking then the door open following 3 guards, one of them went straight to our direction. He was holding something in his hands, I have no idea what it was he opened the cell using his key then lay it on the floor and after that went back and lock the cell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;That was our dinner.&amp;quot; Aris said then he went to the direction where our dinner was sitting. It was a couple of hard bread, and water. I took the bread that Aris gave me. I can&#39;t believe that this is all they could eat, they were still children and their body needs more needs more than this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head snap when I heard a loud noise it was coming from the 3rd cell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you gonna keep that attitude again you little bitch!&amp;quot; A loud slap echoes in the air. I glance at the 4 children they all remain silent and continue eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards started laughing following the sound of water splashing. Before I heard the sound of the lock of the cell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;That always happens.&amp;quot; Mulac whispered, he sounded like he was about to cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance back at the direction of the 3rd cell. The guards started walking away and as soon as they were gone. The soft cry started. If it wasn&#39;t too quiet right now I wouldn&#39;t be able to hear her sniffle.</p>
