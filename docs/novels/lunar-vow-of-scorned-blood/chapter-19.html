                <p>Dwayne&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched as Klaire laughed, this was the first time I saw her laugh. Her laugh was like music in my ears. I smiled bitterly knowing that I was not the cause of those laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;They must be the Royals.&amp;quot; Sarah mumbled beside me. I almost forgot about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes stayed on Klaire and watched her closely. The two guys besides her was without a doubt the Royals. The power radiating around them was not an ordinary one. You can feel the pressure coming from them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes shifted at the tall figure who was heading in her direction. Her aura was much more than the other two. The pack members started walking away from them as it was starting to get hard to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Klaire&#39;s eyes automatically gleamed as soon as their eyes met. She wrapped her arms around him, which made me growl. I didn&#39;t plan that but my wolf didn&#39;t like what he was seeing. The feeling of jealousy and our possessive nature were eating me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes snap in our direction, even her. She stared at me blankly. then turned her attention back to that dark hair bastard. Another growl escaped from my throat, which was more threatening than the one earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The black hair bastard didn&#39;t even move and continue to cling on my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Stop it Dwayne!&amp;quot; Sarah said and you can hear the irritation on her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you going to abandon me again? After you took everything away from me?&amp;quot; She mumbled angrily, her eyes teary. The night when I took her mate away from her flashback. How she became nothing but a broken doll after that incident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t say anything and turn my back away from the person that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. I&#39;m sorry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guilt of everything I&#39;ve done was so overbearing. I cursed underneath my breath! Just what the fuck are you planning to do Dwayne?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah&#39;s footsteps followed from my behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Wait for me!&amp;quot; Sarah hissed. I stopped for a moment to wait for her, she wrapped her arms around me but I pulled away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want Sarah to get the wrong idea again. She stops walking, I glanced back at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You know, I can&#39;t stay with you like before,&amp;quot; I said, Sarah&#39;s expression automatically changing. She was angry, her eyes started turning black.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;No! You promised me, Dwayne! You promised me!&amp;quot; She shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Sarah, I will still stay by your side,&amp;quot; I added. She started shaking her head while glaring at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;NO! WE ARE GOING TO BE A FAMILY!&amp;quot; After that, she shifted to her wolf. She jumps over me and head to the forest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not letting me say any word she vanished within my sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stayed there, not knowing what to do. Contemplating to it I decided to follow Sarah. I shifted to my wolf, I need to make things clear with her. After I was done with the matter regarding Sarah. I will then go to my mate and tell her how I really feel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tracking Sarah won&#39;t be hard. I know too well where she will be heading. The sound of the river stream reaches my ears. I head straight to where the waterfall is, there is a hidden cave just underneath it. This is where we usually go when we were young with Zion. We always go there whenever we wanted to ran away from training. Or just to hide from anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smell of blood welcomes me as soon as I got inside the cave. I shifted to my human form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Sarah?&amp;quot; There she was sitting on the flow naked, her sobs echoed. She glances at me when she heard my voice. Her eyes were staring at me blankly, tears streaming down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands are covered with blood. My eyes went wide as she started scratching her chest. She was shaking her head hard, mumbling something underneath her breath. She did it again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I run to her and grabbed both her hand to stop her from scratching herself. She was struggling trying to get her hands away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Let me go! No one wants me! I&#39;m all alone!&amp;quot; She mumbled and started sobbing hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She burry her head on my chest. I freed her hand and she started hitting me. Yes! Just hurt me. I deserve it! It was all my fault that you were like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Y-you promised me you promised *sob*&amp;quot; I didn&#39;t answer her. I don&#39;t have the right to even say anything to her. It was all my fault. I started stroking her hair trying to calm her down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The same thing happened before. She was also like this after his father died because of me. I went to visit her because she wasn&#39;t eating at all. All she does was cry and cry. She lost so much weight that time. She was around 8 yrs old at that time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remember how her little cry woke me every night. Whenever she had nightmares. I always blame myself because she became like that because of me. Since then I started visiting her every day trying to make her eat something. Her small hands even tremble as she lifts her spoon. I started feeding her also and eventually she started smiling again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as soon as we reach our incoming of age. I took something precious to her again. She was once again back to that same state; she wouldn&#39;t even talk that time. Once again I took the responsibility of her. I promise to take care of her and fill in the people she lost because of me. I promise to be her family that time and make that possible. I promise to make her be my Luna. Which I totally regret now. I shouldn&#39;t have just made that promise at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fell asleep in my arms, I grabbed some blanket that we stuck before whenever we come here. I wrapped it around her naked body. I also took some shorts and slip on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Dwayne, don&#39;t leave me please&amp;quot; she mumbled as she sleeps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m sorry,&amp;quot; I whispered before I lift her up and carry her, her wounds in her chest weren&#39;t deep. I came just in time before she could even do worse to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t notice that we stayed there too long. When we reach the Packhouse everyone is already busy. I went straight to the clinic to get her wounds treated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put Sarah slowly in one of the beds, the Doctor went to her and started treating her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I turned around, my heart stopped. Klaire was lying on one of the beds. She was unconscious. I walk beside her not knowing what to do. I stop myself from touching because I was afraid I wouldn&#39;t be able to control myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head snap at the Dante, he was one of the Pack Doctor. He probably has the idea of what I wanted to know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I have no idea what happened to her. They just took her in saying she just lost consciousness all of a sudden.&amp;quot; Once again I glance at her sleeping face. She looks peaceful while she sleeps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Is she okay?&amp;quot; My heart is beating so fast. I won&#39;t ever forgive myself if something happens to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I found nothing when I check her earlier. She was just sleeping.&amp;quot; I let out the breath that I didn&#39;t notice I was holding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Here wear this.&amp;quot; He throws a polo shirt on me and I slip on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance back at Klaire and hold her hand, pulling it close to my lips. This is the only thing I could do for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What happened to her?&amp;quot; He asks motioning to where Sarah is. I totally forgot about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;She scratches herself.&amp;quot; He stared between Klaire and Sarah. He probably knows the story already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Good thing she didn&#39;t scratch herself deeper. Because by the look of it she was aiming for her heart.&amp;quot; He added, giving me a knowing look. After he was done he went straight outside saying he have to grab some supplies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zion entered the clinic panting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Where have you been? Wait, what happened to Sarah?&amp;quot; He went straight beside Sarah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He probably didn&#39;t know, but I know too well that the way he looks at her is more than just an ordinary friend. I notice the way he always put Sarah first before everything. If only he could be his mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What did you do this time Dwayne?&amp;quot; His eyes accused me. Well, he wasn&#39;t wrong anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I told her I can&#39;t stay with her anymore.&amp;quot; A loud tug, as he pinned me on the wall. I didn&#39;t move and let him do whatever he wants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You know how fragile she was!&amp;quot; He mutters, gritting his teeth. He ends up punching the walk next to my face. I know he wanted to punch me right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cursed underneath his breath and took a step back. Freeing me from his grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Just stay with her Dwayne, until she fully recovers.&amp;quot; He said after he became calmer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;After all, you took everything away from her.&amp;quot; He added before turning his back on me.</p>
