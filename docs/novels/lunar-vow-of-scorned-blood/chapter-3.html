                <p>Dwayne&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was already a month since I found my mate. And all this fucking month was hell for me. My wolf won&#39;t stop crying in pain for losing our mate. The pain is incredibly increasing every time I remember her sweet voice uttering those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know it was me who rejected her first and it was stupid of me to reject her. I grabbed another glass of beer on the counter and drink it straight. I lose count of how many drinks have I taken since this morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Get yourself together Dwayne and stop drinking!&amp;quot; I growled at Zion who is my soon to beta once I inherit the alpha title.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Shut up and leave me alone!&amp;quot; I took another shot but he stops me. I glared at him but he didn&#39;t flinch an inch instead he glared back at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I know you&#39;re a total asshole for rejecting your mate but acting like a total ass won&#39;t get her back.&amp;quot; He then let go of my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;SHUT UP!&amp;quot; I grabbed his neck and growled at him as I felt my wolf wanting to rip his head off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Go ahead kill me, but that won&#39;t change the fact that you rejected your mate.&amp;quot; His bark made I me tighten my grip on his neck. He started to turn pale. I know I should let him go but my wolf is really angry and out of his rage. We are tired and hurt to even think straight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;STOP THAT DWAYNE! &amp;quot; I cussed when I heard my mother rush to us. I let go of Zion&#39;s neck and he stumbled on the floor catching his breath. I could see the red mark left on his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What is wrong with you?!&amp;quot; She glared at me but I dismissed her and pulled myself to the bathroom I don&#39;t want to hurt her. I heard her sigh and walked closer to the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I understand how you felt Dwayne, but nothing will change if you&#39;re just gonna keep sulking and being wasted. You&#39;re a soon-to-be alpha so act like one.&amp;quot; She mutters before I heard her walk out of my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a groan and pulled myself on the floor. I looked at myself in the mirror. I looked like a complete wreck! My eyes were bloodshot from crying and drinking. I knew this is stupid of me to even cry after rejecting my mate. I could feel my wolf turn numb and lost for losing our mate and it was all my fault! His pain is nothing to me I felt sorry for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled a towel from the stool of my bathroom and took a warm shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still couldn&#39;t get her out of my head. Her blue-gray eyes kept haunting me every time I close my eyes. I let the water drop in my skin but nothing felt the same when her skin touches mine. I can still feel her touch and I&#39;ll do anything just to feel her touch again. I know this is all my fucking fault but fuck! I regret everything I said to her! I don&#39;t care anymore if she&#39;s a weak human, all I just want right now is to see her again. All this time I tried to find her but I can&#39;t even find a trace of her scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got out of the bath and pull some clothes in the corner. I somehow look decent for someone who did not even shower for almost a month. My wolf does not even want to communicate with me except for the time when he feels like killing everyone around us lately. And if he could kill me, I know he would not think twice about especially after what I&#39;ve done to our mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw the empty glass of beer and throw it away, the shattering sound of breaking glass echoed in this empty room. My room is nothing but a complete disaster, falling pieces of furniture, broken glass from empty bottles of beer, clothes scattered around the corner. I sat down at my broken bed and bury my face in my palms. What have I done?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced down at my hand&#39;s drops of water pouring down on it, my whole body shiver as I let my eyes welled with tears again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock on the door followed by my father who I can&#39;t seem to read. He glances around my room and lets out a sigh. I know too well why he was here. He probably wants me to start acting as his rightful heir for his Alpha title.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I know that you just want to lock yourself in your mess, but you have to remember that you are soon be inheriting the alpha title. I&#39;ll see you at the training ground tomorrow. &amp;quot; He said. But I knew too well that if I don&#39;t show up he will drag me outside my room to the training grounds not that I even care about it. But my wolf lost so much already and I can&#39;t let him lose his rightful position as an alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day I got up early, took a shower, and ran to the training ground. I was the first one here because I could not even sleep a wink. I started by doing my warm-up by lifting the log of trees in the area after I&#39;m finishing other werewolves started arriving. Some of them can&#39;t even hide their surprise to see me here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Good to see you back,&amp;quot; Glen said. He was one of the strongest warriors in our pack and now the Vice-Captain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yeah.&amp;quot; He seemed to get the idea that I don&#39;t want to talk to anyone right now. And I know that already knows why. Because there is no other reason for a werewolf to be agitated and broken unless it was related to their mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They probably guess after my sudden outburst in the school that almost killed five pack members. I would have killed them after I heard that Dino almost broke my mate&#39;s arm, if not for my Father&#39;s command that time they are already burried underground. I heard they are already being sent in the borderline to keep them away from me because if not. Their death will be early.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Wanna spar?&amp;quot; I gazed at the new arrival. I don&#39;t recognize him at all. This is the first time that I saw him Is he even a member of this pack?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You probably don&#39;t know him. His name is Lindon from South Lake Pack, he&#39;s with them.&amp;quot; He said pointing to the group of 10 unfamiliar werewolves that I hardly notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Well wanna have sparred with me?&amp;quot; the new guy added. I&#39;m not in the mood to do anything right now but may as well be trained while I&#39;m here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded my head and he smiled. I don&#39;t like that smile it makes me wipe it off his face. During sparring, we are not allowed to transform into our wolves. Everyone gathered around us wanting to watch who would win. Well, it was to his advantage in knowing I haven&#39;t been training for a month and some of them are probably thinking the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I&#39;m too pissed and broken, and I wanted to do something to lessen it. My wolf finally agreed with me for the first time. We both gather in the center, the other circles around us. Glen stands between us and reminds us about the rules that no killing but until no one surrenders we won&#39;t declare a winner. Glen will still supervise to stop the match to keep us from getting badly injured to the point of dying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you ready?&amp;quot; Glen as we both nodded our heads and were ready for the position</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;FIGHT!&amp;quot; Glen walks out of the circle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We circled each other, watching each other move. Trying to figure out what attack will be the other does. He watches me like a hawk, giving me a cocky smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Soon to be alpha. Why don&#39;t you show me what you got?&amp;quot; he said. I can hear the excitement in his voice. He also wanted to die early.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I launched a punch at him but he dodged it, so I attacked again using my left leg and he did not expect it, hitting his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I would focus if I were you,&amp;quot; I warned. This time he was the one who attacks for giving me punches from both sides, he was quick but I was able to block them all. He jumped midway and tried to kick me but I dodged it, he was lucky enough to almost hit me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Aww, you were fast,&amp;quot; he whined. I don&#39;t know why he was acting like that. But he was eminence with power. I did not feel it at first but now I am sure of it. He could hit me earlier if he was serious enough in the fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brown eyes are gleaming with excitement. He tried attacking again and this time he hit me right below my right abdomen. I wasted no time while he was still in awe. I make my move fast and swiftly move behind him and smack the back of his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He is collapsed on the ground unconscious. He was powerful but not enough to watch my movements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I think that concludes my training. I&#39;m going.&amp;quot; All of them fell silent and I took that as my cue to get out of here.</p>
