                <p>&amp;quot;I thought you&#39;re dead?&amp;quot; I ask not sure if she was real. She laughs at my reaction then pick something from the table.</p>

                <p>&amp;quot;I don&#39;t know what you are talking about!&amp;quot; I said, my voice sounded angry because I was really angry. How could she be here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You know what I&#39;m talking about Klaire or should I call you Amara?&amp;quot; She picks up a syringe on the side and starts heading my way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Don&#39;t worry if you don&#39;t remember everything, I will make you remember.&amp;quot; She said then press something on the wall. Gas started coming out of the ceiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started to panic, are they going to make me fall asleep again? My head started to feel heavy again, I tried to hold myself up but my legs felt weak. I heard footsteps coming closer to me. It was blurry but I can see it was her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Enjoy your sleep, Princess.&amp;quot; She said and the next thing I know, darkness consumes me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Vision***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was hearing voices again; it was the same voices as before. I open my eyes then close it again, because of the light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Wake up Klaire... You need to remember.&amp;quot; That same voice. I open my eyes and found myself back into an unfamiliar place. It was a huge castle and there was a couple in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was sitting and her husband is holding her. They look happy, my eyes shifted at the door where another man was standing watching them. The husband smiled at the man who just entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Belerick good to know you are back.&amp;quot; The husband hugs the man name Belerick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I see you were enjoying your vacation, my brother.&amp;quot; Belerick teased, they both started laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;She was about to give birth soon.&amp;quot; He mumbled proudly then kissed his wife who is now laughing at his excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Good evening Luna.&amp;quot; Belerick utter, she dismissed the idea of her being called Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Just Amia is alright Belerick. You know you were like a brother to me.&amp;quot; She mumbled sweetly, she had a pair of blue eyes. Her pale skin looks like porcelain under the moonlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Amia, I can see my brother Elijah was having the best time of his life.&amp;quot; They both started laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Well as you can see, he doesn&#39;t even want to get out of our room.&amp;quot; She said then hold the hand of her husband. The way he watches her shows how much he adores her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way Belerick look at them was filled with envy, and there is something about the way he looks at them. And I don&#39;t like the feeling that I&#39;m getting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Well if you have such an adorable wife, you might lock yourself in your room like I do Belerick.&amp;quot; Elijah mutter, his eyes were glowing. Belerick shakes his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Well I haven&#39;t seen her, so right now I need you in the office to discuss the matters.&amp;quot; Elijah&#39;s smile fades, he looks like a child who was about to throw a tantrum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Go now Eli, Belerick is waiting.&amp;quot; He nodded his head then kissed her forehead before following Belerick outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was left with Amia, she was singing something. I didn&#39;t notice it earlier but she was with a child, she was standing next to the cradle of her child. Her long black hair is shining as she moves around she carries her infant which had the exact color of hers. She was singing her some lullaby when she notices something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze at my position when she glances at my direction. She put her baby back to her cradle. She started walking slowly in my direction. My eyes went wide when I notice some shadow lurking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then someone steps out into the light, eyes wide when she noticed who was that man, it was Belerick. He was holding a dagger; it was a familiar sword that they used in my memory to stab me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Belerick? What are you doing? Where is Elijah? ELIJAH!&amp;quot; she started calling his husband&#39;s name but no one answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Belerick walk slowly to her, she glances at the cradle where her child was sleeping peacefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;He won&#39;t come even if you keep calling his name.&amp;quot; Her hands cover her mouth as she notices that he was covered with blood. Tears streaming down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What did you do to him?! Where is he Belerick!&amp;quot; Belerick laugh, his eyes were full of malice. He pulled her hair making her cry in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I stab him! He shouldn&#39;t be the King! It should be me!&amp;quot; He utters, she pushes her in the floor. She started crying harder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;No! You can&#39;t! You&#39;re lying!&amp;quot; I didn&#39;t notice this earlier but his eyes were color grey, I almost froze when I notice that he looks exactly like the man from my dream earlier. His grey cold eyes sending a shiver down my spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You could join him later.&amp;quot; He mumbled, her eyes shifted to the cradle, the baby started crying. She rushes to her baby, making her almost stumbled on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Please don&#39;t hurt my baby.&amp;quot; She pleaded, she was holding her baby in her arms. The baby stop crying as she started singing between her sobs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;My baby mommy will protect you.&amp;quot; She whispered then put her back into her cradle, her eyes started glowing as her hair turns to silver-white. Golden eyes glowing, Belerick moves backward as he watches her change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I wouldn&#39;t do that if I were you,&amp;quot; Belerick said then he showed her something, an image of Elijah still breathing but he was chained and covered with blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Now you have to choose, him or your child.&amp;quot; She glared at him, we didn&#39;t notice but the baby was already gone, he was holding her in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes went back to her blue ones when she saw her child in his arms. The dagger was pointing down to the baby&#39;s neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Don&#39;t! Don&#39;t hurt her please.&amp;quot; She started crying again, she looks desperate. Unable to move on her place she kneeled down to her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Why are you doing this Belerick?&amp;quot; She asks between her sobs. I wanted to help her but I don&#39;t have the power, I just stood there as I watch everything unfolds in my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Because of you! Ever since he met you he forgets about everything!&amp;quot; He answered angrily. She looks at him in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Just because of that?&amp;quot; He started laughing like a lunatic. He looks different from the Belerick I saw earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Just because of that? You have the audacity to ask?! He abandoned everything because of you! He became lovesick like a puppy around you! He wasn&#39;t like the brother I look up to! And I cannot accept a human as my LUNA!&amp;quot; His eyes were starting to turn black, his wolf was about to come out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She notices the changes and rush to him, she pulled a dagger that is hiding on her thighs. She stabs her right in his side. He was surprised by the sudden attack making him lose his grip in the sword.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Bitch!&amp;quot; He throws the baby, she saw it and quickly caught her baby in her arms before she even gets hurt. The baby started crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I will kill you!&amp;quot; She ran to the door but he caught her hair and pulled her back. &amp;quot;Where do you think you&#39;re going?&amp;quot; He yanked her to the floor, her back hit the corner hard making her gasp for air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The baby was still crying she tried to check on her as she stops her crying. Her eyes were focused on the furious Belerick, he looks so big compare to her. She scans the room looking for a way to get out but he was already above her. He pulled her hair once more and throw her to the side, she hit the hard wall as she landed. Her arms were embracing her baby; she was protecting her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood started dripping down her mouth, she was already covered with bruises. I tried to step forward but it was like there is an invisible wall separating us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Should I break your legs so you could stop running around?&amp;quot; He grabbed the sword on the side then started walking slowly to her. He snatches the baby from her, she tried to struggle but she was too weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Don&#39;t hurt her please...&amp;quot; She whispered weakly, he glances at the baby who is crying in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Don&#39;t worry I will raise her like my own.&amp;quot; She looks at him with disbelief, she tried to stand but he kicked her right at her abdomen, she gasps blood dripping from her mouth. He wasn&#39;t satisfied and kicked her again. She landed on the wall, the impact cause fractures in the concrete wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Say goodbye to your daughter.&amp;quot; He pulled the sword, my hands covered my mouth. My tears started pouring down my cheeks as I watch him stab her in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turns his head in my direction then smiled wickedly. I froze then was unable to move.</p>
