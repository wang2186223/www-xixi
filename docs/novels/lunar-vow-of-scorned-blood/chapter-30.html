                <p>NO! I didn&#39;t kill Klaire! I loved her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice started to grow louder, her dead body was moving slowly to me. Whispering those words over and over. I wanted to vanish and run away... But the memory of the time where I turn my back on her stops me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closing my eyes, trying to remember something else. Another scenario flash in front of me. It was the night where we sleep together. She was peacefully sleeping in my arms. My wolf glare at me not liking what he was seeing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smile to myself, remembering the way her beautiful eyes glows as she stares at the night sky, how her soft skin touches mine. that memory was the only thing that keeps me going. Once I open my eyes all the voices were gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared directly into my wolf&#39;s eyes. His eyes were still glowing but they look calmer now. I took a step closer to him. His black fur reminded me of this dark place where he was lock up. It was cold and empty, just like how it felt when she was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You wanted to her back...&amp;quot; He whispered, I patted his head and nodded my head. He looks satisfied right now,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You were really a selfish prick.&amp;quot; He mumbled laughing at his statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yes, and now let&#39;s go back to our mate together.&amp;quot; I mutter looking directly into his eyes. His eyes softened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I hope you will be able to protect her this time...&amp;quot;His eyes glows one last time before finally close them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I close my eyes and breathe slowly, trying to calm my anger. And feeling the flow of this new power inside me. I open my eyes, only to find that the first person that I wanted to see was looking back at directly at me with surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly stand on my feet the ground started to crack as I step, so this is what my father meant when he said that your beast will test your control. For it will determine how you will use his power. This new power flowing in my body is overwhelming. I can feel my muscles grow bigger and my body feels lighter than before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pack members started cheering as I step out of the barrier. My eyes still focus on Klaire, she was also watching me back. Her hair returns to black as well as her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m proud of you my Son!&amp;quot; My mother wrapped her arms around me and pulled me into a hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t hug her back, afraid that I might crash her because of my new found strength. My father once reminds me that it will take time before I get myself used to this strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cheer from the South Lake Pack started, indicating Rion succeed and was the 2nd one to regain his power. I glance at him; he was still smiling. I followed who he was smiling to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clench my fist trying to stop myself from snatching Rion&#39;s eyes off. I let out a deep breath as I watch them stare at each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Dwayne...&amp;quot; My mother squeezes my hand taking my attention off her. I look back at my mother who is now worried that I might burst out again. I shake my head. I started walking away from them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stop as I heard the loud explosion, my head snap at the direction of the loud explosion. It was coming from the East Mansion. Everyone started moving, the other Alpha&#39;s is already done by the time being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;ROGUES!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone shouted. The footsteps of the rogues were getting louder as they got near us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I automatically went in front; Zion was right next to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Go, help the children and elders away from here.&amp;quot; I instructed, he nodded his head and started moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rogues appear not long before Zion was done. They are hundreds surrounding us. I don&#39;t have a good feeling around them. It was my first time seeing red eye werewolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Those rogues look exactly as the ones that attack us.&amp;quot; Rion and his Beta Lindon started moving around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance back at the Rogues that Lindon was referring to, they are the once with red eyes and dark fur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them remain on his human form. His eyes were red like blood; I can&#39;t see his face because something is blocking my eye view. Only the color of his eyes is visible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Give me back what you took from me.&amp;quot; His voice was low and cold but something about it is giving me goosebumps. The pressure of his words is overbearing...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rogues around him started to lower their head. They were too afraid to lift their head at his presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What the hell are he talking about?!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance at the new Alpha of the White Moon; his name is Cameron if I&#39;m not mistaken. The irritation from his voice is evident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The leading rogue didn&#39;t answer; his eyes was staring blankly on me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We don&#39;t have the patience to play around rogue.&amp;quot; The one from the Alpha of the Golden Arid said, flashing his claws. His name is Harid, if I remember it right. He tilts his head on the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I see...&amp;quot; The leading rogue utter, a wave of overbearing pain made me gasp. I felt this before. The same pain, it was like every limb of my body is being thorn into pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was on my knees before I knew it, it wasn&#39;t just me. Everyone around us is feeling the same thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harid was already on his knees, hands on the ground trying to support his weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Fuck!&amp;quot; It was Rion&#39;s voice, he was also trying to keep himself from falling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to scan the crowd everyone is already unconscious. It was just me, the Alpha&#39;s and the Royals who are still standing. Even my Father can&#39;t stand it and was now unconscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was surprised to Klaire standing like she wasn&#39;t feeling anything, as well as the 4 Royals. They are all glaring at one direction. The Rogues surrounding us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Get everyone else away from here.&amp;quot; Klaire&#39;s voice was directing at us and with that, the pain stops. I turn my head to her. Her hair was back to silver-white, her gold and red eyes was furious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even glance at my direction; with a swift move she was already gripping the neck of one of the rogues following a loud snap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes grow wide at what she just did. She snapped it like it was nothing. She turned to look our way, I didn&#39;t notice that I&#39;m the only one who is not moving. Rion, Harid and Cameron was already carrying the unconscious body away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a step forward, feeling my power radiating over my Body. My wolf is quite excited to come out and try his new strength. Especially after he felt that overbearing pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Don&#39;t.&amp;quot; A soft voice stopped me from my track. She was staring at me; the Four Royals were standing beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cameron, Harid and Rion already returned. They all stood beside me, the presence of their power is quite known, as I feel their auras.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Shall we show them what we got?&amp;quot; Harid mutters with his sly smile. I ignore his remark and focus on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Klaire&#39;s eyes was intense and worried? She shifted her eyes with the 3 other Alpha&#39;s. Her eyes glowing...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Get out of here.&amp;quot; She ordered, her voice send shiver down to my spine. The authority on her voice is really something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Klaire, calm down, we need extra hands right now.&amp;quot; Clint mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Klaire head snaps at Clint. Does she hate the idea of having me around her? That was more painful than earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We can&#39;t...&amp;quot; She stops and just nodded her head. She didn&#39;t glance back at me after that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Focus on their heart.&amp;quot; Clint said, grasping the first wolf that was near him. Clint&#39;s hand put a hole on the Rogues body. His heart was out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Get ready, this night will be long.&amp;quot;</p>
