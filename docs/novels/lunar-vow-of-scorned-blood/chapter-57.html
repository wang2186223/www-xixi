                <p>I glance at them. I cannot contain my smile at their misery. They are starting to crumble and I cannot find any more joy than seeing them turn their backs on each other.</p>

                <p>My dear boy, I didn&#39;t let you live this long just for you to give up now. The pressure of the crowd gave him no other choice but to agree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turn my attention to the newest arrival Royalties, that is what they called them but not anymore. I wonder what would the great Clint do after he lost his cherished pack?</p>

                <p>&#34;Sarah aren&#39;t you happy to see me?&#34; Her face was beyond angry. She had some traces of tears on her face. Looks like her plan didn&#39;t work at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You shouldn&#39;t be here! What if someone saw you?!&#34; I laughed at her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she really think I will let anyone who saw me live another minute?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got bored, I want to know how the Factions is while I was sleeping.&#34; She frowned then finally give up the thought she had in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well as you can see Rion knew about the factions.&#34; She look worried for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you handle it so well, I don&#39;t know why they didn&#39;t suspect you after all this time.&#34; She shrugged her shoulders then gave me an innocent smile that is beyond her description.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wasn&#39;t your daughter for nothing.&#34; I patted her head, this cunning woman is the daughter I never had. If only Amara was more like her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will see you soon.&#34; She then bow her head before I left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amara&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve been here with them. I discovered that Kariz had the same abilities as I do. And the others Galaz, Ria, and Ali received his blood which turned them into a werewolf. Just like what happened before, I still</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of the second war flashed in my mind. The smell of blood lurking around me and that thirst to kill. I shove that memory into the back of my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance outside the window letting the sun hit my skin, the golden hour is about to start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remember the last time that I saw him...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the cold old gazebo in the garden that is full of withered plants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to keep being quiet?&#34; I glance up to see Galaz. He was still wearing his usual hoodie. But this I healed his scars. Making him stop using bandages to cover them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are still affected by him ha.&#34; He muttered, taking a little harsh tone in his statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t answer him and remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard the Royalties was cast out of the Factions.&#34; I look at him with surprise. Cast out? Why would they cast out their only ways to stop Kariz&#39;s plan?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t believe me?&#34; I didn&#39;t say anything but I know my reaction is giving it already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well then come with me. I&#39;ll show you that I wasn&#39;t lying about it.&#34; I know I shouldn&#39;t come with him. But the feeling of seeing him even if it&#39;s just a glance is tempting. I know this emotion aren&#39;t originally mine. It was Klaire&#39;s, the me who is still attached to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know that it wasn&#39;t just Klaire&#39;s emotion.&#34; My conscience whispered but I dismissed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During these past few days, I was here. The evidence that Kariz showed me were enough to prove that the Factions is involved with my parents&#39; death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their betrayal leads to this war. The memory I had in the laboratories, those deaths was all the results of their selfishness. If they wanted power then I will show them what true power is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you coming or not?&#34; Galaz muttered with boredom. At first, he was the quiet one but I was wrong. He was way too talkative around me. Maybe because his sister was around my age if she didn&#39;t die during the experiments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stand up and followed him. He shifted and told me to climb from his behind. It will help hide my scent if he will carry me. And with that, I climbed on his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Originally you need a boat to get to this place but there was a hidden passage that connect this place to the northern territory. The coldness of the wind brushes my skin as I held him tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Am I afraid to see him again? The memory of our first meeting crossed my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the time when I just got back to the dungeon and heard them talking about the new kid they got. I was curious at first but the look on the other kids&#39; faces when they saw made me afraid of being seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as I get to know him he was nicer than I expected. He even told me about the outside world. And his blonde hair, I&#39;m sure it will look more pretty once it hits the sunlight and I was right during the first time I met him as Klaire I was mesmerized by the way his hair glows with the help of the sunlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But unlike the Aiden I know, Dwayne was cruel and selfish. He rejected me as soon as he realized that I wasn&#39;t the perfect mate that he wanted. But he was right about that one thing... I wasn&#39;t perfect, especially the time that they were still asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You still there?&#34; Galaz voice whispered in my head. We can all communicate through our minds if we let the other one in. But there are limits to it. You need to be on each other&#39;s pack. But on my case, I don&#39;t need to belong to anyone&#39;s pack to be able to do it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just shut up!&#34; I mumbled he just chuckle and made his pace faster. We reach the pack territory after the next day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was already evening when reach the pack. He shifted back to his human form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See I told you.&#34; He mumbles we both watch from afar. The pack is having a gathering but there is a weird presence among them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you feel it too?&#34; He whispered, I nodded my head and scan the surroundings. I stop at the four people who are wearing a black cape. And when they took it off I almost curse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are they here,&#34; I uttered to myself. He then turns his head in the direction of who I&#39;m staring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Those damn bastards are the ones who took my sister!&#34; He mumbled to greet teeth. I can sense his anger rising.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Calm yourself. You wouldn&#39;t want them to know we are here.&#34; I said pulling him out of the view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fck!&#34; He then turned his back on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just come to the East Mansion when you are done before I couldn&#39;t control myself and start aiming for their throats.&#34; I just nodded my head and he vanish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just stood there watching them until I found him. My heart starts beating as soon as I saw him. He was talking to one of the Alpha, Cameron was his name if I am not mistaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looks calm right now. His hair was a little bit out of place but he looks way better than the last time that I saw him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t hear what they were talking about here but I&#39;m sure he doesn&#39;t like it. The way his expression changes, I almost laugh at it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then his eyes stay in one place and when I trace the direction of his stare my heart almost stops beating. He was staring at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clench my fist as I watch his expression change from being sour into a soft kind one. She wrapped her arms around his arms and they marched towards the center. Everyone stops as they stared at them. They started dancing under the moonlight. If looks like an image came out of a fairy tale movie. I couldn&#39;t help but curse at myself for feeling something at what I&#39;m seeing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did I even come here? I was here to make sure that Clint and the others are gone but this isn&#39;t what I came for. I was about to go when the next scene made my whole body stops. I don&#39;t know how long I held my breath as I watch them kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You shouldn&#39;t watch that.&#34; Galaz hands covered my eyes. I can feel my tears streaming down my cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shouldn&#39;t feel crying after everything they did to me. I shouldn&#39;t be affected because they all betrayed me in the first place. They lied to me and manipulated me. And he... He rejected me the first time that I met him. I shouldn&#39;t be acting like this anymore. I wasn&#39;t Klaire, I am now Amara!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came here because you were taking too long to come back.&#34; He muttered still covering my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t say anything about me crying, he then pulled me into his chest. I want to stop him but I can&#39;t find the strength to argue with him. I just stayed there until my tears stops. When I was calm enough he let me go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay now?&#34; I didn&#39;t answer him and remained silent. He then rolled his eyes at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that how you say thank you to someone who comforted you?&#34; He mumbled while holding his chest like he was hurt or something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just shut up,&#34; I mumbled, with a slight smile on my face. I started marching towards the east mansion and he followed from my behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously Amara. I&#39;m hurt you know.&#34; He said then started laughing. What a psycho!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we reach the East Mansion the place looks abandoned, it was too quiet. Even though nothing changed that much it still feels empty just like how I felt inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance at the familiar place where I stayed for quite a little while. I walk inside, nothing much changes like the outside. The same old furniture are still here. I went inside each room, their things are gone and when I entered my previous room I was surprised to see all my things are still here just like how I left it before I was taken my Rion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory I had here was when I decided to stop everything between us. His devastated look haunted me again. I close my eyes trying to erase that memory away. I walk towards the veranda another memory of him standing here flashes in my eyes. The way his green-blue eyes stared at me. It still gives me chills until now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance in the direction where he took me before. The place where we spend our first night together. I bite my lower lip trying to stop myself from crying again. I hated this feeling, I sealed them before in the past and I know I can do it again. Especially after I was fully awakened. I won&#39;t be able to feel this emotion anymore. No one can hurt me again when that time comes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze when I felt someone&#39;s presence heading our way and Galaz also appears in no time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone is coming, we have to go.&#34; He uttered and I nodded my head. As I take my first step, I stop as soon as the scent of mint and winter hits my nostrils.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance at Galaz wide open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was him,&#34; I said, not even wanting to believe it myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly pulled me in his arms and we jumped from the veranda. He tried masking my scent but it was too late. I know he will caught my scent in no time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have to hurry,&#34; I mumbled and he nodded his head. We both head towards the only exit that we could use. The hidden passage in the cliff. When we reach the coast we both jump.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure we could swim back?&#34; He asks, I know he finds our situation funny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes at him and swim towards the other side of the coast. I&#39;m sure there are no pack members around because of the celebration they have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just be quiet and we have to hurry. There might be some pack warriors around the area.&#34; When we reach the other side of the coastline. Some of the pack warrior is actually there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should I kill them?&#34; He whispered in my ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will only leave evidence that we are actually here.&#34; He look disappointed at my answer. I know he wanted to kill someone right now after he saw the people involve in his sister&#39;s death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then what are yo-&#34; before he can finish his sentence I walk straight out of the water. The pack warrior saw me but his reaction was slow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sleep,&#34; I whispered and in a second he fell to the ground fast asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Woah... I can&#39;t stop myself from being amazed every time you do that.&#34; He uttered. I didn&#39;t answer him and just stared at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh right.&#34; He said, then shifted to his wolf. I climbed at his back and we took off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Further away from you...</p>
