                <p>Yustef mutter as soon as they got out of our sight. He jumped into the second level of the deck. Once the coast is clear, Eliot followed, the second level is quite high but what do you expect from this three.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah and I used the entrance, we really just walk in inside like we own the place. The inside is full of boxes; we need to get upstairs to get some data that we could find. Noah started opening the boxes, he stopped once he finally saw what was inside. It was full of flowers, Red Spider Lily...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Flowers?&amp;quot; I hold out one. It is an eye-catching, coral red flower with a golden sheen that is adorned with elegant curl petals and exceptionally long stamens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah open another box and it was also full of flowers. Did we just do all this trouble just for a ship full of flowers? They probably will use these flowers during the succession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yustef and Eliot appear out of nowhere with the same expression as us. They also look confused. My eyes stared at Yustef who was investigating this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Something doesn&#39;t make sense.&amp;quot; Yustef muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Someone did come here before us and change the ship.&amp;quot; Yustef continues, his eyes staying on the boxes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;The scent of the ship is different from the previous one.&amp;quot; Yustef added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all stared at the boxes full of flowers silently. It only means someone is also watching our every move, they probably found out our movements, but how? In the end, we found nothing, not even a trace that Rogues used this ship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Let&#39;s go first and discuss this later. Someone is already coming.&amp;quot; Eliot said, we all agreed to it and decided to go back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we arrive, Clint was already there. He probably knew what happened already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We found nothing.&amp;quot; Noah uttered as we got inside. Clint didn&#39;t even look surprised by the result.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I figure, they are quite smarter than I thoughts,&amp;quot; Clint said, he took a sip from the glass of his wine. Yustef also pours himself a glass of wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I almost caught a rat roaming around here earlier. The rat jumps off the cliff as soon as I notice his presence.&amp;quot; Clint went to the window that showed the cliff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I didn&#39;t even notice he was around if not because of his carelessness. That rat also has the same...&amp;quot; Clint stopped and turned to face us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We already know what he was talking about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clint walks to me and cups my cheeks. I close my eyes as he continues to do so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We will protect you.&amp;quot; He muttered, I opened my eyes and gave him an encouraging smile to hide the fact that I was afraid of the possibilities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We won&#39;t be able to hide you anymore.&amp;quot; Clint stared at me, concern in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That statement made me stiff. Looks like, we won&#39;t have any other choice. I can feel my heart beating fast, blinking away all my worries I nodded my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;After the succession, we will tell them everything,&amp;quot; Clint announced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What about the traitor?&amp;quot; Eliot asks, he doesn&#39;t seem to like the idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It will help us to get less wary. Also, the traitor will probably keep us more in check.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, Clint was right. If they keep their tabs on us, then we could do something to identify who is behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We already knew someone from the faction is a traitor, and we were quite sure that it was a high rank one. It could even be one of the Alphas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Before that, did you find anything interesting in the passage?&amp;quot; Clint was directing the question to Noah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They already check first the passage yesterday, not letting other packs check it before them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We found nothing except for this.&amp;quot; Noah showed us a necklace that he took out of his pocket. It has the markings of the South Lake Pack. Bloodstains are still visible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It probably belongs to one of the pack members who went missing after the last attack,&amp;quot; I mumbled, remembering what happened that time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I thought so too. But something is questionable. There aren&#39;t even traces of a large amount of blood that indicates they used that passage to drag them down.&amp;quot; Eliot utter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;There is only one way to find out,&amp;quot; Eliot added and took the necklace from Noah. Eliot closed his eyes, and once he opened, his eyes were glowing. He has the ability of vision, whenever he holds something. He can already see what happened to the person who owns the thing he was holding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I can&#39;t see anything; it was just shadows. I can hear the voices and growling of wolves.&amp;quot; Eliot closes his eyes again, returning to normal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Someone is blocking me.&amp;quot; Eliot utter. He put his hands on his head trying to massage his forehead. &amp;quot;Those shadows are the same thing that attack us before.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clint remains silent as well as Yustef.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We also did encounter them during on our way here. They sure do want to stop us but not to the extent of killing us.&amp;quot; Yustef said while staring at the window. His hands clenched his shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone is playing with us, and we are being played.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that I remember, I haven&#39;t seen any of their cars since they arrived. Meaning they rush here on their paws.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After our talk, I finally end up staying in my room. They even don&#39;t want me to stay in my room after the incident before. There are so many things that happened in my short stay here. Twisting every inch of me, it was suffocating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went outside to get some fresh air, and to get my thoughts straight. Everything became blurry since I came here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clint&#39;s words stuck in my head, after the succession, everything would be revealed. My stomach was starting to turn just by thinking about their reactions...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at my reflection on the water in the fountain. The moon shined just above me. My hair was swinging as the air blows, which was calming. I closed my eyes trying to feel this period of time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes snap opened when I heard some tree branches breaking. Looking at the direction where the sound came from...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I found Yustef there standing just a few feet away from me. He was holding a bottle of wine in his left hand and two glasses on his right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I figure that you will be here.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smile at his thoughtfulness. He gave me the glasses and pour me a glass of wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It&#39;s been a while since we last did this.&amp;quot; Yustef smiled at the memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yeah, it&#39;s been a while.&amp;quot; I agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, we always end up staying up all night because we can&#39;t sleep. The nightmare that we&#39;ve been through is still hunting us during that time. We will sneak out to the garden and stay in the fountain at the center of the maze-like garden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Do you still have nightmares?&amp;quot; I blurted out, the wine is probably kicking in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was stop for a while to think and nodded at the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I always end up waking up in the middle of the night feeling like everything is still happening before my eyes.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew what he meant by that. The hell-like experience was something we couldn&#39;t easily forget.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;But it wasn&#39;t that bad anymore like before.&amp;quot; He added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t say anything. I know he was lying and just want to make me feel a little bit better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both remain silent after that and stare at the sky above us. I pulled my knees closer to my chest hugging myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Let&#39;s go inside, it is starting to get colder here.&amp;quot; He suggested, I narrow my brow at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Werewolves aren&#39;t supposed to feel cold because of their body temperature,&amp;quot; I said. He just shook his head and patted my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Well, you aren&#39;t one, so get inside already. We don&#39;t want you to end up with getting a cold, do we?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just rolled my eyes at Yustef. He should know better than anyone that the cold is nothing to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Okay, I&#39;m going inside,&amp;quot; I mutter laughing. Sometimes I don&#39;t know what they see me as. They even treat me like a child sometimes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clint was still awake when I went inside. He was holding some documents in his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;For the succession?&amp;quot; I asked, pointing at the papers he was holding. Why would they even need papers as documents?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yes, I will be one of the elders to lead the succession rights.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I see...&amp;quot; I nodded my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remembering the time where they usually tell me about the succession rights that he attended before. How the process was like coronation except for the crowns?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words of Rion earlier came to mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clint probably notices the changes in my mood. He left the papers on top of the table and walked towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stroked some strands of hair away from my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m sorry...&amp;quot;</p>
