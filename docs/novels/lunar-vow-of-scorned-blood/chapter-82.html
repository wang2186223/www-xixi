                <p>Amara&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was running towards and endless place, it was so dark that I couldn&#39;t even see where I was going. And someone or something is following me from my behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could hear its footsteps and it was getting close. I keep running and running until I found a tree and hid behind it. Now I was in a forest, I covered my mouth trying not to make a sound. I can hear the growling sound of the one that is chasing me. And it was right behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart was pounding so fast, and when it was finally quiet. I slowly step away from the tree and tried to take a peak if it was still there. But then, something drops in my head, it was like a liquid? I touch my hair and almost scream when I notice it was blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My whole body was trembling as I slowly lifted my head...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amara?!&#34; I opened my eyes and found Galaz staring at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34; I ask unsure what just happened. He stared at me with a weird look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is what I should ask you. Look at yourself you are naked and only covering yourself with this cloth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look down at what I was wearing and it was a white cloth that was big enough to cover my whole body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what is weird is that my feet are full of mud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did just happened?&#34; I ask him and he just answered me with the same confused look that I had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should be the one asking that.&#34; I ignored him and look around. I was inside Galaz room, I remember that I told him to sleep and then after that I woke up in this state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here, wear this first and use the bathroom so you could get yourself clean.&#34; I didn&#39;t say anything and pulled the large black long sleeve he was holding and went straight to the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What just happened? I close my eyes and let the water run to my body. I cleaned my feet and let myself dry. After I was done I went outside and found Galaz sitting at the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Feeling better?&#34; He ask, I nodded my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are you feeling?&#34; I ask, trying to keep my mind away from the thoughts of why I was on that state earlier. And looks like he notice my change of subject and I was surprised that he just let me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They still hurt, but I was feeling much better than before.&#34; He mumbled, I caught a glance at the sketch book again. This is my chance to ask him about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you have a drawing with Dwayne&#39;s father?&#34; He didn&#39;t look surprised at my question, but it seems like he was hesitant to answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You saw that huh.&#34; He mumbled, but then didn&#39;t say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you don&#39;t want to answer it then let me change my question to why do you have drawings of me?&#34; His face turned red when I said that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You even saw that?&#34; I nodded my head. He did saw me checking his sketch book right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know. Kariz always made me watch over you before and I just found myself sketching you.&#34; He mumbled then turned his back on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since when did you start to watch me?&#34; I couldn&#39;t help myself but ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right from the time where you encountered Ali, after that I was the one assigned to keep an eyes on you.&#34; Don&#39;t tell me he saw everything. My eyes widen upon realization. And he didn&#39;t seems like he was denying it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You saw everything?&#34; He laughed at my words, like he just caught me doing something bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes and no, don&#39;t worry whenever that Alpha was around, I don&#39;t usually follow you. I wasn&#39;t so fond of romance movies you know?&#34; And he started laughing. I smack his arms hard which made him whimpers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit! Are you planning on killing me?&#34; I rolled my eyes at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you don&#39;t stop I will.&#34; I mumbled, then head to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks for the clothes. And please keep whatever happens today to yourself.&#34; I mumbled, then left him. I went straight to my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did just happened?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I close my eyes trying to remember what happened but still nothing. All I could remember is that vivid dream I had before Galaz woke me up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the ceiling how long was I asleep? Because when I glance at the window the sun was about to set. What should I do now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I jump off my bed and change to my clothes, Galaz clothes smells like him. The scent of fresh spring, totally opposite to his dark looks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I think I would walk around, I opened the door and head outside where I could go for a run. I found Clint not so far from me, he was also running his wolf was shining in the field. When he notice my presence, his wolf run towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands automatically brush against his white fur, closing my eyes. I did missed him. And I know he could feel it as he close his eyes. We stayed like that for a while until I let him go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lay down next to me and I sat next to him. I was planning on going for a run but looks like I wouldn&#39;t be able to do it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been a while since we last did this.&#34; I mumbled, he scoff his head closer to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was my fault.&#34; He mumbled in my head. I shaked my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know that all of this wouldn&#39;t happened if not because of me.&#34; I said, recalling how much we all suffered both in our past life and now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A lot of things happened and you wouldn&#39;t be able to stop them all Klaire.&#34; He answered, Klaire... It&#39;s been a while since I heard that name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t say anything to him and just keep silent. We just remained like that until the others arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you all just by yourselves?&#34; Noah mumbled, and took a seat next to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was really unfair of you two.&#34; Eliot joined in and sat next to Clint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could you all forget me?&#34; Yustef uttered, who just arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We aren&#39;t here for a picnic you know.&#34; I mumbled, they all ignored me and continue to talk to each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well wasn&#39;t it nice to have a giant pillow here.&#34; Noah then lean his back to Clint. He growled at him but he just ignored him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others also did the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, you are right about that Noah. &#34; Eliot said, then tried to fixed Clints fur to his liking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously? Can you both shut up?&#34; Yustef uttered, trying to pretend that he was about to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clint couldn&#39;t stop himself and started kicking them one by one. They just laughed at each other. And I couldn&#39;t stop myself but smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This feels like the old times when we are still back in the Central Kingdom. I usually climb to Clint when we run towards the field, and we usually use him as a cushion. Because he was the biggest back then. And now all of them are almost the same size.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve seen you smile.&#34; Clint uttered, resting his head on my shoulders. I stroke his face and close my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wish we could stay like this, but we can&#39;t.&#34; I uttered, then stood up and start heading back inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all tried to call out for me but I just ignored them. I couldn&#39;t let myself be back into that delusions that we could still be the same like before. Because we all knew that everything has change.</p>
