                <p>Klaire&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes grow wide after hearing his name. F**k! Why did I have to run into another Alpha?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I heard there is a human who arrive with one of the royalties. I guess that was you.&amp;quot; His statement is not even a question. I didn&#39;t answer. I slip into my hoodie; I have to get out of here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Thank you for the help but I gotta go.&amp;quot; I wouldn&#39;t go there if I were. My hand stopped at the door knob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;My pack members just arrived, and you probably know that our pack hated humans.&amp;quot; He added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was right, his pack was known for their hatred towards humans. Because most of their pack dies in the hand of hunters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Then what about you?&amp;quot; He shrugged his shoulders and smiled at me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What I know is what I felt about you is quite the opposite. In fact, I kinda find you interesting.&amp;quot; I just stared at him in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You should stop that interest while it was still early. It won&#39;t do you any good.&amp;quot; I scan at his room; it was huge like my room back in the East Mansion. Thick dark walls, concrete floorings. You can smell the smell fresh scent of woods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stop at the table in the left corner of his room. A book rested on it, it was an old book. The legends about the old war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Have you read that one?&amp;quot; I flinch when I felt him behind me. I didn&#39;t even feel his presence getting near me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Everybody knows about that, even humans know about that legend.&amp;quot; I took a step away from him and continue my walk around his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Well humans believe it was just a legend. But we both know it was not just a simple legend.&amp;quot; I stop on my track and stared at him. He was also staring at me with his hazel eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Have you ever thought that maybe what we were thought about is all a lie?&amp;quot; He added. I froze at his statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He continued to flip the book on his hands. The book he was holding is not even the original one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Maybe? Maybe not.&amp;quot; I shrugged and continue walking around. I trace the Golden markings, the lake that flows endlessly as the moon shines upon it. The letters that spell the South Lake Pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Did you know the reason why it was called the South Lake Pack?&amp;quot; I didn&#39;t answer him and let him continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Back then during the war, they believe that the South Lake turned into a bloodbath, because of the number of death the lake turns red. Then after the war ended the moon shines so bright that it cleanses the lake back to its original state. That was also the reason why the markings look like that.&amp;quot; I just nodded my head and glance at the window. You can hear his pack members playing around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They took their shirt off and ran to the forest, their serious look showed that something happened. They are about 10 if I&#39;m not mistaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I think your pack members are already gone.&amp;quot; I didn&#39;t wait for him to answer and walk myself out of his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can hear his footsteps behind me. The Mansion has the same features like the east mansion where we resided. Except that this one has a huge staircase connecting the right side of the building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I guess; I can&#39;t stop you then.&amp;quot; The entrance is already in front of me when another member of his pack cane running back to the Mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was bleeding</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rion was already on the door before he even arrives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What happened? Where are the others Lindon?&amp;quot; He guided him inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lindon looked shock for a moment because of my presence but focus on his attention to Rion who is now on the verge of killing someone. He tosses a cover to Lindon to hide his nakedness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We were attacked; we don&#39;t know who they are. They look like werewolves but when we fought with them they vanish in thin air. They are too fast for us to identify where they are. Before I know it, everyone is gone.&amp;quot; Lindon explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I will look for them; can you please stay here with him.&amp;quot; Before I could even utter a word Rion was already gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is not good, I have to warn Clint about it but before that I have to help this guy and ran to where Rion is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Who are you? Why are you with him?&amp;quot; I help him to stand he wanted to argue but he had no choice, his abdomen is bleeding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Who am I is not important; I was with him because he help me earlier.&amp;quot; My answer doesn&#39;t seem to satisfied him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Look, I also don&#39;t wanna be involved with him. What you need to do right now is shut up and hold this.&amp;quot; I told him to keep the pressure to his wound to stop the bleeding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;The first aid is at the cabinet in the corner.&amp;quot; Now he was back to his senses. I followed his instructions and opened the cabinet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I first cleaned his wound before applying some medicine and ointment. I bandaged it and he didn&#39;t badge. After I was done I look at him trying to find another wound. But only his abdomen needs a huge medical attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Call for the pack doctor to get your wounds check.&amp;quot; I instructed, I pull my hair tie in my pocket and tied my hair up into a ponytail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Where are you going? It was dangerous out there.&amp;quot; He asked, he was now trying to get up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Stop moving around, your wounds will reopen.&amp;quot; Glancing back to the forest, I wonder what happened to Rion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I have to go.&amp;quot; I went to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Where are you going?&amp;quot; Rion enter, he was carrying two of his pack members they are both bleeding and unconscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lays them carefully in the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I found them unconscious, bleeding not too far from the east mansion.&amp;quot; He added eyeing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;How about the others?&amp;quot; Lindon asked, he didn&#39;t answer but his fist tighten at the thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;They are all dead.&amp;quot;Rion closed his eyes and that came out as a whisper. We all remain silent</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pack doctor arrived quickly with Clint and Alpha Brent. They are both shock to know I was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clint went to my direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Why are you here? And what happened?&amp;quot; He asked as soon as he was beside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Another attack this time, they weren&#39;t normal rogues.&amp;quot; I glance back at the still unconscious pack members of the South Lake, Rion and Lindon was also busy answering the questions of Alpha Brent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I think they are the same Rogues who attack us back then.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flashback of what happened a month ago flooded in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A month ago:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were both on our way back to the Central Kingdom. I was exhausted enough because of the sudden event earlier. Clint remain quiet the whole ride back to the Central Kingdom. I can feel my eyes swollen because of crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just stared outside the window, watching the trees pass us, when something caught my attention. I look back to where I saw a huge shadow pass by. It was so fast that I didn&#39;t get to what it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I yanked as a huge shadow slam into us causing Clint to lose control of the car. We almost crash into the oak tree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you okay?&amp;quot; Clint ask, taking his seatbelt off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot; I mutter and followed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both got out of the car, there are 5 werewolves standing a few feet away from us. But something is different about them. They snarl at us showing their big teeth, their size is much larger than a normal Rogue. And their eyes are red. I have a bad feeling about this. I know too well what those red eyes means.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clint move in front of me trying to hide me away from them. He shifted to his wolf, His wolf is almost the same size as them. He growled at them, the ground started to shake as his growl grow louder making me close my ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Be careful.&amp;quot; I shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t glance back. He strikes the first wolf on his right but they dodge it. They are really fast; I didn&#39;t even see him jump. Clint was also shock about what happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Clint behind you!&amp;quot; The brown wolf caught him, he bit his lower abdomen. Making Clint whimper in pain. Blood stain his silver white fur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was now surrounded by them, Clint rise to his feet. His golden eyes glowing, I can feel his power radiating and I&#39;m not the only one who felt it. The rogues started to step back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clint growl at them once more, they growl back at him. They really don&#39;t want to back off. Two of them rush to us but something stops them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all walk backwards trying to hide from something? Then it hit me. The familiar smell of him made my whole body shiver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clint rush towards me. I look around my surroundings trying to locate where he is. He also done the same thing. But we found nothing, I can even sense his presence only the faint scent of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;He is here.&amp;quot; I whispered</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A loud crash snap me out of that memory. We both stared the person who just arrived, who also his staring back at me with his green blue eyes</p>
