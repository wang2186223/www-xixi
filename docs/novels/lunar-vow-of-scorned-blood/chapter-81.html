                <p>&#34;Renz I did warned you to not use any weapon. Yet you have this and it wasn&#39;t just a simple knife. It was made of silver and it has a scent of wolfsbane in it.&#34; Dale said, while pointing at the small knife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dale turn his head at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay? You didn&#39;t receive any bruises right?&#34; He ask, I shake my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was able to dodge all his attacks.&#34; I uttered, Renz was just glaring at me and still trying to get away from Dale&#39;s hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take Renz to the plaza and collar him. This is what will happened to those who still wish to break the rules.&#34; He uttered, two guards appear and took Renz. He was still shouting that he will kill me but I ignored him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This would be the end of our training for today. You are all dismissed.&#34; The crowd then dispersed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What a lunatic.&#34; Alec mumbled besides me. If I won earlier I would be facing Alec who was also one of the remaining standing in the field after beating everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How disappointing, I was actually looking forward on having a sparring with you.&#34; He mumbled while staring at Renz who is being dragged away from here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We could still fight in the arena.&#34; I uttered then grabbing a glass of water. That was prepared for us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like it, I will be ready by that time.&#34; He uttered, he had a smirk written in his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see.&#34; I answered then grabbed my shirt. As I walk, I decided that since I was smelling like sweat already, why not let my wolf run.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So instead of heading straight to my room I turn to the corner and went to the woods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My wolf was finally release, he doesn&#39;t like the feeling that those werewolves are looking down at him. Because he was still an Alpha. So he let out his frustrations to his prey. Just like before he hunts again and finish them off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We are now chasing a deer which is heading at the cliff side of the forest. We need to catch him before it could run away. But before we reach it, something caught my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the place that I always goes to whenever I wanted to be alone. I slowly made my way towards the tree trunk. I shifted back to my human form. Closing my eyes, all I could hear is the chirping of the birds, the wind brushing on the trees as they swing and hit each other, the ocean waves hitting the walls of the cliff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smell of moist on the ground, the salty smell of the ocean. It was like up here everything is just so peaceful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat down on the tree trunk, then something flash in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goodbye.&#34; I turn around to look for the person who said that but no one is here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Am I imagining things again? But then a flash of a dark haired woman sleeping next to me just like in my dream. Her head was resting in my chest as she sleeps soundly. I can&#39;t help but smile at that thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait? What is wrong with me? I shake my head once more trying to erase her out of my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I touch the trunk of the tree and now that I notice there are wild flowers blooming at the bottom part of it. Their petals are black at the tip buy white in most part of it. I don&#39;t know why but that woman came across my mind when I saw them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit! Dwayne you are really crazy.&#34; I whispered to myself. No one knew this place anyway except me. Or so I thought? I glance up and found some unfamiliar markings on the trees. They are claw marks, but unlike a regular werewolf this once are longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The creature that we encountered at the dark forest cross my mind. But that would be impossible. If that creature even tried to cross the border we will know. Especially after everything that happened before most of the area are guarded 24/7. So who did this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I remember Renz unusual behavior. Because earlier he was acting like he was under something because he was too angry to the point that he tried to attack everyone who tried to stop him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shifted back to my wolf and tried to track the scent of the one who did this but I found nothing. The scent was actually not clear, I couldn&#39;t locate the exact location where that thing came. But then I notice some claw marks from some trees and followed it. Why didn&#39;t I saw this things before? I followed them until I was stop in front of the East Mansion. Again this place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk towards the door and swung it opened, the place still looks the same. No markings of intruders or anyone who tried to hide here. I check the upstairs and found nothing. Then I checked each room and found nothing. Until I stop to the last room that I haven&#39;t check, it was the room next to the veranda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know why, but my heart was pounding hard as I felt my hands starting to sweat when I grabbed the door knob. The door swung open and I was surprised to find someone sleeping in the bed. The scent of vanilla reach my nostrils. Her black hair was facing me as she was sleeping facing the veranda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t wearing anything, the light coming from the outside was shining her pale skin. I slowly walk my way towards her, not wanting to make any sounds that could result for her to wake up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was trying to hold by breath as I get close. Afraid that she will hear my heart beating so fast. What is wrong with me. I pick up the cloth in the chair and slowly covered her naked body. At first I thought she was dead or something and felt relieve when I heard her breathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why are you acting like this Dwayne? She was trespassing! I scolded myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmmm.&#34; I stop breathing when she move. Oh shit! Did I wake her up?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dwayne? Are you here?&#34; Fuck! I watch in horror as she slowly move. Wait what should I do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran downstairs and went to where Sarah is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; I ask her, she narrow her eyes at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I woke up, you are gone. Then I heard about the incident in the training. Are you okay?&#34; I don&#39;t know why I was acting like this like I was hiding something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine Sarah, it was just a small incident. And about what I was doing here is that I was chasing a deer earlier then it went inside. But when tried to find it, it was gone. It probably run to the backdoor.&#34; She narrow her eyebrows. She look suspicious. I hesitantly glance upstairs, wondering if that woman was awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you hiding something Dwayne?&#34; Before I could even answer she ran upstairs and went inside the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait Sarah, I s-&#34; before I could finish my sentence. I was stunned at Sarah sitting at the bed alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait? Where did she go? I look around and still found nothing not even a glimpse of her vanilla scent was left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why is your face like that Dwayne?&#34; She was checking the room. Checking the closet, bathroom and even the veranda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you hiding here Dwayne? Why aren&#39;t you saying anything.&#34; I couldn&#39;t even find my tongue to utter anything. Was I imagining again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was not hiding anything Sarah, I told you I came here because of the deer that my wolf wants.&#34; I mumbled, Sarah then gave up and cling on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was really worried about you earlier. I thought something bad happened to you that&#39;s why I came running looking for you. And this is the last place that cross my mind so I went here. And to my surprise you are really here.&#34; I don&#39;t know why but I felt her last words was sarcasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s just get out of here. This place makes me feel stuffy.&#34; She mumbled and pulled me outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was silent the whole time we head back to the pack house. I was so sure that she was real earlier but now? I don&#39;t know anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ve been seeing things lately and it was making me more confused. There is only one thing to know if she was real and what I saw earlier wasn&#39;t just my imagination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When came across the plaza where Renz was being tied up and collar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You go ahead first, I will talk to him first.&#34; I mumbled at Sarah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure? He just tried to kill you earlier.&#34; She said hesitantly. She was looking back to me then to Renz.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, just get back first. I will find you when I&#39;m done.&#34; I mumbled, she didn&#39;t say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Promise, I will be careful.&#34; I uttered and kissed the top of her head. She then nodded her head and started walking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now I need to talk to him. I made my way towards Renz who had his head down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; He sounded more calmer now compare to earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to talk to you about Ryan&#39;s death.&#34; Just mentioning his brothers name shifted his mood. I can smell her anger and sadness in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What else do you want to say? He was dead already and I didn&#39;t even saw his body.&#34; His voice broke, indication that he was about to cry. But I know he was stopping himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I apologize that I was not able to save your brother and like you said, I was embarrassed about it myself. We were attack by some kind of creature, it was something that we didn&#39;t expect. And Ryan, that thing killed him.&#34; I mumbled, and he couldn&#39;t stop his tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was the only family I had. And earlier I don&#39;t know what&#39;s gotten into me but I was so mad that I couldn&#39;t think straight.&#34; He confessed, and I know he was telling the truth because now that I could remember them clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was the younger brother of Ryan their parents both died during the Rogue attack during our first shift, he even tried to join the training earlier even if he was still young. But I can say that his skills is are something commendable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand, and don&#39;t worry. I will talk to Dale to get you out of here.&#34; He look at me with surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shouldn&#39;t you be mad? I tried to kill you and based on what Dale said the knife I used had a wolfsbane in it.&#34; He uttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not mad and if I was also in your situation. I would probably do worse than what you did.&#34; I uttered. He didn&#39;t say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I still have to ask you about something. Where did you get that knife.&#34; He started to think for a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wasn&#39;t sure, I couldn&#39;t remember anything. All I could remember was when I woke up today and saw you during the training. All I could think is kill you. I&#39;m embarrassed about what I did. I apologize.&#34; He mumbled, while looking down on his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tap his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, I was still alive and you should have brought a bigger weapon if you really want to kill me.&#34; I mumbled, then turn my back on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looks like someone really wanted me dead. But who it was? Knowing my situation I wasn&#39;t even surprised to find someone aiming for my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was already midnight and Sarah was sleeping soundly, I slowly lifted the cover and went straight towards the door. I need to go back to where I saw those markings. Because that is the only way that leads me to the East Mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of her laying on that bed cross my mind, her silky black hair was long enough to cover some of her body. Her pale white skin was glowing, and her face... I didn&#39;t see it because before I could even, Sarah came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shifted to my wolf and started running towards the woods. I went straight first to where I saw the markings earlier. When I got there I stared looking for the tree that had a marking. I stop right in front of it, feeling my heart pounding in my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closing my eyes at first then letting out a deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please be here.&#34; I whispered to myself before opening my eyes. My eyes went wide when I found nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tree was completely okay, and there were no markings on it. I move to the other trees and just like the first one, no markings. I still continued to look for the trees that I saw earlier and to my disappoinment non of them had the markings that I saw earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shifted back and slip into some clothes before stopping at the East Mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at it for a while. What is with this place? That I am seeing this kind of things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know what is wrong with me but I made my way inside, towards the familiar stairs, up to the last room where I saw her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door was close and just like earlier I can&#39;t help but feel nervous. I close my eyes at first then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Open the door loudly...</p>
