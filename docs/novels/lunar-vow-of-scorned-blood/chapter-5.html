                <p>Dwayne&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got myself up earlier than usual and had my way to the bathroom. I heard that the royalties are coming here to discuss something about the war which is getting out of hand with the rogue king.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We don&#39;t particularly like the Central Kingdom but they hold this unknown power and the way they kept everything to themselves is intriguing and their numbers are unknown. What we know is they are smaller in terms of number over the other factions. But they are not to mess with. That was the exact word my father said as he talks about their arrival last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a warm shower to get myself back to my senses. I kind of feel weird since this morning especially my wolf, he is starting to feel restless. And it was making me nervous a bit and excited? Then something hit my nostrils, the familiar scent of sweet vanilla. This can&#39;t be?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hurried out of the bathroom and grab my clothes which are already lying on my bed. I sniffed the air and found her scent getting stronger. My wolf is getting excited with joy while I don&#39;t know what to do. I just want to see her beautiful face and feel her warm again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened the door and found Zion standing right next to my door. I almost forgot that I haven&#39;t talked to him for ages since that incident 3 days ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Where do you think you&#39;re going?&amp;quot; He said, I gave him a wolfish smile which he didn&#39;t expect. He looks surprised by my sudden changes knowing that I was nothing but a walking time bomb this past few days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Looks like you&#39;re back to normal? What gets into you?&amp;quot; He asked unsure. I didn&#39;t answer him and turned my back to run downstairs but he stopped me before I could even open the door. I stared at him annoyed by his interruption.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You can&#39;t. The royalties are here and the Alpha forbids you from getting out of your room after your sudden outbursts,&amp;quot; he said while giving me his serious look. I growl at him as my wolf is getting more impatient as we stay here. I can smell her scent from where we are standing and I know she&#39;s right next door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Let me go to Zion,&amp;quot; I growl to warn him but he didn&#39;t bother instead he holds my arms and tried to drag me but I was stronger than him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You can&#39;t Dwayne.&amp;quot; My wolf is getting angrier right now for him stopping us to see our mate. I growl at him but this time I used my Alpha blood and he bows his head down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wolf: &amp;quot;Mate! I can feel she is here!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My wolf howl in happiness as we reach the door but Zion stopped us again and this time I snapped. I growled louder that I can feel the whole pack now shaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;LET ME GO ZION, SHE&#39;S HERE!&amp;quot; I groaned and he let go, the door bursts out open, and found her there staring right back at me with her blue-grey eyes. My wolf jumps from excitement as he looks at our mate who is nowhere and in just one snap I forgot everything that I&#39;ve been through when she left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Ma--&amp;quot; Before I even utter a word someone pulled her arm and my head snap angrily at that person. He held her in his arms which made my wolf furious! Don&#39;t you dare touch what&#39;s mine! My wolf is itching to take over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wolf: &amp;quot;Get your hands off her, she is mine!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My wolf wanted to rip him apart until he can&#39;t be recognized. I let out a loud growl as my wolf started to get out. I watch her stare at me with wide eyes which make my breath stop. I can&#39;t believe it! She&#39;s here standing right in front of my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you okay?&amp;quot; My head snaps once she looks away and stared at the bastard next to him. I&#39;m gonna kill him! I was about to shift when my father used his Alpha voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;DWAYNE STOP RIGHT THERE!&amp;quot; My father&#39;s voice boomed out and I found my wolf stop from getting out of the surface. He was still my Alpha so basically; my wolf will still listen to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stop from my track and look in her direction. And it almost breaks me when she looks at me with her emotionless eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cold and emotionless eyes stared back at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Dwayne get back there.&amp;quot; My father said I didn&#39;t move an inch and just stare at my mate. My wolf started to panic about the way she looks at us. He whimpered in pain but still felt the joy of seeing our mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;No!&amp;quot; I growl and took a step toward her a loud tug filled the air as I felt myself against the wall. A loud growl escape in my throat but he didn&#39;t bother he just stood there staring at me with his gray-blue eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Let go!&amp;quot; My voice started to change. A roar erupted in the air and my bones started snapping. He was fast enough to ditch my attack. He even gave me a smug smile. My anger rises again and this time I&#39;m aiming for the kill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My wolf fully took over and he was angry. He just wants to be with our mate. He digs his paws on the ground ready to attack. The bastard just smirks and the snapping of bones started as the big silver-white wolf appeared. He was a little bit bigger than my wolf but nonetheless. I will kill him and take off that smirk on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My wolf lets out a loud growl. My teeth show as I run to his wolf for the attack. He was fast enough to jump and attack us, but my wolf was angry enough and found a way to bite his legs. A whine erupted from his wolf. I can feel my wolf smirking right now, he even tightened his bite. I can taste his blood in my mouth. But what surprised me is when he bites my shoulders, a groan escaped from my mouth. His teeth dug further in my flesh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My wolf took another bite in his legs breaking his bones. My wolf even wants to rip off his legs as I remember how he touched our mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He found a way to flip us around. A groan escape in my mouth when I hit the hard concrete wall. My wolf shakes his head angrily. We stood there both watching each other. His gray eyes watch us closely waiting for our next move. My wolf didn&#39;t wait any longer to attack but a sudden pain stops us. My wolf lets out a loud cry as we felt the unbearable pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;That&#39;s enough you two.&amp;quot; A sweet voice erupted in the air it was like music to my ears. But the unbearable pain snaps me from admiring her voice. My wolf whines in pain and her eyes snap instantly in my direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watch her walk in my enemy&#39;s direction which makes my wolf let out a growl. He hated it just like how I hated it. The pain I had right now is nothing compared to what I felt whenever she stared at me with her cold eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again she looks in my direction and the pain stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You don&#39;t need to do that.&amp;quot; I snap from what I&#39;ve heard. The bastard is now in his human form. My anger emerged when I heard his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Enough.&amp;quot; She mutters but I can feel the authority in her words. My wolf just stands at the back of my mind and lets my human instinct take over. I run into the woods and grabbed a pair of jeans in the wood as I change into my human form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I have to Clint.&amp;quot; Her voice echoed in my head like a piece of beautiful music. They look at me once I walked out of the wood. But I keep my eyes locked on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You shouldn&#39;t be standing right now if not to your Alpha blood.&amp;quot; He mutters, my blood is still evident in his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;And you should be dead by now.&amp;quot; I hissed, he just smirked. I wanted to get that smirks on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I want to watch you try.&amp;quot; A growl erupted in the air coming from my father. He is mad and in his Alpha mode.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension in the air became heavier and darker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Okay, that&#39;s enough. Let&#39;s go inside and discuss it more calmly.&amp;quot; My mother&#39;s sweet voice snap, the tension submerged. She lets out a sweet smile and pulls my father inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I shouldn&#39;t be here&amp;quot; I heard her whisper. I look in her direction with adoration and our eyes meet but no emotion is evident in them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Mate&amp;quot; those words suddenly escape from my mouth. A glimpse of emotion appears in her eyes but was consumed by hatred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You are no mate for me.&amp;quot; Those words are like a tornado in my head, taking away all the hope that I hold. It was a nauseating gut-wrenching sadness that I never feel to come close to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And for the hundredth time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hate it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hated myself!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just stood there broken as I watch her walk away from me...</p>
