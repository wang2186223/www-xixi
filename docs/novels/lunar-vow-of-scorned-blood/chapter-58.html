                <p>Dwayne&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scan her empty room, inhaling her scent. Closing my eyes as I imagine her here with, how her voice sounded, the way her pale skin flush because of anger as she hated me. I chuckle to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haha! She hated me...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I walk further to her room something reach my nostrils. An unfamiliar scent. This can&#39;t be? I jump from the terrace and shifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shit please tell me I was right. I ran faster but all I can see and hear is the wave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Am I going crazy? I thought I caught her scent and that scent I remembered it was the same somehow similar to the scent in the Island. I thought perhaps they came here. But I guess it was all in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I came back to the packhouse feeling a bit tired frome everything that is happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart is pounding so hard that it hurt so much. I can&#39;t remember the last time I look forward to a new day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Father wake up! Breakfast is ready.&#34; I opened my eyes and found a pair of gold and red eyes staring at me. His small hands was shaking my arms trying to woke me up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34; I ask unsure, now that I took a glance at my surroundings I was inside a small bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you talking about father? Are you still half asleep again?&#34; He frowned at me then cross his arms around his her chest. He has a blonde hair like mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; I ask still unsure. And there the sound of someone cooking followed by the smell of fresh bake break and soup reach my nostrils making my stomach crumble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom!! Look Dad is being weird.&#34; He ran towards the door and I slowly followed him still unsure where am I.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come here baby, maybe daddy is still a bit sleepy. Remember you were also like that yesterday.&#34; It was a woman&#39;s voice, her voice was soft and comforting. But it sounded familiar?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I reach the Dining area the woman&#39;s back is facing me. Her hair was tied into a bun and she was carrying the child from earlier. His small frame was just right on her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad!&#34; He jump from her and run towards me pulling me to the dining table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Common I&#39;m hungry Dad!&#34; Dad? His been calling me that since earlier. Am I still dreaming? And where is this place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay sweetheart here&#39;s your food and let your dad settled first.&#34; She turn around and I froze. She still look beautiful like how I remember her. Her eyes and red and gold like the child. I felt some butterflies in my stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Klaire...&#34; Her lips automatically form a smile when she heard her name. She was holding some cup of tea in her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes honey? What&#39;s wrong? Are you okay?&#34; She ask concerned, Is this really happening? Did she just call me honey?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad? Mom is asking you.&#34; I glance at the direction of my child? He was munching some bacon in her mouth. I grab the napkin and wipe off the grease in her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No honey, I&#39;m okay.&#34; I mumbled, now that I notice this child look just like her except for his hair and the shape of his eyes. He had my almond like shape eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll get you some soup, wait.&#34; She was about to stand but I stop her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will do it, you just sit there and eat I&#39;ll handle this.&#34; I uttered then kissed the top of her head before I grab the bowl of soup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are acting weird today.&#34; She said while watching me with her gorgeous eyes. I wink at her and her cheeks flush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just want to serve my Queen and my little prince.&#34; Our child chuckles and she was shaking her head as if I just said something silly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? I&#39;m serious.&#34; I mumbled then smiled at her. I lay the bowl beside her then took some for our child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad I wanna go eat some ice cream later.&#34; He whispered at me. I even lean closer just so he can reach my ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh that&#39;s a no Drane, you just had one yesterday.&#34; So his name is Drane. I smiled at the thought of naming him after me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was then looking at me like she was telling me not to let him get ice cream. I just nodded my head at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad you promise once I finish my school early.&#34; He mumbled then pouting his lips. He had her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I brush his hair which made him pout even more. I giggled on how adorable he looks like right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad I&#39;m not a kid anymore. I told you to stop treating me like one.&#34; He mumbled while sinking further to his chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay I will stop. You are right you were not a little kid anymore.&#34; I stop for a moment. &#34;But you know that ice cream are only for kids.&#34; I added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But...&#34; He look defeated, Klaire was only watching us the whole time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No more but kiddo, you heard your mom. No ice cream for now. I&#39;ll buy you one tomorrow okay?&#34; I wink at him and his face automatically brightens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, that&#39;s a promise!&#34; He uttered excitedly. I nodded my head and he started eating again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance at Klaire who is now smiling at me. I grab her hand and kiss the back of her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know doing that won&#39;t change my mind right? You can&#39;t still get him some ice cream.&#34; She while laughing, I smiled at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry I wouldn&#39;t... For today.&#34; I added then wink. She just shake her head and we finish eating out breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to help her do the dishes but she told me to do my job in the garden. She ask me to move some plants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The house is just a small cottage made of woods and marbles. When I got outside Drane was already there playing with his ball. He was wearing something, like a school uniform.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you on your way to school now?&#34; I ask, he nodded his head his bag was strapped on his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was just waiting for uncle Kariz, he said he will drive me to school.&#34; Kariz... Wait where did I heard that name? I tried to recall where I heard that name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honey are you okay?&#34; I didn&#39;t even notice her getting close, she walk towards me then rub my back. &#34;You don&#39;t look so well? You should rest inside. I&#39;ll take care of Drane.&#34; She then guided me inside the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m okay, I&#39;m just maybe a bit tired.&#34; She was watching me for a moment then turn to grab some water on the fridge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just rest for today, wait here.&#34; I heard the screech of tires when she went outside. I peak at the window to see who it was. I can&#39;t see his face because Klaire was blocking the view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then walk back towards his car with Drane. Klaire wave her hands as the car soon took off the drive way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who was that? Who is Kariz?&#34; She look surprised at my question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kariz? Who?&#34; She repeated my question. She was averting her eyes at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Drane said his uncle Kariz will pick him up.&#34; I mumbled, again that name... Whenever I say that name my head was starting to hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe you heard the wrong name? That was Alec, you know one of your closest friend. Anyway you should get some sleep bath, you might feel better after.&#34; I still want to ask who is Alec and I know I did heard Drane correctly. But I had the feeling that she won&#39;t tell me even if I ask again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; I agree then kissed her forehead before I went to the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let the cold water run to my skin, the feeling of it makes me feel alive. Was I just dreaming earlier? But why does it felt like I forgot something important?  What is it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turn the shower off then turn to grab the towel but my head was starting to hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honey are you okay?&#34; I turned around to Klaire or should I say an imposter running to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance at her not wanting to make her worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m okay, my head just hurt a bit&#34; She look confused then nodded her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you starting to remember that your the one who cause me so much pain?&#34; Her voice change and when I look at her she was covered with blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is happening? Klaire!&#34; And as I walk closer to her she became further away from me..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! Don&#39;t go!&#34; I shouted but I&#39;m not sure if she could even hear me. Her laughter burst out of nowhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t go? Isn&#39;t this what you wanted in the first place? To live a normal life with her, to have a family of your own. And now here it is, you are actually happy earlier why did you have to destroy it again?&#34; She was holding Drane in her arms and she was lifeless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You killed us.&#34; Her words stunned me. I glance at my hands and it was covered with blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I can&#39;t hurt you.&#34; I mumbled, still feeling the red liquid in my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This isn&#39;t real! This is just a dream!&#34; I mumbled to myself and run to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got out Drane was standing in front of me. He was alive, I almost cried when I saw him still breathing. He was wearing the exact clothes he had earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you leaving me, dad?&#34; He looks like he was about to cry. I keep reminding myself that he was not real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry Drane, but I need to return to your real mom,&#34; I mumbled then started walking past him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about ice cream? You promise that we will get some ice cream tomorrow.&#34; I smiled at him sadly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, we will buy an ice cream now.&#34; I held his hands. I know this is just a dream but I still want to continue it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The road where we are walking is starting to become foggy. I couldn&#39;t even see where we are going. And when I notice Drane was nowhere to be found I panicked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know that we are lost right?&#34; I turn to find that little voice and found Drane standing a few feet away from me. Feeling a bit relieved that she didn&#39;t get that far away from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But something is off about him. His eyes are different from earlier. His hands are on his pocket. Cold gaze staring at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is on your pocket Drane?&#34; He shrugged his shoulders and started giggling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are funny Daddy, you know what is inside my pocket. Your the one who gave it to me.&#34; He mumbled. I walk towards him and kneel in front of him so we could be on the same level.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look!&#34; My jaw almost drop at the thing in his hands. It was a heart. And just like that he started vomiting blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You forgot Daddy, you killed us remember.&#34; He mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dwayne wake up!&#34; I open my eyes and found Sarah staring at me with worry written all over her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;S-sarah?&#34; She gave me a glass of water and I took it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came here looking for you because you didn&#39;t return after you said you will get some drinks.&#34; There is a slight annoyance in her voice but she dismissed it and grab my face. &#34;Are you okay? I heard you shouting. I thought something happened to you but thank God you are only having nightmare.&#34; A dream, yeah it was only a dream. But it felt so real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was just too tired and I didn&#39;t even notice that I fell asleep.&#34; I explain, I wasn&#39;t lying on the part that I didn&#39;t notice that I fell asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well good thing I was here.&#34; I couldn&#39;t agree more, if she wasn&#39;t here to wake me up I don&#39;t know how long will that nightmare last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, thanks.&#34; I muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything for you babe.&#34; She then lean to kiss me but I move away and grab a glass of water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She look disappointed at first but she just ignored it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it done?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, it was only just starting.&#34;</p>
