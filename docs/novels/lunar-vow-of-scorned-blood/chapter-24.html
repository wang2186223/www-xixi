                <p>I went to my room without saying anything to Clint. He was being sorry because of the fact that he knew about the marking that will happen after the succession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dwayne will take that girl as his Luna. That thought almost crash my heart. My tears betrayed me again, ever since I came here all I did was cry and get angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The succession will happen during the full moon, exactly the same time where the Moon Goddess power is stronger than normal nights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lay down on my bed and close my eyes, I soon drifted to my sleep...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I found myself again in that same old dark place, all I can hear is my footsteps again. What is this place? I did try scanning the room. But nothing is here.</p>

                <p>I turn where the voice came from and found nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Who are you?!&amp;quot; I shouted, no one answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Klaire...&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She called again, this time I decided to follow the voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Show yourself!&amp;quot; I continue walking to the direction where I last heard the voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Klaire...&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She called my name again, this time it was much nearer to me. I continue walking, and there I notice I was barefooted. No wonder I can feel the coldness of the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Where are you?&amp;quot; I shout back. Hoping she will tell me where she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Klaire... Open the door.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned at what she said. There wasn&#39;t even a door here. Or so I thought,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A lard red door was standing in the middle a few feet away from me. Where did it come from? It wasn&#39;t even there earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Open it... Let me in.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She whispered, my body just instantly moving on its own. I grip the handle...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;KLAIRE WAKE UP!&amp;quot; A loud thug of the bed woke me up. Clint was in front of me shaking my arms. Eliot, Noah, and Yustef came to my room running.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; I ask confused. They all stared at me with that you really don&#39;t know what happened look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You almost turn the whole mansion upside down!&amp;quot; Noah exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scan the room and found all the furniture scattered around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What happened?&amp;quot; I asked unsure of what did I had just done while I was sleeping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You were doing it again.&amp;quot; Clint answered, he let out a sigh and sit on my bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know what really happened, all I remember is I was dreaming. The voice and that red door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you all alright?&amp;quot; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all look disoriented. Clothes are rugged plus the way my room looks right now. I doubt the whole house won&#39;t look any better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yes, no scratch at all.&amp;quot; Noah mutter and gave me a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance at his arms which he was hiding at me. But he can&#39;t hide the smell of blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You got injured! Shit!&amp;quot; I felt sorry to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah&#39;s smile fade, he looks a little guilty at my reaction. It should be me who should feel guilty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It was just a scratch; it will heal by tomorrow.&amp;quot; Eliot mutter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still feel sad that Noah got hurt because of me. And knowing it was my cause, that injury won&#39;t heal easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You should tell us what happened before that happened.&amp;quot; Yustef said. He on the wall with his arms on his chest waiting for my answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I don&#39;t know; all I remember is I was sleeping.&amp;quot; I tried to think why did that happen, but nothing came to mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;That&#39;s enough for today, you have your rest.&amp;quot; Clint leans in front and kisses my forehead before heading to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Let&#39;s get you treated.&amp;quot; Eliot said looking at Noah&#39;s arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah&#39;s room is sitting right next to mine, so he would probably be the most affected one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Get some rest Klaire.&amp;quot; Yustef utters before following Clint out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah and Eliot also started getting out of my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m sorry...&amp;quot; I mumbled, I knew they heard me. All I could say was sorry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to go back to sleep, but sleep won&#39;t visit me. I got out of my bed and started walking downstairs. I was right, the whole mansion is a mess, falling glasses is all over the place. The furniture is broken if not they were unorganized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cold wind welcomes me as soon as I got out, my feet are barefooted just like in my dream. Feeling the cold damp ground between my toes. It was relaxing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I close my eyes thinking about my weird dream. That voice stuck in my head, who is she? Why do I hear her in my dreams? Maybe it was just some random dream that happened once in a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scent of winter and mint made my eyes snap open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t hide the surprise in my reaction as Dwayne walks closer to me. I froze there unable to process what should I do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stops a few feet away from me. I can hear my heart beating so fast, I&#39;m even afraid that he will hear it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What are you doing here.&amp;quot; Finally, my voice came out, but it was weak. I look like a confused kid who was left in the middle of the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Let&#39;s talk.&amp;quot; He mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know how to respond. I turn my back at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Wait!&amp;quot; His hands grabbed my hand to stop me from getting inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sparks floated all over my body. It was delightful and comforting. I almost close my eyes just to remember that feeling of his touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cursed at myself, remembering what Rion told me earlier. I shoved Dwayne&#39;s hands, don&#39;t get carried away!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;There is nothing to talk about.&amp;quot; I firmly answer, still turning my back at him. I&#39;m afraid that once I glance at him I will end up being swayed again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m sorry...&amp;quot; He whispered, I don&#39;t know why but I suddenly felt like everything stopped after hearing that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance back at him; he was staring at me intensely. But his eyes were confirming the thing that I&#39;m too afraid to ask him about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remain silent, the whole time we were just staring at each other. Memorizing every inch of each other&#39;s face. Because this might be the last time that we can do this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Fuck!&amp;quot; He cursed to himself and ruffled his hair, he also looks like a mess. His eyes are blood-shot red, now that I notice he also has some bags under his eyes. Nevertheless, he still looks gorgeous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes stop on his lips; I remember the times where those lips were claiming mine. I flush at that thought and look away. He probably notices my reaction as he starts walking towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His arms automatically wrapped around as soon as he closed the space between us. His face remains just above my neck. I can feel his breath getting heavy mirroring my mind. I stood there completely frozen, I wanna push him away but the feeling of him being near me is overwhelming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I wish I could read what&#39;s running inside that pretty head of yours.&amp;quot; He whispered, sending shivers down my spine. My face flushes again recalling my thoughts earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tucked some strands of hair into my ear and stared at me. I know in myself that I promise that I won&#39;t get swayed by him again. But this might be the last time that I will feel this kind of pleasure. My eyes close, feeling his cold hands pressed against my cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can feel his gaze, tracing my lips with his hands. His breath became more heavy and needy? I can feel his breath against my skin. I open my eyes and found him staring at me asking for permission to kiss me. His heated gaze, making my knees weak. All my resolved just vanish in a snap because of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His green-blue eyes staring wildly at me, his gaze is indicating his needs, longing, and love? I frowned at that thought. He apparently notices my confusion. He loosens his hold on me but his hand stays on my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remains silent, his eyes show his alertness, perhaps expecting my sudden outburst like last time. His hands continue to track my back sending chills all over my body. Damn this effect! I almost moan because of it. He noticed my body relax which made him smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes focus on his face. How can he still look perfect? The way his nose twitch and that dimple that I just notice today popping out of his cheeks as he smiles. My gaze stopped again at his lips, I didn&#39;t notice I was biting my lips if he didn&#39;t touch them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes stay on his hands just above my lips. He glances back again at my eyes asking for my permission. And with that, I nodded my head unconsciously, like my body had a mind of its own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasp as soon as I felt his lips brushing against mine. The same old sensation was still there alive and kicking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I close my eyes and for the first time, I let go of all of my worries away and started kissing him back.</p>
