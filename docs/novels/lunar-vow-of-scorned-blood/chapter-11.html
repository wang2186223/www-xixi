                <p>After I left her I went straight to my father. I know he might answer some of the questions running in my head. I didn&#39;t know much about the royalties except for they inherit some different abilities from the moon goddess or something like the bloodline of the King of werewolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was currently looking at the documents on his table as I entered his office. &amp;quot;What brought you here son?&amp;quot; He took a glimpse in my direction then went back to what his doing earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Who are they?&amp;quot; Was the first sentence that came out to my mouth. He stopped for a second then cleared his throat. Knowing he knows who I was talking about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood there for a second. He hesitated for a moment but gave in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We hardly know anything about them the succession of the royalties is already present before I was even born son, but there is a legend where that said they are from the straight bloodline of the King.&amp;quot; He walks towards his bookshelves and took a big brown old book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Back then there is a king of werewolves. He was the strongest werewolf and standing by his side is the mighty Beta his Brother. They said their bond is stronger than anything. And going against them will make you see the death of you.&amp;quot; He put the book on his table. And started to flip the pages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;The king was furious until he met his Luna...&amp;quot; he stops for a second to look at me in the eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;A human.&amp;quot; He added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look at him in disbelief, it was really rare to even be mated by a human because they are so fragile and you can end up killing her during the marking. And here I am having a human mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;She tamed the raging beast inside the King, peace had been achieved ever since then. With the help of the King with his Luna and Beta, all the packs united as one and let him rule as their true King. But his Beta doesn&#39;t like the fact that he needs to follow a human girl like his Luna. He was so against them that one day the Luna was killed by the King&#39;s Beta.&amp;quot; He flipped another page of the book and starts reading it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Hell is how they described the scene, knowing that the Packs are again separated and there are Packs who went against the King and stand beside his Beta. The King was devastated by his own brother&#39;s betrayal. That leads him to kill his Brother in just one snap and all the other werewolves who are traitors.&amp;quot; I stayed at the corner listening as my father retell the legend I used to hear when I was a child. But had been forgotten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;The King turns his back to all the Packs and ran away with his daughter who was blessed by the moon goddess herself. No one heard anything about the King and his daughter.&amp;quot; He closed the book and looked at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;After that war, the Four Elders who fought beside the King decided on creating the four factions to maintain the peace between packs.&amp;quot; He muttered, I just nodded my head. He was talking about the North, South, East, and West territories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;But the peace didn&#39;t last long another war erupted, this time it was against a pack of rogues. Another rebellion of Rogues, the factions is no match for them. They almost lost the battle the number of deaths costs them to be outnumbered by the rogues but then another hope came to them a group of werewolves save them. Their strength is no match for the rogues. And they are being led by a woman, nothing more is written here except for her silver-white hair gleams like the moonlight with her unusual golden eyes.&amp;quot; He continues. He flips another page of the book and continues reading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;The war ended and they won but she vanished without a trace no one knows what happened to her or where she went. After that Central Kingdom was built as the remaining werewolves with her resided there. The Elders believe that she was the daughter of the late King, and the moon goddess blessing was passed down her.&amp;quot; He added, he flipped the last page of the book. I stared at him confused, that was just a legend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;That didn&#39;t answer anything,&amp;quot; I said trying to patch things up. But nothing makes sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Son, that is the only thing we know about them.&amp;quot; He closes the book and walks back to the bookshelf to return the book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It was just a legend.&amp;quot; I frowned at the thought that we know nothing about those Royalties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk out of his office with another question added to my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Legends are real my son.&amp;quot; He yelled and started laughing. Damn! My Dad is nuts. Sighing that I got no answer made me more frustrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went straight to my room not bothering to take a shower I went straight to my bed. Her scent remains in me; I smell like her. And it comforts me as I let myself stumble to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, I went to the training grounds. The werewolves from the South Lake were already there when I arrive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I know we haven&#39;t met but I&#39;m Rion, the next Alpha of the South Lake Pack.&amp;quot; An unfamiliar face approaches me. He offered his hand and I took it. We don&#39;t need another enemy at times like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Dwayne.&amp;quot; I shake his hand. He was around my height; his frame was well built. He looks much stronger than the rest of his pack here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I heard my beta had a sparring match with you.&amp;quot; My eyes stop at the guy with who I had a sparring match before. No wonder he has some skills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just nodded my head grab some sandbags and tied them. He followed me and did the same thing I did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started punching it but it didn&#39;t last that to make a hole out of it. The sand started to fall out of the sandbag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Too eager aren&#39;t we.&amp;quot; He muttered, I didn&#39;t answer and went to grab another sandbag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other pack members started arriving in the training grounds. By the time Glen arrived, I was already in my 11th sandbag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Okay now, let me introduce to you Rion Altizer the next Alpha of the South Lake Pack. He arrives earlier than expected and he will start training with us.&amp;quot; Glen probably wants them to be careful around the other pack especially to the next Alpha of the South Lake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They started to gather into two&#39;s. It was a one on one combat training. I walk to my opponent and it was other than Rion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Looks like this is going to be fun.&amp;quot; He muttered, I didn&#39;t answer him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Okay now start!&amp;quot; Glen shouted the other pair around us started fighting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stay remaining standing, waiting for the other one to attack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I charge at him throwing a punch, he blocks it using his forearms. This time he hit me using his left hand in the V under my ribs where the sternum ends. His smile was triumphant as I yanked back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Didn&#39;t expect that ha?&amp;quot; I straightened my back and stared at him. A smirk formed on my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My next attack caught him off guard I slipped to his side and pushed his elbow down away. Making him defenseless I caught his head and rolled him to the floor. A loud thug erupted in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t notice that everyone is already done with their one on one training. They all stood there silently watching us both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a minute he was already on his feet, he rushed towards me but I was already anticipating his attack. He smashed his elbow to my side but I blocked it. I yanked back and with free arms, I hit him in the face. He almost lost his balance. He wipes his blood from his nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pounces at me hitting my face. I can taste the blood from my lips. We are both bleeding already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We circled each other trying to watch each other. He didn&#39;t miss the chance and charge forward. He almost hit me again in my ribs. But I blocked it, I grabbed his wrist with my right hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hit him twice more with my right, square right below his ribs. He sagged and I shoved him away. I took another step forward crowding him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glen run his way towards us and stood between us. He looks serious, I guess we&#39;ve done too much damage to each other. But who cares? This is nothing compared to my training with my father back then. And he was fully aware of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I think that&#39;s enough.&amp;quot; He glances at both of us. I didn&#39;t bother answering him and just started walking away from the training grounds.</p>
