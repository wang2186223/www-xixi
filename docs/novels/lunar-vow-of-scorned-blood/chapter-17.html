                <p>&amp;quot;Eliot?&amp;quot; He nodded his head, flashing me his bright smile. I immediately gave him a tight hug that he gladly replies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know that seeing familiar face will make me feel this better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;And I miss you too Klaire&amp;quot; he said while laughing. I let him go, so I could take a good look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked so much better than the last time I saw him. His hazel eyes beaming matching his brown hair that complement his tan skin. His physic is much bolder than before. Probably because of their last training.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It&#39;s good to see you.&amp;quot; I smiled, he always had this warmth within him like the bright light felt in the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;How come he was the only one who receive a hug?&amp;quot; Popping out of nowhere Noah stand between us. I smiled at him and pulled him into a hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You finally grow up huh?&amp;quot; Brushing his hair as I teased him. He was the youngest among us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Oh com&#39;on that&#39;s the only thing you notice?&amp;quot; I laugh at him and pretend I didn&#39;t notice how his build is much bigger than before. His toned muscle cannot be hide anymore by his shirt. His blue eyes shines like the deep ocean. I tried brushing his blonde hair again just to ruined it. But he immediately tilts his head to the other side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;There&#39;s nothing much to see anyway.&amp;quot; I mutter, he put his both hands on his chest pretending that he was hurt by what I said. We all burst out laughing. It&#39;s been so long since I laugh like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How I wish this could last where I don&#39;t have to feel like my heart and soul is tearing apart. I push my thoughts away. I don&#39;t need to think about him or anything related to the both of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scanned my surroundings trying to find someone who is missing. How come I haven&#39;t seen him. The two notice me looking for him and they both stare behind my back. Until I heard footsteps from behind me. I turned around, seeing a tall figure marching towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His black hair still looks good as ever, black eyes piercing on mine like a black hole trying to draw me in. A smile form from his lips reflecting mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He still hasn&#39;t change at all; you can feel his dominant aura making the people around him quiet as soon as he walks in. His deadly face is like there is a huge mark saying to not mess around with me kind of feeling. No wonder he was Clint&#39;s best friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yustef!&amp;quot; He nodded his head as soon as he heard me his name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It&#39;s been a while.&amp;quot; I mumbled, as I burry myself into his hug. Cowering away to my worries. His scent reminding me of the cold breeze of ocean night making me feel calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yeah.&amp;quot; I smiled on how he still has this short response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What&#39;s wrong?&amp;quot; He asks. I look up at his face, he was staring at me with those knowing eyes. This is what I don&#39;t like about him. It was too easy for him to read me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Nothing&amp;quot; I whispered and bury my head in his chest. He stroked my hair and didn&#39;t say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A loud growl erupted in the air following the scent that made my whole world crumbled in pain and pleasure. My whole body froze not wanting to look where that growl came from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yustef probably notice my stiffness. He stopped hugging me but didn&#39;t completely let me out of his grip, his hands move to my waist. Noticing why he did that I needed support because my legs feels like they lost all their strength to support me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you okay?&amp;quot; He lowers his head to check on me and again the growl grows louder and more threatening but knowing Yustef, he didn&#39;t even bother and continue to check on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Y-yeah.&amp;quot; I whispered, I tried to stop myself from looking at his direction but my eyes automatically found its way to those green-blue eyes who is staring back at me with those painful expressions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why is he acting like this again? The image of him kissing another girl and everything that happened between came like a flashing movies in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to look away but my eyes lock at the hands who is holding him around his arms. I almost wanted to ripped them off. Getting a quick scan at the person who owns them. Mid-length red hair, small noise with freckles that complement her fair skin, chocolate brown eyes with her slim curvy body. She looked like a porcelain doll that could break any minute but she was giving you the urge to protect her from breaking. I hate to admit it but she was beautiful and looking at them they do fit each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shame of pain wash over me. Making me choke out of my breath. Like the stabbing pain that I let myself be killed over and over. I close my eyes trying to hide all my emotions that keeps my tears from bursting out. But it was really hard knowing the person in front of you causes you a whirlwind of emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Stop it Dwayne!&amp;quot; I heard her mutter. She tried to get him to control and it work, she whispered something to his ear making him stop. His eyes immediately shifted to her. I can&#39;t see his expression but one thing I&#39;m sure at whatever she said made him come back to his senses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My gaze stays at his back as he walks further away from me. Not even glancing back, he vanishes within my sight. My eyes stop at the chocolate brown eyes who is staring at me with a smirk on her face before running to where he went off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately look away and just stared at my feet to avoid their piercing gaze. My tears wanted to crawl out of my eyes once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Is that him?&amp;quot; Knowing what he was pertaining to. I just nodded my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking everything in Noah and Eliot rush towards me. They both stared at me not knowing what to say. Of course Clint probably end up telling them everything that happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m gonna kill him.&amp;quot; Noah muttered. I cannot believe what I just heard from him. Knowing him, he wasn&#39;t the violent type. He usually doesn&#39;t like fighting at all. He hated the idea of war and violence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remember the trembling hands of the young Noah who is covered with blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;ll assist you.&amp;quot; Eliot added. The seriousness on his voice is evident that he was not joking. This is the second time that I heard Eliot say something about killing someone. He was the calm and rational one among them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;ll make sure that no one ever recognize him after I beat him up to death.&amp;quot; Yustef mumbled. His face looks like he was ready to murder anyone that comes his way. I&#39;m not surprised with his reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes grow wide as they were about to follow them to wherever they both went to. How could they even say such things in a straight face? Before they could even take a step. Clint march towards us and alongside him is Alpha Brent and Luna Stella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Looks like I just got here in time.&amp;quot; Clint said amused. While looking at the 3 towering people besides me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So that&#39;s why he just suddenly vanished earlier. He went to talk to Alpha and Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It&#39;s good to see you all.&amp;quot; He mutters sarcastically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Shall we head inside?&amp;quot; Brent suggested to lessen the heavy tension in the air. They probably heard the commotion earlier. It was no surprise with their kin ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We better go inside to start the discussion.&amp;quot; Clint added. Eyeing the three towering killers who are now on the verge of murdering anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance at Yustef, pleading him with my eyes to just let it go. He didn&#39;t say anything instead he started walking inside leaving us all behind. Sighing in relief I glance at Clint who is now heading inside the others followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It&#39;s good to see you too.&amp;quot; He mutters sarcastically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Com&#39;on how could only Klaire have that welcoming feeling? I also haven&#39;t seen you for ages.&amp;quot; He added with exaggeration. He continued to say something as they got inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One again I glance back to where he vanishes and for the last time. I feel like my heart sinking into this empty pit of sadness with this unending pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting everything sink in, I let out a heavy sigh. And headed inside where I belong. Seeing them right now reminded me of the reality the I keep running away from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opens and they are already seated in their own sits. Eyes on me as soon as I got inside. Three other unfamiliar faces were inside the room. They all look around the same age of Alpha Brent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly went to my seat. Clint and Alpha Brent was standing in front. A smile plastered on Clint&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Shall we start?&amp;quot;</p>
