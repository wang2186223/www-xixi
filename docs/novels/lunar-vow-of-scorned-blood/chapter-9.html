                <p>Klaire&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance at him now. He was sleeping. The bleeding of his legs stops. He looks so peaceful while he sleeps. How I wish I could just stare at him like this. But I can&#39;t especially now. Good thing he didn&#39;t get to hurt that much. I took his hands and hold them, that familiar feeling is there again trying to overwhelm me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m sorry,&amp;quot; I mutter. I close my eyes. I shouldn&#39;t be near him right now. He didn&#39;t see me earlier, right? He hurts and it was all because of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting go of his hand, I made my way to the living room where the body of two rogues remains unconscious. I didn&#39;t kill them they just look like they are dead. Their blood is all about over the place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What happened here?!&amp;quot; Clint rushes in my direction. They probably don&#39;t know what happened. And I was not surprised at it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Another attack,&amp;quot; I mutter, J tried to move the unconscious rogues but Clint stops me. He shoved my shoulder to face him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you okay?&amp;quot; I stare at him trying to hold my laugh. How can he be so cute sometimes? I pat his shoulder assuring him that I&#39;m completely fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You of all people, know that they couldn&#39;t do anything to me.&amp;quot; He narrows his eyebrow. He glances at me from head to toe. I followed him and stare at myself. I was also covered with blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;This is not mine,&amp;quot; I assured him. He walks towards the rogues. He squats down to check their necks for markings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It was him.&amp;quot; He confirms my thoughts earlier. I didn&#39;t notice I was trembling until he took my hand and squeezes it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I won&#39;t let him have you. I will kill him if he even shows up.&amp;quot; He kissed my forehead. I close my eyes and let the tears that I was holding downslide my cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We made our way to my room and he stared at the unconscious Dwayne. He wasn&#39;t covered with blood anymore because I wash it away earlier while I&#39;m attending to his wounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I will call for the pack doctor and let him be transferred back to the main house.&amp;quot; He said and headed outside to call whoever he had to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t take that long for someone from the pack to get him. They carried him. One of them even looks surprised to see me unscratched. The other one glared at me, maybe because he thought their soon-to-be alpha was badly hurt because of me. And they were not wrong about it. I just lowered my head and let Clint handle everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Sleep in my room tonight.&amp;quot; I just nodded my head and didn&#39;t argue with him because I am too tired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went to his room and sat on the bed with my eyes closed. I know this would happen. He sent them here to get me and I can&#39;t let them get me not again. I shiver at the thought of seeing him again. It makes my stomach turn upside-down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The coldness of that night sends me to the grave of my despair as I feel my rage I wanted to kill those rogues over and over again. Taking a deep breath, I didn&#39;t let it my anger consumes me as I remember what might happen again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I close my eyes and tried to get some sleep...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not for a while I found myself stand in dark place. I looked around and saw nothing but pure darkness. I have used in the dark my eyes adjusted on their own for the past years I am here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the familiar smell of faint metal and dusk as I tried to walk around but failed. I realized I was dreaming about the past. The pain was all over my body, I leaning on the wall to keep me from falling again. All I know right now is the fact that I need to get myself to stand on my own. Whimpering in pain as my wounds started to re-open again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All I know right now is I can&#39;t let him do whatever he wants to me. I shiver in pain as I remember how his nails dig deeper into my pale skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A loud knock pulled me back from that nightmare. Those dreams again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clint was standing at the door holding a glass of water in his left hand he offers it to me and I gladly took it from him. It was already morning and what happened yesterday was not a dream; I glance at my clothes it was now clean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You were in deep sleep, and I change your clothes.&amp;quot; My eyes went wide at the realization that he took my clothes off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I didn&#39;t see anything, and you were wearing something underneath. I just took your bloody shirt.&amp;quot; He continues. He gave me water and I drank it down. My throat feels so dry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What happened?&amp;quot; I ask. He sat down on the chair near the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We found no traces of how they got here without being noticed.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, it was his doing. He wouldn&#39;t let anyone find him and he won&#39;t stop after he gets what he wants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My whole body feels cold at the thought of having him near me. I shook my head trying to get that thought out of my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clint gave me a confused look but I just smiled at him to assure him that I&#39;m fine. He walks over to my bed and gave me a slight pat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I heard him awake now.&amp;quot; We both know who he was talking about. I let out a heavy sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything that happened last night flashes in my head like a movie. Those rogues are enough to kill a normal werewolf. Luckily, he was stronger than them if not... I don&#39;t even want to imagine what might happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It was my fault.&amp;quot; I can&#39;t forgive myself if something did happen to him because of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It was not your fault. He deserves what happened to him after what he did to you!&amp;quot; I look away from him. A pang of sudden guilt came up to me about what happened last night before the attack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;He didn&#39;t know anything,&amp;quot; I mutter. Maybe it was right after all that he rejected me. He needs to stay away from me. Far away from that, he wouldn&#39;t end up unconscious in my bed again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I know and that&#39;s why I&#39;m here.&amp;quot; I just gave him a slight smile. Knowing my brother was here giving me a little comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Now let&#39;s eat.&amp;quot; I just nodded my head and let him walk himself out first. I will follow up after I took a shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made my way back to my room and slide down to take a shower. I close my eyes, feeling the cold water in my skin. It was cold enough to take me back to my senses. I took the tower from the stool and wrap myself before I went out of the shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A familiar smell of mint and winter made my eyes wide open as I stare at him standing there beside my bed. Blue-green eyes stared back at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Shit! What are you doing here?!&amp;quot; I ask surprised. He stares at me with full of affection but the confusion was there and visible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grab my clothes and turn my back on him. I can still feel his gaze burning in my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Can you please get out?&amp;quot; He didn&#39;t badge but I heard the door at the balcony slide open. I took the liberty to put my clothes on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pair of oversized shirts and a short. I didn&#39;t bother brushing my hair. He was still on the balcony so I made my way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What do you want?&amp;quot; I asked. I crossed my arms trying to look a little intimidating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that I take a closer look at him. He doesn&#39;t have any trace of injury except for the bandage on his right arm the one that I tied. His legs look much better but the bandage is still there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You know why I&#39;m here.&amp;quot; He was about to come closer but he stops himself. Maybe he knew what will happen if he came closer again to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You shouldn&#39;t concern yourself with that,&amp;quot; I mutter, his expression changes. He looks angry?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Seriously, that is all you&#39;re going to say?&amp;quot; He exclaimed. He was furious and I understand why. His pack is also affected because of those rogues&#39; attacks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yes, and don&#39;t ever come here.&amp;quot; A slight pain took over me. I stared at him coldly shielding a thousand emotions as I look at him. I felt like it was killing me from the inside. Like how I die not long ago...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I can&#39;t play with you. So don&#39;t show yourself here anymore.&amp;quot; I turn around to get inside. But he stops me before I can ever protest. He grabbed my hand and the next thing I know his lips were on mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood there frozen unable to think of what should I do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I won&#39;t.&amp;quot; He mutters, and he kissed me again. This time I was returning to his intense kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All my thoughts fade away like how the snow in the winter melts.</p>
