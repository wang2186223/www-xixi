                <p>&amp;quot;Well, I&#39;m giving you your freedom to choose. &amp;quot; And with that, Kariz vanishes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood there alone, they aren&#39;t familiar so I wasn&#39;t sure if he was lying until I caught the scent of someone familiar among them. I can&#39;t be mistaken it was really her, the she-wolf called Sarah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A brown wolf was hiding at the back far from my reach but I know her too well. A pair of hazel eyes stared back at me. The image of her with Dwayne flashes in my head. I can feel my anger resurface just by seeing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They started positioning themselves, completely surrounded me, it only means that what Kariz said was true they are here for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all snarled at me, growling while showing their canines at me. I let out a deep breath, trying to calm myself. I don&#39;t wanna do something that I might regret again. But right now they aren&#39;t helping at all. They all started attacking me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Remember you are not Klaire anymore. &amp;quot; Those voices again, my whole surroundings just turn completely dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You are Amara.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a presence hugging me from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You are not weak...&amp;quot; She whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I am not weak I whispered to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Embrace me, Amara.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed everything that she was saying. Feeling the presence of my old self slowly fading...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Now close your eyes and let me in.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly close my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened my eyes went I felt them running forward to attack me, my reflexes are faster as I jumped up and attack the first wolf that is near me. I focused my attack right at its neck where the weak spot is located. After that, I went to other ones. This time I snap their heads off, I continue doing that until half of them was already dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly made my way to the remaining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t notice that we are already made further to the center of the forest where the circular altar was sitting. I remember this place too well; this is where I was always tied up bleeding till I wish that death will soon visit me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Sarah caught my attention. She was running to the far end of the forest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You can&#39;t get away from me.&amp;quot; I said just enough for her to hear me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly made my way to her, I can see fear written in her eyes when I caught up to her. She just stood there watching me as I kill everyone with just my bare hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes remain on her, not even blinking an eye when someone tries to attack me. All those who tried ended up dead anyway, I even notice some of them running away after witnessing everything. I was not interested in them in the first place so they could run all they want. I&#39;ll kill them later when I&#39;m done with Sarah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I reach her I stop just a few feet away from her. She was glaring at me, she lashed out her anger as she pounced against me. That somehow surprised me, I did not expect her to have this kind of strength. She showed me her canines, snarling at me like she was mocking me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I brush the dirt away from my bloody dress. I was already covered in blood anyway so why did I even care about a speck of single dirt? Now that I notice my surroundings are covered with blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How many of them did I kill already? I lost count of them. I shrugged my shoulders and walk to her direction. She was ready to attack once more but this time I caught her right before she landed on me again. I aim for her abdomen. Surely breaking some of her ribs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smile I satisfaction as I hear her cry in pain. She was gasping for air as soon as she shifted back to her human form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;S-stop!&amp;quot; She pleated as I grab her hair. &amp;quot;Let me go you monster!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I push her to the ground making her crouch in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you with Dwayne?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She started laughing after I mention him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Y-you really think he will still accept you after seeing this?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance around us blood only dead bodies can be seen. Like the whole place is painted in blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;H-he won&#39;t accept you after you killed his pack members!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t help but get mad at her words. I lifted my hand wanting to snatch her tongue out of her pretty mouth. When a loud explosion erupted, making me almost my balance because of the earthquake that it created.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Our job here is done. Now he won&#39;t believe you even if you know the truth.&amp;quot; She mumbled then used all her strength to kick me between the cracks and shifted to her wolf to get away from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cracks are getting bigger I tried to shift my weight as I felt the ground where I was standing is completely unstable it will crumble in a matter of seconds. I jump and landed to the other side. The explosion causes the Island to split into two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She run to the other side and even if I jump from here I wouldn&#39;t be able to reach the other side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard footsteps heading my way I look up and found Galaz. He didn&#39;t look surprised at how I looked. Ria and Ali followed him from behind. They all came out of nowhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What are you doing here?&amp;quot; I ask not even looking at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Woah this place looks horrible&amp;quot; Ria mutters ignoring my question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;This is crazy; I will take note to not get into your bad side.&amp;quot; Ali&#39;s uttered then started picking up some parts of the dead bodies around us and throwing them to Ria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Ali these is new clothes!&amp;quot; She complained, red stains of blood got into her top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We need to get going the island will soon sink.&amp;quot; After Galaz said that another earthquake erupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Just what the hell are those factions are thinking destroying their laboratories,&amp;quot; Ria mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Isn&#39;t that your lab?&amp;quot; That suddenly came out of my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ria shakes her head then looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;That place is where they keep us before. Kariz was the one who rescued us.&amp;quot; She answered, then turn her attention to the place where the smoke came from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We just return back here and killed everyone after we took you in. I&#39;m sure that was also the reason why they send all these werewolves running here.&amp;quot; Ali added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just what the hell is happening, how come we heard nothing about this? Or they didn&#39;t tell me anything about this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;They don&#39;t deserve to live,&amp;quot; Galaz said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t see his face but I feel his hatred. He then walked towards me and offered me a handkerchief but I didn&#39;t take it. I was already covered with blood and that won&#39;t do anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Where is he?&amp;quot; I don&#39;t need to mention his name because I&#39;m fully aware that he knows who I&#39;m talking about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Kariz was probably in the somewhere along the coast waiting.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance at the bodice of water surrounding us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We have been waiting for you all these years.&amp;quot; Galaz added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You can&#39;t even be sure that you could trust me,&amp;quot; I mutter coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This newfound power of mine is too hungry for blood, the thirst of seeing someone dying is making me feel alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just seeing what I have just done and not feeling anything is making me unsure of myself. I know this part of me is because I as Klaire am still not gone, I can still feel her inside me those memories that I have as she is still flashing in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But all of those are all created by lies. I close my eyes trying to bury those memories away when something caught my attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That scent! I can&#39;t be mistaken...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rustling of leaves followed by footsteps soon approaches us. My head snaps at the new arrivals it was really him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel my heart pounding in my chest as soon as our eyes meet. A pair of Green-blue eyes stared back at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Klaire...&amp;quot;</p>
