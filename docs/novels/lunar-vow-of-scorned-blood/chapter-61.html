                <p>Dwayne&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After my talk with Rion I went straight to the Elders. I know they might go against me and if they agree I know they will let someone keep an eyes on me to make sure I was really on their side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to be honest I don&#39;t know which side should I stand for. But right now I need to do a different approach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I open the door Hunter was sitting on the sofa. He was drinking a cup of coffee the smell of caffeine made me abit nausea. I always dislike the scent of coffee because it reminded me of the scent of the person who made our lives miserable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What brought you here my Grandson.&#34; He ask not even bothering to look at me. &#34;I was just about to call for you. But now that you are here that won&#39;t be necessary.&#34; He added, then put his cup away and look at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to talk to you about something.&#34; I muttered, he then told me to take a seat and I did as I was told.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We really need to talk especially about your mate. I heard so many things about her which is quite a mystery don&#39;t you think?&#34; He mumbled giving me a slight nod, his eyes were penetrating within me. Like if I wanted to hide something he will end up knowing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hardly know anything about her. I was also surprised during the Succession.&#34; Now that I remember they didn&#39;t even show up during that time and let the Royalties handled it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I was aware about the youngest daughter of the previous King, but I didn&#39;t know that she was born as human. Since King Aris died his son Armadeus continue his rein, and from what I heard he had 2 children Clint and you know the other one Klaire who is born as a human. If your father didn&#39;t told me about what he witness I wouldn&#39;t even believe it myself. I never thought that the Central Kingdom will hide that important piece of information to the faction. &#34; He explains. I can feel that he was telling the truth but something is still making me feel uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t you come during the succession?&#34; I cannot help but ask, because I want to stop contemplating about this matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was part of the agreement of the treaty to us Elders and the Royalties. That the succession will be handled by both parties but during that time we were attacked by the rogues which made us cancel our trip and let the Royalties lead the succession. But now that I think about it. It felt like they planned it all along.&#34; He added, I clench my fist not liking his statement. I know the fact that the Royalties don&#39;t like to open up to the faction but that time they open her up to us. They showed her true power to us and that means they wanted to make this treaty happened. But now that he was saying this he somehow had a point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rogues attack that time and only the pack members happened to be unconscious and then that statement of giving back what rightfully theirs was another story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you have any evidence that the Central Kingdom is involved with the Rogues? And Rion?&#34; He stop for a second like he was thinking about something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, but that is also the reason why we need your help to get more information about them and right now Rion is our first step to get them. I heard all of you are together in the Island.&#34; He said, I nodded my head. Liking the fact that I wouldn&#39;t have a hard time telling him about my plan yo go to the South because he was planning it all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Also the island, I want to ask him about it but I know this is not the right time. I still need to gather more information about their connection with it. And if I was wrong then that would be a good news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, but during that time when we arrived everyone was already dead.&#34; The memory of our meeting in that same place was always tragic. Her gray-blue eyes flashes in my mind like whirlpool trying to suck me in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was her right?&#34; I was stunned by his words. He was staring straight to my eyes. I know he knows something. Did Sarah told him? Or was there somebody else who saw everything?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know. Like I&#39;ve said everyone was dead when we arrived at the site.&#34; I muttered. I wasn&#39;t lying about this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see, have you heard the story about the second war?&#34; I know he partly talking about the Legend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mean the legend?&#34; I ask trying to avoid such subject. I had some of the memory of the second war. I glance at my hands, the hands who took her life away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, you know Dwayne when I was young my father always tell me about the second war. What he witness when he was a kid. &#34; He stand on his feet and walk towards the window. He look serious and angry?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When he was young he witness a horrifying event. It was during the second war, he saw how the one who saved them actually end up killing the whole faction. But what is more interesting about it is that person is actually a human with a mysterious power that came from the moon goddess herself. &#34; My heart started pounding when he turn around to me. I know he was not yet alive that time but it felt like he knew that I was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you saying Klaire and that woman are the same?&#34; Someone mumbled from my behind, when I turn around it was Cameron together with Harid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not quite sure yet, but if they are the same then it only means that she was a danger for us all.&#34; He answered, the look on their face was enough for me to know that they are waiting for my reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then what are you planning to do if you are right about that?&#34; I ask, he gave me a wicked smile. And I know that I wouldn&#39;t like what he was planning to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will have to kill her.&#34; He muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day I went to where Zion and the others are waiting when I arrived their I found the 3 familiar faces that I haven&#39;t seen in a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha.&#34; They all bowed their head and I nodded my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It been a while Dwayne.&#34; Arren muttered, Darren then smack him in the head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You shouldn&#39;t just call him by his name. He was our Alpha now! Did you actually left your brain in the bar?&#34; He mumbled, scolding Arren. I almost laugh at them. They haven&#39;t change at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay Darren you could just act like before.&#34; They all nodded their heads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t you going to explain why we are here?&#34; Claus said, he still have that shady look on him. He look much better than the last time I saw him. He was a complete wrecked when he lost his mate. And I know how that feels because I didn&#39;t lost her once but twice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right, first I have to let you know that we won&#39;t be alone on this mission. There will be eyes that will monitor us. So don&#39;t trust anyone except me.&#34; I uttered while looking at them one by one. I had a little doubt about Lindon coming here but seeing him here only proves what Rion said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You probably all know that we are heading to the South. We need to find the people who are helping Rion before the Elders or the Rogues does.&#34; I know the Rogues will end up disposing them to make sure we would get any information about them and the Elders will do everything in their power to get any information about them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard you are keeping someone who might help us.&#34; My eyes stop at Lindon who&#39;s eyes were wide open. I already knew that he was keeping someone who is related to Rion. Rion told me about it because he made sure that Lindon will hide her for the meantime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you kn-&#34; he stop when he finally realized how. &#34;So that&#39;s why you need me.&#34; I nodded my head. We need to finish our talk before they arrived here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you just planning to locate your mate?&#34; Arren uttered, he received another glare at Darren.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes and no. Yes, because eventually we will need to find her to know the Rogues location. And no, because I need to find out the connection of the Faction with the Island.&#34; They all look at me confused. But I can&#39;t tell them about it yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, I think we need to stop that right now.&#34; I turn to Zion who is now staring at the 6 people heading our way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cameron, Harid and the others are their Betas and someone from their pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are all so early.&#34; Cameron uttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s an honor to meet both Alpha of the west and east.&#34; Darren said. And they all greeted them the others did the same to me. And when we were all done with the greetings. Harid explain our plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will seek information about this people.&#34; Harid pull out 5 photos of some unfamiliar faces. All of them look a bit younger than J expected. They are just a few years older than us. Around Claus age if I&#39;m not mistaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance at Lindon who is also staring at the photos but only one caught his attention. It was a picture of a woman with a chocolate brown hair with a pair of blue eyes. And i know for sure why he was staring at her like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This people are known for their dislike with the Faction. This is Terry, he was part of the pack&#39;s warrior before but he started showing his violence with his colleagues and the former Alpha punish him which lead him for losing his left eye. And this one was Alejandro, he was known for his obsession with herbs, medicine that he usually experimented on like the toxins from the flower during the succession. While Bryan works in the South warehouse before but was caught stealing weapons from the warehouse. He was immediately taken to the dungeon but he got out and went missing. While this Devon and Dieter the two siblings who are we had no information. They just suddenly appear in the pack when they are young practically orphans and was raise there. Devon went missing after Rion was caught only Dieter remained.&#34; He stop for a minute then continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And another thing they are related to Rion&#39;s mate.&#34; He added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance at Lindon who is now standing a few feet away from us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk towards him and stop in front of him. I know heard everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They are adopted by the family of Rion&#39;s mate. And Devon was the one you need.&#34; He whispered.</p>
