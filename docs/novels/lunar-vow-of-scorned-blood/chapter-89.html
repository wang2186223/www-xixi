                <p>Amara&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Galaz stared at me with disbelief, I told him everything that happened that day. How I ended up getting here naked and how he saw me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously Amara! You know how dangerous it is for you to go there. Especially after knowing that they wanted you in the first place!&#34; He now sounded like Clint, getting nag by him. I just rolled my eyes and stared outside the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Galaz then stood next to me. He was still not happy about what he just found out. And I feel the same way. Just remembering how he immediately went to Sarah after hearing her called his name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just make sure that you would not go back there. &#34; He uttered, I didn&#39;t say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amara! You have to keep yourself out of the Crescent Moon Pack, you know what happened to Clint and Zion.&#34; Upon mentioning Clint, it made me just want to go back there even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you heard anything about Clint?&#34; I ask, he then look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, after what happened. The people we had inside the pack are now all dead.&#34; The look of horror was written on my face then turned into a worried look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if something bad happened to Clint? And it was all my fault because they wouldn&#39;t go back there if not for me. And then I acted like that to Clint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Galaz then hold my shoulders to stop me from pacing back and fort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Clint is not weak and you know that. That person is even stronger than any of those pack members.&#34; But then the story about the Elders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Elders are there.&#34; I mumbled, they probably aren&#39;t much of a threats before but after seeing what they did to the Central Kingdom only means they gained something that we know nothing about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amara, Clint will be fine. And we will make sure of it. He knows that you still need him and he won&#39;t let anything bad happened to him.&#34; I didn&#39;t say anything and just stared at the sincere eyes of Galaz. I wonder since when did someone stared at me with those eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay?&#34; He added, and I nodded my head. Even though I don&#39;t agree with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he finally able to calm me down, Ria called for him. Ria is also acting weird lately especially around Yustef. She always tend to avoid seeing or bumping into Yustef. While Yustef is also being weird around Ria. I didn&#39;t ask what happened between them because we aren&#39;t back into that kind of relationship where we used to be close enough to tell each other everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance once more outside, the scenery still looks so peaceful during this time, like there are no wars happening between the Faction and us even though it still haven&#39;t begin yet, but I can feel it soon blood bath will start to take over this peaceful scenery. Closing my eyes as I feel the breeze of the cold air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then turning around to the door where Galaz left. Then back to the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck! I&#39;m sorry Galaz but I have to do this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I jumped off my window, landing in my feet with a slight sound as I hit the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know that Kariz was the who actually called for Galaz, probably about something related to the upcoming awakening. I still haven&#39;t seen what is inside the book because before I could even opened it Kariz took it from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And before they could even notice the illusion I put in my room that I was sleeping I need to get out of here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shifting is still questionable for me so what I did is used my abilities, like the speed I have even without shifting I was actually fast like a normal werewolf. It was weird at first but after the training I had with Kariz on using my abilities in a much controlled and stable way I was able to do this much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would be late at night before I will arrived there. I still remember the passage that Galaz and I used when we went to the Northern territory, it was still a long way but I found a much shorter way when I came here. This is actually the way my Lycan used to go to where he was that time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I entered the gave like entrance, there are a lot of passage that will lead you to different places, Galaz did say that there are a lot of werewolves who got lost because of this passages, and they only used one passage which is the safest and a way that they are really familiar with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can hear the drops of water inside the cave, making it like a solemn yet mysterious place. The moist of the ground was all I could smell from here and some unknown scent that I did remember smelling before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring all my dilemmas, I went straight to the passage that I could still remember. The memory is a little vivid but it was like my body actually knew where it is. And there it was, there is a huge waterfall that hides the passage. If you don&#39;t know that there is a passage in this location you wouldn&#39;t even notice it. The water was surprisingly warm when it hits my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This place is like playing with time, just like what Galaz encountered in the Dark Forest before. The whole werewolf territory is full of unexplainable place where you wouldn&#39;t even be able to understand how everything works.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closing my eyes I crossed the water, it feels like my body was being turned apart, and I couldn&#39;t help but scream at the unbearable pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How did I not remember about this? I close my eyes, trying to ignored how my body feels like crashing on something. I wasn&#39;t even able to open my eyes, like I have no control with my own body. And then suddenly I felt like the pain was starting to wash away from my body, like my body was floating in a body of water. And when I open my eyes, I was staring the moon, and I was in the river that connects to the river inside the pack. I was just outside the territory. And how long was I like that? Then I remember that, that place was not following the normal time frame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was already evening, and from where I am standing it looks like the pack was up to something. Like they were having some celebration. I can feel my heart pounding as I hugged myself, I suddenly felt cold like my body was still not used to this place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly heading my way towards the border of the territory. A few guards saw me coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s there? If you are lost we advice you not to come further.&#34; Someone shouted but I ignored them and just continue walking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go back! If you don&#39;t we would have to retain you.&#34; Again with their same warnings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should have just listened to your own advice.&#34; I mumbled, when I stood in front of him. Making him step backward because of surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How?!&#34; Before he could even react I knocked him out. Then footsteps started heading this way. Another eyes sores are heading this way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I then close my eyes, then stared at all of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sleep.&#34; And with that they all fell to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s more like it. I head inside but before that I took something that will help me cover myself. I don&#39;t need anyone knowing I was here before I could find Clint. I started walking towards the packhouse, wondering if the celebration was connected to Clint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There is still an additional announcement everyone. Another member of our pack is about to come.&#34; I heard an unfamiliar voice mumbled, I walk faster so that I could catch a glimpse of who it was. I had my suspicion that, that person is one of the Elders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you are all aware of, our dearest Sarah here who is the mate of our Alpha, my great-great grandson was actually having his child&#34; I stiffen at where I was when I heard those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance up and regret it as soon as I did. My eyes landed at Dwayne who had Sarah held in his arms. They both look happy, the cheering and shouting of the crowd felt like it was silent scream of my whole being right now. I couldn&#39;t even hear anything after that I just stood there completely silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before they could even notice me on the crowd I hurriedly made my way towards the dark side of the corner. Where I was far enough from the crowd. Then footsteps started approaching my way and to my dismay it was them. But there are not alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to not listen to what they were talking about but I couldn&#39;t just pull my ear out of my head. They were talking about the unborn child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clenching my fist, I felt more betrayed than before. The pain is like a loud slap as I watch them kissed each other in front of me. I want to look away but my body had a mind of its own and likes to torture me even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just stood there not even caring anymore if he will see me or not. As soon as our eyes met I felt like there is a large lump in my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Followed by the angry tears of agonizing pain, and hatred that I was holding since the time at the East Mansion.</p>
