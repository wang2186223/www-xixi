                <p>When I went back to the packhouse my father was already waiting for me in the doorway along with my Mother. They both had this displeased look on their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to have a proper talk Dwayne.&#34; My father muttered as soon as I reach the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to also scold me about being the Alpha?&#34; I ask showing my disinterest in the topic. I had too many things running in my head right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will decline the treaty with the Central Kingdom along with the Fraction.&#34; He announced that made me stop my track. I look at him with disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who gave you the right to decide? I AM THE ALPHA!&#34; My voice made the whole house shake. But he didn&#39;t submit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just lost your right to be an Alpha after you let your pack members die in the hands of your own mate!&#34; He barks back. Where did he hear that from? I glance upstairs and saw Sarah standing with bandages all over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I was not there when that happened!&#34; I mumbled, I can feel their eyes on me. I can smell their hate from where I&#39;m standing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is the reason why we told you to make Sarah the Luna because the Central Kingdom may have the power but they are still strangers to us.&#34; He added, his voice sounded calm but his authority as the former Alpha is still there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know my pack doesn&#39;t fully trust me yet, especially after what happened and right now I was sure that some of them will start to challenge me for the title.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You may have the title as an Alpha but remember that your pack still matters on every decision and right now your pack doesn&#39;t trust the Royalties.&#34; My father&#39;s words made a huge commotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The former Alpha is right! Ever since they came here we were attacked more frequently!&#34; And they all started muttering their opinions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you forget the fact that they help us during the time when the factions is in great danger against the rogues,&#34; I mumbled, they all became silent but the hesitation is still there?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The factions don&#39;t need them anymore! We are already strong enough. We outnumbered the Central Kingdom!&#34; Someone shouted from the crowd and everyone agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They are pressing me to agree with them. And if I don&#39;t most of them will challenge me for the title and I know I can beat them all but too many pack members already died because of me. I glance at the crowd and Cameron and Harid was standing not so far from the crowd. It seems that they already made their decisions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My father notice where I&#39;m looking and he confirmed my presumptions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They already made a decision to cast out the treaty and if we won&#39;t agree with them they will start a war against us.&#34; He mumbled, I clench my fist. I can feel my anger trying to surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can decide to not agree and go for the war, my pack is the strongest among the factions but still, I glance at my pack members who are crying at the news of their loss. Will I be able to live peacefully while knowing that I brought death to my pack? The memory of the second war flashed in my eyes. The scene of dead bodies, fire, and the sight of my own mate killing them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They planned this all alone without my presence because they know that I wouldn&#39;t agree to it and the only way for that to happen is if my pack will go against me and they succeed. I close my eyes for a second then turn to mutter the words that I would regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I agree to cancel the treaty.&#34; The crowd started cheering and my eyes stop at Clint who is watching us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had a blank look on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did the right thing son.&#34; I didn&#39;t answer him and just turn my back and started walking away from here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I reach the forest Clint and the others are already waiting for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So this is your plan? Abandoning us again?&#34; Noah&#39;s voice uttered with anger. He looks like he was about to rip my head off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have to do it,&#34; I answered, feeling frustrated with everything that just happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are fully aware that you originally belong to us,&#34; Yustef said, he had a stern look on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gritted my teeth trying to contain myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are also aware that I am Dwayne and not Aiden anymore! I am different from the past! I cannot just abandon my pack because I am their Alpha!&#34; He started laughing which made me grab his collar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are right, you are far from the Aiden I knew. Because he wouldn&#39;t reject his mate in the first place.&#34; He yanked my arms away. He then looks at me with disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t reject her if you let me remember! All this time you knew everything and you all fooled us! You are also the reason why she left!&#34; I spat out. This time it was Yustef who pinned me on the tree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Klaire stop me before from killing you but this time I wouldn&#39;t think twice to rip your head off.&#34; He snap, his eyes were turning golden yellow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could watch you try,&#34; I growled back, my wolf was beyond furious to stay calm. Our emotions are mixed to the point that I very much want to kill someone right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s enough! This is what the enemy wanted. Right now we cannot aim at each other&#39;s throat.&#34; Clint&#39;s voice made us both stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to go.&#34; He mumbled, he didn&#39;t even give me a glance before they all left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did the right thing.&#34; I turn to see Cameron and Harid standing a few feet away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t answer them and just keep walking past them. Cameron then pats my shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We also lost our pack members on the Island. &#34;He mumbled, then pull his hand away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I reach the packhouse I did not go straight to my room instead. I head to the only person who witness everything that happened on the Island before we reach her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t bother knocking when I open the door she was already waiting for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew you will come.&#34; She smiled and then put down her cup of tea. I can smell the herbs on it and it was hurting my nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you find that place?&#34; I grab her arms. She started hissing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dwayne it hurts!&#34; When I notice her wounds started bleeding again I let her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Island is already under our surveillance before. Remember the time that I went to train? That was the first time that I came across that place. The elders before took us there and we found out that the rogues are usually roaming around that place.&#34; She mumbled. I frowned at her words. Why didn&#39;t I know about it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And when I saw you jumping on a boat with the Royalties I had no other choice but to tell the Alpha&#39;s and we decided to follow you. The direction where you are heading is pointing only at that Island. We took the route where the Elders took us before but when we got there.&#34; She started choking on her words and cried. Her whole body is trembling at the memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We found Klaire and she wasn&#39;t alone. I tried to talk to her but then she started attacking us. She killed everyone, I watch her snap their heads and hearts out. And the look on her face was evil.&#34; Her sobs became loud, I know the picture that she was describing. That was exactly how I saw Amara killing everyone during the second war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knows that breaking their bones will heal in no time so she aims for a way that will lead to death in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah looks pitiful right now. The look she got was the same when she lost both her father and mate. I pulled her in my arms and started coaxing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dwayne she tried to kill me! NO, SHE WAS GOING TO KILL ME!&#34; Her whole body was trembling as she cry. I didn&#39;t say anything and just remain there silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she was calm I carry her back to her bed. I need to talk to my father about this. I was about to go out when she pulled my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please stay?&#34; She was giving me that same look again. But I pulled my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t, I still need to do something.&#34; I turn to reach the door but she stops me. She hugs me from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She tried to kill me in the forest, that was the time when I was found naked in the forest.&#34; She mumbled. I let go of the doorknob and turn to face her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; I know that something strange happened and the way she reacted when she saw Klaire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She got mad at me, maybe she heard the gossip about me being the Luna, and then she tried to kill me. She was jealous of me because she can never be the Luna.&#34; Her words made me mad. I pull her away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is my Luna, and no one will ever take her place not even you.&#34; Her eyes grow wide at my words but I turn my back on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I open the door Zion was waiting outside. I know he heard everything I said. I just stared at him and then made my way to where my father is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I even heard Zion&#39;s voice trying to calm Sarah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I found my father, he was at my office. Reading the familiar old book of the Legend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t you tell me about the Island?&#34; He glances at me for a second then close the book in his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because that place is forbidden.&#34; I smack the table with my hands demanding a proper explanation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know that Sarah went there before with the Elders. How come no one told me about it.&#34; I hissed. He cleared his throat then look at me in the eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t tell you about it because only the Elders can.&#34; This made me more furious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dwayne I wanted to protect you from it. After the last encounter, you had with the Rogues. I cannot let you go there and trust me you wouldn&#39;t want to get involved with the Elders.&#34; From that I know I wouldn&#39;t get an answer from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went out of the office and started looking for the only person who is more likely to be involved with the Elders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was watering her plants when I found her. She was wearing her long white dress, her garden was filled with flowers blooming. This place is full of memories. I usually help her plant these plants when I was still young. She turns to me with a smile when she notices my presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mother.&#34; Her smile used to be a ray of sunshine to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh Dwayne, I thought you were with Sarah?&#34; She look a bit disappointed when she saw me here and not in Sarah&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zion was there with her,&#34; I answered while staring at the newly bloomed flowers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t they beautiful?&#34; This flower looks exactly like the flower during the succession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you have these flowers?&#34; She laughed at my reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You and your father had the same look when he saw these flowers.&#34; I won&#39;t be surprised why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These flowers are not harmful, I really like them. You know from where I was born these flowers are all over the place. People usually don&#39;t like them because they usually symbolize death but for me they are unique.&#34; She explains. This is the first time I heard about this. My mother doesn&#39;t usually talk about her origin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And where is that place mother?&#34; I ask, then pick the flower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In the human territory.&#34;</p>
