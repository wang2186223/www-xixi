                <p>Dwayne&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah was taken to the Doctor once we arrived. She had some serious bruises all over her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where have you been?&#34; My mom rush to me with her worried voice and pulled me into a hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you hurt? Where did this blood come from?&#34; I didn&#39;t notice that I was also covered in blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m okay Mom, I just need some rest,&#34; I mumbled then walk away to who knows where.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stop and found myself in the last place that I spend with her. I sat at the tree trunk and started weeping. Recalling the last memory I had with her here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way I gaze at her at that moment, I was bewildered as if she was some kind of mystical creature that might vanish if I let her out of my sight. And if I only knew she will be gone, I wouldn&#39;t have taken my eyes off her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood up and started throwing punches in the first tree that I laid my eyes on. Knowing everything just made everything much worst, having this memory only made me more guilty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know that tree wouldn&#39;t help you find her right?&#34; I look up and found Clint standing a few feet away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you here?&#34; I ask, he took my spot earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw Kariz.&#34; He announced, which made me stiff. I look at him with disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was he reincarnated like us?&#34; He stop for a moment, unsure if he should continue what he was thinking or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, he wasn&#39;t. At first, I also thought that he was also reincarnated.&#34; I stared at him a bit confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But he was a human, if he wasn&#39;t reincarnated he should be dead a long time ago,&#34; I mumbled, it doesn&#39;t make sense at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remember the second war? The time we fought against him?&#34; I nodded my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that he mentioned it, Kariz was totally different when we fought against him. We can&#39;t even stand against him during that time. Only Klaire was the one who stops him during that time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is just a guess, but when Klaire hit me on the Island I saw Kariz watching us.  I followed him after that and found him waiting for me on the coast. When he turned around I was stunned to see his eyes, it looks exactly like Klaire.&#34; He continues with a serious look on his face. Red eyes? Like the mysterious guy from the attack that night during the succession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you saying that he was all behind this?&#34; I said unsure,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That doesn&#39;t make sense, remember that Klaire is the only one who had the blood of the Moon Goddess and when we received it we turned to werewolves but he didn&#39;t.&#34; I frowned feeling confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean by that? That Kariz also had the blood of the Moon Goddess before he even received her blood?&#34; He didn&#39;t answer and just remain silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There is only one way to find out, we need to find them.&#34; After that, he started walking away. I was left alone not knowing what to think.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that he mentioned it, I don&#39;t have much memory of the second war. It was kinda blurry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I return to the Packhouse there was a loud noise coming from so I ran and witness Rion being taken away by Yustef.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is going on here?&#34; I ask as soon as I reach them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was the traitor!&#34; I froze when I heard what he just said. Rion was bleeding there is some bruise on his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I ask unsure if what I heard is right. He yanks Rion harder making him fall down to his knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell him what you&#39;ve done.&#34; Rion just started laughing resulting in another hit from Yustef.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t do anything wrong, you were all just some bunch of idiots following the elders who are nothing but some bunch of murderers!&#34; He spits some blood from his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was the one who kidnapped Klaire.&#34; After hearing that my wolf came out, I wasn&#39;t able to control him. He growls at Rion who is now watching me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She doesn&#39;t belong to you anyway!&#34; Rion spat then shake Yustef hands off him. I nodded my head to Yustef to let him go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My wolf was snarling at him, challenging him. He wanted to bite his head off right at this moment after finding out that he was the reason why she went missing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure about this Yustef ask?&#34; I glared at him not liking his interruption. When he saw that I was serious he shrugged his shoulders and then step backward to give us enough space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bones cracking filled the air followed by his transformation. His wolf was decent enough to almost match my wolf. We both circle each other, watching each other&#39;s move. I did not waste any more time because my wolf is impatient enough to smash his skull.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dug my paw into the ground and then jump at him, he dodge it then kick me right in my abdomen. Tried to bury his class on my skin but that didn&#39;t work. I caught his left leg and bite it hard. He whimpers as I dug my canines into his skin. He started scratching me with his claws but I did not let go of his leg. I want him to have a scar that would remind him of this day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know I couldn&#39;t kill him right away because he will still have to face trial. He was still an Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I was satisfied with the result I throw him to the ground. If it was a normal werewolf that injury can cause him his life or loss of the ability to walk. But it was no surprise that he could still stand. He was no ordinary one if he did not betray us. I know he will be a respectable Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We are now gaining more crowd and the pack members of the South are now heading this way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shifted back to my human form wiping the remaining blood of him on my mouth. Yustef throws some clothes on me and I slip onto them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If that was me he wouldn&#39;t be able to stand,&#34; Yustef mumbled while staring at Rion who shifted back to his human form. His legs is bleeding heavily, he was having a hard time walking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take him,&#34; I ordered, then the guards escort him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;LET HIM GO!&#34; Lindon shouted then shifted to his wolf. The others followed. Of course, they will be angry seeing their Alpha like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yustef growled at them, giving them a warning not to step further. They all lowered their heads in submission and then took a step back. The authority that the Royalties have is something that they can&#39;t just ignore, they have the same level as the Alpha&#39;s when it comes to authority and power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Calm yourself Lindon, everything is fine,&#34; Rion said while trying to keep himself steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lindon turn back to his human form and didn&#39;t say a word. I know he wanted to argue but Rion gave him a look and he submit himself by lowering his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that Rion&#39;s father came forward and slap him. Rion glared at him and then spit the blood from his burst lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are a disgrace!&#34; Rion glared at him if not for Yustef, they would also start fighting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have no right to be mad at me right now! I know what you are doing with those bastards!&#34; I have no idea what he was talking about right now but something is telling me that he knows something that we don&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you talking about?&#34; His father also sounded confused at first but then his face turns pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You of all people know what I&#39;m talking about you son of a bitch!&#34; He said enraged. Then tried to rush towards him but he was stopped by the guards who are now holding him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How many times do I have to tell you that I have nothing to do with it, especially about your father&#39;s death.&#34; He said, Rion was still glaring at him. He was not his son?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are a liar! You killed him for the title you fucking bastard!&#34; He shouted, his eyes were turning black. He was about to turn to his wolf the people who are restraining him came flying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yustef and I came to step forward and pinned him down to the ground. We can&#39;t afford another chaos after what just happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t do that if I were you,&#34; Yustef warned, his eyes were also glowing right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get off me or I&#39;ll kill you both!&#34; He was trying to struggle but it was not used.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll take it from here.&#34; Noah stepped forward. &#34;Lift him up.&#34; He uttered then we did what he said. His eyes soon turn golden yellow, glowing as he stared at Rion in the eyes. And when he was done Rion&#39;s eyes turn back to normal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you do?!&#34; Rion ask, I can feel his strength fading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I put your wolf to sleep.&#34; He answered then motioning my people to take him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will regret siding with them once you knew everything.&#34; He mumbled before he was completely taken out of my sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance at Yustef looking for an answer after what just happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He can subdue your wolf by just looking at your eyes,&#34; Yustef explains. Then followed the guards who took Rion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look around and found the other Faction staring, Harid and Cameron just remain silent. Lindon walks out after that. Keep whispering on each other and when they notice me staring at them they all look away and continue their work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk to where the former Alpha was standing, I think he had a lot of things to do. My father shows up from nowhere along with the other two former Alphas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What is going on? I glance in my Father&#39;s direction and he looked away. Does he know what Rion is talking about?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rion&#39;s words remained in my head. What does he know that we don&#39;t? My father pulled Rion&#39;s adopted father whispering something in his ears. That made him nod his head and followed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly made my move to follow them but Zion came to me and pulled me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER THIS TIME?!&#34; Based on his reaction he was talking about Sarah. But now that he mentioned her I somehow feel a bit irritated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t do anything. I didn&#39;t know that she was on the Island.&#34; I yanked his hands away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was there because she followed you!&#34; That made me stop my track.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Follow me?&#34; I just remembered the familiar scent mixed in the air. Those werewolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes! Along with some of our pack warriors they know the danger but they still followed their Alpha!&#34; I was right, the sight of her made me forget about those familiar scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are they Dwayne?&#34; I remained silent. This time he cannot contain himself and started punching me. I welcome his every hit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he notice I wasn&#39;t fighting back he stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me remind you that you are the Alpha! And you just lost some of your pack members because of your mate! I wonder how will you tell those families who lost their loved ones because of you!&#34; He then left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything is starting to get out of hand. The issue about Kariz, Rion, and Klaire is still unsolved, and now this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Zion is right, I am the Alpha and right now I just failed them.</p>
