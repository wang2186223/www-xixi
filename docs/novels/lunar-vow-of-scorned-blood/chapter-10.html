                <p>Klaire&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sweet taste of mint welcomed me, letting a familiar sensation of lust come to life inside me. Until something pulled me back to my situation right now. I can&#39;t do this! Stopping myself to go further I push him. He stared at me confused and disappointed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just stood there staring at him as my tears started to fall out of my eyes. A sudden alert washes over his beautiful face. He cups my face with his hands. His hand feels so warm and comforting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look away and took a step back away from him. His hands froze not knowing what to do he just stood there staring at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Just leave me alone please...&amp;quot; I whisper enough to let him know that I mean it. He shook his head and insisted to come near me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Please s-stop&amp;quot; I sob he pulled me in his arms. It made me even cry more letting myself melt in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Shhh... I&#39;m sorry.&amp;quot; His whisper, his voice is muffled as he burry his face onto my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Just let me go... this is what you wanted in the first place&amp;quot; I muttered trying to convince myself to wake up from everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t move and kept on stroking my hair. I close my eyes trying to find the urge to push him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;S-stop!&amp;quot; My voice broke, this time I push him all the strength left in my whole being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, he lets me go, he just stood there. My tears fall heavy as I stare at him. Tears fell down his face. He looks completely shattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wipe my tears away. This is the right thing to do! I reminded myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know what to do. It feels like it&#39;s killing me inside. As thousands of swirling emotions came to life inside me, it hurt so much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood in his place not saying a word while looking at me with his broken eyes. I wanna look away but my eyes lock on him. Like how I always find myself mesmerized by those pairs of eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I know it was stupid of me to reject you, but I wanna make everything right.&amp;quot; He whispered, he grabbed my hand and kisses it. I closed my eyes fighting the urge to pull him and continue what we left earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You wouldn&#39;t want to involve with me,&amp;quot; I mutter, he stared at me confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know he had a lot of questions about me. He was probably asking himself. But it was better for him to stop looking for answers to his questions. And if he was involved with me his life won&#39;t be at peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Why? You know I can protect you if those rouges came back again.&amp;quot; He clenched his fist probably remembering what had happened the other night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stare at him sadly. He looks so desperate. Like how desperate I am to keep him away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You don&#39;t even know what you were saying.&amp;quot; I look at him in the eyes and keep a blank expression. This had to stop right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I might not know why they are after you but I will find out.&amp;quot; He took a step closer to me and I took a step back. He looks serious and determined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is not the answer that I wanted to hear from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What are you, hiding mate.&amp;quot; He whispered and that frightened me. My whole body froze as his eyes stare at me piercing down to my soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, please! Don&#39;t... I wanna say those words but my words don&#39;t want to come out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walks to the railings he stops his track for a bit and turns around in my direction his gaze staying on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I will see you again&amp;quot; with that he jumps off the railings leaving me completely unable to understand what just happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clint was busy looking at the map in front of him when I went to the dining. The food has been prepared on the table. He lowers the map for a moment and glances at me before taking his eyes back to the map.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What took you so long?&amp;quot; I went to my seat and grab something from it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I just have to deal with something.&amp;quot; I can&#39;t look at him in the eyes. I even took another shower just to get his scent off me. So Clint won&#39;t pick up his scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t answer instead he rolled the map and started eating his food. My mind is wandering about what just happened earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything is just chaotic. He wants me back and I want him more than anything but I can&#39;t! I can&#39;t have him... During that one month, everything completely falls out of place. And that is something I shouldn&#39;t let him get involved in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Klaire, are you okay?&amp;quot; Clint&#39;s voice brought me back to my dilemma. He looks quite worried about me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yes, I&#39;m just thinking something.&amp;quot; I gave him a slight smile to assure him that I&#39;m okay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lets out a sigh and didn&#39;t say anything. Maybe he felt that I was not in the mood to talk about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our dinner ends up with only the clacking of plates and utensils filling the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dinner, Clint went to grab the map and motion me to follow him. I followed him to his office. I didn&#39;t even know he had his own office here. He rolls the map on the table. Showing the whole North territory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He circled the East Mansion where we locate. The east surrounds by cliffs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;How did they get here without being to notice.&amp;quot; He mutters to himself. I look around the map and he was right the east is surrounded by pack warriors guarding the nearest border.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We are missing something. I glance once again at the forest is next to the border. And next to the cliff is the ocean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;They didn&#39;t use boats do they?&amp;quot; I ask. His eyes glimmer by the sudden thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;The ocean next to the cliff is filled with sharp rocks, making it hard for boats to get near it. Except if there is a secret passage where they can safely dock their boat.&amp;quot; So it means someone is telling them this information within the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We need to investigate further. But we cannot let anyone know about this.&amp;quot; I didn&#39;t say anything and just keep staring at the map. Where could that passage be?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Also that poison they used. It was not a simple poison. Someone is turning their back to the factions.&amp;quot; He added. I remember Dwayne&#39;s leg from the incident. It didn&#39;t heal quickly which indicates something is going on here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Good thing we caught two of them for questioning. I wonder where they are right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I took them to the dungeon. This Mansion is full of surprise.&amp;quot; He said, answering my questions earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;So you read minds now?&amp;quot; I joke, he just shakes his head and smiled at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Your face is showing it.&amp;quot; He pats my head and walks his way out of his office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed him from behind. He went to the right part of the corridor. And press something from the wall. The huge wall soon opens showing a dark staircase down the dark path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grabs a torch in the side and made his way down. I follow him our footsteps echoes as we go further down. I guess this is where the dungeon is located.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can hear the chains clicking as we reach the bottom of the staircase. I can feel my whole body trembling. This familiar feeling is making it harder to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clint notices my panic and he grabs my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m here, you are not alone.&amp;quot; I squeeze his hand and let out a heavy breath. Nodding my head so he can continue to walk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dungeon is dusty and old. It has a large prison cell. The torch from the wall is the only source of light. Does it look like it hasn&#39;t been used for years or maybe a century?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stop at the third cell and there they are. Both hands and feet are tied to each corner of the room. They are bleeding looks like Clint already went down here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They are both still unconscious. Clint grabbed a bucket of water in the corner. And splash the water to their face. They both flinch and gasp for air at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Wake up! It&#39;s time for you to answer me you fucking bastard!&amp;quot; I can feel his anger radiating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;HA-HA-HA *COUGH* he is coming,&amp;quot; one of them said. The other one also started laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You think it was funny?&amp;quot; He punches them in the face blood splat out of their mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Y-you don&#39;t frighten us.&amp;quot; They both stared at us with nothing but the humor in their eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;His *cough* going to get you.&amp;quot; My whole body shivered, his cold gaze stared at me like he was saying I can&#39;t escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Then I will kill him!&amp;quot; Clint shouted at them. Their laughter erupted. He tightens his fist and punches them again and again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood scattered around... And again I found myself unable to do anything.</p>
