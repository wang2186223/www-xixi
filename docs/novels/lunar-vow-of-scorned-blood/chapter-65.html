                <p>&#34;Get everyone out. I will handle them.&#34; He muttered, but something about him feels off. I can feel the pressure radiating around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go!&#34; Yustef pulled me, but before we left I turn to where Clint is and he was still standing there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He will be alright. You know Clint is now the closest to Klaire after Dwayne.&#34; Yustef mumbled, while we run towards the residence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, where is Noah?&#34; Yustef pointed out at Noah, who is busy helping the other citizens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all froze when a huge explosion open the main entrance. Showing thousands of werewolves. The faction really made sure to outnumbered. Central Kingdom is not an easy pack to destroy and the Faction is fully aware about that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look at Noah and Yustef who are also staring at the direction that caught my attention. A weird feeling of power was coming from there. And when I finally saw who their was. Clint was already in front. I didn&#39;t even felt his presence nor see him come there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You made the wrong move.&#34; Clint uttered, his eyes were directed towards the 3 elders. Where is the other one?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Common Clint, the ruling of the Central Kingdom is already long gone.&#34; One of them uttered. This time I was sure it was from the West. I remember his name was Vincent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They started firing some fires on us. Burning the houses, I clench my fist. Good thing we are almost done taking the elders and childrens out. Clint dodge the fire aiming from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously? Are they even werewolves, they are using such equipments.&#34; Noah uttered, staring at the big cannon that are at the back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Careful, those have wolfsbane mixed in it so the smoke can affect us somehow.&#34; Clint appeared behind us. How can she even move faster than before?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m on it.&#34; Yustef whispered, I shake my head at his crazy idea. Some of our warriors are already fighting against them. But still they are quite a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Make sure to destroy them all and get back here fast.&#34; I uttered, he just smiled at me. Oh! I know that smile. He was really enjoying this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shall we handle the rest?&#34; Noah shrugged his shoulders then we all shifted. Yustef went ahead first, not even stopping for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our silver-white wolf was standing out of the crowd of werewolves. This is harder than expected. All you can hear is the snapping of bones, crashing of bodies, some cry. I cannot even explain what is happening around me. I just kill who ever caught my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can smell the blood mixing in the air but then something made my chest hardens, it was like I was suffocating and when I glance around me I wasn&#39;t the only one experiencing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wolfsbane!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turn to where the Elders are and they are smiling wickedly. They are even letting their warriors die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yustef need to get those machines down. But then something unbelievable happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another set of werewolves appears and this time they were the shadow ones. They were heading our way but what surprised me is that they didn&#39;t attack us. They attack the werewolf behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What on earth is happening?&#34; One of the Elders said. Feeling the same surprised and confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look at Clint&#39;s direction and he didn&#39;t seems surprised at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m sure it was him! Galaz abilities is to created this shadow like figures that can suck your life and devour you after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was the only one who is behind the shadow wolves. He devour his prey which makes him even stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Calm yourself Royalties.&#34; We all turn our heads to Galaz. He was still wearing his hood around his head but something is different. His bandage are all gone showing us his face. No scars, or wounds in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It looks like you can&#39;t even handle them alone.&#34; He muttered, his voice was full of arrogance. I just hissed at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell are you doing here?&#34; He put his hands in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Relax! I&#39;m here because she told us to.&#34; My eyes widen at his words. I know he was talking about Klaire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would like to have fun with you right now but we need to finish this leaches first. &#34; He glance at the direction of the Elders who are glaring at us. &#34;It&#39;s been a while since I had my fun like this.&#34; He added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that his shadow shallow the bunch of werewolves completely. I didn&#39;t even had time to react. The smell of blood and burning woods filled the air. As well as the scream and growls of the pack members. Just how far did they have in their bloods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I open my eyes we are inside the a castle. Galaz was sitting at the chair sipping some wine when I woke up. I turn to look over my shoulders and found the others. Clint was t in the air by the same thing from earlier. Yustef was completely locked up only his face can be seen. He was glaring at Galaz direction and Noah he was still unconscious, both his hand and feet was tied up like mine. What the hell happened after the attack?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are probably asking why you are all here.&#34; Galaz uttered, he glance at my direction then back to Yustef and Clint. &#34;Okay, so now one will talk. Then I&#39;ll tell you anyway. We don&#39;t want you to interfere with our Business here. As you all know at this moment we will burn down all the Factions. But this is just a start up.&#34; He added then took another sip of his wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you planning on killing us?&#34; I muttered. He shake his head, clicking his tongue as he lean forward. Resting his hand bellow his chin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We could actually do that right now, but she doesn&#39;t want to. Right now we want the Factions to experience what happened to us. How it felt to see your love ones dies and you can&#39;t do anything about it. We will just take their childrens and kill some of their pack members. Nothing more nothing less just a little number.&#34; He then shrugged his shoulders. Just what is really happening?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is she?&#34; Clint uttered ignoring what he just said. He still have that calm look on his face even though he was tied up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, you are still awake? So the poison that Ria created is still useless around the almighty Clint.&#34; So that&#39;s why we lost conscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still haven&#39;t change huh.&#34; I look up to find Kariz, he still have the same look like before. &#34;I&#39;m glad you could all make it.&#34; He muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell are you planning Kariz!&#34; Yustef uttered, trying to get away from his chains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Relax! I wouldn&#39;t do anything. In fact Clint was fully aware of this matter.&#34; He mumbled then smiled at Clint. We all turned our head towards him and he just remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell is happening?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will explain everything later.&#34; He mumbled, then stared at Kariz. &#34;Now get us out of here.&#34; He added. Kariz told Galaz to take our chains off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who knows you couldn&#39;t even free yourself.&#34; Galaz uttered, receiving a glared at Yustef. When he was done taking his chain off, he pulled Galaz collar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wonder if you could even smile after I beat your little wolf.&#34; Yustef muttered, Clint told him to stop and he hissed. Letting go Galaz who is smirking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now let&#39;s start the real party.&#34; Kariz mumbled. I remained silent, watching him remembering how we all first met him, and that time when we got out of that facility. I wonder if we really know who he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all build our own pack after that, starting up by finding our shelters. At first we found a small cave that&#39;s where we first settled in. Amara by that time is starting to show her power and it was growing as times go by. She then became our Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aris are you sure you are going?&#34; Kariz mumbled, after all this time Kariz and I became closer. He was the same age at Mulac but he was there before all of us. We just found out that he was locked up into a different place before they took us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have to find a place where we could all live with hiding from them anymore.&#34; He sniff, then wipes his tears. As I stared at him longer he somehow had a slight resemblance of Klaire but his scars still cover half of his face and can&#39;t be healed anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You promise you will come back?&#34; I patted his head and smiled at him. He was the only one who didn&#39;t show any changes after everything they did to us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course I will, you just have to stay here and look after Amara.&#34; He frowned at my statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know that she was way stronger than me.&#34; I smiled at him and brush his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are strong always remember that.&#34; We bid our last goodbye before I went outside to where Calixto and Afreo is waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We will search some place where we could finally lay low. At this age we can finally shift into our wolves and when we reach a place where we can avoid the packs and humans, we all end up in the center continent. It was a place where humans and werewolves avoid because of the danger around it and we found it as the perfect place for all of us. It took us years to reach the place and finally when we got back everything change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amara was still the same but something is different about her. She was starting to become occupied. We can&#39;t seem to talk to her like how we used to? She was like a complete different person not even Aiden can only Kariz can stand beside her that time. I tried asking Kariz what happened when we are gone and he just answered us nothing. Even Aiden can&#39;t answer our questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then it happened, one day Amara went missing and when she came back she was covered with blood. All her body was completely covered with blood and the next day she had no idea about it that happened twice and when she ask her again it was like she completely forgotten about what just happened. After that we kept watching her, making sure that if she was going somewhere, someone should be with her. Kariz was the only one who could stick up with her. And so they became closer even Aiden was starting to get pissed because of it but he can&#39;t do anything about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then it all change when Kariz went missing, and that was the third time Amara came home with blood all over her. At first we thought she might be connected to why Kariz was missing but the scent of blood is different. It wasn&#39;t his and not even a bit of his scent was around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that day our lives completely change...</p>
