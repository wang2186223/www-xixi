                <p>Dwayne&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was already two days since I last saw her and I was stopping myself to run towards the east mansion. Because right now I need to do something first, I have this feeling that this might be connected to all my question somehow. I ran back to where I saw her last time, maybe she could answer my question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flashback:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remember our training from earlier. That next Alpha from South Lake is actually good enough to injured me. I need to get stronger to be able to protect her if another rogue attack occurs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I decided to get myself some time to think while I let my wolf go for a run. Maybe this will help me get my thoughts back in place. I remember again those words she mutters not so long ago; the way her tears broke my heart knowing that it was all because of my doings. And for the hundredth time I hated myself. My wolf let go a sad howl, I&#39;m sorry...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A blinding light stop my track; it was so bright that it obscures my vision. Once the light went out I found myself staring at a Lady with silver white hair that looks like it was shining because of the light coming from the moon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;So, it was you&amp;quot; she whispered enough for me to hear it. I look at her confused, I don&#39;t know but she seems harmless, she turns around to look at me and I was stunned. She looks exactly like Klare except for her golden eyes and silver white hair and she look much older. She reminded me of that Legend my father talks about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Who are you?&amp;quot; she smiled to me sadly, and it made my heart ache all of a sudden. It was like I hate the idea of seeing her sad. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s gotten to me but it feels like I&#39;ve known her for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I need to show you something, come here.&amp;quot; she mutter, pulling my hands closer to her. I know I have to shoved it away but as our skin touch a flash of images keeps popping in my head. It was like I&#39;m watching a movie in my head and suddenly I was transfer into another place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a huge castle but not an ordinary castle, I can smell the scent of rogues lurking around. Moreover, it seems that they can&#39;t detect my presence, and suddenly I was transferred into an underground dudgeon. It was really dark that the only light available is coming from a torch in the corner, the smell of metal and dust welcomed my nostrils, as well the lingering faint smell of blood. Where am I? And where is that lady? I walk further and this time it was complete darkness, good thing my wolf vision is good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And there I was staring at the lifeless body of a little girl or so I thought, I instantly felt the urge to kill someone right now. My thoughts stop when the little girl move a little, the chain in her hands is covered with blood as well as her clothes. She looks so young maybe around 8 or 10? Her tiny little hands try to swift away the strands of hair blocking her eyes but she can&#39;t even lift her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;W-whose there?&amp;quot; she whispered weakly. I wanted to kill the people who did this kind of thing to this little girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I-I k-know... s-someone is here, I c-can smell your s-cent&amp;quot; she tried to stand but she was too weak and trip before she could hit the ground I caught her right in time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How come I didn&#39;t notice this earlier, her hair has the same color of that lady but hers is cover with blood. I was about to ask if she was okay, but she hurriedly pull away from me and move at the furthest corner of her cell. Once more I realized why she reacted that way as the smell of rogues approaches us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Well look at our little princess already awake after all the things the king have done to her.&amp;quot; there are four rogues here and all of them are big enough to frighten the little girl. I could kill them with just one snap and my wolf was furious enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Look it seems like she lost her tongue.&amp;quot; they all burst laughing. The shortest one pulled the hair of the little girl that makes her whimpered in pain. I swear they wanted to see their death early.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Do that later, you know that he won&#39;t let us go live if we didn&#39;t bring her back fast.&amp;quot; One of the rogue mutter. The one pulling her hair frowned but follow the other one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Hurry up!&amp;quot; They unlock her chains, she just stood there unable to move. One of them push her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Move!&amp;quot; He shouted, pulling her hair. Her legs wobble as she took another step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was ready to approach them and let them meet their death but the little girl stared at me. I have no idea how she knew where I was but her prepossessing eyes stop me. She smiled bitterly as if she was so used to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Don&#39;t let him get her...&amp;quot; was the last thing I heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I know it I was back in the middle of the woods. With another question added in my head. Don&#39;t let him get her? Who is she talking about?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those last words of that lady and those piercing eyes of that little girl hunted me back</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since that day I always find myself back here in the woods, getting my hopes up that maybe that lady will appear again. I don&#39;t know why, but this familiar feeling might be something. That little girl, I wonder what happened to her. Her unusual eyes, eyes with different color, red and golden yellow. Those eyes haunted me like I&#39;ve seen them before but I&#39;m just not sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seems that just like the other night she wasn&#39;t going to show up. I let out a deep breath and was about to go back when I heard some branches breaking. I turn around to find the familiar brown wolf. The smell of the autumn breeze reminded me of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Miss me?&amp;quot; She asks in a teasing tone after she transform back to her human form. I just shook my head. How did I even forget that she will be back? She grabbed a pair of clothes and change into them in no time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Sarah look we need to ta-&amp;quot; she didn&#39;t let me finish my sentence and grappled me with a kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Sarah stop!&amp;quot; I angrily brush my lips. Grabbing her shoulders to keep her distance away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood there staring at me with her innocent brown eyes, I don&#39;t know why I even think that those eyes are innocent. Right now it makes me wanna regret even meeting those eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You like that before though.&amp;quot; she mumbled while pouting her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a deep breath and started walking my way back to the main house. She followed from my behind. I have no time to even handle her right now. I bet she already heard about what happened between me and my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What brought you back?&amp;quot; I ask, even though I knew the obvious answer. She smiled happily and gave me a wink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I came back for you.&amp;quot; How I wish I could hear those words from my mate&#39;s mouth, a slight tingle of pain washing me over again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I know how it feels.&amp;quot; She mumbled sadly and gave me a weak smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made me feel a slight guilt because of my harsh reaction earlier. Sarah is my childhood friend; she was the daughter of the third command of my father. Everyone thought that she will become the next Luna. But I was not even interested to her that way because she was more like a sister to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all grew up together including Zion. Until everything change one day, while the three us decided to have a quick run because we just had our complete first shifting. A sudden attack occurs exactly when her mate appears, as soon as those words escape her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;mate&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A large wolf rush towards her. It turns out that he was one of the rogues. His canines showing ready to bite the life out of her. Rogues are known for being ruthless even to their mates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I initially run towards them and the next thing I know the rogue was lying on the ground lifeless as I gaze with my hands covered with blood. While she stood there unable to believe what just happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that event she started to change, she became quiet, like a lifeless doll and only when she was with me will she start talking. I can still hear her scream every night she had nightmares, it was all my fault and that guilt keeps eating me alive. That is why I cannot leave her alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until one day she almost killed herself begging for me to fill in the void, she was crying helplessly and all I did was hug her, ever since that day we started to sleep together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t think much about it during that time because I was not too entangled before about the mate bond. I thought that it wasn&#39;t necessary and I could just reject my mate if she was not fit to be my Luna and make Sarah my Luna because I took away her mate. But I was completely shaken after meeting those blue-gray eyes. Those eyes that made my whole world upside-down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Sarah you know that won&#39;t happen again.&amp;quot; I think she already know what I&#39;m talking about. Her smile faded, anger coursed her demeanor face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;NO! You can&#39;t just leave me like this!&amp;quot; her tears streaming down her face. she looks weak and desperate. I wanted to console her but I cannot do that anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes went wide when a fainting scent of vanilla sweep the cold breeze. I know too well who that scent belongs to. I turn around to look where the traces of those scent came from but no one is there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But her scent tells me that she was just around not too long ago</p>
