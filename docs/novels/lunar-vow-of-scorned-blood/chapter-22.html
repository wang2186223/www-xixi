                <p>Clint was busy with something, which left our four to start our own observation. Yustef, Eliot, and Noah started investigating the other Faction on the days I remain unconscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yustef noticed a movement from the White Moon Pack, he found a ship just around the nearby coastline and it wasn&#39;t even reported during the following meetings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We already had our own suspicion and decided to go and check what was on that ship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I headed downstairs, they were already completed when I got there. Their heads turned in my direction as I walked down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Pretty slow aren&#39;t we?&amp;quot; Noah teased, I rolled my eyes at him. Clint was nowhere to be found.</p>

                <p>&amp;quot;He already went to the packhouse.&amp;quot; Eliot answered. I narrowed my eyebrow at them. Something was fishy around here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you sure, you wanna come with us?&amp;quot; Noah ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the fifth time that he asked the same thing. When he heard that I was going with them this time. They all reacted weirdly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;For the fifth time Noah, I&#39;m okay.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was still about to argue but I started walking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all followed not long after. They remained silent the whole time when we were walking, which was kinda weird? Especially Noah, he was the one who can&#39;t keep his mouth shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we get near the packhouse, they all started acting weirder?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you sure about this?&amp;quot; Noah asks again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stop and glared at him. &amp;quot;If you ask that again, I will smack you in the head.&amp;quot; I mutter. They all started looking at each other then they all let out a sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I was about to ask them what was going on. Rion called for me, he was walking in our direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I thought I won&#39;t be able to see you again.&amp;quot; Rion said, and he was with Lindon, his beta. Lindon&#39;s wounds were already healed this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yeah, it&#39;s been a while.&amp;quot; I mutter awkwardly. He was one of the people who witness what happened last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;By the way, I&#39;m really sorry about my father. I heard you fainted because of him.&amp;quot; Rion added with feeling guilty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah cleared his throat. I almost forgot about them. I rolled my eyes at them. They looked like they wanted to crawl their claws out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rion looked at their direction with wide eyes and his cheeks started to flustered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did Rion really didn&#39;t saw them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I apologize about that, let me introduce myself. I&#39;m Rion Alterez, the next Alpha of South Lake.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All their expression turn sour. It&#39;s not like they were friendly with the son of the Alpha who insulted me last time. They were just being nice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;This is quite new. The pup of the South Lake is being friendly with a human.&amp;quot; Noah muttered. I noted the sarcasm in his voice, so I glared at him, motioning for him to stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;About that, I deeply apologize for my Father.&amp;quot; Rion muttered. Lindon was starting to feel a little uneasy with the staring game happening here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Tsk.&amp;quot; That was the only thing Noah said and he started walking first. Yustef followed, Eliot remain beside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guarding, Eliot probably stayed because he didn&#39;t want me to stay alone with Rion and Lindon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Sorry about that.&amp;quot; I muttered, Rion shake his head and gave me his million-dollar smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It&#39;s nothing, I should be the one apologizing.&amp;quot; Rion said smiling at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked harmless, but that was also the reason why I felt like I had to stay alert around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rion&#39;s face suddenly brightened up as something came to his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Now that I remember, I still don&#39;t know your name. At least you could tell me your name after I let you sleep on my bed.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lindon and Eliot started coughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Sleep on whose bed?&amp;quot; Eliot muttered, trying to confirm if he heard it right. Eliot&#39;s eyes stayed on me. I shook my head at their thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It wasn&#39;t like that, he found me on the forest and I fell asleep. He took me in his room because he didn&#39;t know where he should take me.&amp;quot; I finished the story in one snap, not wanting for them to misunderstand any further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Nothing happened, I don&#39;t plan on doing anything to her...&amp;quot; Rion mumbled something but I didn&#39;t hear it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Rion, we need to go. You are needed for the preparation of the succession.&amp;quot; Lindon reminded him, I can still feel Lindon&#39;s dislike around me and I can&#39;t blame him for that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Now that you mentioned it, have you heard that the next Alphas will be having their succession by the end of the Month. I heard they will also declare their Luna by that time.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes shifted to Eliot who looked away. So, this was the reason why they were acting like they didn&#39;t want me to come with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We better get going too. Let&#39;s go Klaire.&amp;quot; Eliot pulled my hand, I followed him quietly. No one said anything, we both remain silent on our way to the packhouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yustef and Noah was waiting for us at the entrance. I pulled my hands away from Eliot&#39;s hold. Still processing on what I just heard, I suddenly feel suffocated. I continue walking, leaving them behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze on my track when I heard Dwayne&#39;s name. And he was standing next to the girl in the forest. I wanted to look away but my body won&#39;t let me do it. My eyes glued on his, our staring game felt like hours until the girl next to him tucked his elbow on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We need to go, Dwayne.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes drifted on that girl and just nodded his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remain there watching them pull away. That girl&#39;s hands travel to his, they walk holding each other&#39;s hand. I can feel my eyes starting to water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone cover my eyes with his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Don&#39;t look.&amp;quot; Yus&#39; cold husky voice whispered in my ears. I can feel his presence on my behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yus.&amp;quot; His name was the only thing I could utter and my tears betrayed me again. He pulled me into his arms and let me cry in there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t say anything and let me cry there in silence. After I calm myself, I let him go. His shirt is soaking wet because of my tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah and Eliot stay a few feet away from us. They both look guilty and worried at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m sorry, we didn&#39;t tell you anything about it.&amp;quot; Noah said, his eyes remaining on his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It wasn&#39;t your fault.&amp;quot; I mutter, feeling embarrassed that I&#39;m still acting like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;And it wasn&#39;t your fault also.&amp;quot; Yustef muttered, he clenched his hands. He looked angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yes, it wasn&#39;t your fault.&amp;quot; Eliot agreed, he patted my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smile a little by their actions, I&#39;m really glad that they are here with me. I somehow don&#39;t feel that alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Let&#39;s go.&amp;quot; I stop them using my hand when they were about to say something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Just make sure you will stay next to us. No funny business.&amp;quot; Yustef said seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded my head, they kept reminding me about the whole plan last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now I think I remember, they choose this day because they know the whole Factions would be busy because of the succession. They will start passing their titles during the New Moon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did I forget about it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Klaire, are you listening?&amp;quot; Eliot ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just nodded my head. I didn&#39;t even hear anything they were saying earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You will stay with Noah, watching out for anyone who might come.&amp;quot; Eliot added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yustef took out a piece of paper on his pocket. He showed it to me, the layout of the ship. It was a three-level ship. We will enter the deck. Yustef and Eliot will head at the lower level of the ship. We have a guess that this was the exact ship that those rogues used.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We arrived at the location of the ship and it was quiet. I can see some guards who are guarding the ship. One in the top deck and two on the port. Yustef head out first, we conceal our presence, making it hard for them to even notice us. Eliot followed after Yustef, and motioned it is clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I and Noah follow them on behind. The Ship is a lot bigger than I expected. Yustef had already knocked down the 2 guards on the port. He pulled them on the side, they look like they are just sleeping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He told us to follow him and we did it quietly. They could just knock them out in one snap if they really wanted to but we need to stay low this time. We heard some footsteps coming our way, making us head back from where we were hiding earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were holding some boxes that came from the ship. What was inside those boxes? We will find out soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Let&#39;s go.&amp;quot;</p>
