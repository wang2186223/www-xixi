                <p>&amp;quot;Move faster.&amp;quot; The order was directed to me, I didn&#39;t notice that I was staring this long and stop moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started walking faster, this time we turn to the hallway then move right until we reach a red door. The door was big at the point of view of the young child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened and we were force to enter it. There are total of 10 bed at this room when we all got inside the door was automatically closed. I turned to check it but it was useless, the door knob was already locked before I even reach it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scan the room it was a medium size room big enough to sustain us all. A slight sound made us turned our heads, it was a boy. He was hugging himself in the corner. Hands trembling, Mulac slowly walk to his direction and went down to his knees to check on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you okay?&amp;quot; I ask, not sure what to do with him. He lifter his head tears were streaming down his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had a long hair, half of this face was covered by the strands of his hair. Black eyes stared back at us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you alright? Did they do something to you?&amp;quot; He shakes his head rapidly then stared at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m Mulac, do you have a name?&amp;quot; He shakes his head once more; he doesn&#39;t have a name? Or he just doesn&#39;t remember it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Do you even know anything?&amp;quot; Afreo said who is already standing beside Mulac. Aris also went to where the kid was sitting and started talking to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calixto was standing next to the little girl, she was standing in the far corner and Calixto was next to her, I have no idea what they are talking about, and she was actually smiling at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There is slight discomfort as I watch them, when they notice me watching they both stop talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know that they were close also during Calixto&#39;s reaction before. That thought never cross my mind. I can feel a slight irritation and I don&#39;t know if this is mine or this kid&#39;s emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened taking all our attention to the new arrival. It was the same woman; her name is Via if I&#39;m not mistaken. She was smiling when she entered, her eyes roam around and stop at her direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walks around and stop in the center right in front of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Okay now, this will be your new room. Don&#39;t you like it?&amp;quot; She asks, no dare answer among us we just stood there with confused face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Well that would be all, now please have some rest. I&#39;ll meet you all in the morning.&amp;quot; She said then start walking to her direction. The Doctor lean forward to match her height, her eyes were blank. She whispered something to her making her eyes wide. Then started walking to the door after that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Goodnight everyone...&amp;quot; She mutters then the door opened and she went out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of us all stood there quietly unable to even process everything. Afreo climb to one of the bed and the rest followed, I pick the bed next to her Calixto was next to Mulac and right after her was the kid with the long hair. I still have no idea who he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You should choose the bed which is further away from me.&amp;quot; She mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was right what I saw earlier weren&#39;t an imagination she was fully awake that time and heard us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m sorry about what you heard.&amp;quot; I somehow feel guilty about everything. She shrugged her shoulders as if it was nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m used to it. I know I look different and weird.&amp;quot; She mumbled, but the sadness in her voice was evident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t remember what our conversation was about but the next morning the Doctor arrived again, they gave us some breakfast then the same medicine as before. The whole month our routine was always like that. They will come here do some checkup. Writing something in their files then the same thing happened like every single day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We also name the kid with the long hair Kariz, we all decided it and he seems to like it. The relationship between us all was starting to be more comfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We heard that Amara was actually raised here, she was locked up in the dungeon before she even remembers it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was already being 3 months; I notice some changes within my body. It was starting to become different, I can feel my strength increasing and the same goes to the others. The doctors started taking some blood samples from us after they notice some changes from us. I&#39;m still not sure what the hell are they doing, why would they need human kids for this things. I confirmed that all of us was human because there aren&#39;t any traces that indicates they are from the werewolves bloodline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened again and this time it wasn&#39;t the typical doctors who went to check on us. It was Via and she was with a man, I can feel the power radiating around him. Even a little human can tell that he wasn&#39;t normal. Grey eyes was looking for something in the room then it stops on my direction or should I say at the person behind me. I can feel her whole body trembled in fear as he stared at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was pulling the hem of my shirt making herself smaller, as she tries to avoid his piercing gaze. He walks slowly at us; his steps feel like he was dominating us. He stops right in front of me I look up to gaze at him but he didn&#39;t bother looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Is that how you greet your father?&amp;quot; All our eyes went wide except for him and the Doctor. She lowers her head; she was now clenching my shirt. It felt like she could rip it off any minute now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Come with me.&amp;quot; She looks hesitant for a moment, &amp;quot;You know what will happen next.&amp;quot; He said smiling, but his voice was giving a low warning. She instantly went to his side. She turned her head to glance at my direction before she followed him. They all went outside living us with Doctor Via.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Okay now, I need you all to also follow me.&amp;quot; We didn&#39;t say anything the guards started entering the room, we all went to line up like how we used to then start following them from behind. I don&#39;t know where she went but this time we are heading to another direction far from the usual place we are getting to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We entered the room, 6 bed was waiting for us, they instructed us to lay down and we complied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They started to inject us with something, I felt my surroundings spinning. This isn&#39;t a good sign; I need to get out of here. I tried to get up but I can&#39;t feel my strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Let&#39;s now begin...&amp;quot; Was the last thing I heard before everything went blank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Vision end***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I now remember everything, starting from this place. I scan the dungeon once more. I heard some footsteps from my behind it was Eliot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Aris.&amp;quot; I utter those words; he didn&#39;t look surprised after hearing that name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Welcome back Aiden.&amp;quot; He smiled at me. I gave him a bro hug and he did the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Since when did you remember?&amp;quot; I ask, he shrugged his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I really don&#39;t know at first I thought those are all some random dreams, I didn&#39;t believe it at first, then I saw the same Lady you were talking about. &amp;quot; He explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A loud noise caught both our attention, we started running outside. The rest was already there when we get there, the loud noise came from the other side of the Island, there were smoke around there. This only means one thing...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was really here, we all went out shifting to our wolves, and when we got there. It was already too late...</p>
