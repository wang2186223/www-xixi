                <p>My mouth curl into a smile, my wolf was relentless. He wanted to crawl his claws out. I scan the grounds we are totally outnumbered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;This is going to be fun.&amp;quot; Cameron mumbled to himself. As he started shifting to his wolf, revealing his dark brown wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harid followed his new wolf, it was bigger as expected. Snarling at the Rogues in front of us. My eyes stop at Klaire&#39;s direction. She was just standing at center with her eyes only looking at one direction. I follow where she was staring so intensely but found nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turns her head at me, feeling my gaze. Her eyes are blank; I can&#39;t read what she was thinking. In a swift move she made the rogues whimper. the rogues near her was now crunching on the ground. Crying in pain, it was just a guess but that was exactly the same thing that happened before us. How did she?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A loud growl snaps me out of my thoughts. A rogue was now on top of me, snarling his teeth at me. I used my hands to stop his head from getting near me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Ack-&amp;quot; a loud cry came from the rogue who attack me, as he lost his strength. Stumbling on the floor in pain. His claws were digging at the ground as he whimpered in pain and in a snap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance back at the only person who could do this, Klaire was staring intensely at the rogue. Her eyes were glowing. She just stops once the rogue was dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Either you help, or get out of here.&amp;quot; She said coldly, shifting her eyes back in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The four royals beside her, shifted to their wolves. Four silver white wolfs was standing beside her. Their eyes are glowing with intent to kill whoever comes their way. You can smell the metallic scent of blood mixing in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Some of the rogues are like just shadows, our attacks are useless.&amp;quot; Rion mumbled, I didn&#39;t even notice he was standing next to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What do you mean?&amp;quot; I ask, he was pertaining to the weird rogues with red eyes and dark fur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I tried to attack one of them, but my hand just slips into nothing. &amp;quot; Rion pointed at Harid who is fighting one of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harid was in disadvantage, one of the Royals help him. I don&#39;t know who is who among them. But he jumps right above the rogue and chew his head off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Aim for the head if you want to fight one of those.&amp;quot; Clint mutter, then shifted back to his wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shifted to my wolf, Rion did the same thing. We somehow manage to kill some of the rogues but they still keep coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I growl at the rogue who is challenging me. It was one of the red eyes rogues. His eyes are glowing with the killer intent. Teeth elongated, Sharp canines flashing. We both squared up each other. I can&#39;t underestimate their strength. If I didn&#39;t receive my new found power, I wouldn&#39;t last to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting out one loud growl, the rogue charges once more. I quickly went to defensive position, preparing for the impact of his attack. The rogue was a lot heavier than I had predicted as the rogue slams into me with full force. Letting out a grunt, I bite his neck, wrapping my canines deeper. I heard the snap of his bones, but he still tried to bite my face off while his body trembled with pain. When I finally let go of my grip he was already dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time I charge to another rogue, he was busy fighting Cameron when I jump over his head, and chew his head off. I can taste the metallic taste of blood in my mouth. Cameron nodded his head and we both went back to fighting with the other rogues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t notice one of the rogues attack and end up getting hit. I gritted out before falling onto my back, using the momentum to kick the rogue over my head. He whined from the impact but I didn&#39;t give him a chance to recover and broke his neck. He lay their breathless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another wolf came rushing to me, I kicked him in the stomach as soon as I saw an opening. He yelped and by the sound of the crack, I knew I broke a couple of his ribs. I jump back not letting his take a breath and snap his head off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time we are done fighting all the rogues, another group came running. We are already exhausted and Harid got injured during the fight, his arm is bleeding heavily. His wounds were not healing, one indication that they use poison to keep us from healing faster. Harid and Cameron was already in their human form. The field is already covered with blood, bodies of rogues scattered around. The Royals fur was covered with blood, just like me and Rion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance my surroundings to look for Klaire, she was nowhere to be found. Did she get caught up by the rogues? I was on the verge of panic when I felt an intense power emerging around us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed the source of that power and saw Klaire. I could see a distinct outline of glow around her, I couldn&#39;t see the details but more or less the heavy feeling of the pressure around her is evident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rogues also stop on their track as they felt the intensity in the air. Klaire&#39;s gaze was focus on the new arrival rogues. She was surrounded by this golden light; her silver-white hair was flowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I notice a large flow of energy emanating around her, it was much distinct than the glow around her. Black and gold was the color of it. The atmosphere around us is changing a certain heaviness in the air would sit on your shoulder until it felt like you would be crashed. It was getting harder and harder to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried keeping my focus but it became harder as the pressure is crashing me. I shifted to my human form because it was getting harder for me to maintain my wolf form, Rion was already in his human form before me. He was with Cameron and Harid. Harid was already unconscious. Probably also due to the pressure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rogues growl louder at us; we are still outnumbered by them. But they aren&#39;t that many like before. I glance back at Klaire. Her back was facing me so I can&#39;t see her expression. My eyes grow wide when the rogues started attacking each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have no idea why, but they are killing each other. My eyes snap at Klaire. She was smiling at the gruesome site in front of her. Like she was enjoying it? Her eyes were blank when she turns her to my direction. She probably felt my gaze. Her gaze was sending shiver down my spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Sleep...&amp;quot; Her voice is the last thing I remember before, I felt the sudden heaviness in my eyes. And before I know I was falling into a deep sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I woke up I was already in my room. I supported my head with my hand as I felt a little dizzy when I got up of my bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah burst out of the door, she hurriedly wrapped her arms around me. She was crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I was so worried about you, when I heard that there was a rogue attack. I didn&#39;t know what to do.&amp;quot; She mumbled while sobbing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stroke her hair to comfort her. I was still feeling a little confused about everything that happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I was okay, Sarah.&amp;quot; I mumbled, putting my hands on her shoulders to keep a distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You were unconscious for 3 days!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned at what she said. 3 days? So that happened already 3 days ago? I went to my balcony to check the surroundings. It looks quite normal like before. No more blood around, not even the smell of blood or rogues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What happened?&amp;quot; I ask, unsure what I wanted to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She crossed her arms and gave me a glass of water. She was staring at me intensely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;The Luna marking is postponed after the attack. Then the Royals track down the rogues who attack that night but they still found nothing. The Alpha of Golden Arid was still unconscious. They found poison on the canines of those rogues. Also the flowers used in the succession was also one of the reason why the pack felt unconscious except you and the other Alpha&#39;s.&amp;quot; She explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flowers? So that was the reason why it was harder for us to locate the scent of rogues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded my head, letting out a deep sigh. I still have no idea what just happened. But the connection between the rogues and the royals is quite obvious. The way Klaire reacted to that unknown man is quite suspicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;ll take a shower; you could go downstairs first.&amp;quot; I didn&#39;t wait for her answer and step inside the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I need to clear my thoughts and the cold water will help me come back to my senses.</p>
