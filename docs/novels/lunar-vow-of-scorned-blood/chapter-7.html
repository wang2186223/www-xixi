                <p>Klaire&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stay in the mansion since we came here. After that incident, I didn&#39;t have the gut to meet his blue-green eyes that I started to love...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of what happened keeps hunting me. The way he looks at me with those emotions is breaking me inside like all those emotions that I sealed away are being open little by little. It was making me crazy fighting every inch of my body is screaming to be with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know what to do with him anymore. He wanted this! He was the one who rejected me but why is he acting like a lost puppy waiting to be picked up. And I know for myself I shouldn&#39;t pick him up! Not anymore...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a frustrated groan. Clint was so furious about the way he reacted when he saw me again. He was even angrier at the fact that he even tried to get near me. And I can&#39;t blame him for being like that. I was even angry at myself for reacting like this!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way it almost crushes me as I watch him be in that pain. It even took my breath away when I heard him cry in pain because of my doing. But I had no other options I have to stop them before one of them gets into a serious injury or worse death, knowing my brother will take no time to kill him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Part of me wanted to see him and see if he hurt anywhere. I wanted to stay in his arms and feel safe but I need to control myself. I blame this stupid mate bond that I have this feeling of affection towards him! And it was getting out of hand! It was an ironic feeling that I can&#39;t explain!</p>

                <p>Those words keep echoing in my head. How dare him to even call me his mate! After what he did a month ago? I can still feel my world-shattering into pieces every time I remember that day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I Dwayne Carter rejects you as a mate. I don&#39;t need a weakling human to be my mate.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hatred, sadness, disappointment, and betrayal are the things that left me since that day. And it should remain like that! Damn it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A loud noise brought me back to my senses. I close my eyes to sharpen my senses but heard nothing? I pull myself out of my room and head outside where the noise earlier came from. I sniff the air and find the familiar sweet scent of mint and winter. I even close my eyes to sniff the scent when the reality hit me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pair of blue-green eyes are standing a few feet away from me, who is now staring at me with so many emotions. Everything flickers in his eyes mirroring me but I tried to conceal it. It is a good thing it was dark and my hair is covering my face a little because of the wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;s wearing a white shirt that hugs his chest perfectly, with his jeans. He was barefooted stating that he came here running with his wolf form. His blond hair is a mess but still looks flawless at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If that even makes sense at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What are you doing here?&amp;quot; I tried to make my words loud but it turns out to be a whisper. I can feel my whole other trembling from excitement and anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We need to talk, Klaire.&amp;quot; The way he said my name gives me so much pleasure as my whole body reacted to every word. I even close my eyes to hide the affection that is flickering out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;There is nothing to talk about.&amp;quot; I bite my cheek to keep myself from calling his name. His name that I keep calling in the past month.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blame the mate bond for this!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a step closer to me but I took a step backward afraid that once he was near me I wouldn&#39;t be able to control myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Don&#39;t.&amp;quot; It sounded more like a plea rather than a threat. I can&#39;t even look at him in the eyes. I&#39;m too frightened to see what those gorgeous eyes look like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t listen to me and took another step. This time I looked up at him but what he did next catch me off guard. He pushes me to the wall with my arms locked with him. The smell of mint and winter makes me lose control. The feeling of wanting keeps popping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes to control myself before I throw myself at him and completely forget that he doesn&#39;t want me. A wave of sparkling tingles my whole body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Let me go&amp;quot; I finally found my voice. I felt so powerless as I stare into his eyes. Longing and lust are written all over them and I&#39;m pretty it was mirroring mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I can&#39;t do that.&amp;quot; He even moved closer I can feel his breath on my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips are brushing with me as he speaks. A bolt of pleasure made me close my eyes and bit my lip to stop myself from moaning. How can he do this to me?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I am not yours, so you had no right to claim me.&amp;quot; I reminded myself of those sleepless nights. Crying and nothing but pain. But it was all completely useless! I was completely captive by him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A growl escaped from his mouth and his eyes started to turn black. This time I know his wolf was about to come out. He closes his eyes trying to fight his wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;MINE!&amp;quot; He said with full of power. His possessiveness is evident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with a blink of an eye, his lips are crashing to me. My eyes pop wide open as I let him send sparks throughout my whole system. I found myself closing my eyes and returning his harsh yet show so much belonging kiss it was like he is marking his territory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moan escape from my mouth as I let him slip his tongue inside my mouth, letting him taste it. We both fight for dominance but he didn&#39;t let me. I gave in to the pleasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All those reasoning that I keep reminding myself earlier was completely washed away in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You are mine&amp;quot; he whispers between our kisses. I didn&#39;t answer instead I let my hands brush his soft blond hair. He closes his eyes as he lets out a moan. A smirk crosses my lips knowing that I can give him so much pleasure by just tugging his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand caressed my hair pulling me closer to him like the limited space between us is still too far. It was not enough for both of us. The feeling of having him next to me even feels surreal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes shot open when I heard something. And I think he also heard it because he frowns. I even heard him curse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Wolf paws.&amp;quot; He said the same thing that is running in my head. There are werewolves coming to us. My eyes shot wide open when everything, we had just done slapped me like a wildfire. I quickly move away from him but he stops me before I can even take a step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grabbed my waist and pulls me closer to him. Back to our position earlier. I can feel my cheeks heat up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;They are getting close.&amp;quot; He whispered while staring at me, I look away. I shouldn&#39;t let him do that again. I felt a pang of slight guilt to my brother for not feeling guilty at all. Damn this is hard!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sniff the air and find the unfamiliar smell of rogues. I heard him curse under his breath. His grip tightens and with just a few swifts he pulled me inside. We are now in my bedroom how did he know where my room was? He carefully lays me down on my bed. Like I will break any minute if he wasn&#39;t careful. I almost smile at the thought, a good thing he didn&#39;t see it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Don&#39;t come out unless I came to get you.&amp;quot; He mutters, cups my face gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can feel his power radiating over his body as he stared at me full of concern. He was hesitating to say something but decided not to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I can utter the word, he was already gone, leaving me his scent that soon vanishes in the air. I found myself missing his presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bury my face into my hands. Why did I let this happen?! My tears started streaming down my face. I don&#39;t understand myself anymore. All my rationality is all gone just by being near him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought I was ready to face him that I can control myself, that I will be okay once I saw him again. But I was wrong! This is all wrong! The day I met those blue-green eyes everything completely falls out-of-place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Especially now...</p>
