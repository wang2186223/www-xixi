                <p>I ran outside that place and when I close the door everything was on fire, there is smoke everywhere. I flinch when I heard a loud cry, just what on earth is happening right now? Is this another memory?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance in the direction of the loud cry and found the young girl standing right next to the body of a lifeless werewolf. Her whole body was full of blood. I found some traces of blood from where she came from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart almost stopped when she turned in my direction, her eyes were blank. Her expression is different from a normal child around her age. Her eyes were red; a murderous glare was written all over them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Get her!&amp;quot; I didn&#39;t notice the arrival of the other Rouges, they all shifted to their wolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The little girl didn&#39;t even flinch and just stared at them and in a snap, they all started killing themselves. She started walking slowly in my direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What happened next made my whole world stop.</p>

                <p>I know that what she was saying was directed to me. I didn&#39;t say anything then she turned to face the new groups of Rogues right behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They look surprised by the gruesome sight in front of them. She slowly lifted her hand then whispered those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Pain.&amp;quot; Her words were directed at them and all of a sudden they all started whimpering in pain. Their loud cries echo within the walls of the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them tried to fight and stood on his feet even though you can see the pain written on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I w-will kill you!&amp;quot; He mumbled while trying to regain his strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;If you could even get close to me.&amp;quot; She mumbled then her lips turned into a playful smile. And right within my eyes, his head exploded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight made the other Rogues tremble in fear, you could smell the fear in the air as well as the intensity of her power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t even doing anything except stare at them. This time she turned to the remaining Rogues who are weakened to a snivel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slowly walks in their direction then glances down at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Shall I help stop you from feeling in pain?&amp;quot; She asked, her voice was soft yet it doesn&#39;t sound like a child at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Okay, if no one will talk, then I have no other choice.&amp;quot; She slowly lifted one of them, just right where her height can. Then in a blink of an eye, his heart was already in her little hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;See it wasn&#39;t that bad, you won&#39;t feel any pain anymore.&amp;quot; She mumbled playfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Amara!&amp;quot; She turned to face the one who called her, Amara that name again...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let go of the body of the Rogue then face the same kid that I saw earlier. He wasn&#39;t alone there are 5 other kids right behind him. His green-blue eyes are glowing. I can never forget those eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Aiden, I was just about to get you all.&amp;quot; She said, she sounded more like a child right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stop when they notice the sight in front of them. His eyes went back and forth from Amara to the Rogues. When she noticed his stare she turned her back to the Rogues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I was just about to finish.&amp;quot; She mumbled then snap her fingers. All the rogues started taking their hearts out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the children covers the eyes of the smallest among them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Oh C&#39;mon Mulac don&#39;t be afraid, I wouldn&#39;t do that to you.&amp;quot; Her smile was giving me chills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Let&#39;s get going before he catches us all.&amp;quot; The child that looked exactly like Clint said then they all started running.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;The exit is right next to that corner on the left.&amp;quot; One of them said I notice an unfamiliar face among them that I just saw right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was small so I didn&#39;t notice him earlier. He had black hair and his long hair was covering the haft of his face. I tried to see his face clearly but it was useless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I turned to face the entrance a man was already waiting for them. His presence was overwhelming, he slowly turned around to face the children, they all stop and stared at the man with the same expression as I am.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Well, what do we got here?&amp;quot; His words sounded normal but I can feel the intensity within his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Get out of the way!&amp;quot; The young Clint said, he sounded like the Clint I knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Look here little kid, I gave you that strength. I even feed you and let you stay here instead of the shabby street. And this is what I would get in return?&amp;quot; He acted like he was hurt but then everything happens too fast the next thing I know. The young child was already flying in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A loud thud erupted as he hits the wall. They all stood frozen like I am. His gray eyes look bored and unaffected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Now who wanted to go next?&amp;quot; My eyes were wide open as I watch everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Afreo!&amp;quot; They all ran to where the young Clint who is called Afreo was laying around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What do want from us?&amp;quot; Aiden mumbled, his green-blue eyes were furious and he was staring at that man, anger was written all over his innocent face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Aiden don&#39;t.&amp;quot; She mumbled while holding his hand to stop him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Good question.&amp;quot; The man put lifted his hands on his chin like he was thinking seriously about the answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Well to be honest I don&#39;t need anything from all of you. Just her.&amp;quot; His eyes were directed at the young girl behind Aiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You all just substitute in case she wasn&#39;t successful.&amp;quot; He mumbled, they all look confused like I am.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What do you mean by that?&amp;quot; This time another child asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Since you will all die in my hands then, I will explain everything to you since that idiot Doctor didn&#39;t even have the slightest thought of telling you.&amp;quot; He lit up tobacco that he took out of his coat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You see, the blood that is running in your veins came from her.&amp;quot; He pointed at Amara. &amp;quot;She was the key for me to open the old clan that is already extinct.&amp;quot; He inhales then blows out the smoke from his tobacco.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You see; her blood was capable on infusion with the Lycans old blood. Well, her father and I found that Royal blood of Lycans during our last war. But then he met her stupid mother who is protecting that bloodline.&amp;quot; He mumbled then started hitting his tobacco.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If what he was saying was true, the Lycans are the firstborn bloodline of werewolves. They are believed to be the most powerful creature that the Moon Goddess created but because they are so powerful, they became ruthless to their core and killed any kind of creature. Their thirst for blood and chaos is indescribable. The Moon Goddess then took her creation back and created the werewolves in exchange for the Lycans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Your lying!&amp;quot; She mumbled, he started laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I am not my dear daughter, I raised you for this. I&#39;m not your real father. I killed both of your parents because you were the only key.&amp;quot; He said, then threw his tobacco.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;So everything was a lie? Everything I did for you was because I thought you were my father... I thought once I did everything you want so you could treat me like your daughter!&amp;quot; Her voice broke as she started crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Of course my daughter, I don&#39;t want to tell you this but you gave me no choice. I need you to be the vessel of the new Lycan and you happen to be the daughter of the protector and my dearest brother.&amp;quot; He slowly walks towards her. But someone blocks his way. It was the kid who had a long hair</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Get out of the way you little bastard.&amp;quot; Just like what happened to Afreo he ended up flying, he landed at the far corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We won&#39;t forgive you!&amp;quot; One of the children started running to attack him but end up getting beaten up. He kicks him right in the stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;No Mulac!&amp;quot; One of the kids run and tried to catch Mulac but he was already laying on the floor before he reached him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;D-don&#39;t cry, Calixto.&amp;quot; Mulac whispered, blood was dripping down his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m not crying, we will get out of here so just stay still,&amp;quot; Calixto said. I stood there completely hopelessly while watching all this happening right before my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Now be a good kid and get out of the way.&amp;quot; He stops right in front of Aiden who is holding Amara behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lifted his head then glared at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I won&#39;t let you!&amp;quot; A loud slap echoes, Aiden almost fell to his feet but he remains standing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You still won&#39;t move?&amp;quot; This time he lifted him using his one arm. He throws him on the wall hitting his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He groans in pain but continues to stand and went to her side. Belerick looks annoyed at the moment. He punches him in the stomach making him throw up blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;STOP!&amp;quot;</p>
