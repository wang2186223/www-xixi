                <p>Dwayne&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was shocked when she nodded her head. I lean down slowly closing the gap between our lips. She closes her eyes as our lips touch. I mirror her actions. Sparks erupted my whole system, sending fireworks alive inside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Kiss her!&amp;quot; My wolf could not wait one second any more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kissed her with the intention of telling her everything I feel, all this feeling is too overwhelming. She kissed me back with the same intensity. It feels like our lives depend on each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand caressed my hair, making me moan as she pulled the strands of my hair. A moan scape my mouth, I can feel that she was liking it. I bite her lower lip she gasps at the contact. Her breath was dry and needy; I slip my tongue on his mouth tasting every inch of it. She fought for dominance but I&#39;m too eager for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I love you...&amp;quot; I whispered between our kiss, she stiffened as soon as she heard those words like a wildfire suddenly took her resolve. Her eyes were wide and cautious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remains silent, the line of her jaw is strained and there is tension in her eyes. I was waiting for another blow of anger around her but instead, her index fingers trace the base of my neck. I gaze into the depths of her blue-grey eyes. I don&#39;t know what she was thinking right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;No, you&#39;re not.&amp;quot; Her words are full of confidence. Like she was sure that I don&#39;t love her. Her eyes are dark, pupils dilated from fear? From lust? I want to hurl myself at her, but I restrain myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I open my mouth to say something but her index fingers shush me, the coldness of her finger melting away as she traces my upper lip. I have no idea what she was doing, but I like the urge of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tiptoes to lean closer to my left ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Let&#39;s get out of here.&amp;quot; She murmured, her words stuck in my head, I stop for a minute to process what I just heard from her. Her eyes gleam with lust and longing mirroring mine, the way her lips curl into a smile is making me shiver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know why but how she behaves right now is making me confused? I was expecting her outburst, yelling at me what am I doing here. But nothing like that happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just came here to explain to her what she might hear from everyone. But she won&#39;t even listen to anything I say. That I myself don&#39;t know what to do, duty between love... Never in my entire life did that word occur to me. I never imagine myself to be doing all this because of love. I thought I gave up everything about my mate after the incident involving Sarah and her mate. But I was wrong, Klaire&#39;s blue-gray eyes got me smitten the moment I saw her. I was just too afraid to admit it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Klaire steps back, making a small space between us. I watch her every move afraid that she might actually be gone this time. The hollow in my chest expanding just by thinking about it is too painful for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to say something, but I am too afraid to mutter a word. I remain silent watching her long white nightgown sway as the wind hits her. Her hair flowing, she tucks some strands of hair on her ear. She looks weak and fragile under the moonlight. Her pale skin glowing. She looks really beautiful... I could watch her forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her shoulders slump as he relaxes, she turns slowly to face me once again. Her eyes were burning with desire. She moved slowly towards me, her eyes stuck on mine, she was watching me like a prey. She wrapped both her arms around my neck, she smiles and some unknown emotion flits across her face, making me uneasy? My wolf brush that thought away, he likes the way our mate is not yelling at us to leave her alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Kla--&amp;quot; her lips claim mine once more, I was a little surprised, and kissed her back. She stopped mid-way, I frowned why did she stop? My wolf and I ask the same question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Let&#39;s stop here.&amp;quot; she closes his eyes as fury and possibly regret, sweeps across her beautiful face. She unfolds her arms around my neck. My fear earlier is already happening in front of me. She averted her eyes, guilt is evident in them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A large lump stuck on my throat, she was watching me cautiously. Waiting for my reaction. Closing my eyes, I tried to conceal all these emotions swirling inside me. I don&#39;t wanna end things between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Just this time, please allow me.&amp;quot; I whispered staring deep into her eyes. She looks hesitant like she doesn&#39;t trust herself if she will stay with me longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opens her mouth to say something but I did the same thing she did earlier, I lay my index finger on her lips. She didn&#39;t say anything and just watch me with confusion. I pulled her hands and kiss the back of her palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Please?&amp;quot; I added, trying to keep my emotion in check. My eyes still fixated on her, hoping... My lips curl into a smile when she slowly nodded her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a step back from her, took my shirt off, and shifted into my wolf. She glances up at me, blue-gray eyes alive, and it&#39;s there in the air between us, and that electricity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lower my head down, caressing my fur by her hand. She closes her eyes as she leans her head on mine. My wolf rejoices at the feeling. I lower myself, she looked a little confused at first but then she pulled herself on my back. Her weight was right between my neck and upper back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She yelped when I started moving, her hands were tugging my fur. The cold breeze welcomes us; we move further in the forest. I peek up at her, and she&#39;s wearing her enigmatic half-smile. Her giggles feel like music in my ears. I stop right next to the cliff, he crawled down on me and I shifted back to my human form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes shut close as she notices my nakedness, I smile at her innocence, she looks adorable. I slip into the clothes I brought with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m done.&amp;quot; I mutter, she peeks a little making sure that I was already dressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What are we doing here?&amp;quot; She asked, I didn&#39;t answer her. Her eyes scanned the place. It was a remote area of the forest. I offer my hand at her, she just stared at it for a moment then took it. I let out a breath that I didn&#39;t know I was holding as she grabbed my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I guide her to a large three that are lying on the ground. I usually use it as my chair whenever I come here. She follows, pulling her into my side. I clasp her hand and trace my knuckles with her thumb, and all my muscles clench tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I usually come here whenever I wanted to be alone.&amp;quot; I mumbled, glancing her reaction she was just staring at me intensely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I just want to show it to you.&amp;quot; I added, her eyes clouded with a flicker of emotion. I run my index finger down her cheek. She closes her eyes at the contact, I took the chance to lean forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m going to kiss you, if you hated it you can do whatever you want.&amp;quot; I murmur between our lips. She remains silent and I close the gap between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I inhale sharply, taking in her sweet vanilla scent as our kissed deepen, my arms supporting her back as we move closer, it felt like the space between us is still too far for us. I tug her hand on me and yank her so that she was on my lap. She has her arms around me, I snuggle my nose on her hair as my lips moves down to her neck. She let out a soft moan as I continue to kiss her. She clasps my hair tightly, making me close my eyes. The pain of it resulted in pleasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gaze at her for a moment, bewildered, as if she was some kind of mystical creature that might vanish if I let her out of my sight. My hand stops at the hem of her nightgown, I slip her out of it. I glance at her for a moment, her flush skin brushing against mine. As we embraced each other...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wake, too warm because of the sunlight hitting my face. Everything happen last night still feel like a dream. I peek up at the beautiful woman beside me but as I open my eyes she was nowhere to be found. I blink twice trying to adjust my eyesight. I hurriedly slip into my clothes and tried looking for her, hoping she was just close by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I groan in frustration, I shifted to my wolf and went to the place where she might run to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I jump off to her balcony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was right, she was here, she flinched once she noticed my presence. She was now wearing a different dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked like she was actually waiting for me to show up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Why did you left without waking me up?&amp;quot; I stepped closer to her but she stopped me like she was disgusted at what just happened between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Forget what happened, because this will be the last.&amp;quot; She mutters, with her voice expressionless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood as I watch all my hope crumbled into pieces...</p>
