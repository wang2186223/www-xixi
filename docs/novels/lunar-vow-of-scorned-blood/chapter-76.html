                <p>&#34;Are we going to go after him?&#34; One of them mumbled. They sounded frightened and I couldn&#39;t blame them. After seeing those rogues, something about them is weird.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You and the others stay here. Make sure to remember the way to get out of here in case something happened ang get help. And you on the other side with the others follow me.&#34; They all nodded their heads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haft of us went to follow Ryan, I shifted to my Wolf and the others follow. I don&#39;t know why but our vision isn&#39;t that clear around this area. So we need to sharpen our ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are they?&#34; Someone mumbled, I told them to shut up and focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait I heard something.&#34; Someone said. As he said that the sound of cracking bones echoes. Followed by the screaming sound of Ryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Over there!&#34; We all run towards where the sound is coming from. And there he was being eaten by those Rogues? But now that I look at it properly it don&#39;t look like the Rogues we encountered before. In fact, the rogues that attack us earlier was already laying on the ground dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was not the rogues we&#39;ve seen before. What is that thing?&#34; The creature that somehow looks like wolf turn its attention to us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It have the head like a werewolf, but instead of standing with its own two feet. Like a human being, red eyes stared at us as they start to drool in their saliva.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get ready.&#34; I uttered, it was the only one remaining but it still feels more dangerous, like our number is still no match to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We just watch it with surprised look. And when it finally notice our presence it turns its head towards our direction. And before we could even react, one of us was already being split into half by it. My eyes grow wide because of it. I didn&#39;t even see it move, it was too fast. And when I say fast, that in a blink of an eyes 3 of my pack was already dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Warn the others, we need some backups.&#34; We used our mind link to tell the one who are waiting outside but no one is responding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Focus in front of you, defend each othe-.&#34; I uttered, but before I could finish my sentence it was rushing towards me to attack. I was just in time to dodge it. It&#39;s claws left a hole on the ground where I&#39;m standing earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Growling at me, it looks pissed then in a blink of an eyes I was flying in the air. Before I could even know what is going on I hit the large tree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My vision was vivid, all I could hear is the dying sounds of my pack. Is this really the extent of my power? I tried to stand but my ribs was badly injured because of the hit, I think I broke at least 5 ribs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My wolf was having a hard time to keep our balance but we have to help them. I jump at the back of it, and bite the back of its neck. Their size is a bit similar to ours but a bit bigger than my wolf. It started to try to grab me with it&#39;s claws, scratching me but my wolf bit it harder. It let outs a grunting sounds before it was finally able to pull me out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grunt when I hit the ground, feeling my ribs cracking. The sound of my pack mates was starting to lessen, meaning most of them died already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before that I need to handle what is in front of me. It doesn&#39;t look happy for what I did to its neck. I can still taste the blood of it in my mouth. And it wasn&#39;t a good taste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Its red eyes were glowing, and I know I wouldn&#39;t be able to dodge its next attack but I could do something to block it and hope that it won&#39;t tear me apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My wolf was watching it move slowly towards me, showing its claws I know he will aim for my chest. I don&#39;t know why I suddenly feel that way but I&#39;m when it notice my reaction it suddenly stops.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know why but it step back and started running away. I have no idea what just happened but I felt a sudden relief that it was finally decided to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I know deep inside me that this is now going to be our last encounter with that creature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My wolf was to weak to keep our form and I landed on the ground back to my human form. I turn my head to the side, no one in my pack members survived. The fight didn&#39;t even take that long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I suddenly felt a sting in my upper abdomen. I need to get out of here. I stumbled for like 2 times before I was able to get myself up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding my upper abdomen, when I returned to the place where we left the others, I was left with nothing dead bodies. All of them are dead, they&#39;re corpses had this marks in them, this time I was sure it was the rogues doings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I woke up, I was in the clinic. Sarah was sleeping next to my bed. I sat down slowly, supporting my right upper abdomen. It looks like they came looking for us after we didn&#39;t return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah woke up and blink a few times before smiling at me. I stroke her red hair, it was longer now but not as long as her hair. I froze, what did I just say?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong? Do you still feel anything? Does it hurt anywhere? Or should I call the docto-&#34; before she could finish her sentence. I pulled her into a kiss. She was surprised at first but then started kissing me back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanna drown myself with only about Sarah, and not about that woman. Who I&#39;m not even sure if she exist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She climbed to my lap while my hands travel to the hem of her dress. Closing my eyes as I try to inhale her autumn scent. I kissed her neck, tasting and nibbling on it. Trying to find that familiarity, the feeling of being hers. But I still feel nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t stop...&#34; She gasp, finding herself having a hard time to breath. I didn&#39;t even notice that I stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone might come.&#34; I whispered, hiding my guilt for suddenly feeling this way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looks disappointed at my action, she climbed off my lap and fixed her dress. She cannot hide her anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you doing this?! Since you wake up you never even dare to go further than kissing me! We&#39;ve done way further than that before Dwayne!&#34; She burst out. I couldn&#39;t even look at her properly, the look of hurt in her eyes was making me feel even worst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you know what forget it! I don&#39;t wanna force you anyway!&#34; And with that she started storming away. Closing the door in the clinic loudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is wrong with you Dwayne?&#34; I brush my hair out of frustration. Then grabbed my clothes that Sarah probably brought to me. Which made me feel more guilty that I acted like this to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I was about to step out the Doctor arrived. This time it was one of the Doctors I saw in the facility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will just check something.&#34; I didn&#39;t say anything and took off my shirt again. She wanted to see the claw marks and my other bruises.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like they heal faster than expected.&#34; She muttered, giving me a mirror to see them for myself. And just like she said it was healing faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m sure I was still feeling them earlier but right now, the dark patches was fading. And my ribs that I could almost see it&#39;s marking was now gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, now we are done.&#34; She scrabble something in her board and then walk out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know that we have another facility in the territory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I walk out, the pack members was gathered around. You can hear they cries from hearing the news about their families deaths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hunter was there comforting each families and my father watches from a far. I still haven&#39;t talk to him about the creature that we encountered in the Dark forest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You finally woke up.&#34; He mumbled as soon as he saw me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I healed faster than expected.&#34; I answered as we stare at the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Other pack decided to return back to their territories by tomorrow.&#34; That wasn&#39;t a news to me anymore. After what happened lately I&#39;m sure they also need to check their pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see, but Dad I have to tell you something about what happened yesterday.&#34; He didn&#39;t seem surprised at my words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was just about to ask you about it. Let&#39;s talk in the office.&#34; I nodded my head and followed him inside the office. He close the door as soon as I entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what is it that you wanted to tell me?&#34; He sat down to his chair and I took the seat across him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know if you will believe me what we encountered in that place was not a regular werewolf.&#34; He remained silent the whole time I retell what I just witnessed. I tried my best to describe that beast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t look surprised at what I just said, he stood up and grabbed something from the bookshelves. It was the first time I saw it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wasn&#39;t sure but perhaps this will tell us what you just saw.&#34; The book was full of mythical creatures that you will just hear inside legends stories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He started flipping the book and I stood their silently. He stops at the page where the exact beast that I saw was drawn from it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lycans.&#34; I read the words written above it, there are still something written on it but I couldn&#39;t read it because there were like old writings that I&#39;m not sure what language did they used to write it. It was like the writer doesn&#39;t want someone to know what was written in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My father didn&#39;t say anything and just stared at the picture. Like he was actually lost on his own thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought those are already gone?&#34; I muttered, he sat down on his seat feeling dumbfounded about our discovery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I also thought that but looks like we are wrong.&#34; He mumbled, we both became silent after that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep this between us for now. &#34; He suddenly said, I don&#39;t know why he wanted to keep the information about it but I agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I also don&#39;t want to cause another chaos towards our pack. When I opened the door Hunter was just about to get inside. Did he hear anything?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh Dwayne! I was glad to see that you are okay.&#34; It looks like he didn&#39;t hear anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was even surprised myself.&#34; I mumbled, he just laugh at my words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well you are stronger than that, you just need to see your full potential.&#34; He mumbled then tapping my shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is your father inside? I need to talk to him about something.&#34; He stop for a minute then thought about something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;On the other hand you should join us.&#34; Before I could even say anything he already pulled me inside. My father was shocked to see Hunter with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What brought you two hear?&#34; My father ask, he sounded uncomfortable at the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well Dwayne was about to get out but then I decided that he should join us. Because sooner he will start to take over again.&#34; My father wanted to say something but decided not to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We sat to the chair while Hunter remained standing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since the faction was about to get back to their own territories with the other Elders.&#34; He nodded at my father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because it looks like the rogues are on the move. The night after the time where the Rogues were seen roaming around the territory. The West was attacked by Rogues, their main office and laboratories was completely destroyed but nothing was taken.&#34; I glance at my father and he ignored me. How could he not tell me about this matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then yesterday when you are attacked by Rogues. The East was attacked also. It was like they used all the time they had to attack the other territories while their Alphas are away.&#34; He stops. Marking the land area where the attacks are made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The south received some previous attack but we all decided that it was better to keep an eyes on their territories so that if the Rogues decided to return then their Alphas would be ready for them.&#34; He stops then glances at the book on the top of the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My father and I both look at each other. It was the book that we used earlier. I swear it feels like the time slowly ticking as we watch him made his way towards the table but to our surprised he ignored it and grabe a piece of marker that is above the book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So as I was saying, we caught one of the rogues last time they where seen roaming around, and we tried to force him to say their location but he keep refusing and when we are finally about to make him talk. He pointed out this! Yet we are still unsure it was the right location or not because as you can see.&#34; He was talking about the markings along side the Dark forest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is where it was pointing out. But based on the map nothing is here, and some of our pack members tried to scout the area but they only came back with nothing. So this is where you will be coming.&#34; My father stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, he will not go there.&#34; My father object. But his words are useless with Hunter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t do anything about it Ben, you are aware of how important this matter is.&#34; I don&#39;t know why but I suddenly feel like he was talking about another matter other than this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My father let out a sigh and took his seat back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, as I was saying Dwayne you will lead them this time. Because unlike the other you are much better than them and no one is as perfect as you are on tracking them down.&#34; He uttered then smiled. I didn&#39;t say anything and just nodded my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I need to find out more about that creature and also I need to find those traitors. Is what they were saying is true then that place is where they were hiding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I went back in my room Sarah was nowhere to be found. It looks like she was still mad at me and I couldn&#39;t blame her for it. I was deciding if I should go find her or let her be for a while to sort my thoughts out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if I stayed here I know I will just end up seeing things again. So I decided to dragged myself out and went to the only place where she could be right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk further to the forest and stop to where Sarah&#39;s father was buried and to my surprise she wasn&#39;t there alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was with the guy that I saw before. And now that I can see him properly it was Alec, one of our pack members who are done training to the South. She was surprised when she notice me and came rushing towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you here?&#34; I didn&#39;t even stared at her and keep my gaze towards Alec who is now walking towards us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been a while Dwayne.&#34; He offered me his hands but I ignored it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I even almost forget your face.&#34; I muttered, he was Zion&#39;s cousin. And unlike Zion, I actually don&#39;t like him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He used to beat up Zion when we were still a kid. And I was just happened to always be there to defend Zion. Alec was a manipulator, like he can deceived anyone, showing them that he was a great kid to put the blame of Zion. Ever since then I didn&#39;t like him. He tried to get close to me because of the title but I ignored him and always go for Zion&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seems like it, because you just happened to chose the wrong beta.&#34; He bark back, I suddenly feel irritated and pulled his collar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t act so high and mighty anymore Dwayne. You aren&#39;t the Alpha anymore remember that.&#34; He added, Sarah came rushing between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop that Alec! Both of you could you please stop! Can&#39;t you give some respect towards my father!&#34; We both remained silent. I let go of his collar and he turn his attention towards Sarah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll see you around.&#34; He mumbled, giving me a slight look before walking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you with him?&#34; She glance at me with still anger in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? He happened to be around here when I walk out on you. He was my friend during my time in the South.&#34; That explains why they both look familiar with each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then her eyes brighten up, like some idea crossed her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you jealous?&#34; She mumbled, jealous? Is that even what I was feeling when I saw them? Because when I saw them together my mind was just around the time where Alec made Zion suffer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she didn&#39;t hear my answer, she pulled me and gave me a kissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know I have my eyes only to you.&#34; She uttered, I didn&#39;t hear her other words anymore but somehow it feel like this happened before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the wind blows carrying the scent of Vanilla.</p>
