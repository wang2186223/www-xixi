                <p>Klaire&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forget about the long lace dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turn on my side, and hug my pillow, filled with an overwhelming sadness. The image of seeing Dwayne tomorrow is too much for me. I can feel my tears wanting to crawl down my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t help but wonder if did Dwayne missed me? Probably not like I&#39;ve missed him. I was the one who push him away this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My thoughts plague me into the early hours until eventually, I fall into a fitful, exhausted sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the large mirror on the wall, I take a long, hard look at my face. I am my usual pale self, except for the dark circles around my too-large eyes. I look gaunt, haunted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dwayne&#39;s tortured expression haunts me. I always hear his voice in my head. In my mind, I visualize Dwayne&#39;s face, the last time I saw him as I left him with nothing but those painful words for him to forget me and everything that happened between us. I choke at that thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why would I stay when things had reached such an impasse? When in the first place there is nothing for us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shake my head. I have an evening to get through first. How am I going to do this? Unsure about it myself. Sighing... I hurry out of the restroom to make last-minute adjustments. Grabbing my white long lace gown, I slip into it. It was hugging my figure; the back is openly showing my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at myself again, I look pretty decent than I expected. I curled my long black hair and put on some light makeup to hide my dark under eyes and my pale face. Tidying my hair for the last time so that it hangs artfully down my back, I take a deep breath. This will have to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clint knock on my door, he was wearing his gray suit, no tie. His white shirt is open at the collar. His gray-blue eyes are glowing... He looks sleek as his hair is finally in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were watching my every move, he looks wary. He was worried, he doesn&#39;t want me to go. But it was my turn to do my part.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;The car is waiting downstairs.&amp;quot; He finally spoke, I open the glass box. He walks slowly to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you sure you wanna do this?&amp;quot; He asks again. I rolled my eyes at him, he was always protective of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Clint, we already talk about this,&amp;quot; I mutter avoiding his gaze, I wouldn&#39;t want him to see my painful expression. Just thinking about seeing Dwayne with that girl... The thought is so painful that I dismiss it immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;But Klaire, I can&#39;t just watch you break yourself again.&amp;quot; His gaze was steady at me. Some unknown emotion flits across his face, making me smile. He was really worried; I squeeze his hands to assure him. He let out a sigh and gave up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Okay, just make sure if you feel uncomfortable we will head back,&amp;quot; he mutters, his voice softer. I nodded my head at him. He won&#39;t stop nagging unless I agreed with everything he was saying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both glance at the crown inside the glass box. I haven&#39;t worn this for ages. He was the one who took it out of the box, glancing at the diamond embedded in it with its softly golden outline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crown was built by the fairy clan as it actual beams of sun and moon. For when light is ready, it realizes it is time to switch from waver to matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slowly places the crown in my head, he smiled as he stared at me. He looks like a proud father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I can&#39;t believe my little sister is already grown up.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I giggle at his sentiment. He offered me his hand and I gladly took his offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliot, Yustef, and Noah were already waiting downstairs. They all dressed up for this event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliot was on his white suit living his collar open. Noah was wearing a white inner shirt and black suit his collar is also unbuttoned. And lastly, Yustef was wearing an all-black suit, he left 3 buttons undone. What is with the undone button with these people?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An SUV is waiting for us; this is the same car we used before we came here. The packhouse is not that far from here but they insisted to use the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turn and climb into the back, Clint sat next to me, and on my other side is Yustef. Noah was sitting right next to the driver who is none other than Eliot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Ready?&amp;quot; Eliot asks, keeping his eyes at me through the mirror. I inhale sharply, nodding my head. He started the engine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take my hand and gently skim my thumb across my knuckles as we sit in the back of the car heading to the packhouse. I am beginning to feel a dull, unpleasant ache deep in my belly, caused by my nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We&#39;re here,&amp;quot; Eliot announced, making my face runs out of blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yustef notices my sudden reaction. I silently thanked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You all go ahead, I&#39;ll stay with Klaire,&amp;quot; Yustef mutters, saving me from collapsing if I step outside the car for the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clint wanted to argue but he was caught up by someone from the Pack. He was taken by them. Probably something about the succession, Noah and Eliot also did follow him inside. Leaving me and Yustef alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Idly, I wonder, how long will I be able to manage without crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You okay?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t answer, because if I do... I know my voice will crack. I just nodded my head averting his piercing gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Okay then, we will wait here until it was your time to enter.&amp;quot; Yustef said slightly annoyed about something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was glad that he didn&#39;t say anything else after that. We sat there quietly...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clint knocks on the window after a few minutes. He looked hesitant to open the door, but decided to open it at the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone was already in place, the pack members of each faction were gathered outside waiting... They probably expect some elders to do the succession but they were all wrong. Now that our so-called father is dead, it was our turn now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Let&#39;s go,&amp;quot; Clint muttered, he offers me his hand to help me get out of the car. Yustef was already outside waiting for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a deep breath, calming my nerves. I took Clint&#39;s hand and slowly step out of the car. I can already hear the curiosity of the ones who are outside waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You ready?&amp;quot; Clint squeeze my hand and I did the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nodding my head, I wrapped my arms around his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd became silent as soon as their eyes landed on me, their expression is priceless. They can&#39;t hide the surprise in their eyes as they stare at my crown. Yustef and Clint remain at my side as we head inside. All eyes were watching us as we enter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Alphas was waiting at the front stage with the next line of Alphas, the surprise in their eyes is evident. The scowl on the Alpha of the South Lake Pack is quite funny honestly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watch as his expression turn from surprised to embarrassed. The other also had that unbelievable glare. Rion on the other hand was smiling brightly at me. Alpha Brent and Luna Stella&#39;s look has taken me aback. They didn&#39;t expect me to be one of the Royals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes stop at Dwayne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looks glorious except he&#39;s scowling at me. he was wearing a black suit that look perfect on him. His hair is a little messy but he still looks hot... my heartbeat lurches at the sight of him. All I can see of his face, his beautiful chiseled mouth, and the way his jaw tensed as soon as he saw me. His green-blue eyes shifted to my crown, eyes widen then turn back to their blank state. A bit my cheeks trying to keep myself composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I close my eyes for a moment as dark desire wanting to unfolds throughout my body. Once I open my eyes, all my emotions were gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scan the crowd; 2 unfamiliar faces are standing next to him. They are probably the next Alphas of Golden Arid and White Moon. Their frame is similar to each other, the other one has a darker tan skin color, green eyes, and black hair. The tattoos on his neck are showing all the members of Golden Arid have a lot of tattoos on their bodies. He looks exactly like the Alpha of the Golden Arid who is now watching me closely. The one on the right has pale skin and black eyes, his red hair highlighted in the lights. He was shorter than the other 3 next in line Alphas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clint clears his throat to gain their attention, my eyes shift at him. Here goes nothing...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Let me introduce to you all Amaris Klaire Calypso, the granddaughter of King Felcio Alec Calypso. And my sister.&amp;quot;</p>
