                <p>As soon as we reach the North, I was tied down and strip off my title as Alpha. My father looks at me with disbelief. I know he couldn&#39;t believe himself after knowing me, the son he once knew who wouldn&#39;t even dare to care about someone just to keep his title. But I change, I wasn&#39;t the same Dwayne I once knew. And to be honest I don&#39;t even know if which one is the real me. After knowing I was Aiden and now this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything that is happening lately is full of non stop question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah run towards me as soon as she saw me. She look worried yet mad at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could you do this to us?&#34; Her words means nothing to me anymore. The look of hurt in her eyes doesn&#39;t even affect me. Not even the slight guilt of everything I&#39;ve done and took to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s enough Sarah, get inside.&#34; My father pulled her away from me. I was looking for my mother but she was nowhere to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course the whole pack knew about what happened, they all gathered outside waiting for my arrival as soon as they heard the news. I can hear they&#39;re disgust from where I&#39;m standing. My wolf was quiet the whole time. I was starting to get worried because I couldn&#39;t feel him. And I couldn&#39;t blame him for being like this. This all happened because of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance at the only person who person who put me into this place. He was staring back at me. Blue-green eyes looks at me with nothing but emptiness. I couldn&#39;t even read his emotion. Hunter took a step forward and now that I notice the other Elders just also gathered around in front just like before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well you all know why we are gathered here today, as you are all aware of the Alpha of the Crescent moon pack, my own flesh and blood turned his back on us and betrayed us.&#34; He stop for a minute to look at my direction. His words means nothing to me now, I couldn&#39;t believe myself that I once wanted to succeed his position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are all really sad and disappointed about this news especially after the Alpha of the South Lake betrayed us and sided to the Rogues. And right now this happened. We caught him trying to help a missing prisoner who help Rion to his schemes escape with his underlings. They all attacked us and escape except for him.&#34; I couldn&#39;t help but smirk knowing that Zion was and the others are probably got away from here. That howling I heard was from Zion, it was something that we both do whenever we want to send a message to each other. Even though werewolves usually does it to locate each other, ours have a different from the normal one. It was something that only us knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you know, we don&#39;t want to end this evening with only negative news. As you can see the other Elders made a secret attack towards the Central Kingdom. Because according to our investigation, they are connected to the Rogues and we wouldn&#39;t want another betrayal to happened to us. So we made a step to destroy them all. And as a result we achieve our long awaited victory. The former respected Central Kingdom is now nothing but dust to us.&#34; The crowd started cheering. I remember Cameron&#39;s words, I clench my fist, gritting my teeth as I glared at all of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lindon was standing next to the Elders and what surprised me is the one standing next to him is the familiar face that I would never forget. He was wearing a cape that&#39;s why I couldn&#39;t see his face earlier but right now I could see it clearly, he was staring back at me with a smile in his face and right next to him is my mother who looks at me without any emotion written in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And before I ended everything, I would like to introduce to you all the important key who made all of this available. None other than the King himself. King Belerick.&#34; The crowd gasp with disbelief upon seeing him. He was only written in the Legend before. But I know who that was, he wasn&#39;t the real King, to be exact he was none other than Belerick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled his cape down, I didn&#39;t notice this earlier but his hair was different, it has the same strands as Klaire. Silver white flocks that looks like the light coming from the moonlight. How did that happened? His eyes weren&#39;t gray anymore but red, rubies eyes that looks exactly like the color of blood. He died at the facility right? Just what happened when I lost consciousness?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know most of you know me from just being in the books, but to tell you the real story. I was once the Beta of my brother, who is the Alpha. But he was also blinded by his mate and forget everything. I have no other choice but to took my hands on that matter and make sure the pack will continue to flourish with the help of the Elders, should I say the former Elders we were able to take the pack. But this result for the death of my own brother and his mate.&#34; He mumbled, he didn&#39;t seems to care about what the reaction of the crowd and continue his tale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I killed my own brother for the benefit of the pack, because that is what a real Alpha should do for its pack. No matter what the consequences is.&#34; The crowd started cheering and agreeing from all his words. Then turn his head towards my direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which your Alpha failed to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the gathering and my verdict, I was taken to the dungeon where Rion was waiting for me with a smile on his face, like he was expecting this to happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew I will see you sooner, but I didn&#39;t expect to be in this kind of situation.&#34; He laugh to himself and I ignored him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was tied both my hands and feet, with my collar around my neck, just like Rion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You knew he will betray you.&#34; He laugh again and stared at me like I was some kind of idiot who will fall for his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew Lindon wanted power more than anything. And I have to do that because words won&#39;t make you believe about everything, but once you saw it with your own eyes then you might know from the start that I was telling the truth.&#34; I know his words was somehow true. But to be honest I really did believe him even without our encounter with Hunter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So tell me Alpha, oops. I mean Dwayne. What is your connection with Devon and the Rogues?&#34; His words was full of speculation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need to answer your question.&#34; I muttered, ignoring him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew you were something else when I first met you. You have the same feeling like Devon and Dither when I first saw them at first I ignored it but then something doesn&#39;t make sense around you all. Then I met the Royalties, which made me more suspicious. And after that night where I witness her power I was more excited. I never felt the same feeling before. After that day I couldn&#39;t stop the feeling that I was alive again. So I did what I was told and took her because I also want that power in my hands.&#34; His eyes was full of anticipation, like he was under the influence of ecstasy. He looks more like delusional to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you kill her?&#34; His smile fade and turned into anger. His eyes automatically shift into a hard glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could you mention her!&#34; I don&#39;t know why did I mention her. Maybe because I don&#39;t like hearing him mention her. He was partly the reason why everything started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know what you are talking about!&#34; His eyes shifted again into a confused look. He sounded so sure early and now I don&#39;t know how to describe him. He looks broken?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Devon saw you.&#34; I mumbled, by mentioning her name he became agitated. He mentioned her before but he didn&#39;t react this way. I wonder what else are you hiding Rion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That bitch was the reason for all of this! If only I didn&#39;t listen to her!&#34; I don&#39;t know if he was talking to me or to himself? He was out of his mind that is what I&#39;m sure of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You killed her.&#34; He froze upon my words and with that he kneeled down, not minding the shift in his bones. We are tied to a position where we weren&#39;t abled to move around except to stand if we tried to sit or anything it will lead to bones breaking. They used a silver material to our chains to make sure that it will burnt our skin and it will lessen the healing process.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t want to, I-I have no choice. She was a low rank and knowing the Elders they wouldn&#39;t accept her. And I couldn&#39;t accept her even if she was beautiful... Not even if she had that porcelain skin.&#34; He started muttering while in tears. I couldn&#39;t even look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looks so pitiful.</p>
