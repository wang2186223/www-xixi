                <p>When we get back to the main house, the whole pack is in chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What happened?&amp;quot; I ask the first man that I bumped into.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Rogues attack again, some of the members of South Lake Pack are still missing.&amp;quot; I didn&#39;t have the chance to ask another question when my Father also went rushing out of the door with that bastard royalty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Good thing your here, go and check the surroundings make sure no rogues is nearby.&amp;quot; He didn&#39;t give me a chance to say anything. They quickly made their way to the forest leading to the South Lake Mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zion was now here beside me getting ready to take off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You coming?&amp;quot; Zion ask. He took off his shirt. Sarah went inside the house as soon as we got here. She was sulking I know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Tell me the details as we go.&amp;quot; I said, he nodded his head and we both shifted to our wolf. His wolf has a shade of brown and gray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We headed to the forest through the border.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;The rogues attack again, and no traces found between the border.&amp;quot; He minds link.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;There are seven members of the South Lake who are missing after the attack. Three of them was badly injured.&amp;quot; He added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stop as we reach the border. The pack members guarding the border went to greet us. We both shifted back to our human form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What happened here?&amp;quot; One of the member step forward. I remember him Derek, he was one of the leader of the Guards guarding the borderline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Sir, we found no suspicious activity in the border.&amp;quot; He mutters, showing his confusion on the sudden attack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;How about in the other borderline?&amp;quot; I step outside the border, checking for wolf paws or anything that can give us any clue that the Rogues was here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes shifted to the dark forest, I felt like someone is staring at me. But no one is around. I can&#39;t even feel a slight presence over there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You okay?&amp;quot; Zion ask who is now also outside. His eyes darted to the direction where I was staring earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What are you looking at? Did you find something?&amp;quot; He asks. Still staring at the dark forest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Nothing, not even a little traces of rogues.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both went inside. Derek contacted the other person in charge of the next border saying there are also no activity in there. I even talk to Glen who is now checking that premises.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like me, he found nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How did they got inside without letting us know again? Did they used another passage? But where? Also last time one of the rogues said they are here for her, then why would they attack the members of the South Lake Pack? Unless she was there</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Don&#39;t tell me she was actually there? I shifted back to my wolf. Not liking the idea popping in my head. Zion follow from my behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What was that? Where are you going?&amp;quot; He asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned right, running back to part of the territory where the South Lake Packs resided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m going to check something. Go to the last border, I&#39;ll meet you at the main house later.&amp;quot; I didn&#39;t wait for his answer and run faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My paws dig deeper down the wet soil as I ran the wind brushing my fur. I went back to where the fainting scent of her earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The metallic smell off blood caught my nostrils. I stop my track when I found some traces of blood. I growl as my realization; I can&#39;t be wrong this scent actually belongs to her. It was a faint scent but I&#39;m sure it was her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I move a little further because of the scent of blood, just around the far end where I was a massacre of blood is all over the place. This is the place where the attacks happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed the traces trying to keep myself from thinking any negative thoughts. This part of the woods was near the South lake and the East Mansion</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And this blood traces are coming to direction of the east mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Don&#39;t let him get her.&amp;quot; And there the thing that the Lady said back then pop out of my head. The idea of her missing again is making me anxious. I wouldn&#39;t let that happen! I won&#39;t just stand and watch her got out of my grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The traces stop near the east mansion. I hurriedly went inside to find her but there are no traces of her around. She was nowhere to be found. I went to her room but nothing is there. I went downstairs checking each room. A slight scent of her saying she was here not so long ago. I followed the traces of her scent but a huge wall welcomed me. It was a dead end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something is off, I tried to look for anything that may lead to opening a secret door or something. Back then I really don&#39;t come around here because it was dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slight click and there the wall opened showing a dark staircase. This reminded me of the staircase down to the dungeon where that little girl is. I followed the staircase down to the dungeon. It was really a dungeon, but why is it hidden? There are six large cells, you can smell the metallic scent or rust and blood?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I step closer to the third cell where the metallic scent of blood is getting strong. Traces of blood is still within the chains. Indicating that someone just died here, and the blood splash on the walls saying it was not an easy death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There is only one thing that I could think off. Rogues why would they hide the fact that they caught some rogues? Its either they don&#39;t trust us or something bigger is happening here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went outside again trying to think where could she be. Right now finding her is what really matters. I know those blood don&#39;t belong to her but still</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I close my eyes, ears twitching. Trying to use all my senses to locate where she was right now. I open my eyes and gaze back at the direction where I felt a little tingling feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My paws stop right in front of the South Lake Mansion. I grab some clothes that are scattered around and slip on them. The sound of footsteps as well as voices reach my ears. I went inside in a hurry; I have to see her. I bump into a huge vase sitting right next to the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes stop on me as the loud crash of glass filled the air. There she was standing next to that bastard. I focus my gaze on her as I watch her eyes grew wide at my sudden appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Dwayne have you found anything?&amp;quot; Our staring game stop as my father step between us. Taking my eyes off her, I look at my father who doesn&#39;t look please by the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Nothing, no traces at all.&amp;quot; I mutter. I scan the room, Rion was standing at the corner watching us. Lindon the one I had sparring with before was badly injured. His abdomen was covered with bandage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My father went to that bastards and started talking to themselves. I didn&#39;t bother listening to what they are saying. I stood still watching her every move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was now talking to Lindon and I was using all my strength to stop myself from growling or killing that guy. I frowned as I notice Rion was also watching her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that I think about it what on earth is she doing here? I step to her direction and grab her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What are you doing?&amp;quot; She asks, trying to get out of my hold. Rion step forward between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Let her go, Dwayne.&amp;quot; He mutters, while grabbing my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Back off.&amp;quot; I warned, my eyes focus on her. She was the only thing that keeping me from killing Rion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Rion just back off, let me handle this.&amp;quot; She muttered, Rion took his hands off me and step back. Since when did they became close for her to say his name?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Follow me.&amp;quot; I whispered, she stopped for a moment, letting out a sigh she nodded her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;But first get your hands off me!&amp;quot; She shoved my hands away and started walking outside. I follow her from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes were shooting arrows at as soon as we got outside. She crossed her arms in her chest. I glanced at her. She still looked beautiful even though she was pissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t notice earlier her left knee was covered in bandage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What happened? Are you okay?&amp;quot; She glanced at her left knee knowing what I was talking about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yes, I&#39;m completely fine. So mind your own business!&amp;quot; She shouted angrily. Why is she getting mad about?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You know that this isn&#39;t just about our business right.&amp;quot; I said, that made her stiff for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a step closer to her but she raised her hand stopping me while shaking her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She somewhat looks afraid? But what is she afraid off?</p>
