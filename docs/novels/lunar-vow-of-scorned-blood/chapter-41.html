                <p>Dwayne&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole night we found nothing, not even a slight scent of her. Eliot was blaming himself the whole time. Clint was also cursing the whole time. They all look restless about something. I myself feel the frustrations of finding nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We haven&#39;t sleep even a blink after she went missing. We are now at the East Mansion at the moment, looking for clues that might lead us to her but there is no luck at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Let me try it again.&amp;quot; Eliot mumbled, taking something that belongs to Klaire&#39;s once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One thing that I discovered while being with them for more than 24 hours they all have unique abilities. Eliot has this vision where he can see what is happening or happened to a person just by holding something that belongs to her. I still have no idea how did they have that abilities or what are the abilities of the other 3.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Found anything?&amp;quot; I ask, he shake his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Still nothing.&amp;quot; He mumbled, we both let out a sigh. Just where on earth did they take her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A running Noah came to sight; he looks like he was out of breath or something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I found something.&amp;quot; We all jump up our feet and followed him outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t notice this when I came here to check the passage.&amp;quot; Started as we walk down the back of the East Mansion. Around the Cliff where the old passage was located.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What do you mean?&amp;quot; Clint ask, he seems like he was not himself since earlier. He was so emerging in his thoughts that we can&#39;t talk to him properly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;There was another passage, but this time it was underground. I wouldn&#39;t be able to see it myself if I didn&#39;t smell her blood.&amp;quot; I stop on my track upon hearing those words and I wasn&#39;t alone. Clint, Yustef and Eliot also stop moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah notice that we aren&#39;t following him from behind and turned around to face us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Those are only drops of blood, and knowing her she did that on purpose so we could find her.&amp;quot; Noah added, the lumps in my throat seem to pass by and we continue our walk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You should have said that earlier.&amp;quot; Yustef mumbled feeling the slight irritation I was feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I didn&#39;t know you would interpret it like that.&amp;quot; Noah answered then entered the passage. This is like the second time I went here. It was still the same, you can hear the waves hitting the walls. The smell of the sea welcomes my nostrils.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;This way.&amp;quot; Noah instructed, we follow him from behind the passage was tight, only 2 persons can walk at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We smell the fainting scent of blood, we are now at the lower level of the passage and a few steps away from us was the exit towards the coast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Here it is.&amp;quot; Noah said, then trying to find something within the walls. &amp;quot;Found it&amp;quot; he announces then we heard the stones started to slide open. Another staircase, Noah entered and we followed from behind. It was just a short walk but it was dark and cold only the drops of water can be heard as well as the fainting sounds of waves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a cell right at the end of the staircase, it was just a small one but you can see the traces that someone was just here. And her vanilla scent was all over the place. I walk to the direction where her scent was stronger and found a couple of chains. I grab one of them then something flashes in my mind. It was an old memory?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The place was blurry, and I was underwater? Or not? There was light in front of me and people wearing lab gowns. I can hear the fainting sounds of machine beeping around me. I was trying to focus my eyesight but it was still blurry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Dwayne? Are you okay?&amp;quot; I flinch and turn to face Noah who look a bit concerned at my reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What happened?&amp;quot; I ask, confused about what I just saw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We have no idea; you suddenly stop moving after holding those chains.&amp;quot; Noah explained. I let go of the chains and face them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Maybe I could use this.&amp;quot; Eliot said, I step aside and let him handle the chains. He closes his eyes again then when he opened them, his eyes where glowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know why but I can feel someone staring at me and when I turn around to face who it was, it was Clint. His eyes were blank like something was in his mind at the moment. And when he notices me staring he turns to look at Eliot. What was that? I shake my head and focus my attention at thinking about what I just saw earlier. I have no idea where that place is but something seems familiar with it. Like I really have been there. A felt a slight headache, I hold the wall on my side to support myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I found it.&amp;quot; Eliot announced, my headache suddenly disappeared and I straightened my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;She was at the old laboratory.&amp;quot; He said directing it at Clint who clenching his fist at the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;But we did check that place before heading to the Crescent Moon Pack and we found nothing. The place is a messed just like how we left it.&amp;quot; Noah said. I frowned a bit confused about their topic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yes, I know that but I will never forget that place Noah. &amp;quot; Eliot mutters his eyes was saying he wasn&#39;t joking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all look mad about something; sudden Clint&#39;s attention turns to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You need to know everything. I don&#39;t wanna do this but you have to know everything&amp;quot; I was a little bit surprised about what he said. The seriousness in his voice was giving me goosebumps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you sure Clint?&amp;quot; The new arrival Yustef said. He was left outside earlier to double check the area while the rest of us was in the underground dungeon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yes, because whether we acknowledge it or not he was also part of this.&amp;quot; Clint answered not living my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three others remain silent; Clint walk to my direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We already know who you are after we saw your face.&amp;quot; Clint utter, he averted his eyes for a moment letting out a sharp breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What do you mean?&amp;quot; I ask confused. He looks back at me then his eyes started glowing following a sharp pain in my head. I groan in pain as image started flashing in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Vision***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was back again in the dungeon same dungeon where I saw the little girl, but this time I wasn&#39;t alone. There were 4 other children with me. I glance at them both their hands and feet were chains. Then the familiar sounds of chains coming from me, I glance down at my hands and they were tiny. Just like the other 4 children I was also tied down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another sound of chains came from the other corner. I tried to adjust my eyes to the dark but it didn&#39;t work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Hello? Is anyone there?&amp;quot; I shouted, then another jingling from the chains. Someone is there, the followed by a small female&#39;s voice. It was a little girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Y-yes, who are you?&amp;quot; She asked, her voice sounded weak at the moment. I can&#39;t see where she was because it was too dark at the other corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was about to say my name but another name came out of my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;My name is Aiden.&amp;quot; What? I tried to correct it but my body moves on its own. Like it has its own mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What is your name?&amp;quot; I ask in my child&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Uh... Amara.&amp;quot; She whispered, Amara? Suddenly it sounded familiar in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Can you both shut up!&amp;quot; I turned to face at the now awake child, he looks like the small version of Clint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Who are you?&amp;quot; I suddenly ask, he look annoyed at my question but answered anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Afreo.&amp;quot; He said then turn his back on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Where are we?&amp;quot; I ask, he look hesitant for a moment then answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What I heard from the guards earlier they called us subjects, and for your question. I also have no idea where we are. I was here for about a month now before you arrived.&amp;quot; He mumbled sounded a bit bored. The other 3 started to wake up also.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The look in their eyes was not the look that you will get from children around their age. Based on what I see they are around 7-10 years old. They look thin and weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m Aris.&amp;quot; One of them said, he sounded friendlier than the other 3. He looked exactly like the young Eliot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Over here is Mulac and that over there is Calixto.&amp;quot; He was pointing at the young version of Noah and Yustef.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of what they are talking about earlier came to me. What is happening?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard a fainting sound of keys jingling followed by the door opening. A man entered the dungeon, he was taller than my child self. He looks firm and was covered with scars all over his neck down to his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It&#39;s time.&amp;quot;</p>
