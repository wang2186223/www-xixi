                <p>Klaire&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watch as the buildings started to become trees as we started to get further away from the city. We now took the dirt road taking us further to the forest. I looked at Clint who was driving. He gave me a small encouraging smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you ready little sis?&amp;quot; I just nodded my head and smiled back at him. It&#39;s been a month since I last saw him. The pain is still there but I can bear with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you sure you wanted to come with me in the pack? You can just stay in the mansion.&amp;quot; He said, I squeeze his hand to assure him I&#39;ll be fine. And besides, we need to do this because I am part of this and whether I like it or not I am partly the reason why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;ll be okay Clint.&amp;quot; I smiled at him while he returned it with a sigh but nod in the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked outside the window, the marking of the Crescent Moon Pack is written in bold red and black font with the red moon in the center, and from the center, a sword is lying. As we got closer to the border of the territory more warriors are guarding it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few warriors are waiting for us at the border probably already expecting our arrival. They are the usual pack warrior, but since this is one of the four major factions of packing their warriors look more intimidating with their bulky build and their towering height making me look small.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clint got out first on the car they automatically lowered their head as they saw Clint out of the car. Now that I think maybe I should have taken Clint&#39;s offer on waiting on him in the Mansion. But there is no turning back. I held the grip of the door and swung it open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some of the near warriors stop what they&#39;re doing as they realize that I am different from them and what is more shocking is I&#39;m with Clint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;A human?&amp;quot; I heard one of them whisper to another warrior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Good thing I&#39;m wearing a hoodie, so they won&#39;t see my face. I know werewolves co-exist with humans and was known by few but they still hated our guts. Clint cleared his throat to get their attention. I could feel his irritation with them. His power was radiating around him making the air tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Got a problem? &amp;quot; He narrowed his brow and I bite my lips to keep myself from giggling. He was trying to look intimidating which affect the pack warriors to even lower their heads. Clint is the most patient among us but once he snaps, you better ran away from him if you can.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;N-nothing your highness.&amp;quot; They are all utter. We walk into the pack with the warriors leading the way. I can see that this pack is a huge one in the scope of the territory comprises half of the North.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The four factions, the North, South, West, and East are ruled by the four strongest packs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Crescent Moon of the North is known for its strength, mastery, and speed. They are rulers. All the ancestor&#39;s leaders of the three other factions came from them. No one dares to mess with them as they know for being barbaric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>South Lake Pack of the South is known for its weapons and craftsmanship. They stand in battles with the North for ages and their weapons can destroy anything that comes their way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The white moon of the West is known for its medicines and poison. They are the weakest in terms of physical strength but they are not someone to be a mess with. They live harmoniously with the human territory; you can say that they are the calmest pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Golden arid of the East known for their kin eyesight and art battle. The desert is their habitat which resulted in their unique area of battle. Once you cross their territories there is no going back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only faction that does not follow them is the Central Kingdom known as the Royalties. They are believed to be the descendants of the King of werewolves and are truly respected because of their unknown power. They consider above all the four factions. Clint is one of them...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Klaire, are you listening?&amp;quot; I stare at Clint who is now walking towards me, probably because I haven&#39;t moved a single step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What is it again?&amp;quot; I ask confused. He lets out a sigh. He looks worried again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you sure you wanna come with me?&amp;quot; he asked again. This is probably the 10th time that he asks me this ever since we left the car. Again I nodded my head at him and he rolled his eyes at me. Not liking my answer at all he walks faster but not fast enough to leave me alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We are getting closer to the main house known as the packhouse, the pack members are already gathered outside of their homes to check our arrival probably, they all stand there in awe, as Clint just stand there without even trying... already caught their attention. You can smell the pressure in the air just by his presence alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watch as the unmated she-wolf stared at my brother with hearts in their eyes. While others started whispering about how can a weak human be here. I just rolled my eyes at hearing that word again. Shaking the memory off, I scan my surroundings, at first glance, it looks like a normal town of humans, children running around and playing, wives folding laundry, and doing housework while their husband is busy with work. But it is far from reality. These are all werewolves capable of snapping your head into two without a sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Your Highness welcomes to my pack I am Brent Carter the Alpha.&amp;quot; I look at the 560 yrs. Old wolf who looks like a 40 yrs. Old wolfs. He has brown blonde hair and blue eyes. He was gorgeous for his age.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It was a pleasure to be here Alpha Brent.&amp;quot; My brother said politely even though I know he&#39;s looking for something or someone may I say. I look around for a moment. My heart is hammering inside my chest. I inhale sharply trying to calm myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Just Brent is fine.&amp;quot; He smiled and then a beautiful woman came beside him. He had blonde hair with green eyes. She looks like a great and nice Luna. &amp;quot;And this my wife, my Luna, and my Mate Stella.&amp;quot; He said proudly. I found it adorable. I just hope the same thing happened to me... I shook the memory away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It is a pleasure to meet you. Luna Stella,&amp;quot; Clint said. He gave them his million-dollar smile which made the unmated she-wolf lose it. I just rolled my eyes at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Stella is fine. Your highness,&amp;quot; Stella says while smiling, she&#39;s so beautiful whenever she smiles. She looks at me and smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;And who is this young lady over here.&amp;quot; She took a step in my direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m Klaire,&amp;quot; I answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;She&#39;s with me&amp;quot; Clint added this seems to confuse the Luna but she was kind enough to not ask how did that happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just smiled not wanting to let them pry further about the details of how why I ended up coming with him. And Clint was already showing that he won&#39;t entertain any question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I see, please let us go inside,&amp;quot; she mutters but stops on her track when we heard a loud growl coming from inside the Packhouse?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;LET ME GO ZION! SHE&#39;S HERE!&amp;quot; The door burst open and I stop breathing as he stands there staring at me with his blue-green eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My whole body stiffens as I let myself take in everything that is happening, and there he is again making my whole world stop. Inhaling his mint winter scent. How can he just suddenly swift me off my feet by just being a few steps away from me? His gaze made me shiver down my spine, making my whole body feel alive just by his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried to get closer to me but his friend caught him and Clint won&#39;t make that easy. Clint moves in front of me as everything registers in his head. He held me in his arms trying to block my view away from him. This stops me from running in his direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you okay?&amp;quot; I look away from our staring game. Focusing my attention on Clint who is now on the verge of killing someone. I nodded my head but a loud voice boomed in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;DWAYNE STOP RIGHT THERE!&amp;quot; it was the Alpha. My eyes grew wide as I realize why he reacted that way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was marching towards us. His are all black which means his wolf is out of control. He snaps out. Once he calms down his eyes soon return to their original color, a color that I once longed for to stare at me with love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just stood there and stared at me with pain and longing evident in his eyes. I gaze back at him but do not return his affectionate stare. I stare at him coldly and with no evidence of emotion can be seen.</p>
