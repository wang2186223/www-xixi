                <p>Dwayne&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I step outside, I was welcomed by fifteen snarling rogues. They look larger for a normal rogue. And they seem to come here prepared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smirk formed in my lips as I let my power radiant, the pressure in the air can be smelled from across the field.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them shifted back to his human form. He has black hair and a good build body, and I&#39;m sure he wasn&#39;t just a normal rogue. This one is imitating a much more powerful wolf compared to the other fourteen rogues here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We don&#39;t wanna kill you, we just want the girl.&amp;quot; He said calmly. His eyes shifted to the upper floor where my mate&#39;s room is located.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;If you can kill me.&amp;quot; I hissed, my wolf is itching to snap them one by one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Very well then.&amp;quot; I can feel that he was dangerous. He tilts his head to the side and the other made their move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He motioned to the other 3 wolves pointing to the second floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;She was there. Gets her.&amp;quot; They made their way out. They will look for another entrance one of their head to the side door. The other jumps in the air aiming for the balcony. I caught him in the air pulling his feet with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Where do you think you are going?&amp;quot; I throw him back to that bastard. He shoved him away with a swift in his hand I heard a faint snap indicating he broke his neck. He ended up lying on the floor breathless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was a little surprised by it. He was one of them. How can he just kill him like that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What a useless thing.&amp;quot; He mutters while shaking his head his smile remains to flash in his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I never thought rogues can be this ruthless.&amp;quot; I stare at him with a discussion he just shrugged his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m just here to get her anyway.&amp;quot; Now he was getting into my nerves. Other rogues tried to attack me but I dodge them. I caught one of them and snap his neck using my bare hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Not bad.&amp;quot; He is muttering joyously. What a fuck up psycho. &amp;quot;This is gonna be fun.&amp;quot; He shifted to his wolf form. I didn&#39;t notice it earlier but he was larger compared to the rogues with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard glass breaking inside the mansion, meaning some of them got inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Shit!&amp;quot; I ran back inside but four wolves blocked my way. They really wanna die early.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let my wolf come out, the snapping of bones as I shift filled the air. My wolf growls in delight as he stares at them passed by their sudden interference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My wolf was way larger than them and he likes it, crashing this bug is nothing to him. I can even hear my wolf letting out a snorting sound. This will be fun but I have to make it quick and kill those bastards who are inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three rogues attack me at the same time but I was faster enough to dodge their attack. I bite the leg of the first wolf that was near me and throw him in the air until he landed on the wall. Another one attacks me from the side but I was furious enough to snap his head. I let out a loud growl when they all attack me at once. Lucky enough they scratched me but my wolf is out of my control as he bites, snaps, growl at the remaining rogues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They are far stronger than I thought. These wolves know how to fight. And it makes me worry knowing any minute those rogues can find her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Other rogues didn&#39;t let go of the chance and launch their attacks on me. One of the rogues was lucky enough to bite my shoulders. My wolf groan in pain and sang at him, I can taste the blood in my mouth as I bite his head off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stare at the 4 remaining wolves standing. My dark fur is now covered with blood. I have to make a quick shower after I finish them off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The largest one circled me following his direction the other also made their way to surround me. My wolf remains at center watching, waiting for them to attack. The wolf on my right tried to bite my right leg but I kick him making his wolf stumble. The other pounced on my back catching me off guard. The largest one used this chance and bit my left leg, I can hear my bone breaking as his teeth dig deeper down my flesh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shifted my weight and strike the nearest wolf to me. I bit him hard making his hold on me loosen. This time I made a quick move I got out of his grip but my legs are bleeding heavily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another crash inside the mansion this time I heard a loud growl. Shit! They found her. My wolf agitates. I charge forward and bit the first wolf that I caught. Tearing his limbs out, the metallic taste of blood stays in my mouth. I attack the next wolf and grip his arms, tearing them open. Then I made my way to his neck, I let my canine dig deeper until I heard a loud snap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made my way to the largest one who is now making his way to attack me but I caught him just in time. Gripping, tearing, ripping is all you can hear as we fight. I threw his body on the ground when I satisfy enough. I shifted back to my human form. He shifted not so long ago after me, because of the damage I had caused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk in his direction. I can smell his fear as his body started to tremble in fear. There is only one reason why he was still breathing right now and that is I need him to tell me what they want from her and how they got here without being noticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look at his blood is all over his body just like mine but most of it is not my blood my leg is the only concern. A slight irritation came to me as I remember how we are interrupted by this foolish rogue now I have another reason to rip his head off. My wolf wanted to crawl out again and want to kill him at last for disturbing us with our mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Who send you here.&amp;quot; He just laughed at me but the pain is evident in his eyes. I growl at him and stop myself from pulling his heart out of his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;D-do... Y-you really think*cough* I will t-tell you?&amp;quot; I grab his neck and tighten my grip. He was trying to fight me but it was useless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I am not here to play jokes with you. And if I were you, I will shut my mouth and tell me what you know.&amp;quot; I growl at him. His breathing became slower as he whipped in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot; M-maybe the little mate of yours can tell you who sent me.&amp;quot; And with that, he kills himself by pulling his own heart out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared at his lifeless body annoyed and confused at the same time. Why would my mate know who sent them? Well, that is not important right now. I heard another loud crash inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck! I forgot about that! I ran fast inside and found two bodies. They smell like the rogues from earlier. Blood, broken glass is all over the place. I made my way to check the bodies they are lifeless. And something about their death is a little unusual because there are no wounds at all only blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Klaire?&amp;quot; I made my way to her room and found no one. But the sweet scent of vanilla is still there. I saw a figure on the balcony I know it was her. I walk in her direction but I feel dizzy all of a sudden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slight pain causes me to lose my balance, my leg is still bleeding. I let myself fall on the floor but a soft arm held me steady. I don&#39;t need to look at the person as I smell the familiar scent of sweet vanilla. Sparks erupted in my whole system as I let her guide me to her bed. I wanna stay awake but this sleepy feeling is pulling me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Shit! It was poison.&amp;quot; She mutters, she sounded so cute. My heart flutters at the thought that she worries about me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to focus. I open my eyes and stare at her but everything is blurry. I stroke her hair. It was white? Am I seeing things? She stares at me but the sleepy feeling is too strong. I even heard her call my name before my eyelids started to feel heavy. And the next thing I know darkness consumed me with the questions running in my head.</p>
