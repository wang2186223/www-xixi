                <p>Klaire&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>About 2 hours ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I completely waked up, Clint told me that I was unconscious for a straight whole week.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stayed in my room after what happened yesterday. The dream I had kept bothering me, it felt so real to me. I even ask Clint if I said or did anything, before he woke me up but he said none and told me that he was just about to check on me when he notice that I was having a nightmare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then another matter about the factions. We need to deal with them first. I asked Clint to keep the details about my past. I don&#39;t want another chaos to happen within the faction and the Central Kingdom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We will just let them believe the part of the legend they know. And do nothing about it, we will just add the details about my birth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So Clint, Yustef, and Noah are going to handle the matters with faction, while Eliot was left behind to keep an eye on me, if those rogues plan to return and attack again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock on the door made me flinch, it was Eliot. I still feel guilty whenever our eyes meet. The image of his neck on my hands is giving me goosebumps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Klaire...&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still haven&#39;t talked to them about the details of my dreams, I can&#39;t seem to let myself tell them the detail on how I killed almost everyone in my dream and the part where I took both of their life with my own hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I don&#39;t wanna talk about it,&amp;quot; I mumbled while looking out of the window. The feeling of that dream is still fresh, plus the things that happened during the succession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You still don&#39;t remember everything, so don&#39;t blame yourself.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Here we were again, they kept telling me that everything was okay, but we all knew that what happened that night was beyond normal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all said the same thing that I didn&#39;t remember everything so I shouldn&#39;t blame myself. But who else would I blame? The whole pack was endangered because of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turn around to face him. &amp;quot;We both know it is my fault,&amp;quot; I mumbled then lower my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it was not because of me, that person I never want to meet again wouldn&#39;t be there... then I would not be able to lose control and end up hurting the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliot looks down for a second then glances back at me. His eyes are worried and sad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It was never your fault, Klaire. We failed to notice his movements and that was not your fault.&amp;quot; Eliot said trying to comfort me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I strange moment flashed into my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I will keep my promise, Amara. We will stop you no matter what happened... I&#39;m sorry,&amp;quot; Clint&#39;s uttered in his last breath before I took his heart out of his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was that...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you okay? Klaire?&amp;quot; Eliot was now supporting me; I didn&#39;t notice him getting close. I pulled away from him in a hurry while holding my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yes,&amp;quot; I answered unsurely, sudden I feel a little dizzy. He supported me and help me to sit</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Should I call Clint and the others?&amp;quot; He asked worriedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Kla-&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stop him using my hand. He sighed and took a step back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you sure?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded my head at him,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m alright, Eliot. I just feel a little dizzy but I am fine now. so no need to call them&amp;quot; I pleaded, he wanted to say something but he stop himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Please call me if you need anything. I will let you rest now.&amp;quot; He mumbled, before heading out of my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;So this is where you are.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned around to see who is the intruder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes went wide when I notice who he was. His flashy smile is still there but something about it is making me shiver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Rion...&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smile widens at hearing his name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You remembered, I&#39;m honored, Princess.&amp;quot; He uttered, I can feel the heaviness in the air. This isn&#39;t a good sign.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What are you doing here?&amp;quot; I ask, keeping my eyes on him. Watching his every move. I don&#39;t want to take my eyes off him just in case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Well, I think you know why I am here... Amara.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stiffen upon hearing that name. That name again, I glance at him confused and he just chuckles at my reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What did you just call me?&amp;quot; I asked confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He started walking around the room, my eyes were watching him with caution. He walked through the table and took the book that I was reading before. He started flipping the page then move on to the other corner of my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;How did you know that name?!&amp;quot; I ask again, this time demanding for him to answer. He stops moving around and slowly marches towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Because I know everything.&amp;quot; He mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned at his words. Know everything?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widened at his words. Don&#39;t tell me he knew about my abduction?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could react, he was already right in front of me then blew some silver power right in my face and with that, I suddenly felt my head spinning...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What I remember is that I was falling and he was walking slowly to me before everything went black.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Eli...ot&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I woke up, I didn&#39;t know how much time had passed. I was bound by some chains. The cold chains between my wrist and even in my legs. The familiar cold smell of dungeon, rusty old metals with the metallic scent of blood is mixing with the whole place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried pulling the chains but it was useless. Where the hell am I? I tried to scan the prison where I was locked in and found nothing. It was just dark, not even a tiny bit of light can be seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where on earth did Rion bring me? It was obvious right now that he was the traitor. But why? I guess I will find out later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes adjusted in the dark, just like before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So I was once again in this place. I wanted to cry but that won&#39;t help me. I can feel my fear crawling inside me, but after everything I remember. This is nothing compared to my fear of myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can hear some footsteps approaching. I wanted to pretend to sleep but I can&#39;t talk to Rion if I was pretending.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was holding a torch in his hand when he got in. Now that I see his true self, I can feel my anger boiling. He let his pack members die! He knew about the rogue attack! He didn&#39;t stop me instead he wanted me to be there so we won&#39;t suspect him!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You asshole!&amp;quot; I wanted to slap his face but the chains won&#39;t let me get near him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why is my power not working?! I tried tugging the chains again but it was useless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Don&#39;t waste your energy princess. Those chains are built to restrain you.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glare at him, he pulled a chair from the corner and sat in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I know what you wanted to ask, why do I do this, right?&amp;quot; Rion uttered amused and excited. I didn&#39;t answer him and kept glaring at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It was simply because I wanna destroy the faction. And to do that I need to be the King of werewolves.&amp;quot; He said, then started laughing like a lunatic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You are out of your mind!&amp;quot; I glared at him, I can believe that I&#39;m hearing this from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Maybe? But if I have the same powers like yours, it would be simple. Like what you did to those rogues that night. You told them to kill each other and they did it without second thoughts.&amp;quot; He muttered amused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You don&#39;t even want to be in my shoes&amp;quot; I answered, I meant every word I was telling him. He doesn&#39;t even know the dreadful part of having this kind of power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Oh please, stop with that kind of drama. You sounded like my mate, so I had no other choice but to kill her.&amp;quot; Rion mumbled like it was nothing to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt all my anger boil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;YOU CRAZY BASTARD!&amp;quot; I shouted and tried to attack him again, I can feel my flesh was getting cut because of the chains but I don&#39;t care. I wanna kill this bastard in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Calm down, princess. We don&#39;t wanna waste that precious blood of yours, don&#39;t we?&amp;quot; He pulled my hands at him to stop me from getting more hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Bastard!&amp;quot; I spit at his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rion laughed and wipe his face with a handkerchief. He used the same handkerchief to wipe the blood from my wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Don&#39;t be impatient, you will know everything soon. But right now, he needs to meet you again.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My face became pale as Rion mention him. I know too well who he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Oh! You became silent, so you know who I am talking about.&amp;quot; Rion started laughing at his own statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned at him, he was really a crazy son of a bitch!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He places his hand on my chin, pulling my head hard to make me look at him. I can see his eyes glowing with enthusiasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m also quite curious about your relationship with him. He was really obsessed with you to the point that if I touch even a single strand of your hair I will be dead.&amp;quot; Rion mumbled, tightening his grip. He let go just on time before I started bleeding or bruising.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I wouldn&#39;t want to live a marking in that pretty face of yours.&amp;quot; He said, he turned his back on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Where are you going? Get this thing off me!&amp;quot; I shouted, but he didn&#39;t even glance back and continued walking until he vanished within my sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was now again alone in this cold dark place, I wrapped my arms around myself. Hugging myself. I can&#39;t believe that I&#39;m in this situation again...</p>
