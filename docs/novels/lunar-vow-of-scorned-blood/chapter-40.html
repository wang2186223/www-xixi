                <p>Klaire&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped for air because I suddenly felt nausea at the sight. Closing my eyes to calm myself and when I open my eyes I was into another setting again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Vision ***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time I was surrounded by white walls, the memory that I saw in my dream came back to me. This was the exact place. I walked around and found the familiar entrance to the dungeon. I turn around and walk to the right corner where the room I was brought in before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped when I noticed the same capsule like in another room. I opened the door and entered, there I found the small girl unconscious. She looked exactly like me but younger. Her hair was silver white; I couldn&#39;t see the color of her eyes because they were close at the moment. I noticed some tube attached around her, there was a black liquid being transferred to her body or being injected to her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was about to check it when I heard some footsteps from behind. I don&#39;t know why but I started hiding. There were like 4 people wearing some lab coats and one of them was Via the woman I saw in my dream. Just what the fact is happening? I hold the wall besides me for support because my head was starting to hurt like crazy again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced back at the child, the 3 doctors around her started checking on her, Via was just watching them to their jobs. She was just standing and looking at the file on her hands. What are they doing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Ms. Via the blood transfusion still show no sign. Her body was rejecting it.&amp;quot; One of them said, blood? I walk to the big container where the tubes were connected and smelled a fating scent of blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to reach for the container but as I get closer I can feel my heart beating faster. My temperature was starting to rise; I can feel the shift in my body. I felt a little light headed at the moment. And my body moves on its own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was brought back to reality when I heard a loud noise from outside the room. They all run outside to check it, I also followed them and saw a group of guards fighting each other. One of them grabbed a pen and stab the other one with it. Blood splashing out of his neck. One of the Doctor was shock and started shouting. The other one who stab his colleague, took the pen out and stab his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;FUCK! GET THIS CLEAN!&amp;quot; My eyes glance at Via who looks bored at the sight like it was the normal thing that you could find happening within the premises.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What are you waiting for? MOVE!&amp;quot; one of the Doctors said and they all started to go back to what they are doing earlier. Leaving the two dead body to be pick up by some other guards around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;This is probably the fifth right?&amp;quot; One of the guards muttered then started picking the body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;No, this the sixth time. Same thing happened before you arrived here.&amp;quot; The other one whispered back. They both put the body into a huge plastic bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Just what on earth is happening in this place?&amp;quot; The other one ask, his colleague just shrugged his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We Rogues don&#39;t have the right to ask questions all we need to do is follow.&amp;quot; The other one utter then they both started moving with the bodies in their hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to recall what just I witnessed earlier and based on what I heard this isn&#39;t the first time. I remember the look in his eyes before stabbing himself. It was blank, like he wasn&#39;t himself?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked back to the room where the little girl was located, she was still unconscious. Via was staring at her with intensity in her eyes. You could tell she was thinking something but I have no idea what it is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Ms. Via? He wanted to see you.&amp;quot; I turned my head and faced the woman who called Via, just like Via she was wearing lab coat. Via nodded her head and started walking outside but before she closes the door she glances once more at the sleeping child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I also hurriedly made my way to follow them, and again it was the familiar route, she pulled her card and the door opened. The endless staircase welcomes us like in my dream. I slowly followed them from behind until we reach the top, the door opens again. Just like how I remember it in my dreams there are 4 capsules located here. I didn&#39;t notice it before but there were children inside them. Oh wait, there were additional two capsule inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just what on earth are they doing here? I tried to check the capsule and found the same tubes attach in them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;How are the subjects?&amp;quot; Via ask, while looking inside the capsule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;They are reacting to it, but no sign of success.&amp;quot; The man answered then handled her the file. I wanted to look at what is written in the file but I can&#39;t see them. It was written into unfamiliar language.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Okay, keep on observing them. We will start the next phase soon.&amp;quot; He nodded his head. She started walking into another door, the same door where he was located.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opens and just like I remember it was an office, the chair slowly turns and everything became clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can now identify the man I saw; it was Belerick. His lips automatically form a smile when he saw Via&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;How is my daughter Via?&amp;quot; His voice was full of excitement. I can almost feel my anger rising just by looking at his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Still no reaction, it was already being months since we started the blood infusion.&amp;quot; His smile fades at the news. He pulled a tobbaco in the table and light it up, he started smoking it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I heard another guards killed his colleague and himself after.&amp;quot; I can see the changes in Via&#39;s face, her face became pale and I can feel the discomfort around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yes, another one lost his control and end up killing the guard with him.&amp;quot; She answered, he smiled again this time it was too wickedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;That only means it was working.&amp;quot; He mumbled then blow the smoke in the air. He pulled the tobbaco on his lips once more inhaling the steam smoke from it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yes, I understand. But she was still unconscious.&amp;quot; A loud bang made her flinch. She was shaking as she slowly opened her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;She will wake up soon. Those deaths only indicate that she will be awaken soon.&amp;quot; He started laughing after that, I don&#39;t have any idea about what he was talking about but I can feel my hands sweating, I don&#39;t know why but ever since I came here my body is reacting on its own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;How about the other subjects?&amp;quot; He narrowed his brow and stared at her blankly. His grey eyes were cold even if he was smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;They are just plan B anyway if she awakens we could just throw them or killed them.&amp;quot; He said while shrugging his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;But those have her blood within their veins. And now that we saw some results that infusion her blood with humans is possible. They might become useful tool.&amp;quot; She started mumbling, I clench my fist at what I just heard. So, she was saying that those children are humans. And they were being used as tool subjects.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Move to the next phase then. I will decide what to do with them after they prove they are useful.&amp;quot; Via squeal then turn back to normal when she notices him staring at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yes, I will do that.&amp;quot; He told her to get out and Via followed. I glance back again at the capsule; I didn&#39;t saw their faces because something is covering it. But base on their heights and body structures they were all just around 7 to 10 years old kid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Okay now listen up!&amp;quot; They all turned their attentions at Via who is standing at the center.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We will now begin the second phase, the phase where we will test the subjects if they can successfully shift.&amp;quot; She utters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can feel the excitement in her voice as she says those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We can now see the end results of all our experiments and study. Soon new generation of werewolves will be born and this is just the start.&amp;quot; They all clapped their hand and Via nodded her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all returns on their work. A loud sound came from the capsules, followed by the opening of the covers. I stood there as they started taking the tubes out of their bodies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly step closer to their direction. Eyes full of curiosity... Slowly one of them open his eyes, my body stiffen when I notice he was staring right back at me... With his green-blue eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Vision end***</p>
