                <p>I looked around and found myself in a dark place, it was an old dungeon. I glanced at my hands and found both my tiny hands were tied up. Where am I? And why is my hands being so tiny. I looked at my feet and they were also small. Did I turn into a child?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard the sounds of footsteps and my body moves on its own, moving to the far end of the cell. I can feel my fear rising? Then following the loud laughter was three adult werewolves. The other one was holding a torch, while the other two was looking down at me. One of them is holding a key for my chains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Hey kid wake up!&amp;quot; One of them said, they move the torch closer to me to see what I&#39;m doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Oh she was already awake, good thing.&amp;quot; The one with the torch said. I heard slight thud when the other one push both of them to the side to get closer to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I almost cried when he pulled my hair up. It felt like my hair will going to be pulled out of my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Hey Rob, we wouldn&#39;t want to leave her with bruises again. You know what happened last time.&amp;quot; The one with the torch utter. He was cowering just by the thought of what he was talking about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Tsk! They wouldn&#39;t even notice! She was covered with blood anyway.&amp;quot; The one pulling my hair said. When he said that I was covered with blood that was when I notice that he was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fainting scent of blood was coming from me not in the dungeon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You know she will notice, especially him.&amp;quot; When the him reached his ears, he immediately let go of my hair. I landed on my butt because it was too sudden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared at him but their backs were already on my face. I heard the clicking sound of keys and the next thing happened the chains on my risk was undone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Carry her.&amp;quot; He ordered, the other one started walking closer to me. I took a step back, my reaction made him look annoyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Look kid, even if you try to run or stick yourself in the far corner. I can still get you.&amp;quot; He mumbled annoyed, I tried struggling by punching him in the face when he lifted me. I scratch his right eye, making him loosen his grip on me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to run but he caught my hair and pulled it harder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Look at what you&#39;ve done!&amp;quot; He mumbled then I felt my whole body trembled in pain. I clench on the floor holding my abdomen where he punches me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Now behave yourself and stop making it hard for me!&amp;quot; He ordered, I tried to stand using my weak feet but it was useless my tiny body can&#39;t handle the punch of a 6-foot adult werewolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he notices my lack of reaction he lifted me one more. I was right over his shoulders. I wanted to struggle again but I don&#39;t have any strength left in me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shut my eyes close when we reach the doorway, a blinding light welcome me. This is probably the first light that I saw since it was too dark in that cold dungeon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw some people who are wearing lab gowns, the place looks like a hospital? Or clinic. White paint was all I can see in the place. They lay me at the hospital bed when we entered a plain white room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Now stay still.&amp;quot; The other one mumbled then the other two started strapping me in the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What are you doing! Let go of me!&amp;quot; I finally found my voice, I tried to struggle again but then a woman wearing a lab gown entered the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You can all go now.&amp;quot; She said then went straight to me. The three assholes walk out of the room. Leaving me tied down in bed with this woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled at me when she notices me watching her. She was holding a file in her hand. She looks like she was in mid 30s? Red hair that matches her pale skin and hazel brown eyes. She looks pretty too be exact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;How are you feeling?&amp;quot; She started talking casually, I frowned at her familiarity in her way of speaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Who are you?&amp;quot; I asked, she looked surprised by my question but her smile never leaves her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I see, you wanna start talking now ha? That was really nice just keep doing that. And as of for your question. I will say my name again. I am Via and I am here to help you.&amp;quot; Her voice was soft and sincere. She looks warm at the moment or I still feel dizzy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Why am I here?&amp;quot; I ask, she started doing something with the file she was holding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Because I need to observe you.&amp;quot; She mumbled, she was writing something in the file.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes were scanning me; she stops for a moment then reach for something in the cabinet. She gave it to me after. I open it and found a white dress. It was a children&#39;s dress. I even forgot that I was at a body of a child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Come with me, let&#39;s get you clean up.&amp;quot; I didn&#39;t say anything and remain silent. &amp;quot;Don&#39;t try escaping, you know what happened last time right?&amp;quot; I have no idea what she was talking about but end up nodding my head. Her grin widens at my response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reaches for the straps and undone them one by one. Once both my hands and feet were free I jump of the bed by stumbled on the floor. She came closer to me and help me stand. My whole body felt weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Oh careful your wounds aren&#39;t fully healed, now come with me. Let&#39;s get you cleaned up.&amp;quot; She guided me into a small bathroom inside the room. I glance at myself in the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was literally covered in blood, not even a single part of my body wasn&#39;t covered with blood. My long hair was now color red, I stared at my eyes, it was gold and red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Now shall we?&amp;quot; She started giving me a bath, the water turns red as the blood started washing down my body. I look like around 7? I was glancing at my hands the whole time. After that I slip into the white dress earlier. She looks satisfied when I was done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;So right now let&#39;s go back and meet him.&amp;quot; I froze by what she said. Him? Whose him? I wanted to ask something but we started moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled a card on her lab coat pocket and the slight click following a door opening in front of us. She motions me to follow her and I have no other choice but to follow her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a long staircase. Only the sound of my footsteps and her heels clicking echoes. When we reach the top the door opens on its own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes went wide at the sight in front of me. There are 5 young children tied up into something like a capsule? There is some tube attached in their bodies. They were the same age as this body of mine around 7-8 years old. They were also some people wearing lab coats moving around them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Come with me.&amp;quot; I didn&#39;t say anything and she pulled my hand. We entered another room it was like an office. The chair turns slowly to us showing a handsome middle age man around 30s. He had a pair grey eyes, I never saw anyone with those shade of grey eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Welcome my daughter.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Vision end***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I woke up I was gasping for air, I felt the heaviness in my head like someone just hammered it. Who the hell is that guy? I place my hand in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt the familiar cold feeling of chains in my skin, glancing down both my hands were tied down. I look around and found myself inside a glass box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard a clicking sound then the light turned on. I was looking at the unfamiliar face in front of me. She was smiling at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Good to see you again Amara.&amp;quot;</p>
