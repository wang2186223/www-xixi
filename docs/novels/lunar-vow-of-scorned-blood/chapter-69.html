                <p>Eliot&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just how far did they have in their blood. Galaz level can actually match a normal Alpha. I watch as he smoothly swallow the other werewolves with one go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Galaz this isn&#39;t something I have knowledge about.&#34; The newly arrive Ria mumbled, she was talking about the smoke that is mixed up with wolfsbane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was like some kind if toxins that focus on us. Look at the other werewolves, some of them rise again after they inhale it and lost consciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you do something about it?&#34; Ali uttered, he was already using his clones but the number of the faction&#34;s armies keep coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clint already killed a lot of them but it was no used. Noah was also doing his best to control their wolves but our efforts is starting to be useless. Our pack members also help, and a lot of them already died because of exhaustion and they cannot keep up with a lot of werewolves coming their way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yustef was already able to destroy one of the canons. He was taking far too long than expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to evacuate.&#34; I was stunned when I heard those words from Clint. Everything was like a silent blow, we all stood there watching the Central Kingdom being destroyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was right, the wolfsbane is making us weaker if we continue to fight. We won&#39;t stand against them.&#34; Galaz uttered, when I look around all I can see if the body of our pack members, we killed a lot of the faction but we are outnumbered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to go back!&#34; Galaz shouted, he was talking to the rogues who came with them. Who would have known that they would end up helping us and that we will actually need they&#39;re help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to get some samples.&#34; Ria said, while staring at the canons, Yustef was still there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You cannot just go there Ria!&#34; I&#39;m pretty sure it was Ali&#39;s voice who said those words. We aren&#39;t close to each other but using Clint&#39;s abilities even though they are rogues we were able to communicate with them in our wolf form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I have to! This isn&#39;t something that I could just missed. &#34; She answered back, they are far enough from me but because of my werewolf eyes I could see them clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you notice your strength? You weren&#39;t even able to stand properly and if I didn&#39;t save you earlier you could have been dead!&#34; He scold her. I ignored them after that, now wanting to hear their argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I focus on the werewolf around me, they are completely smaller than my wolf but something about them doesn&#39;t make sense. I&#39;m sure I was able to aim for their weak spot but they could still stand and attack me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Is this also the effect of that smoke? When I heard another loud explosion follow by a falling sound of metals, I&#39;m sure that Yustef was able to destroy another canon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be careful the Elders are nowhere to be found!&#34; Yustef voice mumbled. &#34;I couldn&#39;t see them after they entered the inside walls.&#34; He added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What are they planning this time? I shove the head of the werewolf in my mouth then attack the next one. All I can hear is the ripping sound of flesh followed by the overflowing smell of blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all stop when we heard a crying sounds inside the palace. Don&#39;t tell me they went inside while we were busy fighting here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was starting to get bored. So I paid them a visit.&#34; One of the Elders said it was Vincent. He had a wicked smile plastered in his face while he was holding a head. It was one of our pack members.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was even expecting so much from all of you. Yet, I was so disappointed. Is this the result of the first experiment? What a waste of time.&#34; Uttered, I clench my jaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t.&#34; Clint appear behind me, I didn&#39;t notice that he was this close already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At this rate, everyone inside was already dead. And only few was left from our pack warriors.&#34; He mumbled, I know we could kill him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can&#39;t. You already feel it right? The effect of the wolfsbane was already starting to consume us.&#34; And now that he mentioned it, I can feel my inside heating us. I tried to ignore it but it was affecting my vision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We cannot stay here any longer.&#34; Yustef appear, there was still some canon standing. &#34;They have other canons behind them. They are using a special kind of wolfsbane. I tried to take one but as I tried to touch it. It burns my skin.&#34; He added, while staring at the Elder in front of us. &#34;The other 2 Elders was also nowhere to be found. I think they are looking for something.&#34; He uttered, I don&#39;t like the words that is coming from their mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We couldn&#39;t just left and let them get away.&#34; I mumbled, just imaging the image of the body of our pack members inside the palace is making me want to rip him open. They are only children and elders. Some of them are even pregnant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eliot, this is not the time. We will get back to them but right now we need to fall back.&#34; I didn&#39;t say anything and remained silent. Clint gave a signal to our warriors to go to us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will leave right now.&#34; He said, they all didn&#39;t say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You all go, your highness. We will try to stop them if they try to follow you.&#34; One of them uttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! You are coming with us!&#34; I blurted out but they didn&#39;t say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our family and mates, as well as our children are already dead. We won&#39;t be able to attain the justice they deserve if you all ended up getting caught by them. So please... Do everything it take to let them pay.&#34; I couldn&#39;t uttered a word. Their eyes looks like they lost hope. And I couldn&#39;t blame them for that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand, I will make sure that they will pay twice than what they took from us.&#34; Clint said, he was staring at their eyes. This is one of the few times I witness Clint like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now go.&#34; I nodded my head, and we all head to the secret passage. Vincent tried to stop us but they blocked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They wouldn&#39;t stand that long, so we need to move fast!&#34; We all hurried our pace. Galaz was just behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go to this way.&#34; Noah opened the underground passage. We haven&#39;t used this in awhile. When we got out the ocean was already waiting for us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like we will go swimming.&#34; Ria uttered, we ignored her and pulled the hidden boat. It was a small boat that could feet only 8-10 people. And this area of the ocean was too dangerous. This is also the reason why we didn&#39;t let the pack members take this passage. Because it was connected to the dark forest. This is the forbidden area of the whole territory. Because once you got inside, you wouldn&#39;t be able to get out unless you actually know the way. Luckily Noah was able to find a way to get us to the exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it will take quite some time to get there the time inside the dark forest was actually different from the normal hours. It was faster there, so if you got lost your time will be affected. You 1 week ther is only a day outside. But the exit that we will head right now is actually around the South Territory. So we still need to be vigilant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here wear it.&#34; We all slip into some clothes that are inside the boat, good thing Yustef made preparations before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we finally got out, we are just outside the boderline of the south. It took us a week inside the forest but like I&#39;ve said before the time is different from the outside. It was already night when we got out. And according to Noah, this is the shortest and safest route.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all lay on the ground when we finally reach the exit. The tour inside was not easy, our body was not able to adapt with the changes inside. The pressure around that place is complete crashing us. Also knowing the fact that our body is completely draining our energy because of that wolfsbane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t feel my legs.&#34; Ria blurted out, she was looking pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should I carry you?&#34; Ali offer his help but she just rolled her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are bleeding, and by the looks of it your wound won&#39;t get healed that easily.&#34; Ali was injured because some shadow like figures attack us. They are far from Galaz abilities. Because those things are like humans, they tried to lure you somewhere then start ripping you to pieces. Ali was lucky that he was able to wake up before anything serious happened to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will carry you.&#34; Yustef suddenly uttered, making me stare at him with disbelief. Did he just really said those words?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone is coming.&#34; Clint suddenly uttered, we all stared at him. Follow by the footsteps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should I just killed them?&#34; Ali uttered, Clint hush him. We all stood up and Yustef carried Ria just like what he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t do anything. We don&#39;t want more commotion. And right now even a normal werewolf will end up giving us fatal wounds.&#34; I cannot disagree with him. I was expecting that the effect of it will soon vanish but it didn&#39;t. As time goes by it was still eating me up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to get back fast. So I could start my study about this.&#34; Ria suddenly show up a red wolfsbane flower. It was the first time I saw a red one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where did you get that?&#34; Ali ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To him. He was able to get one which is why we need to start going before this flower dies.&#34; She answered. Since when did they got this close? As far as I know Yustef hated her so much that even mentioning her name is enough to get him annoyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This way.&#34; Galaz said. We all didn&#39;t say anything and start heading to who knows where. I don&#39;t know why Clint was actually trusting them right now knowing that they are the enemy a few weeks by now. And right now they are acting like they are the good guys and came to our rescue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are we going?&#34; Noah blurted out as we run. We can&#39;t even turn to our wolf because they are the ones who are greatly affected by the wolfsbane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To where she was.&#34; Galaz answer. &#34;You wanted to see her right?&#34; I know he was talking about Klaire.</p>
