                <p>The air around us was starting to feel heavier, everyone stopped moving and stared at the young girl, that I even myself was watching her with my eyes wide open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My surroundings were starting to be surrounded by darkness, I didn&#39;t notice earlier but she was starting to be surrounded by emanate glow, and it was dark. She was being surrounded by complete darkness, I couldn&#39;t see what is happening right in front of my eyes as the darkness was starting to consume her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;HA! FINIALLY!&amp;quot; Belerick was watching her with satisfaction in his eyes. He stops doing what his doing and lifted his hand in the air as he continues to watch the young girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was moving slowly; I can see her face as her back was facing me. She slowly walks herself towards Belerick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Amara no...&amp;quot; Aiden whispered as his hands was around his stomach where Belerick kicked him. He tried to stand on his feet but failed and end up stumbling on the floor. He was too weak to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;This is it! This is what I&#39;ve been waiting for!&amp;quot; Belerick can&#39;t contain his excitement. When she was close enough to him, he slowly went down to his knees bowing head as Amara stops in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pressure around her was affecting everyone around her, including me even though I wasn&#39;t part of this time frame. I can feel my body started to feel her power. The atmosphere says it all like it holds a certain heaviness in the air like it would sit on your shoulders until it felt like you would be crushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Welcome my Lord, I am Belerick your humbled servant.&amp;quot; Belerick mutters as his head was still on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you the one who woke me up?&amp;quot; Her voice was low and sounded different than before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remember what Clint was telling me before, Lycans are mystical creatures, they aren&#39;t just strong but have these abilities to control and dominate the werewolves. I really didn&#39;t put my mind on it but this time I can see what he meant by that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything that happened before, how those Rogues were killing each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yes my Lord, my brother and I tried to before but I have to kill him when he stops doing our goals.&amp;quot; Belerick explained, I clench my fist just by remembering what I witnessed before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I see...&amp;quot; Amara said, she scanned her surroundings. The stopping at the sight of the 5 children. Her smile was giving me goosebumps; her eyes were blank no traces of a young child written in them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Belerick lifted his head but that was far the worse decision he made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Did I ever said that you could lift your head? I remember exactly what you did to my vessel.&amp;quot; She mumbled coldly. And with a snap of her fingers his head went flying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This caught everybody&#39;s attention, like she knew it would she smirked and watched their reactions. Everyone&#39;s face became pale. The fire at the building was starting to catch up on their location. But she didn&#39;t even mind it and dragged Belerick&#39;s body and toss his body in the fire like a piece of cake. Then he lifted his head using her left hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Don&#39;t you all feel relieved now that he&#39;s dead?&amp;quot; She asked, her voice sounded bored at the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The something flickered in her eyes, like some kind of idea came in her mind. She smiled at the thought in her heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You all have this young girl&#39;s blood. I can feel her power radiating in them.&amp;quot; She said, then lifted her hand in the air. &amp;quot;This is interesting...&amp;quot; She added then all the five children started to float in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Who are you? Where is Amara?!&amp;quot; Aiden mumbled, he was trying to struggle but it was pointless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Malik, that was what they called me before. This vessel isn&#39;t bad, but something about you was the reason why this Child lose her control.&amp;quot; She moved Aiden closer to her, she was scanning his face closely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I see; you both are mates after all.&amp;quot; She said, sounding board. She turned her attention to the other one it was Afreo this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You, you are the strongest among them. I can feel it; I saw you before in the dark. You were really fighting it.&amp;quot; She mumbled, her eyes were full of enthusiasm as his lips formed a slight smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I have no idea what you are talking about.&amp;quot; Afreo said, she started doing something to him and he started to scream in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I wanna test how strong you were but I guess there aren&#39;t much to expect from you.&amp;quot; She then turns her head to the next one, Afreo started to feel a slight sense of relief as the pain went down. This time it was Aris, I can see his hands trembling a little when she turned her head to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Amara? Don&#39;t do this I know you could still here me!&amp;quot; Aiden&#39;s voice shouted she didn&#39;t even turn her head at him and she send him flying from the far corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I wouldn&#39;t want you to disturb her while she was sleeping.&amp;quot; She said her voice was cold as eyes, her eyes went back to Aris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You were the visionary.&amp;quot; She mumbled, she then threw Aris in the wall his back was hitting the concrete wall following a loud crashed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Now what do we have here.&amp;quot; She was now in front of the 3 other kids, she scanned them back and forth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;How come I don&#39;t feel anything from you.&amp;quot; She moved slowly at the long haired child. She lifted his hair away from his face, showing a burnt like mark in his left face, the scar is surrounding his right eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You didn&#39;t receive her blood, no your body rejected it.&amp;quot; She mumbled then turned her head back to the other remaining two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I still want to play with all of you but this little girl was starting to wake up and I wouldn&#39;t want her to bother my fun time.&amp;quot; She mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;LET HER GO!&amp;quot; Aiden came rushing to her direction, his eyes were glowing. And then he shifted into a black wolf, his wolf growl and charge at her. He slammed into her full force. She wasn&#39;t expecting that hit, what was even more surprising as he jumped towards her he surprised her by changing back into her human form and tackled her to the floor. Holding both her hand right above her neck as he climbed above her to sustain her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;AMARA WAKE UP! I KNOW YOU COULD HEAR ME SO PLEASE COME BACK!&amp;quot; he said while restraining her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;She wouldn&#39;t hear you, I was keeping her somewhere safe.&amp;quot; She mumbled, her lips were smiling giving him her triumphant smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;NO DON&#39;T LET HIM CONTROL YOU AMARA! WAKE UP PLEASE! THIS ISN&#39;T YOU! NONE OF THIS IS YOUR FAULT SO WAKE UP!&amp;quot; He mumbles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Aiden?&amp;quot; She whispered, then something flickered back again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;NO! I WON&#39;T LET YOU TAKE HER, SHE WAS MINE!&amp;quot; she was back again to his control. She was starting to struggle but he pinned her down, the other started moving and helps Aiden on holding her down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;WAKE UP AMARA! Come back to us we are here for you! You wouldn&#39;t be alone again. I am here for you.&amp;quot; Her eyes started flowing with tears, following an emanate golden glow around her. It was warm and comforting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Aiden...&amp;quot; She started sobbing then. He pulled her into a tight hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Everything is fine now...&amp;quot; He whispered and they all stumbled on the ground, as she lost her consciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Amara!&amp;quot; One the child caught her in time before she hits the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Calixto be careful, she might still wake up and end up killing us all.&amp;quot; The smallest one said, the one called Calixto shake his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I didn&#39;t tell you about it but she was the one who save me during the time where I was helplessly beaten up by those guards when they caught me.&amp;quot; He explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;But that wasn&#39;t important right now, we need to get out of here.&amp;quot; The other mutters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all started moving, one of them grabbed Aiden who is now unconscious, Afreo broke his arm by the impact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Let&#39;s get out of here.&amp;quot; Calixto started to slowly lifted her and carried her outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood there trying to process everything that I&#39;ve seen so far. I watch as they all started walking outside, my eyes stopped at the long haired child then everything started filling up the holes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slowly turns his head and stared at me with the same look that I would never forget. Everything was starting to make sense now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I close my eyes trying to stop my tears for falling and when I opened them I felt my body sinking, like I was being consumed into the deep see, all I can see is the small light getting further and further away from me as I was sinking deeper and deeper into this darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Vision end***</p>
