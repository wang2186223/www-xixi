                <p>It&#39;s been three days already. I heard my mate is still unconscious. The memory of what happened at the clinic that day. It&#39;s making me feel even worst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Zion left, His words stuck in my head. I took everything away from Sarah...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m sorry...&amp;quot; I don&#39;t know who am I apologizing to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stayed by Klaire&#39;s side this might be my only chance to stay beside her. She looks so peaceful while she sleeps. I pulled her hand on my lips and kiss it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m sorry...&amp;quot; I whispered again. I still don&#39;t have any idea about what happened to her. Derek also has no idea about what happened inside the office. They just told him that she just fainted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I need to ask my father about the details later. I didn&#39;t notice that Sarah woke up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Ugh...&amp;quot; Sarah mumbled, trying to scan the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly stood up to assist her, but I stop once I notice Klaire was gripping my hand. A smile form on my lips. How I wish she would do the same once she regains consciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gaze at my hand which is being held tight by Klaire&#39;s hand then back to Sarah who is now fully awake. She sat down on the bed frowning, holding her head. I don&#39;t know what to do and just end up watching her. She scans the room, eyes wide by my presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Dwayne!&amp;quot; She exclaimed, jumping off the bed towards me. She stops mid-way when she notices who is lying beside me. Her eyes landed on me or in our hands rather. Her expression automatically changes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;W-why?&amp;quot; She mutters her voice being angry. Her eyes started tearing up. She looks so pitiful and desperate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just stood there frozen unable to decide what to do. Zion&#39;s voice echoed in my head &amp;quot;you took everything away from her.&amp;quot; Those words stabbed me a thousand times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closing my eyes, I let go of Klaire&#39;s hand and did the only right thing that I thought of. I immediately ran to Sarah. After all, Sarah needs me more than anyone else</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know what emotions I should feel, all I know is, I am angry and fearful, and perhaps it can be tuned out to something like being disgusted with my whole existence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that day, Sarah never left my side, she started to act normal again and she&#39;s back to her cheerful side. Zion didn&#39;t talk to me after that. He just looks pleased that Sarah is okay now. But every time I caught him staring at Sarah and he immediately looked away. He hasn&#39;t found his mate yet. And I hope he wouldn&#39;t do the same thing I did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was in love with Sarah, but I just didn&#39;t know how long it would last. Because once his mate appeared. Those emotions would crumble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every time I find a chance to go to the east mansion to visit my mate. I will always end up with seeing that bastard&#39;s face. That eyesore is really getting his way and this time another three eyesores were added to my list. I brush my hair out of frustration and let out a heavy sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Dwayne, are you listening?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at my mom who was now calling my attention. She shook her head when she noticed that I had no idea what she was talking about. I looked at her with confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Your presence will be needed tomorrow. The passing of title will begin by the end of the month, the day of the new moon.&amp;quot; She continues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I totally forgot about it after everything that happened. So I was really going to be the Alpha, my wolf wiggled his tails with pride. He was excited about the new authority that will pass down on us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mom sat down on her chair and motioned me to follow her and sat on the chair across her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Son, I know you are having these mixed emotions right now. But I have to remind you to do your part as the future Alpha and your father also have a hard time already because of the sudden events.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gritted my teeth at the memory of those sudden attacks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t answer her because I knew she was right. She reached for my hand and gave it a slight squeeze. Now that I looked at her, the dark circles under her eyes showed that she wasn&#39;t getting enough sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What happened?&amp;quot; I ask. I know she didn&#39;t just call me here to tell me about the passing of the title.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She averted my eyes. She wasn&#39;t telling me something, and I was right. She sighed and stared at me in the eyes, whenever she did this, it would be a serious matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You have to take Sarah as your Luna.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took my hand away but she tightened her grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you seriously, right now?!&amp;quot; I asked again not believing what I just heard from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You rejected your mate, Dwayne! And Sarah you have to take responsibility for her!&amp;quot; She added contemplating whether she should continue or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I already knew what she would say anyway. I wanted to protest but I decided to remain silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Oh no! Dwayne, this is a huge disaster for us.&amp;quot; My wolf may feel angry and hurt right now but still obeyed his Luna. He slowly buries himself into the back of my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Please understand Dwayne.&amp;quot; She muttered, trying to reach my hand but I pulled my hand away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remained silent...My mon dismissed me after the long silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah was waiting for me outside when I got out. She looks happy about something. Her face turned confused when she noticed my expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What happened?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t answer her, turning my back to head upstairs. I heard her calling my name but I didn&#39;t bother her call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lock myself in my room. And started throwing things around. All the things that caught my eyes end up crashing on the walls. I thought I could still fix everything after I get my issue with Sarah, I thought I could at least try to chase Klaire back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My tears run down my cheeks, all my hopes shattered to pieces... Is this the sentence for my sins? For rejecting my mate?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Dwayne get up!&amp;quot; Sarah hissed, trying to make me get out of my bed. She burst into my room early in the morning just to wake me up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m not going.&amp;quot; I turned my back on her trying to get myself back to sleep. She was here for the arrangements of my succession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone was making a fuss about it already and I found I was not interested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Oh come on! You know you will end up doing it anyway!&amp;quot; She exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They probably told her that she will also stand next to me as my Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still haven&#39;t fully decided about that matter, because after that ceremony I will have to mark her, which will cause the bond between Klaire and me to fully weakened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit my lower lip at that thought, if have the same effect on Klaire will just make everything more impossible for us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Dwayne! Are you listening???&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled a pillow up to my ear, Sarah pulled it away. Hearing a faint thud as it hits the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What is wrong with you! Are you going to really let me be mateless?!&amp;quot; She mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened my eyes and looked at her. She was about to cry again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Okay, I will go. I&#39;ll be downstairs in a minute.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah&#39;s face glows up and her arms wraps around me before heading to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I will wait for you downstairs. I love you!&amp;quot; Sarah utters before vanishing to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a heavy breath and lay down on my bed. My eyes drifted to the only painting intact in my room. I left it there because it was a painting of thunder cloud, but what keeps me to leave it is the color of it, blue with a mixture of gray, reminding me of Klaire&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still heard nothing about her, it was already 5 days since I last heard something about her. And that was still back in the clinic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;DWAYNE I&#39;LL COME BACK THERE IF YOU WON&#39;T START MOVING!&amp;quot; I heard Sarah shout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My room is still a complete mess. All the new furniture is completely destroyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grabbing the towel on the stool I head to my bathroom to take a shower. I remember I still have some matters to talk about my father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After I&#39;m done, I went downstairs where Sarah was waiting with Zion. I hadn&#39;t seen him also in a while. They both notice my presence. Sarah waved at me, while Zion stood there awkwardly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Finally.&amp;quot; Sarah looks relieved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wrapped her arms around mine. Zion averted his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It&#39;s been a while,&amp;quot; I mutter keeping my eyes on Zion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scratches his head and we both started laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yeah, good to see you get up on your feet.&amp;quot; Zion said, trying to light up the mood around us. Sarah stared at us confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Geez! Do that later. Let&#39;s go, Dwayne!&amp;quot; She started pulling my hand, Zion just nodded his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah stopped all of a sudden, I stopped also to see what Sarah was staring at. My heart started beating fast...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blue-gray eyes staring right back at me...</p>
