                <p>It&#39;s been 5 years since that day where we last saw Klaire, it&#39;s been years but it still feels like yesterday to me. I was still hunted by what happened 5 years ago.</p>

                <p>After everything that we&#39;ve been through, the Royalties remained in the Pack because we are still not. Not yet, because she was still out there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Let&#39;s start,&amp;quot; I mumbled, they all turn their heads at me. Clint, Yustef, Noah, and Eliot were on the other side of the long table. I took my seat right at the center.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;They are again moving,&amp;quot; Eliot uttered, his eyes are glowing then he started marking it on the map like how he usually does.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;That&#39;s the West territory,&amp;quot; Noah said while staring at the map. &amp;quot;That was the nearest pack to the Human Civilization.&amp;quot; He added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just what on earth are planning this time? I glance at the map where they attacked before. They already destroyed the South border territory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We need to move, and get there before they do.&amp;quot; They all nodded their head and we all prepared all the things that we will be needing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All these years we prepared ourselves doing training, Yustef was the one in charge of training the pack members. We cannot risk any more lives this time we can&#39;t repeat the same mistake like before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance at my pack members who are now done with their training. I wish Zion was still here to witness all his hard work did pay off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;ve been looking for you.&amp;quot; I turn to see Sarah, she was wearing a yellow sundress. Her favorite dress, I kissed her forehead. Her lips curve into a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Why are you here? You should be inside right now.&amp;quot; I whispered, she shake her head then pulled my hand into her now growing belly, it was still not that noticeable but you can feel her belly bump.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I can&#39;t just send you off without saying goodbye.&amp;quot; She mumbled, then pulled me into a kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>5 years have passed and I still have no idea where Klaire is. All those years we tried looking for her tracking their every movement, but still found nothing not even a glimpse of her shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now Sarah is pregnant with my child. It all happened one day after Zion died, I was not in my right self at that time. I went drinking, after losing my mate then I lost my best friend. Sarah was in my room during that time and she was on her heat, that is what they call it when a she-wolf was at the age where they can conceive a baby. That only happened to the she-wolf who already found their mate and on her part. I was the one who killed her mate that&#39;s why she was in pain every time she feels her heart. My mother did say that it feels like all your limbs are being taken out of your body. And the only way to relieve it is to mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That is also one of the reasons why I started sleeping with her in the past. She didn&#39;t conceive a baby before because it was nearly impossible for a she-wolf to conceive a child that is not her mate. But there is still a small possibility and that is how it happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clint was furious when he found out, saying that I had betrayed his sister. And I know he was right but I cannot just abandon my child because of my selfishness. I made a mistake and that is something that I have to carry for the rest of my life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Go inside now, it&#39;s cold outside.&amp;quot; She bid me another farewell before she went inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You look good at being a father,&amp;quot; Yustef uttered, I can feel the sarcasm in his statement. Clint just stared at me then started moving again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all hated me for taking Sarah in, well it&#39;s obvious in the past that we have our pack but I am not Aiden anymore, I can&#39;t just be stuck into the past. Right now I have a pack that I have to protect and a child that will soon replace me in this title. I have to do everything in my power to keep them safe even if I have to go against everyone... Even her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My wolf doesn&#39;t like the idea of fighting our mate but he has this parental father inside us that we have to protect our pup at all cost. This pup is also one of the reasons why we somehow had the motivation to keep going.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I can&#39;t believe you got another she-wolf pregnant after you came chasing Klaire back,&amp;quot; Noah uttered with hatred. I know they are mad, and I understand why because I myself is even mad about myself. But I can&#39;t let that affect my child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Let him be Noah,&amp;quot; Eliot called for Noah. Among them, Eliot was the only one who didn&#39;t show his hatred. But I can feel his somewhat resentment over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a sigh and went inside, as I entered my office my mother is already waiting for me there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Dwayne...&amp;quot; She starts, I know how this will end again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Mom we already talk about this.&amp;quot; She cups my face then turn it so I found face her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;My son you know that this pack needs their Luna, especially now. Your position as Alpha is still being questioned after everything that happened.&amp;quot; I pulled her hand away from my face and lean on the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know what she was saying is not wrong. After all the chaos that happened in this whole 5 years. The Pack was furious and afraid that one day I would betray them because of my mate. They are already fully aware of all the things that happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw their doubts every time I came across them. Their respect for my father is also being questioned because of how my father can&#39;t control me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You need to make Sarah your Luna, you have to think about the pack. You&#39;ve wasted 5 years of your life looking for her but found nothing. All those lives that we lost were all because of her Dwayne! When will you even be able to open your eyes and face it!&amp;quot; I reach for the doorknob not wanting to hear any more from my mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You rejected her in the first place, Dwayne! You have to live with it!&amp;quot; That&#39;s the last thing I heard before the door closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I close my eyes, shaking that thought away from me. If I didn&#39;t reject her would things be different? Will she stay if I didn&#39;t leave her alone? Will she still choose to be with us even if she remembered everything?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smash the vase on the side, not caring about the piercing eyes that are watching me right now. If Zion was here I know he would end up punching me right now and telling me to do the same thing that my mother wants. Especially if it was about Sarah...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You okay there?&amp;quot; Alec asks, he was the one who took Zion&#39;s position after he died. He was one of the strongest fighters we had after Zion and Dale died.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yeah.&amp;quot; He look at me unsure then turn his back and started walking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec and I aren&#39;t that close, he just returned after his training with the South. He was more close to Sarah because they did training together. He was also a quiet guy, brown hair with a well-sculptured figure and he was also taller than me. When he first arrived here he fought with almost all the pack warriors who wanted to take the position of the Beta and all of them did not stand against him. He earned my respect because of his fighting skills. Even the Royalties acknowledge his skills. If I didn&#39;t know he was a low-status werewolf I would believe that he has Alpha blood inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watch him walking away then stop, to stare for something or someone. I followed who he was staring at and found Sarah who is now talking to Grace, one of her friends. Sarah noticed Alec staring then she whispered something to Grace and she started walking away like she was running away from someone. Is it just me or she was somehow uncomfortable with Alec?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Alpha everything is ready, we were only waiting for your word.&amp;quot;</p>
