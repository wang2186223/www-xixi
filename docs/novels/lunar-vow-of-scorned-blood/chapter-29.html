                <p>I froze at my feet, as I realize who was the person wearing the crown was. Klaire looks gorgeous in her long white lace gown. Her hair is curled sitting just around her waist.</p>

                <p>What is her relationship with them? And the crown? I scowled when the thought about the legend hit me. She was related to that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Let me introduce to you all Amaris Klaire Calypso the granddaughter of King Felcio Alec Calypso. And my sister.&amp;quot; Clint announced, all this time the answer was right in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah gasped, I even forgot that she was standing next to me. She wrapped her hand around mine for support. She looks shocked and frightened. Her eyes are a bit teary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It was her...&amp;quot; Sarah mumbled, I stare at her confused. But she ran away before I could even ask her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never mind that, I&#39;ll ask her later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes darted back at Klaire, she was distracted by someone. My eyes stop at her hand and shifted to the man who is holding her hand. He was also staring back at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The staring contest stops as Klaire spoke, my attention focused on her. She was avoiding my eyes but I let myself watch her graceful movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Good evening, you are all probably surprised but that wasn&#39;t the concern for today.&amp;quot; She pauses, lifting her arms in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It is for them, for now, save hour questions for later.&amp;quot; She added, directing her words towards us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the corner of my eyes, the surprise in their faces is evident. I gaze at the only one who is smiling... Rion, he doesn&#39;t even look surprised at all. Instead, satisfaction is glowing between his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Focus, Dwayne.&amp;quot; My mother whispered, making me turn my eyes back to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Klaire was now at the center of the circle, eyes closed. I watch in fascination as she gracefully moves and starts the succession. She lifted her head, gazing at the moon as it starts to shine above her. My whole body shivers coldly, her power radiating around us... Golden auras move around her. The wind is starting to blow stronger, circular around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all started to cover their eyes to avoid the harsh blow on their eyes. I just remain there standing, watching as her black hair slowly turns into a silver almost white color. My heart started beating fast... What is this? The heavy feeling in my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Golden butterflies started appearing, circulating her. She looks like she belongs to a different world as I watch her. I wanted to ask her everything right now. But something within my guts is telling me this isn&#39;t the right time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Don&#39;t let him get her...&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly the voice of that Lady echoes in my head, reminding me of the same silver-white hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My gaze stays at Klaire, everything was moving slowly like she was the only person around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;As the Moon Goddess grants you your position, may you continue to serve with all the power vested within you.&amp;quot; She mumbled, her eyes opening slowly... Red and Golden eyes staring at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widen, the same eyes that little girls have. The way she looks with those eyes is different from that little girl. Klaire&#39;s eyes are cold and blank... The little girl from the dungeon&#39;s eyes is soft and scared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They can&#39;t be the same person right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sighing to myself, there is only one way to find out. I step forward following her instructions. It was already the second part of the succession. The transferring of markings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>According to my father during this time we won&#39;t be able to freely leash our beast. Because in this part we have to tame and dominate than to control their real power. It would be an inner battle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was the last person to receive the markings, I kneeled. Her scent is stronger this time. Clenching my fist just to help me be more rational. Her presence is big enough to almost make me lose control. My eyes remain close making all my other senses more sensitive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart almost jumps out of my chest as I feel her presence in front of me. Her breathing slows, I almost smile that I still have the same effect as before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;State your name and title.&amp;quot; She whispered, her voice sounding soft yet wary between my ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Dwayne Carter accepts the position of Alpha,&amp;quot; I stated, lifting my head like how I imagine myself staring right at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breathing slows, I heard a slight sound in the ink, as she dumps her index fingers on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;May the Moon Goddess give you her blessing.&amp;quot; She mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I inhale sharply as I felt her finger on my skin. Sparks climbed all over my body like I was being electrified with the pleasure of her next to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands slowly live traces between my skin, it was a slow and torturing minute of my life. She hurriedly took her hand away from me as soon as she finish placing the marking on my forehead. It feels like she has been burnt, not wanting to even be close to me for another minute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take a deep breath. It doesn&#39;t begin to fill the void in my chest, a void has been present since that day when I claimed her yet lost her at the same time, a painful hollow reminded me of my loss again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I open my eyes and she wasn&#39;t in front of me anymore. They took their sits next to the Alphas. My eyes remain at her; I gaze at her trying to tell her my intense feelings. Her eyes remain gazing back at me, a flinch of emotion is flickering, not sure what it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next part is the Oath taking between the Pack. This is the bond that will let me connect to everyone who is part of the Pack. My father stood in front of me as I kneeled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took my upper clothes off, lowering my head. He places his right hand above my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I am passing the Alpha to you, my Son, as you will be the father of this Pack. Do you swear to protect this pack with your life?&amp;quot; My father utter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yes, I swear upon the Moon Goddess,&amp;quot; I answer, my heart started to beat faster. My body somehow feels heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You will be the foundation of the pack with your Luna. Your power and authority will always be respected as you respect your members. Will you be able to let go of everything and put the pack first?&amp;quot; My father added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pause for a moment. He wanted me to let go of everything, my eyes darted at the only person who makes me feel lost without her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Do you swear?&amp;quot; My father added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yes, I swear upon the Moon Goddess,&amp;quot; I answer, he took his hand off me. I glance up as he instructed. He lifts both his hand up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I announce you, Dwayne Carter, as the new Alpha of the Crescent Moon Pack of the North.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasp at the sudden pressure I feel. Clenching both my fist, the burning sensation in my chest is starting to grow stronger, making it harder to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A voice boom in my head, it was my wolf&#39;s voice but different at the same time. I close my eyes trying to block his voice out, it stops for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a sudden pull inside me when I open my eyes. I was in a dark place; it was inside my mind. I scanned where I am, a large black wolf was standing in front of me. It was too large to be my wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What do you desire...&amp;quot; It muttered, its blue eyes gazing at me, piercing deep inside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remember what my father told me once you gave in to your darkest desire you lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I know what you want.&amp;quot; It was walking slowly around me, I didn&#39;t answer it and just remain silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You wanted to make things right.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze at its words; it smirks at my reactions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a snap I was taken in the forest, it was familiar like I have been here. There I found a familiar face, it was me when I was younger. Sarah&#39;s father was with me... No! I shouted the day of Sarah&#39;s father flash in front of me and again I can&#39;t do anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I can give you power if you let me out.&amp;quot; its voice was whispering between my ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;No!&amp;quot; I firmly answered, again I was shifted into another place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time it was the day when Sarah, Zion, and I just had our coming of age ceremony. It was our first shift. We were all very happy not aware of the danger that will come our way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze as I saw I take out the life of Sarah&#39;s mate again. I close my eyes not wanting to see that again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You can&#39;t keep me here.&amp;quot; It whispered again. I block it out, its laugh echoing around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, it changed to another place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned at the unfamiliar place, it was snowing. Blood is scattered around, I followed where the blood came from and froze, my face became pale at the scene in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was me, with a heart in my hand right... And right next to me is the lifeless body of my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Klaire...</p>
