                <p>Eliot&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that I remember before we can reach the place they made us drink something. Galaz mentioned that it was to make sure that we are not part of the Faction&#39;s plan. I was hesitant at first but Clint took the bottle and drink it before he told us to do it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all didn&#39;t think twice because we trust Clint. And by the look of it he was really aware of everything that is happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We walk out of the door, the place is quite old. Noah was still unconscious. I think it was probably because of the wolfsbane that we inhaled. Even now I can still feel my body weakened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Can someone please explain everything that is happening right now?&amp;quot; Yustef mumbled, feeling a bit left out as I was. He was getting grumpier than usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It was all part of the plan. Remember the time in the Island?&amp;quot; I nodded my head, those events aren&#39;t easy to forget. Until now I can still imagine the looks of Klaire had during that time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I saw Kariz that time. He told me everything he knew about the Faction. At first I didn&#39;t believe him but when we encountered the werewolves that belong to the faction it only added to my suspicion. Because no one knows about it other than us and Belerick. It also confirmed my presumptions when we encountered Ria and Ali, at first I ignored that thoughts but when we encountered them again it only confirmed that they are somehow like us. Kariz mentioned about the fact that the faction was continuing what Belerick left. Dwayne&#39;s already knows about this and decided to make his investigation to the faction. But looks like they got caught.&amp;quot; Upon saying that Zion entered, he looks surprised when he saw us but recover quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What happened to Dwayne?&amp;quot; I ask, he avoided my gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Just like he said, we were caught before we could even investigate further.&amp;quot; He answered, clenching his fist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kariz opened a huge metal door. But what&#39;s inside it made us froze. It was a  frozen werewolves. No, it has the head of a werewolf but it&#39;s body is different, it was covered with fur but his hands are slightly shorter than his legs. Like it doesn&#39;t walk using his four legs but two. The crystal like ice stuck him in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What is that?&amp;quot; Zion mumbled. As I stared at it longer it feels like it was calling for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Don&#39;t.&amp;quot; Kariz uttered, I stop before I could even touch it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;This is what we found inside the Facility. It was a Lycan, I don&#39;t know how they got their hands on it. But it only means that they are continuing what they are planning.&amp;quot; He continue. Then shutting the door behind him. He told us to wait outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Is this for real? Lycans?&amp;quot; Zion mumbled with disbelief. We ignored his words. It&#39;s been a while since I last hear someone mention about Lycans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lycans are commonly mistaken as a werewolf, but Lycan is a more advanced species that, unlike the werewolf, can for the most part control their transformations. A werewolf can only change under the full moon, and cannot control that. The same can be said for lycans, however they are also able to transform at any given time, whether under a full moon or not, should the need arise. They are the first creation of the Moon Goddess and the reason why we are taken. Belerick wanted a Lycan army for his plans. I don&#39;t know why he have this hate so much from the other clans why he will go to this extent just to awaken them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Took you long enough to get here.&amp;quot; That voice, we all turn around to find Klaire. She was wearing a red dress, her hair is no longer black but back to it&#39;s original color of silver-white.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It&#39;s been a while.&amp;quot; Clint mumbled, the coldness on their voices is evident. Klaire ignored him and walk down the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;So you all saw it?&amp;quot; Her voice sounded bored and uninterested. She look more pale, her shoulders look thinner. She lost so much weight but you can see the built of her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looks intimidating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kariz walks out of the door and smiled when he saw Klaire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I thought you wouldn&#39;t go out of your room.&amp;quot; The look of familiarity is evident among them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I couldn&#39;t just let you handle everything on your own. Besides we need to do this after everything we found out.&amp;quot; She answered, looking stern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Well then shall we?&amp;quot; Kariz opened another door but this time it looks like a normal office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waiting inside was Galaz, Ria and Ali and two black panthers. Who are far from the normal once. Kariz took the center seat and besides her Klaire sat down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance at Clint, who had a look that I cannot read. He looks calm yet something underneath it is hiding. He was just staring at Klaire who didn&#39;t even glance twice to our direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gentleman please have a seat. 5 other unfamiliar faces entered but two among them caught our attention, they have this different feeling among them. Just like how we felt with Ria and Ali.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;They are with us.&amp;quot; Zion mumbled as he watch our reaction. They took the seat next to him while we sat across them. My eyes stays at the two siblings. Twins perhaps, they look quite similar to each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Looks like they are more of us.&amp;quot; The boy uttered. He looks young, just like us they were also checking us out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;This is Devon and Dieter, I came across them while I was checking the South. As you all aware of, they are somehow like us. They are the third generation of the new breeds. I have no idea if they have other new breeds but as far as we know they are the only success they had.&amp;quot; Kariz explains. Then he glance at their direction. &amp;quot;And this people in front of you are the first generation of new breeds. While Ria and Ali are the second ones and Galaz is my own creation.&amp;quot; He smiled at the mention of own creation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know why Clint trust him so much. But I can&#39;t still put myself at ease. Especially after they had so many things that they hide from us. I wasn&#39;t even sure if they are telling us the truth right now. But just like Clint muttered earlier we have no other choice but to trust them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Now that everyone is here, I would like to tell you everything that we discovered so far. From the time that you are all busy traveling here Amara and I have our own ways.&amp;quot; Amara, Klaire didn&#39;t even care about mentioning that name. Is she really Amara now? Is Klaire really gone? Even though she was both of them but Amara is cruel and ruthless. Just remembering what she have done to all of us. It was like she was complete different person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kariz let out a huge map, which include the whole continent and territories. This time it had the territories of other clans. The underworld where vampires and demons are located, the fores lake where fairies, dwarfs and elves are located and also witches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;As you all know Lycans are the first creation of the Moon Goddess, Because of their non humane nature they resulted into a huge war among the other clans. This made the Moon Goddess to sealed them away and create the werewolf. We are still unsure why the Factions wanted to awaken the Lycans but one thing is for sure, other clans started looking down to our kind after the war. Which we think was the reason why the Faction wanted to built their own army of Lycans but until now they still failed. Using the bloodline of the human mates of the Lycans which runs to your veins.&amp;quot; Mates of Lycans? Is that the reason why they pick us among all the humans out there?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yes, you all are from the bloodline of the human mates which also received the blessings from the Moon Goddess but unlike us, Amara and I are from the protector of the Lycans Blood.&amp;quot; Amara and him? His smiles widen. &amp;quot;Yes, we are siblings.&amp;quot; He added. Making us all in shock. Siblings? How?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I will let Amara tell you everything about us after. Right now let&#39;s continue our meeting about the Faction.&amp;quot; He mumbled, no one said anything. I glance at Clint who finally show some reaction, he had the same look we had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Then why did you attack us before?&amp;quot; Noah&#39;s voice suddenly came from the door. He was finally awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;The second war started because of you. Which lead to our death.&amp;quot; He added, his words was full of anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;The second war, it was all started because I Belerick manipulated me. When I was awaken that was the only time I was able to get out of his control&amp;quot; Noah suddenly burst out laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Do you really think we will believe you? Manipulated? He doesn&#39;t have that kind of power and he died remember?&amp;quot; I couldn&#39;t let myself stop Noah because just like him I was also mad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I don&#39;t know if you will believe it or not but Belerick is far more different than what we have seen before. I don&#39;t know how he was able to change that much but one thing is sure. Everything is connected to that thing.&amp;quot; He was talking about the Lycan that we saw earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You mentioned that you are awaken during the second war, then what exactly happened?&amp;quot; Clint was now the one who is talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;For all of us to be a Lycan there will be three stages of awakening. But that is only possible if you have our blood. One is where you will notice a fraction of your powers showing up. Which happens to Amara before when we are still young and being unable to control the sudden shift of your power. The second is the rebirth, where you were able to die but then ended up being rebirth or in my case I was able to come back to life. This is also the time where you will show a sudden change, where you are not able to control all your powers and this is the time where the Lycan inside you was the one controlling your thirst to kill. Like what happened to the Island and I think this also happened to Amara during the second war. Even if she was not yet on the second phase, it only proves that what we know are still not enough.&amp;quot; He explains. We all remained silent during that time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;And the third one is when you are finally able to shift. I tried to awaken Amara before but I was only able to retrieve her memories in her previous life.&amp;quot; He became silent at the last part. &amp;quot;And you all witness what happened in the Island after. Her Lycan responded but it was still weak.&amp;quot; He continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Do you really want to continue seeing Klaire like that? With nothing but killing everyone in her head? Uncontrolled and not even able to recognize anyone.&amp;quot; I couldn&#39;t stop myself this time. Just seeing how everyone died while I have to continue the Central Kingdom as Aris. That life was nothing but emptiness, all I could wish that time is death to visit me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I know you are upset after everything that happened Eliot, but that was who she really was. Lycans was already part of us. Even before the experiment, it was already in our bloodline. You wouldn&#39;t understand because you are just part of her.&amp;quot; I wanted to argue but Klaire bump in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You have no idea what you are saying Eliot. That is the real me before you all appear in that facility. You have no idea how it felt to be afraid of your own self, after we left the facility everyday I can feel the power inside me growing. Like a ticking time bomb that will explode anytime and what made me afraid more is that I will end up hurting all of you. But then everything happened one day. I was not able to control this thirst to kill and ended up killing everyone. Do you know how hard is that to accept? That everyone died with my own hands. And now that I have the answer to everything I wouldn&#39;t let you all to stop me.&amp;quot; Her words were firm. I couldn&#39;t stop myself to smile. The Klaire we know was still there, she still cares.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;So what are your plans now?&amp;quot; Clint uttered, Klaire sat down again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I need my blood back.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled Clint&#39;s hand, I still can&#39;t believe him. He agreed to everything they said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What the hell is wrong with you? You know that giving her blood back will wake her Lycan completely.&amp;quot; Yustef also cannot contain his anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you really going to let Klaire turn into that Lycan?&amp;quot; Clint shove our hands and let out a heavy sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We all know that everything we are now belongs to her and she have the right to take it back. You would not understand.&amp;quot; This made me mad, I punch Clint&#39;s face. Making him stumbled on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;All this time we are trying to stop anyone who tried to awaken the Lycans and now you will just going to let them turn your sister into that monster?!&amp;quot; Clint wipe away the blood in his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You have no idea what you are saying. I saw Klaire turn into one before!&amp;quot; This made us all stop. He saw Klaire turn? Into what?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What do you mean?&amp;quot; I was lost in words right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Remember the time she always come back with blood all over her body? It always happens during the full moon. One time I saw her walking down the mountain towards the forest at first I thought she was just sleep walking but then I saw it with my own two eyes. Amara turned into that thing. I wasn&#39;t able to move that time and she saw me, I thought that would be the end of me but she just ignored me and killed the werewolves who are following us. I ran back as fast as I can before she even notice me again. That was the first time I saw that thing. The cold death in her eyes as she stares at me made my whole body trembled. The next day I acted like nothing happened and notice that Amara had no idea what happened to her last night.&amp;quot; I cannot find my words to utter anything after hearing what he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Why didn&#39;t you say anything to us?&amp;quot; He brush his hair out of frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I can&#39;t, because I myself didn&#39;t believe what I just saw that time.&amp;quot; He mumbled then grab a glass of water on the table and gulp it with one shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;So that is the reason why you want to return everything to her?&amp;quot; Noah ask, he glance at him and shake his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Now is the time for you to tell us everything you know Clint. Because as you can see we are all affected with this matter with Klaire.&amp;quot; Yustef uttered, he was right with that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Kariz was aware of this matter. I don&#39;t know how he knows it but like he said it was the only way for Klaire to get back in control. If she had her full abilities back then she would be able to control herself during her shift.&amp;quot; He explains. I still doubt what Kariz was saying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know if this is a good idea. And there is also Dwayne, we won&#39;t be able to return everything to Klaire because Dwayne was also part of her. He also received her blood before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;How can you be so sure about that?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clint let out another deep breath and look hesitant at first. Before letting out the news that made our world upside down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Because Kariz was a Lycan.&amp;quot;</p>
