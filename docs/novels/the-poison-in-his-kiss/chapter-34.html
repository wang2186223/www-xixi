                <p>But while I have accepted it, my hatred has only deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I flipped through the photos Simon had taken, showing Brandon holding the child twice, while Elora and Brandon&#39;s mom, Karen, held the child most of the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s laughable that Brandon chose to send my son Brett to boarding school because he was too lazy to take care of him, yet he treats the two children so differently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sneered, &#34;Brandon, if you can&#39;t even pretend to be a good father, then you have no place in my children&#39;s lives.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon put away the documents. I couldn&#39;t take those things back with me, as it wasn&#39;t safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the two of them and continued, &#34;It seems that since Elora can give Brandon a child, he is quite satisfied with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon nodded, &#34;That&#39;s right. Before Elora returned from abroad, Brandon had many women around him, never the same one twice. But once Elora appeared, there was no one else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He probably plans to get rid of you and then elevate Elora to the position of Mrs. Jordan. And that woman named Shirley is just a tool Brandon can discard at any time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I agreed. Back then, I stepped back and arranged for Brandon to join the company, and my most capable subordinate at the time was Elora.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was worried that the company&#39;s old employees wouldn&#39;t accept Brandon, so I arranged for her to help him with his performance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew almost all the core information, data, and secrets of my company at that time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This led to Brandon later clearing out the old employees and smoothly bringing in the Jordan family members, all thanks to Elora&#39;s help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afterward, Elora naturally got together with Brandon, and with his help, they successfully sidelined me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora then left the company to avoid suspicion, but in reality, she went abroad to have a baby and returned afterward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wonder if Shirley knows she could be discarded by Brandon at any moment. She might still be dreaming of becoming Brandon&#39;s wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Speaking of Shirley, I suddenly remembered, &#34;Simon, do you know someone named James around Shirley?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon thought for a moment, &#34;You must be talking about Shirley&#39;s first love when she was a waitress. After she got together with Brandon, James came to this city, likely arranged by Shirley.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, &#34;It seems James is taking money from Shirley to do things for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I overheard her talking to James yesterday, asking him to investigate Elora. Maybe we can use this opportunity to let Shirley know about Elora and her child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon immediately understood my intention, &#34;Leave it to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thanked him. It was already noon, and I was worried Shirley might wake up early, so I prepared to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon cautiously checked outside the room, and then we went our separate ways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having figured out their background, I felt a moment of relief, but it was quickly replaced by anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though I had Simon and Kathy helping me, my chances still seemed slim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon had deceived me for so many years, and I was always a step behind, but at least it&#39;s not too late to wake up now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got home, Shirley was still asleep on the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke her up, &#34;What&#39;s wrong with you these days? Why are you sleeping all the time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley was startled and quickly got up, &#34;I guess I haven&#39;t been sleeping well at night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She probably wasn&#39;t sleeping well because of Paula, who was a constant threat to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go make dinner, I&#39;m hungry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley nodded and went to the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched her back, thinking that if she found out about Elora, it would be an interesting drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I suddenly thought of a crucial point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I overheard Shirley and James talking, James said to Shirley before I left, &#34;He doesn&#39;t love you. He&#39;s just using you. Can&#39;t you see that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have to wait until he abandons you to be satisfied?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Shirley replied, &#34;Don&#39;t worry, he wouldn&#39;t dare. He should see what I have on him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was in a hurry to leave at the time and didn&#39;t pay much attention to this conversation. But now that I think about it, Shirley&#39;s confidence must come from having some leverage or secret about Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I could get hold of that secret, my chances might improve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it would be difficult to get it out of Shirley now. Only by pushing her to a desperate situation could I use this card.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dinner, I went to feed the children. They were sleeping soundly, unaware of what was happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although my body was slowly recovering, I was still very tired, so I couldn&#39;t help but fall asleep on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though this house was still dangerous, as long as the urban renewal funds for my old family home hadn&#39;t been released, Brandon wouldn&#39;t dare to touch me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So I slept peacefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I woke up, it was already evening. Shirley had finished cooking, and Brandon was sitting on the couch watching the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing me, he gave a gentle smile, &#34;You&#39;re awake? I saw you sleeping soundly, so I didn&#39;t want to disturb you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at his hypocritical face and said slowly, &#34;I just had a dream about someone. You&#39;d never guess who.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who?&#34; Brandon asked, feigning interest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I dreamed about Elora. I haven&#39;t seen her in a long time. What position does she hold in the company now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Brandon heard me mention Elora&#39;s name, the remote control fell to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked it up nonchalantly, but there was still a hint of evasion in his eyes, &#34;She resigned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elora resigned?&#34; I pretended not to know, &#34;Why? Elora is very capable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon cleared his throat, &#34;I heard she had a baby. Maybe she wants to focus on her family.&#34;</p>
