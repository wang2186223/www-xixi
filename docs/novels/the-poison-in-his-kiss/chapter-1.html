                <p>Trapped in a gilded cage of deception, Caroline discovers her &#34;loving&#34; husband’s cure is a slow-acting poison. With her body failing and children in danger, she feigns weakness to uncover his affair with the nanny and a plot to steal her fortune. Aided by a detective and her resilient cat, Caroline fights to reclaim her life—one antidote pill at a time. But as her enemies turn on each other, survival demands she become the actress of her own funeral. How far would you go to escape a killer who shares your bed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nala, you can&#39;t eat that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the medicine bowl was knocked over, my cat Nala suddenly jumped down from the windowsill and started licking the spilled medicine on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to stop her, but I was too weak and dizzy to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scolded her twice, but Nala ignored me, so I had to give up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The medicine was something my husband had gone to great lengths to find to help nourish my body. Although human medicine is different from cat medicine, a little bit shouldn&#39;t harm her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I struggled to pick up the bowl and put it back on the nightstand, then collapsed onto the pillow, panting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nala licked the floor clean and then jumped back onto the windowsill, basking in the sun and washing her face with her paws.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked longingly at the sunlight streaming through the glass window, imagining how warm it must be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since my health had deteriorated to the point where even standing up was difficult, I hadn&#39;t been out in the sun for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking about my health made me feel a bit down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since I gave birth to a pair of adorable boy-girl twins, my health had been getting worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, I was just dizzy, but then I became lethargic and weak, losing hair in clumps, and my spirits were getting worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, I barely had the strength to get out of bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately, I have a loving and caring husband, Brandon Jordan. After I frequently felt dizzy post-childbirth, he worried about my health and persuaded me to take a break from work and rest at home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He even gave up his beloved screenwriting career to help manage the company my parents left behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People who know us say I&#39;m incredibly lucky to have such a good husband like Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I also feel that way. With a loving husband like Brandon and three adorable and considerate children, I am what people often call a winner in life!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s just that my body is failing me, suddenly deteriorating. Even after visiting major hospitals, no one could find anything wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon has been running around trying to find ways to treat me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He even hired a nanny to take care of me, prepare my medicine, and remind me to take it on time, hoping I would get better soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I also want to get better soon, but...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Knock, knock, knock!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I was lost in thought, the nanny knocked and entered, &#34;Mrs. Jordan, did you take your medicine?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nanny Brandon found is named Shirley Ross, and she&#39;s only twenty-five years old.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley is very pretty, and although young, she&#39;s honest and diligent, taking great care of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m very satisfied with her and have praised her to Brandon multiple times, even asking him to give her two raises.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at Nala washing her face on the windowsill and didn&#39;t mention that the medicine had spilled and Nala had licked it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just nodded weakly, &#34;Yes, I took it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ve been taking this medicine since I started feeling dizzy three years ago, but it hasn&#39;t helped, and my health has only gotten worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly, it&#39;s good that it spilled!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want to take it anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley smiled with relief, &#34;It&#39;s good that you took it. Mr. Jordan insisted that you take your medicine on time every day.&#34; As she quickly cleaned up the medicine bowl, she sighed with envy, &#34;I&#39;ve been a nanny for a long time, and Mr. Jordan is the best husband I&#39;ve ever seen. Mrs. Jordan, you are truly blessed!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know I&#39;m blessed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only I could have a healthy body again!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed inwardly and looked at the bright sunlight outside, &#34;Shirley, I want to go out and get some sun.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, Mrs. Jordan.&#34; Shirley smiled, &#34;I&#39;ll take you out once I finish cleaning up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley left, and the room became quiet again. For some reason, the silence made me uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Meow!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp cat&#39;s cry startled me. I turned my head to see Nala falling from the windowsill and twitching on the carpet before going still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it weren&#39;t for her breathing, I would have thought she was dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But how could Nala fall from the windowsill?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cats have great balance, and Nala has always been healthy. Even if she fell, she shouldn&#39;t have been knocked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was a gift for my first child, and I&#39;ve always taken good care of her. There&#39;s no way she could have eaten something wrong or suddenly gotten sick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only thing she ate that she shouldn&#39;t have was...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I suddenly turned my head, staring at the faint medicine stain on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill ran down my spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hurriedly and weakly got out of bed, my legs trembling. I took one step and fell to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t dare cry out in pain, and I didn&#39;t know why, but I was afraid of alerting anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I struggled to crawl to Nala, carefully cradling her soft body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She seemed to be asleep, but how deeply must she be sleeping to not wake up no matter how I moved her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at her unconscious state, I couldn&#39;t help but imagine if I was the same after taking the medicine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unaware and at the mercy of others!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But how could that be?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This medicine was prescribed by a famous expert Brandon found after traveling thousands of miles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He loves me so much; how could he harm me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if not him, then who?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt like I was falling into an icy abyss, shivering with cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, I heard footsteps outside the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly crawled back to bed with Nala, pretending to be asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The footsteps stopped at the door, and I heard someone turning the doorknob. I tensed up, trembling slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened, and the person seemed to just glance inside before closing the door again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I heard faint voices in the hallway, &#34;She must keep taking the medicine. Make sure she takes it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voices faded, and I couldn&#39;t hear anything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened my eyes and stared at the pale ceiling, feeling like I had been pulled out of icy water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear made me tremble uncontrollably. What did Brandon mean by that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Is he really trying to harm me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our family is well-off. I&#39;m an only child, and my parents ran a construction company. When the real estate industry boomed, their company grew significantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But shortly after Brandon and I got married, my parents died in a car accident, and I inherited their company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When my health declined, I handed over the company&#39;s management to Brandon and focused on resting at home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he wanted to harm me, it would make sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, if I died, Brandon, as my husband, would legally inherit all my assets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But could it really be him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We&#39;ve been in love for five years and married for three.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In eight years, he&#39;s always treated me the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He surprises me on holidays and anniversaries, and if he&#39;s busy with work and neglects me, he buys me gifts to make up for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m not good at cooking, so he takes care of all the household chores, cooking, and taking care of the kids without complaint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got sick, he was more worried than anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took me to major hospitals for checkups and read various books to find ways to cure me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever he heard about a famous doctor, he would book a flight and take me to see them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even my friends say Brandon treats me like a daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sometimes, he even prioritizes me over our daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He says our daughter will grow up and leave home, eventually getting married.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I am the only one who will walk with him through life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one can replace me in his heart!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could someone who loves me so deeply really harm me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If someone wanted to harm another, could they really treat them like a treasure for ten years?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t believe it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because if it&#39;s true, then he&#39;s truly terrifying!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if it&#39;s not him, then who?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides Brandon and the kids, there&#39;s only the nanny, Shirley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Shirley is honest and has no reason to harm me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Other families might worry about a young, pretty nanny getting involved with the husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Shirley knows her boundaries and rarely appears when Brandon is home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when Brandon is home, he&#39;s always with me, so they have no time to be alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon can&#39;t be the one, and Shirley has no motive. So who could be trying to harm me?</p>
