                <p>I looked into Paula&#39;s eyes, and the way she looked at Shirley was devoid of any sympathy, as if she were looking at a dead object.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I began to wonder what could have happened between these two sisters to make Paula hate Shirley so much.</p>

                <p>&#34;Stop kowtowing. Do you think I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re trying to do? You just want to get injured in our house so you can stay here openly.&#34;</p>

                <p>Shirley looked to Brandon for help, but he just looked down, pretending not to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger flared in Shirley&#39;s eyes, and she gritted her teeth. &#34;Mrs. Jordan, it wasn&#39;t my intention to follow you. It was because...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could finish, Brandon stepped forward and kicked Shirley, sending her sprawling on the floor, clutching her chest and coughing miserably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You still dare to make excuses? Are you going to say I ordered you to do it? It seems you really want to sow discord between us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Brandon, his usually refined face now filled with anger as he glared at Shirley. &#34;You really have some nerve.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew Brandon was just worried that Shirley would reveal the truth, so he had no choice but to act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley seemed to come to her senses after Brandon&#39;s kick. She lowered her head and knelt again, saying to me, &#34;Mrs. Jordan, as long as you let me stay, I&#39;ll do anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said nothing, and Brandon, still glaring at her and breathing heavily, finally looked at me and said, &#34;Caroline, although Shirley was wrong this time, she has done good work before. She took good care of the kids, didn&#39;t she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon tried to use the kids to persuade me, not realizing that mentioning them only made me angrier. How dare he bring up the kids?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You dare to mention that? I saw Shirley badmouthing me to the kids, making them afraid to get close to me so they would only recognize her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as I said this, guilt filled Shirley&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon glared at Shirley, as if blaming her for ruining his plans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe you misheard? The kids were just unfamiliar with you because you were sick before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sneered, &#34;Are you trying to cover for Shirley? Are you trying to get rid of me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon shook his head repeatedly, speaking to me in a gentle tone, &#34;No, Caroline, I just think this might be a misunderstanding. Maybe you misunderstood?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood up and looked at Brandon. &#34;If you think it&#39;s a misunderstanding, the kids can talk now. Why don&#39;t we ask them and see what they say? Let&#39;s see if you still think it&#39;s a misunderstanding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon was speechless. He knew that Shirley was likely to have done such things, and if the kids confirmed it, there would be no way to cover it up, and she would have to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Brandon, my eyes filled with anger. &#34;You don&#39;t care about me or the kids. You think it&#39;s fine for her to follow me and badmouth me to the kids. If nothing matters to you, then let&#39;s get a divorce. There&#39;s no point in us being together anymore!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My words were heavy, and Brandon immediately understood my meaning. He quickly said, &#34;No, Caroline, I didn&#39;t mean that. I just thought we were all used to Shirley. I didn&#39;t know what she did. If that&#39;s the case, then let her go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon glanced at Shirley, who started to tremble, as his look was particularly cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Shirley and gave her an ultimatum. &#34;Tonight is your last night here. You have to move out first thing in the morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this moment, Paula came downstairs, pretending to be innocent. &#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Shirley. &#34;Shirley tried to sow discord between us, so she&#39;s no longer our nanny. You should leave too. With Shirley gone, it&#39;s not appropriate for you to stay either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paula was stunned, not expecting the situation to affect her. Just as she was about to explain, Brandon impatiently waved his hand. &#34;You leave with Shirley. I don&#39;t want to see either of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paula bit her lip, looking at us with resentment, but ultimately went upstairs to pack her things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I went upstairs to my room, I heard the sound of Brandon slapping Shirley. It was a clear, crisp sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I wasn&#39;t mistaken, Brandon must have been furious with Shirley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, the person he had trusted had made a mistake and was now useless. He would have to find someone new and start over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most importantly, he couldn&#39;t continue to have someone follow me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So Brandon could only take his anger out on Shirley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quietly opened a crack in the door and saw that no one was downstairs. Brandon had clearly taken Shirley away to punish her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, my door suddenly opened, and I broke out in a cold sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought Brandon had caught me eavesdropping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to my surprise, it was Paula who came in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Jordan, it&#39;s me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Paula warily. She was just like Shirley, and who knew what she might do? It was better to be cautious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said, &#34;Mrs. Jordan, you don&#39;t need to be on guard. I&#39;m not here to harm you. I&#39;m here to help you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, I didn&#39;t believe her. &#34;Say what you need to say. I don&#39;t need any help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I slept with Mr. Jordan, and so did Shirley.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paula said this without any hesitation, catching me off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I showed no expression and looked at her. &#34;Do you think I&#39;ll believe you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a deep breath. &#34;Mr. Jordan has another wife outside, named Elora, and you know their child, Jason.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve mentioned before that Elora&#39;s husband is also named Jordan and is also in the construction business. And you&#39;ve never met her husband. How could it be such a coincidence?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at me earnestly and asked, &#34;Have you never suspected?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said nothing, letting her continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paula glanced outside, making sure Brandon and Shirley hadn&#39;t come up, then took my hand. &#34;I&#39;m willing to be Mrs. Jordan&#39;s weapon and help you with anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at her, unable to discern her true intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said, &#34;As long as I can get rid of Shirley, I&#39;ll do anything.&#34;</p>
