                <p>The next morning, Brandon left early, but I noticed Paula didn&#39;t go with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So I concluded that Brandon was off doing his own thing and not going to the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Paula left for work, I stopped her: &#34;Can you drive?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paula looked a bit surprised but nodded: &#34;I learned in college, but I&#39;m not very good at it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded: &#34;There&#39;s a car in my garage. You can drive me to the office.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley, who was clearing away the breakfast dishes, immediately became alert: &#34;Mrs. Jordan, Mr. Jordan doesn&#39;t want you to go out. Your current health...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sneered: &#34;What do you mean he doesn&#39;t want me to go out? Is Brandon trying to confine me? Call him right now, and I&#39;ll ask him myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley realized she had misspoken and immediately fell silent: &#34;I was wrong, Mrs. Jordan. Mr. Jordan is just worried about you. You&#39;re not fully recovered yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t be bothered to listen to her nonsense any longer and pulled Paula outside: &#34;Since Brandon isn&#39;t confining me, you should mind your own business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paula looked back at Shirley and said, &#34;Exactly, Shirley. I think Mrs. Jordan&#39;s health has improved a lot recently. It&#39;s fine for her to go out for a walk. You&#39;re too nervous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley could only stomp her foot and go back to call Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Brandon was wearing casual clothes this morning, probably going somewhere far, so he wouldn&#39;t be at the office anytime soon. I just needed to take this opportunity to check out the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paula&#39;s driving skills were average. A half-hour drive to the office took her a full hour, and she gave me an apologetic smile when we got out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, Mrs. Jordan. I&#39;ve never driven such an expensive car before, so I was a bit slow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled slowly: &#34;It&#39;s okay. You look quite attractive. Maybe Brandon can introduce you to a man, and then you can drive such cars often.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paula didn&#39;t know that these cars were bought with the money I earned before. She just thought I was Brandon&#39;s sickly wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was instilling this hope in her so that Paula would take action sooner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, who doesn&#39;t like luxury cars?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got out of the car, and before entering the office, Paula said she was going to the locker room to change into her work uniform and told me to go in by myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and looked at the familiar office entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since I had my child, I rarely set foot here. It seemed to have become Brandon&#39;s domain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My busy days in this building seemed to have gradually faded from memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head, dispelling the negative emotions, and entered through the main door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reception area looked the same as before, but the people had completely changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned at the sight of the beautiful and self-aware receptionists. They all seemed to be Brandon&#39;s type.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I walked in, I was stopped by the receptionist, who looked me up and down with disdain: &#34;Who are you looking for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned slightly. Her tone made me very uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m looking for Asher Wheeler.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I casually mentioned the name of a former subordinate, but the receptionist&#39;s eyes widened: &#34;Never heard of him. Get out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was stunned, unable to believe that the company&#39;s receptionist had such an attitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The receptionist looked at me and said, &#34;There&#39;s no such person. Are you here to cause trouble? Get out! We don&#39;t take in vagrants.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at my outfit, which didn&#39;t have a single brand name, but it was custom-made for comfort. Plus, I had put on makeup to look haggard, so I didn&#39;t look very presentable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that wasn&#39;t a reason for her to treat me this way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if I were a client?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean? Is this your work attitude? What&#39;s your name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The receptionist rolled her eyes: &#34;What, are you going to complain about me? So what if I tell you? My name is Claire Fairfax. Go ahead and complain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Work attitude is for clients, not for vagrants like you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at how shabby you are dressed. How dare you come into our company? How shameless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words completely angered me. I looked at Claire and sneered: &#34;Do you know who I am? How dare you talk to me like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop threatening me. Are you some kind of leader? I&#39;m telling you, as long as I&#39;m here, you won&#39;t get in. Get out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With the way you look, if you go in and other clients see you, they&#39;ll think our company is going bankrupt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claire rolled her eyes and took out a small mirror to touch up her makeup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sneered and stood in the lobby, waiting for Paula to return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I never thought there would come a day when I would be stopped from entering my own company. It was utterly ridiculous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this also indirectly showed that the company might have undergone a complete overhaul. After all, when I mentioned Asher&#39;s name, she acted like she had never heard of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher was my CFO back in the day. Everyone in the company knew him. If he were still here, Claire wouldn&#39;t have reacted that way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This only strengthened my resolve to go inside and take a look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claire saw me standing in the lobby: &#34;Are you done yet? Get out! You&#39;re affecting our company&#39;s image, you know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What era are you living in, still wearing such clothes? It&#39;s so ugly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t say anything and waited quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claire got angry when she saw I wasn&#39;t leaving: &#34;Are you going to leave, or do I need to call security to escort you out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Paula&#39;s voice rang out: &#34;Mrs. Jordan, why haven&#39;t you gone in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paula had changed into her uniform and was surprised to see me still in the lobby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claire didn&#39;t know me, but she knew Paula. After all, Brandon had been bringing Paula to work every day recently, so it was hard for the company not to know her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Ross.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claire greeted her with a smile: &#34;Didn&#39;t you come with Mr. Jordan today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at her face and thought, her change in attitude was really fast. It&#39;s a pity she didn&#39;t go into acting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paula shook her head at Claire and walked up to me: &#34;Mrs. Jordan, were you waiting for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pointed at Claire: &#34;This lady wouldn&#39;t let me in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Jordan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which Mrs. Jordan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claire&#39;s face turned pale. She knew what the name Jordan meant in this company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paula replied impatiently: &#34;Mr. Jordan&#39;s wife, who else? You don&#39;t even recognize Mrs. Jordan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claire looked at me, shaking her head repeatedly, her lips pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Mrs. Jordan, I really didn&#39;t know. Please forgive me. If I had known, I wouldn&#39;t have stopped you. Mrs. Jordan, you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sneered: &#34;Didn&#39;t you say your work attitude is for clients? Then keep that attitude and find a new job.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, I walked straight in without looking at her; Claire collapsed to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the elevator, Paula led me to Brandon&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought I rarely came here, not knowing that this was where I once fought hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the familiar place, but it didn&#39;t evoke any memories, only a sense of unfamiliarity.</p>
