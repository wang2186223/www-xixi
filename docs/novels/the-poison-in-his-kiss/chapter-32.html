                <p>The next day, after Brandon and Paula went to work, Shirley indeed asked for leave and went out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I readily agreed, but as soon as she left, I immediately followed her in my car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I arrived at Savory Bites ahead of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw Shirley go inside from my car, and I quickly followed her in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately, each table here had partitions, so Shirley couldn&#39;t see me, but I could still hear her talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person she was waiting for hadn&#39;t arrived yet. I ordered food for a while before I heard someone arrive late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bertha, I&#39;m here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley&#39;s voice was full of impatience: &#34;I told you not to call me Bertha, I go by Shirley now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>James&#39;s voice was rough, and he waved his hand casually: &#34;You can call yourself whatever you want, I&#39;m just used to calling you Bertha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley clicked her tongue and finally stopped correcting him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I asked you, did you find out who that woman was yesterday?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I realized they were talking about Elora. It seemed that Shirley&#39;s well-informed nature had something to do with this James.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That kind of thing isn&#39;t so easy. Brandon really is lucky, the women around him are more beautiful one after another.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you chasing after him? For money?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s better than you. All you do is drink all day. If I don&#39;t go after him, should I go after you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was stunned. It seemed their relationship wasn&#39;t simple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>James laughed: &#34;What&#39;s wrong with me? Haven&#39;t I ever satisfied you? Don&#39;t pretend you don&#39;t know me after putting your pants back on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the way, when do you have time? Let&#39;s see if Brandon is better or if I am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get lost. You&#39;re not even as good as Brandon&#39;s toe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley snorted coldly, her tone full of disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck, tell me clearly, how am I not as good as him? He looks useless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>James slammed the table and stood up angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough, you&#39;re embarrassing. I have serious business to discuss with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seemingly aware of the attention from people around, Shirley said impatiently: &#34;Hurry up and find out about that person for me. Also, I&#39;ll find a way to get Paula out of here, and you use some means to get her to another city, got it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shirley, you&#39;re really ruthless, not even sparing Paula.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley sneered: &#34;If she dares to compete with me for Brandon, she has to be prepared for this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Also, find out about that woman as soon as possible. I&#39;ll transfer the money to you later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Shirley get up, I sneaked out from the other side and drove home first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, Shirley came back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stayed in her room for a while, then stood in front of me: &#34;Mrs. Jordan, I have something to tell you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at her and nodded: &#34;Go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Paula staying at home for so long makes me feel embarrassed, especially since you even arranged a job for her. So, I&#39;ve decided to have Paula move out. I really feel bad about taking the salary you give me every month.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at her, thinking about what she had said to James earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feared that once Paula moved out, she wouldn&#39;t come back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Paula is quite lovely. Brandon and I... both like her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I emphasized the last sentence. My words were casual, but Shirley&#39;s eyes filled with jealousy: &#34;That&#39;s not a reason for us to stay. Paula must move out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her insistence, I pretended to be helpless and nodded: &#34;Alright, we&#39;ll do as you say. But Paula can move back anytime. I&#39;m home all day and chatting with Paula is a good way to pass the time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley nodded and left after seeing me agree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched Shirley&#39;s back, thinking of Paula, who was very similar to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paula might look youthful on the surface, but she was no ordinary character. How could she leave so easily?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was really hard to tell who would come out on top between Shirley and Paula.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the evening, when Brandon and Paula came back from work, Shirley brought up the matter at the dinner table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Jordan, I&#39;ve found a place for Paula. She should move out in the next few days. I really feel bad about her continuing to stay here and bothering you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon didn&#39;t feel bothered at all. After all, he was the beneficiary, and Paula was now the closest to him, so he naturally didn&#39;t want her to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Shirley&#39;s reason was legitimate, and he couldn&#39;t refute it, so he looked at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caroline, what do you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged: &#34;This is Shirley&#39;s opinion. We haven&#39;t asked Paula what she thinks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was ultimately a drama between the sisters. I threw the question back to see how they would handle it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paula bit her lip, her eyes brimming with tears, looking pitifully at Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paula&#39;s fragile appearance was hard for anyone to resist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure enough, Brandon&#39;s eyes began to cloud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know it&#39;s not good to bother Mr. and Mrs. Jordan, but I really can&#39;t bear to be apart from Shirley. How about I move out with Shirley so I can be close to her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Paula is trying to create a lose-lose situation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon couldn&#39;t agree to Shirley moving out. There would be no one to monitor me then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley didn&#39;t expect Paula to pull this trick, dragging her into it. She glared at Paula fiercely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Brandon: &#34;Brandon, they are sisters. Why not let them stay? Our family can afford to feed one more person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon was eager for me to express my opinion first, so he immediately nodded: &#34;Alright, let&#39;s do that. Shirley, don&#39;t worry about anything else. Let Paula stay, and we&#39;ll discuss other things later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon waved his hand, making the decision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley wanted to say something but couldn&#39;t, so she could only glare at Paula in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Shirley couldn&#39;t get rid of Paula, she might resort to other means. There would probably be a good show tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, I heard some noise upstairs. Peeking through the door crack, I saw Shirley, dressed scantily, heading to Brandon&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Brandon had been busy with Paula and Elora lately and probably hadn&#39;t touched Shirley for a long time. She must have been anxious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But honestly, with Elora&#39;s beauty and Paula&#39;s purity, Shirley really couldn&#39;t compare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure enough, it wasn&#39;t long before Shirley was thrown out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood at the door for a long time before walking away silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she went downstairs, she saw Paula coming up, her tone full of mockery: &#34;You got kicked out? But Brandon asked me to come to his room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the dark, Shirley glared at her for a long time before gritting her teeth: &#34;Don&#39;t be smug. Brandon is just after your youth and beauty, it&#39;s just a novelty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paula pouted: &#34;Shirley, don&#39;t forget, you don&#39;t even have youth and beauty anymore!&#34;</p>
