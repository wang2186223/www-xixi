                <p>The howls still echoed, stretching into the night, reverberating through the ruins, through the broken stones and the shattered past. They did not fade. They did not waver. They rose higher, deeper, vibrating in the very bones of the earth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley stood at the center of it all, her breath slow, her pulse steady, as the fire in her veins matched the rhythm of something ancient waking inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had expected fear.</p>

                <p>But what filled her now was certainty, fire-forged and unbreakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wolves both the living and the dead, waited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Golden eyes locked onto her, unwavering, full of something she had never had before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loyalty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not the kind that was forced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not the kind built from fear or blind devotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was something earned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ghosts of the past had not bowed for centuries, yet they had bowed for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pack that had once followed Tobias without question had not hesitated to follow her instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, she has an army.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not just of wolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of warriors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of those who had been erased, forgotten, cast aside by those who had rewritten the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But no more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This war was theirs now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena let out a sharp breath, shifting on her feet as she took in the massive ghostly wolves surrounding them. &#34;So, just to make sure I&#39;m not hallucinating, are we fighting alongside actual dead wolves now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley&#39;s lips curled, slow and knowing. &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena grinned. &#34;God, I love this war.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran, however, was still watching Riley. Not in shock. Not in doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because he had felt it too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something had shifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And there was no turning back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was calm, steady. &#34;We need to move. You know they felt that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley nodded. She did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Far beyond these ruins, they were listening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ones who had buried her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ones who had erased this kingdom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ones who still thought they could stop what was coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wind stirred, carrying embers from her fingertips, the fire curling around her like an extension of herself. She wasn&#39;t just standing in the ruins anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was rebuilding them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One step at a time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One battle at a time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she would not stop until every last one of them burned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to the wolves, her wolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We march at dawn,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the howls answered her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was not just a sound. It was a promise. A declaration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night itself seemed to pulse in response, the wind carrying their voices far beyond the ruins, spreading across the land like a ripple in a still lake. But this was not stillness. This was war waking up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley felt it in her bones, in the way the ground seemed more solid beneath her feet, no longer just a forgotten battlefield but hers again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pack didn&#39;t hesitate. They stood taller, their golden eyes alight with something sharp and unyielding. They had spent their lives fighting someone else&#39;s war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, they would fight for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena sheathed her daggers with a sharp grin. &#34;Dawn, huh? Not even giving them time to sleep off the fear?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley smirked, her fire burning brighter. &#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena chuckled, shaking her head. &#34;You&#39;re my favorite person in this war.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran, however, was still watching her, unreadable, golden eyes flickering like he saw something no one else did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not just a leader.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not just a warrior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re not just marching,&#34; he said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley met his gaze, understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; she agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They weren&#39;t just moving forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were taking back what had been stolen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One step at a time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One city at a time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until nothing remained of the ones who had tried to erase them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her chin, turning to the ruins one last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This place had remembered her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And soon</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The world would, too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But not just her name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not just the whispers of a past they had tried to bury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They would remember the fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They would remember what it meant to fear her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ones who had rewritten history, who had shaped the world to their liking, who had decided which stories lived and which were forgotten</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their time was ending.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because Riley was not just here to reclaim what was stolen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was here to tear down everything they had built.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to face her wolves, her army, her people, the ones who had chosen her before she had even chosen herself. The golden light of the ghostly warriors shimmered in the night, standing alongside the living, a force that should not exist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, they did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because time had not killed them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because history had failed to erase them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because they had never truly left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their loyalty was not bound by life or death. It was bound to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran stepped closer, his golden eyes never leaving hers. He didn&#39;t say a word, but she knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He saw it now, too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This war was not just for the present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a war to reclaim the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A war to shape the future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena exhaled, tilting her head at Riley. &#34;You know, I&#39;ve followed a lot of bad ideas before, but this one? This is the first time I believe we can win.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley smirked, the fire in her veins thrumming. &#34;That&#39;s because we already have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena grinned. &#34;I really do love you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pack shifted, waiting, ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no more hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No more doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They would walk into battle with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They would set the world on fire if she asked them to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because she wasn&#39;t just their leader anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was their vengeance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when dawn came their enemies realized what had awakened in these ruins</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would already be too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too late to stop her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too late to silence the ghosts that had risen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too late to change the course of history they had spent centuries rewriting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because this time, the story was no longer theirs to control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley had taken it back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she would burn the old world to the ground before she let them steal it again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ruins seemed to breathe with her, the energy thrumming beneath her skin no longer foreign, no longer unfamiliar. It was hers, as it had always been. As it had been meant to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned her gaze toward the horizon, where the sky was still cloaked in night, but the faintest sliver of light had begun to rise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dawn was coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with it, war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran stood beside her, his stance steady, his golden eyes dark with understanding. &#34;They&#39;ll know we&#39;re coming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley didn&#39;t blink. &#34;Good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena smirked, twirling a dagger between her fingers. &#34;If they&#39;re smart, they&#39;ll run.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They won&#39;t,&#34; Riley said, her voice sharp as steel, her fire flaring brighter between her fingertips. &#34;They&#39;ve spent too long believing they&#39;ve already won. That they&#39;ve already erased us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her chin, the weight of this moment settling deep into her bones, solid and unshakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let them think they&#39;re safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wind howled through the ruins, stirring the dust, the embers, the echoes of a kingdom that refused to stay buried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because they weren&#39;t just reclaiming a throne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were bringing an empire back from the dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wolves both the living and the ones lost to time, stood in perfect silence, waiting for her command.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a slow step forward, standing at the edge of everything that had been stolen from her, her voice carrying through the night like the first note of a song that had been centuries in the making.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We march at dawn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A final, thunderous howl split the sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the world at last began to remember.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not in whispers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not in the twisted, rewritten stories their enemies had crafted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But on fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the echoes of the past clawing its way back into existence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the way the very earth trembled beneath their feet, no longer a graveyard of forgotten names, but a battlefield waiting for war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The howl that split the sky was not just a sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a reckoning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A signal that the forgotten ones had risen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That the queen they had erased was coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And this time, she would not fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley stood at the head of it all, unshaken, unafraid, unstoppable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had walked through the fire of their lies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had bled for their betrayals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been hunted, broken, and buried beneath history itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, she was still here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More than that</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The past no longer haunted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It belonged to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the future?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That would be written in their ashes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wolves behind her moved as one, waiting, watching, golden eyes burning with the same unrelenting hunger that pulsed beneath her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For centuries, their kind had followed orders from those who had stolen the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For centuries, they had bowed to a power that was not real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That ended now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because she was the power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was the fire, the storm, the unbroken force that would tear through everything that stood in her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dawn was approaching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when the sun rose</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would rise on a world that finally remembered her name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not just as a whisper in the dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not just as a ghost of a queen long forgotten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as a force that could not be stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the fire that could not be extinguished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the reckoning that had come for those who thought themselves gods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air around her pulsed, thick with energy, with the weight of something far greater than this single moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because this was not just a battle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was not just vengeance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the return of everything they had stolen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley lifted her chin, the fire beneath her skin thrumming louder, hotter, as the wolves behind her both the living and the dead stood in perfect, waiting for silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could feel it the moment before the storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The breath before the strike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant before the world split apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had spent their lives following orders given by those who had chained them to a lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, they followed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not because they had been forced to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not because they had no choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But because she was the truth they had been denied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when the world saw her coming</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would bow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or it would burn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The choice had never been theirs to make.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not when they had rewritten history with blood-stained hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not when they had stolen her throne, buried her name, and chained the wolves to a false king.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had spent centuries believing they had won.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That their version of the past was the only one that mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That the fire had been extinguished forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because Riley was no longer just a girl fighting to survive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was the war they never saw coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wind howled around her, carrying the scent of fire and ruin, the echoes of the past folding into the present, stretching toward the future she would carve from their ashes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind her, the pack waited, silent and still, their golden eyes locked onto her, unwavering. They had been soldiers in someone else&#39;s war for too long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, they were hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when she moved, they would move with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She exhaled slowly, the embers in her hands flickering brighter, stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They would not stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not until every chain had been broken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not until every name that had been erased was spoken again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not until the ones who had stolen everything from them had been torn apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first rays of dawn began to crest over the ruins, the golden light stretching across the broken stone, over the wolves who stood waiting, over the throne she had reclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley turned toward the horizon, toward the path ahead, toward the war that had already begun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And as the fire in her veins roared to life, she whispered the last promise she would ever make to her enemies</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Run.&#34;</p>
