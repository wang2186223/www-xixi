                <p>Riley&#39;s breath came in sharp, ragged bursts as she lunged again, muscles burning, sweat slicking her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran dodged her strike with infuriating ease, stepping just out of reach. &#34;Too slow,&#34; he taunted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley growled and spun, aiming a kick toward his ribs. He blocked it, his forearm bracing against her shin before shoving her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She staggered but caught herself before she could hit the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Again,&#34; Kieran said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley clenched her jaw. Her body hurt. They had been at this for hours, and every inch of her screamed for rest. But she didn&#39;t stop. She couldn&#39;t stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not when she knew what was at stake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She adjusted her stance, watching the way Kieran moved. His muscles tensed slightly, anticipating her next attack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She feinted left, then shifted her weight at the last second, aiming a strike to his ribs. This time, she was faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hit him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran grunted as her fist connected. He barely moved, but she saw the flicker of surprise in his golden eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she was on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gasped as Kieran swept her legs out from under her in one swift motion, pinning her before she could react. His body was warm and solid, his weight pressing her against the damp earth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t get cocky,&#34; he murmured, golden eyes locked on hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley&#39;s heart pounded, her breath coming fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And suddenly, she was aware of everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The heat of his body. The way his chest rose and fell against hers. The sharp angle of his jaw, the way his lips parted slightly as he breathed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her skin burned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran must have realized it at the same moment because his expression shifted his amusement fading into something else. Something dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley swallowed hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran did not move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes flickered down to her lips, just for a second, before snapping back up to hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something cracked between them, something too sharp, too intense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley&#39;s throat went dry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kieran,&#34; she whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tensed, his grip tightening slightly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then a voice shattered the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, this is interesting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley flinched. Kieran jerked away from her so fast it was like he had been burned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Callum stood at the edge of the clearing, smirking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley&#39;s blood ran cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran was already moving, stepping in front of her before she could react. His entire body radiated tension, muscles coiled tight like he was ready to tear into Callum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Callum only tilted his head, his golden eyes glinting with amusement. &#34;What&#39;s wrong, Wolfe? Didn&#39;t mean to get caught?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley scrambled to her feet, her pulse hammering. &#34;What the hell do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Callum&#39;s smirk widened. &#34;What, no &#39;thank you&#39; for interrupting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Callum laughed. &#34;Relax, lover boy. I&#39;m not here to fight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley&#39;s stomach twisted. Callum was never just there to talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran must have known it too, because his voice was low, dangerous. &#34;Then why are you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Callum&#39;s gaze flicked to Riley, his expression shifting. &#34;Because she doesn&#39;t have much time left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley stiffened. &#34;What does that mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Callum&#39;s smirk faded. For once, there was something serious in his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You feel it, don&#39;t you?&#34; he said, voice softer now. &#34;The fire under your skin. The hunger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley&#39;s hands curled into fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had felt it for days now the way her body ached for something she couldn&#39;t name, the way her instincts were sharper, wilder, harder to control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Callum took a slow step forward, ignoring Kieran&#39;s warning snarl. &#34;You&#39;re changing, Riley. And if you don&#39;t learn to control it soon&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tilted his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well. Let&#39;s just say you won&#39;t like what happens next.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley&#39;s breath caught in her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want to listen to him. She didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But something deep inside her whispered that he was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something inside her was breaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Callum watched her carefully, then sighed. &#34;Tell me, Wolfe, how long were you planning on hiding this from her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran&#39;s entire body tensed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley frowned. &#34;Hiding what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Callum&#39;s smirk returned, slow and knowing. &#34;Oh, he didn&#39;t tell you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley&#39;s stomach churned. &#34;Tell me what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran didn&#39;t answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Callum chuckled, shaking his head. &#34;You really should have told her, Wolfe. Before she figured it out the hard way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley turned to Kieran, her pulse hammering. &#34;Kieran,&#34; she said slowly, &#34;what is he talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran&#39;s jaw clenched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Callum exhaled dramatically. &#34;Fine. I&#39;ll do it myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he turned to Riley, his golden eyes gleaming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not just changing,&#34; he said, voice laced with something almost gentle. &#34;You&#39;re running out of time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley felt the ground tilt beneath her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; she whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Callum stepped closer, his gaze steady. &#34;You&#39;re not just turning into something, Riley. You&#39;re losing yourself. And if you don&#39;t get a grip on it soon&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smirk was gone now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;you won&#39;t be you anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold shiver crawled up Riley&#39;s spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; she breathed. &#34;That&#39;s not&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Callum lifted a brow. &#34;You think it&#39;s a coincidence your claws came out without warning? That your senses are sharper than they should be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breath hitched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Callum&#39;s voice softened. &#34;You&#39;re changing faster than you&#39;re supposed to. And if it keeps going like this&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley took a shaky step back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Kieran. &#34;Tell me he&#39;s lying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran&#39;s golden eyes met hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And for the first time</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not for himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her stomach dropped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my God,&#34; she whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran exhaled slowly. &#34;Riley&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You knew,&#34; she choked out. &#34;You knew, and you didn&#39;t tell me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran stepped toward her, but she backed away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was going to tell you,&#34; he said, voice tight. &#34;I just&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When?&#34; Riley snapped. &#34;When it was too late?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran&#39;s jaw clenched, but he didn&#39;t deny it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That silence shattered something inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head, something hot and wild curling beneath her skin. &#34;I trusted you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran&#39;s expression was pained. &#34;I was trying to protect you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley let out a bitter laugh. &#34;By lying to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t want you to be afraid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am afraid,&#34; Riley snapped, her voice sharp. &#34;Not because of what&#39;s happening to me because you hid it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran exhaled, but there was nothing he could say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because he had hidden it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, Riley didn&#39;t know if she could ever trust him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned back to Callum, her heartbeat wild.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do I have to do?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran went rigid. &#34;Riley, don&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Callum smirked, his golden eyes gleaming. &#34;Smart girl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley ignored Kieran&#39;s warning glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because right now, she didn&#39;t care about his secrets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t care about his excuses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She just wanted the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if it burned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran grabbed Riley&#39;s wrist before she could take another step toward Callum. His grip wasn&#39;t rough, but there was an urgency in his touch, a silent plea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t,&#34; he said, his voice low and raw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley yanked her arm free. &#34;Give me one reason why I should listen to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran&#39;s jaw tightened. &#34;Because he&#39;s manipulating you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Callum let out an exaggerated sigh. &#34;Oh, come on, Wolfe. I&#39;m just helping her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran turned on him, golden eyes flashing with fury. &#34;The hell you are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; Callum mused. &#34;Because I don&#39;t see you offering her answers. You knew she was losing herself, and yet you waited. What were you hoping for? That she&#39;d just magically figure it out before it was too late?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran&#39;s entire body tensed, but he didn&#39;t answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because Callum was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley&#39;s throat tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned back to Kieran, every muscle in her body taut. &#34;You had days to tell me. Days to explain what was happening. But instead, you let me train like it was just some normal fight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was trying to buy time,&#34; Kieran said, his voice strained. &#34;To find another way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Another way to do what?&#34; she snapped. &#34;Pretend this isn&#39;t happening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran ran a hand through his hair, frustration bleeding into his every movement. &#34;No. To stop it before it got worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley let out a bitter laugh. &#34;Well, congrats, Kieran. It&#39;s worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran flinched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time since she&#39;d met him, he looked like he didn&#39;t know what to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That hurt more than anything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Callum, of course, looked entirely too pleased with himself. &#34;Well,&#34; he said, clapping his hands together. &#34;Now that the lovers&#39; quarrel is over, are you ready to hear the real solution?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran&#39;s glare could have burned holes through him. &#34;If you so much as&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Save it,&#34; Callum interrupted, rolling his eyes. &#34;We all know Riley isn&#39;t listening to you right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned back to her, his expression shifting, softening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You feel it, don&#39;t you?&#34; he murmured. &#34;The fire in your blood. The way your instincts are taking over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because she did feel it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even now, she could feel the heat beneath her skin, the slow, curling hunger creeping up her spine. The wrongness she had tried so hard to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Callum&#39;s voice dropped to something almost gentle. &#34;I can teach you how to use it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran let out a low growl. &#34;Over my dead body.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Callum smirked. &#34;Tempting, Wolfe. But this isn&#39;t your choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned back to Riley, his golden eyes burning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s yours.&#34;</p>
