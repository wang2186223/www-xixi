                <p>The night burned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fire raged around Riley, swirling and twisting in the air like it was alive, responding to her every breath. The wind carried the scent of smoke, scorched earth, and something darker: the presence of something ancient, something wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure stood before her, their golden eyes gleaming in the flickering light. They had barely moved since stepping from the shadows as if they were waiting for her to understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Riley didn&#39;t care about understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cared about finishing this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because this war had started long before she had been reborn into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Long before she had ever known Caius.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Long before they had erased her name from history.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And tonight, it ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure exhaled slowly like they could hear her thoughts as they had already predicted her every move. &#34;You&#39;ve remembered something, haven&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley stiffened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because they were right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t know how. She didn&#39;t know why. But ever since she had set foot in the ruins, the past had been clawing its way back to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fragments of battles she had never fought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories of people she had never met.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or at least, people she wasn&#39;t supposed to remember.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were there,&#34; Riley said, her voice low, steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure inclined its head slightly. &#34;I was.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fire crackled. The wolves behind her remained silent, waiting for her to make the first move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran was tense, his body wound tight like a coiled spring, golden eyes flicking between her and the figure assessing, waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena, however, had never been one for patience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, am I the only one getting tired of this cryptic bullshit?&#34; she muttered, adjusting her stance. &#34;They aren&#39;t here to talk. Let&#39;s just end this already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow, knowing smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As reckless as ever,&#34; they mused, eyes flicking toward Lena. &#34;Some things never change.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena&#39;s expression darkened. &#34;The hell does that mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley didn&#39;t answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because she knew exactly what it meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she knew what would come next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first strike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A war that was not meant to end</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure moved first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One second they were standing there, calm and composed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next, they were upon her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley barely had time to react before their hand collided with her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a punch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not an attack meant to wound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was something else entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment they touched her everything cracked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind fractured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not like before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not like the visions that had flickered in and out of her subconscious, teasing her with glimpses of the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, it shattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The world around her vanished in an instant the fire, the battle, the wolves, Kieran shouting her name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t in the forest anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was somewhere else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somewhere she had been before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The throne of fire</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The golden city was burning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flames licked the sky, devouring banners that bore her crest, swallowing the walls of a kingdom that had been built to last forever, and yet it was falling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not to war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not to a rival kingdom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To something worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thing they had all pretended wasn&#39;t real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have to leave!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice rang through the firestorm, desperate, raw, familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley turned but she already knew what she would see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caius stood before her, not as an enemy, not as the betrayer she had spent so long hating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the man, he had been before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the war had consumed them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he had made his choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood stained his armor, his golden eyes wild with desperation. &#34;They&#39;re coming, and they won&#39;t stop until you&#39;re erased. If you stay, you die here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was breathing too fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A trick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it felt real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could feel the heat of the flames licking at her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ache in her muscles from battle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of the blade strapped to her hip, a blade she had forgotten she had ever wielded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t just something she was seeing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was living it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not without you,&#34; she heard herself say, voice steadier than she felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caius&#39;s jaw clenched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t understand,&#34; he whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then make me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then the throne room doors burst open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air turned to ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the figures stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The same creatures that had come for her tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ones who didn&#39;t kill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ones who erased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caius moved instantly, positioning himself between her and them, his body tense, his breathing sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw it then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The choice in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The choice she hadn&#39;t understood before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reason he had betrayed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because he hadn&#39;t betrayed her at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had made a deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To stop them from taking her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To erase her before they could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And it hadn&#39;t worked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because she had died anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because nothing he had done had been enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization slammed into her like a falling star.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vision fractured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The War That Never Stopped</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley hit the ground hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lungs gasped for air, her body shaking as the firestorm in her head crashed back into the present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was still in the forest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still standing in the fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the figure was still in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because they knew what she had just seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had been there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And for the first time, Riley understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This war wasn&#39;t new.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t about Tobias.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t even about Caius.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had always been about them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ones who erased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ones who had been waiting in the shadows of history, rewriting the world until it fit their design.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Riley?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was the mistake they had been trying to correct for centuries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pushed herself to her feet, her breath steady despite the storm inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should have killed me the first time,&#34; she said, her voice cold, clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure exhaled softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart slammed against her ribs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And yet,&#34; they continued, tilting their head, studying her. &#34;Here you are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley curled her fingers into fists, fire curling between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You won&#39;t get another chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure&#39;s golden eyes darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then let&#39;s see if you can stop us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They lifted their hand</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the shadows came alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, they weren&#39;t just coming for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were coming for all of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Riley knew</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t just a fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the moment history broke apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she was going to be the one to rewrite it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No more running.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No more being hunted like a ghost in her own story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No more fighting a war she didn&#39;t understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because now she understood everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew who they were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew what they had done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she knew without a doubt that they feared her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was why they had erased her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was why they had buried her name in the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because she was never meant to rise again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet she had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shadows howled around them, twisting, writhing, hungry for destruction. The fire reflected in their shifting forms, golden eyes gleaming from within the darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley didn&#39;t move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood her ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because the past had taken everything from her before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because she had died before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this time she wasn&#39;t falling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran moved beside her, his golden eyes fierce, body coiled and ready. Waiting for her command.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena twirled a dagger between her fingers, a slow smirk tugging at the corner of her lips. &#34;So, what&#39;s the play, sweetheart?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the pack was watching her now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not Tobias.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not Caius.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because this wasn&#39;t just another battle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The one that had started long before any of them had been born into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The one they had been forced into without knowing why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Riley knew now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fire inside her roared, crawling up her arms, licking at her fingertips, pulsing beneath her skin like it had always belonged there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And maybe it had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe she had been born to burn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this time, she wasn&#39;t burning alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to her pack, her wolves, her army.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want the truth?&#34; she said, her voice steady, cutting through the crackling flames.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They listened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were always listening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This war isn&#39;t about power,&#34; she continued. &#34;It isn&#39;t about territory, or revenge, or some ancient grudge between Alphas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let the words settle, let them sink deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This war is about control. About rewriting history. About making sure none of us remember what we were before they took it from us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow murmur spread through the wolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some of them had suspected it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now she was confirming it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, she was giving them the truth they had never been allowed to have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her green eyes burned as she turned back to the figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You spent centuries trying to erase me,&#34; she said. &#34;But guess what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fire surged, an inferno roaring behind her as if the world itself had been waiting for this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You failed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure&#39;s smile faded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, they looked at her not like she was an inconvenience</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But like she was a real threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like she was the thing they had been trying to stop all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Riley grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, let&#39;s see if you can survive what comes next.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, she attacked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fire surged with her, roaring to life as if it had been waiting just like she had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley moved like a storm, her body coiling, twisting, striking with a precision she didn&#39;t fully understand but felt in her bones. This wasn&#39;t a new fight. It was an old one. One she had fought before. One she had lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure barely had time to react before her flames lashed out, striking with the force of an avalanche. But they didn&#39;t flinch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, they lifted a hand and caught the fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not like before, when they had merely resisted it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, they bent it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Controlled it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turned it against her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fire recoiled, twisting midair, shooting back toward Riley in a spiraling inferno of her own making.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She barely had time to throw up her hands, blocking the worst of the impact as heat exploded around her. The force of it sent her staggering back, her heart hammering, her vision swimming through the haze of smoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she didn&#39;t fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dug her heels into the ground, gritted her teeth, and pushed back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fire around her shifted, answering her call, bending not to them but to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t just a vessel for this power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was the fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And if they thought they could use it against her they were dead wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley forced it forward again, twisting the flames, sending them spiraling toward the creatures emerging from the shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the fire touched them they screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not human screams. Not animalistic howls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like the fire wasn&#39;t just burning them it was unmaking them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley exhaled sharply. That was it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was how she had to fight them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The past wouldn&#39;t save her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only becoming something new would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to her pack, to Kieran, to Lena, to the wolves still holding the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Burn them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pack didn&#39;t hesitate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Torches were thrown, and flames ignited. The forest lit up, the night itself turning to fire and smoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Riley ran straight into the heart of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure was waiting for her, their golden eyes unreadable, their stance steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, they looked serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not amused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not entertained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like they had finally realized what she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like they had finally realized what she could do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re stronger than before,&#34; they murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley smirked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sound surprised.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They tilted their head slightly. &#34;Not surprised.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their fingers flexed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Disappointed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, they moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Faster than anything she had ever seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One moment, they were standing before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley barely spun in time, claws up, fire streaking from her fingers as she struck</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But they caught her wrist midair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second they touched her, her mind fractured again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The golden city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The throne room was in flames.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caius shouting her name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A blade pierced her ribs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of her voice screaming</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ripped herself free, gasping, shaking, heart pounding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure hadn&#39;t moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had just let her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still fragmented,&#34; they mused. &#34;Still incomplete.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley clenched her jaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was done with their games.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She threw herself at them again, her fire blinding, her power surging, pushing harder, burning brighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They tried to counter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this time</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley was ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She caught them by the throat, her claws pressing against their skin, her fire burning hot enough to scorch the air itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their golden eyes flickered, not with fear, but with something close to recognition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Finally,&#34; they murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley snarled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Burn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then she let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Let go of everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hesitation. The fear. The fragments of who she had been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let the fire consume it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The flames exploded outward, swallowing them both whole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The past was burning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when the fire died</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only one of them would be left standing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fire roared, consuming everything in its path, turning the battlefield into an inferno of writhing shadows and blinding gold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The heat stung Riley&#39;s skin, but she didn&#39;t flinch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because this time, the fire was hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure struggled against her grip, their golden eyes flickering not with fear, but with something deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like, for the first time, they saw her for what she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she had always been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mistake they had tried to erase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The war they had tried to bury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Riley wasn&#39;t a mistake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t a ghost of the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was the one thing they had feared all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The one who would end them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fire surged higher, hotter, wrapping around the figure like chains of molten gold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their lips parted a breath, a final word, a plea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley didn&#39;t wait to hear it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let the fire take them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And as they burned, she whispered, &#34;You should&#39;ve killed me when you had the chance.&#34;</p>
