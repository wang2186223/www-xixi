                <p>I took a deep breath. I knew so many questions were running in Lexie&#39;s mind. The last time we talked I told her how much I hated Luca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I explain?&#34;I asked softly, trying to pacify her anger.</p>

                <p>I sat down beside her &#34;I think I like him?&#34; I said with a bent head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; She asked with surprise. I nodded my head. &#34;Oh, good lord!&#34; She groaned as she rubbed her forehead. &#34;Lia you can&#39;t be with him, he might be using you for all I know and he is bad &#39;&#39; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head disagreeing with her &#34;I don&#39;t think so and what makes you think he is bad&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because... Because&#39;&#39; she raised her eyebrow. &#34;Because it is Luca. He is like the symbol of evil for our pack. A man that made us lose our Luna is not even meant to be with you who is Dean Luna &#39;&#39; she explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. I knew she would be worried about me. That has been the reason I had kept it from her but with what we did before we came here, how he let go of control while kissing me. I knew that I was going to have him and keep him with me for as long as I could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever enmity he had with Dean ended when he killed his mother. It has nothing to do with me, besides he has saved me multiple times and has stood up for me, is that not how love works?&#34; I asked her. I mean that was what we both shared as our idea of love. Someone who loved us and put us before himself and Luca had proven himself countless times without number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! That is how manipulation works&#34; she exclaimed &#34;He would prove himself worthy make you trust him then go away like he always does&#34; she shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pressed my eyelids together for a while. She should just try to trust him. I mean he will never hurt me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long?&#34; She asked me to draw my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I asked with a raised eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long has this been going on?&#34; she asked me again, her voice deep with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know... I mean. I think since I got married not like we just jumped into bed but he became my friend and then we started seeing each other. Okay. I don&#39;t think I can call it an affair, um, we haven&#39;t had sex just kissing and smooching&#34; I explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a long time lia. I don&#39;t want anything bad to happen to you&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is our Alpha taking it? I mean surely he must have noticed you guys&#39; closeness. Is he okay with sharing with you?&#34; She asked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded &#34;Yeah, he does not care about me only about himself and you know we are not mates&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even though he seems like a nice man he must have cared about you,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. It seemed as if the pack did not know the type of wolf they had as an Alpha. I stood up and zipped down my dress to show the marks I sustained from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gasped at the mark, and she ran her hand over my back. &#34;Who did this to you?&#34; She asked in a soft voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned towards her &#34;Your Alpha&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my gosh, this can&#39;t be true and why would he do such a thing?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because he found out about my mate and it was my mate&#39;s friend that killed his father,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She widened her eyes with shock as she covered her mouth. She stared at me, &#34;Who is your mate?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed hard ready to spill the truth &#34;It is Finn, Finn from the bloodlust pack. The one that killed Dean&#39;s father&#34; I explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously? What sought of fate do you have? Why would the moon goddess put you in such a tight condition?&#34; she asked with concern, laced in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged as turned my back to zip my clothes &#34;Maybe the moon goddess wants me to end Dean&#39;s life&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? End the Alpha&#39;s life? Don&#39;t let someone hear about this, not even your so-called Luca&#34; she warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and turned to her &#34;While Dean was tormenting me I passed out, I think I died and the moon goddess gave me the right to end Dean&#39;s life. If I don&#39;t do so our kind will suffer &#34;I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile curved on her lips and she burst into laughter &#34;Were you hallucinating? I mean how would you see the moon goddess and be alive, you only see her when you die!&#34; she shouted, hitting my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared at her with a serious face &#34;Wait, you weren&#39;t joking?&#39;&#39; she asked. I shook my head in return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes widened with disbelief &#34;Wait you mean all this while when I have been here, you died and came back?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See it like a second chance&#34; I replied to her and sat down. I wish I would just have one day where I would not do anything and I would not have to worry about Merlin or Dean or Luca or Finn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what did your mate say?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He wants to take me next week, I have not made up my decision although Luca had made it clear that he would rather die than have my mate take me away from him he does not know of the one-week ultimatum though&#34; I added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded &#34;I feel you should tell him. It would be a good thing and just follow your heart, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded &#34;Okay&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca horned from outside indicating that he was back. &#34;I have to go,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come back before you go. It had been a long time since we spent time together and I kind of miss my friend, &#39;&#39; she said with a low voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My smile widened &#34;Aww, don&#39;t worry I will come back&#34; I said and hugged her before leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I stepped out of the house I made up my mind to tell Luca about Finn.</p>
